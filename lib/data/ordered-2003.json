[{"name":"Kyocera Finecam S5R","amazon_reviews":["The Kyocera S5R is quite the complete camera.  Like one of the other reviews said, it rises above the rest when taking action pictures (for examples, kids in a soccer game).  It comes with good software, cables.  Very easy to connect to TV and computer.  Controls are easy (worst case, a quick read through the reference card should get any one set.)  Its only down side is from what I was told from an SME, is the night pictures.  So again, I was very happy with my purchase.  My pictures from my vacation look really nice.  Good luck.","I had a 5 megapixel sony that had an optical finder and gave it to my brother when he was visiting because his broke.<br />I read about the s5r but did not see many owners or reviews or samples.<br />I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised!  I now always have a camera in my pocket.<br />The camera is fast! and unlimited 5 megapixel pics is more than my 717 can do.<br />But to keep the camera tiny, the manufacturer decided not to put a fan in the computer bay.  (Which explains the heat produced)<br />This is a little performer that just wants to burn itself up for you.<br />I am pleasantly surprised at the quality see pbase.com/stefffanovich","I bought Kyocera S5R mainly because of its capability to record VDO at 640x480 pixel at 30 frames per second until memory filled up. The fast still image capturing at 3 frames per second is an added bonus. Kyocera suggests that high speed SD card should be used , the one with transfer rate about 10 MB/s. I used the Panasonic 256 MB SD card which has just that speed but had never been able to do non-stop shooting until the memory filled.  The camera stopped about 1 minute or so , obviously just could not handle large amount of VDO data all at once.  When it stopped shooting the red light was blinking several more seconds to show that the data were being processed. Then you have to start shooting again if you want more VDO. In short , it could not do continuous shooting till memory full as advertised.<br />In general the still images taken by this camera were of  really good quality , except in some instances with flash. I wish Kyocera could add the function to adjust the flash , i.e. , low-medium-strong , instead of just one fixed mode which seems to be too strong , many of my shots were overexposed.<br />The battery life is at best an average or on the lower than average side.<br />The LCD monitor should have more pixels.","The Kyocera S5R is quite the complete camera.

The camera still works and I have taken several thousand photos. It's \"credit card\" size and about 3/8 inch thick.  Very tiny. There's a digital zoom but no optical zoom. (That's why it's so small!) I have a vacation photo hanging on my wall that is 11 x 14. So even at 2 megapixels it takes good photos.","When i bought this camera, i was really mostly interested in finding a cool, little camera that would be sure to impress others with it's sleekness and not so much worried about it's features.  After using it a little tho, i was pleasantly surprised to find that it's a great camera with no bad qualities as far i can tell so far.  THe battery life it excellent, the LCD screen is as good as i could have hoped for and the quality of the pictures is far beyond any expectation of any need i could ever have for this camera.  The ease of use is phemonminal also.  Within an hour i had figured out how to use the features and had hte pictures on the computer.  Speaking of taht, the included software was also easy to use and very complete.  This said, if you're looking for a great, little digital camera that won't break the bank, you've found it.","Better than the EX-S2, the S20 adds a lens cover - really needed for a 'pocket' camera.  Can take it anywhere without looking like a tourist.  Flash is very bright.  Pictures at max res 1600 x 1200 fine mode are pretty good, certainly good enough for a website or 3x5 prints.  And since you are limited by the fixed lens anyways, 3 or 4 MP seems like a waste for the money.  Added a 256 MB card and it holds 214 pix at max res.  Only holds 6 pix without so definately get a card.","I'm writing this review about 5 years after purchasing the camera. The camera still works and I have taken several thousand photos.

I love it for its simplicity and it takes excellent pics! Though no tele-photo or the extras one purchase with other cameras. But if one know how to use software, that is not an issue.","I have had this little camera for about 6 years. Bought it in Puerto Rico at the Post Exchange on impulse. A friend had one and I liked it and when I saw one I grabbed it. Absolutely the best, simplest, most durable camera ever. I have dropped it off cliffs, out of a moving car, had it in mud and under water (much farther than it says it should go) and it has always functioned flawlessly. The shape is something folks have to get used to but I like it.<br /><br />It takes great family and vacation pics and has been put to the test. I use it often in the garage to take photos of my hobby cars. But like all things, when some company discovers they made something fantastic, they discontinue it. I have been searching online to try to find another one of these since mine is beginning to wear out. The switch is going bad, and it is covered in greasy finger prints and now showing considerable wear. I am worried it will die and I will have to get something that is just adequate.<br /><br />Great job with this one Sony, a fantastic, rugged camera I have really enjoyed. Shame on you for discontinuing it. :(","I love this camera.  Great for one hand use if necessary.  Rugged plastic construction.  Unfortunately, they never replaced it with an upgraded model with higher resolution camera.  Sony memory card is expensive in comparison to other memory card formats, which is my only complaint.","I have had the camera since 2004 and it still works.  I use it like most people for outdoor activities. I don't do anything special to prevent it from getting wet. However, on  my last kayak trip I noticed condensation behind the LCD.  Based on what I have read in the other reviews the end may be near.<br /><br />Its a great design, the one handed shape.  It tucks into a life vest or a ski pocket.  I never put it in a case, its always at hand. It was inexpensive and the pictures can be great.  Its best features in order are, water proof, small size, and easy to deploy.  That puts the camera in play in more situations than a SLR or even most point and shoots.  That makes for some good pictures.<br /><br />The video is a joke and there is no sound.  The lack of a zoom is fine.  Most zooms are pretty anemic. The resolution when you blow it up is lame by today's standards. It eats batteries so carry a bunch of rechargeables and a charger or use lithium disposables (but recycle them!!!)<br /><br />I believe they don't make the camera anymore, but I really would like Sony to update the thing pretty much as is but with a sharper lense (skip the zoom though), more resolution, better water proofing, and better quality of construction. If they could produce it for less than $150 bucks I bet they could sell a bunch of them.","I purchased this camera as a cheaper option to any other camera with a $400 marine housing as I dont intend on diving 40 metres the u60 is perfect for my surfing pics and a bit of reef photography. I bought this 7 months ago for $380 and its the best money I've ever spent taking fishing and surfing and everywhere wet the images are crystal clear and I dont see any differnce in image quality between this and my 5 megapixel camera.","Although the DSC-U60 has almost none of the features one has come to expect on a digital camera, it does what it does flawlessly. What it does is snap simple, hi-resolution photos in any environment without fail.<br /><br />It has no zoom lens. What you see in the viewfiner is what you get, period. You point, you shoot, that's it.<br /><br />It is (or at least mine is) really, truly waterproof. This is an absolutely essential feature for me, and is the raison d'etre of the DSC-U60. If you don't need a waterproof camera, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you kayak, canoe, fish, or camp, it's really cool to have a camera you don't have to worry about getting wet. I've killed a number of cameras on river trips, and probably lost some great photos as a result. This puppy has been in rivers, lakes, and hot tubs, and hasn't skipped a beat.<br /><br />The lens is great, the electronics are great, and the resolution is superb. Although 5 or 6 MP is becoming standard these days, the DSC-U60 takes extremely sharp, clear photos, good for printing or viewing on-screen.<br /><br />If you need anything more or less than a waterproof point-and-shoot, you will be disappointed. This would be a really poor choice for a general-purpose camera. There are better, sharper, and easier-to-use cameras out there with way more features for much less money.<br /><br />On the other hand, if (like me) you really need an indestructable camera for simple, high-quality snapshots, you couldn't ask for more.","I really like the Sony DSCU60 digital camera, it's special to take it to the beach and take pictures under the water. With 2.0 megapixel it's not for pros but the quality its great for point and click cameras.

If they could produce it for less than $150 bucks I bet they could sell a bunch of them.","I purchased this camera as a cheaper option to any other camera with a $400 marine housing as I dont intend on diving 40 metres the u60 is perfect for my surfing pics and a bit of reef photography. I bought this 7 months ago for $380 and its the best money I've ever spent taking fishing and surfing and everywhere wet the images are crystal clear and I dont see any differnce in image quality between this and my 5 megapixel camera.","Although the DSC-U60 has almost none of the features one has come to expect on a digital camera, it does what it does flawlessly. What it does is snap simple, hi-resolution photos in any environment without fail.<br /><br />It has no zoom lens. What you see in the viewfiner is what you get, period. You point, you shoot, that's it.<br /><br />It is (or at least mine is) really, truly waterproof. This is an absolutely essential feature for me, and is the raison d'etre of the DSC-U60. If you don't need a waterproof camera, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you kayak, canoe, fish, or camp, it's really cool to have a camera you don't have to worry about getting wet. I've killed a number of cameras on river trips, and probably lost some great photos as a result. This puppy has been in rivers, lakes, and hot tubs, and hasn't skipped a beat.<br /><br />The lens is great, the electronics are great, and the resolution is superb. Although 5 or 6 MP is becoming standard these days, the DSC-U60 takes extremely sharp, clear photos, good for printing or viewing on-screen.<br /><br />If you need anything more or less than a waterproof point-and-shoot, you will be disappointed. This would be a really poor choice for a general-purpose camera. There are better, sharper, and easier-to-use cameras out there with way more features for much less money.<br /><br />On the other hand, if (like me) you really need an indestructable camera for simple, high-quality snapshots, you couldn't ask for more.","I really like the Sony DSCU60 digital camera, it's special to take it to the beach and take pictures under the water. With 2.0 megapixel it's not for pros but the quality its great for point and click cameras. The only con: no audio with video recording but for 150$ I think its ok","For 2mp cam with no zoom, this little thing takes some nice shots.  I have used it in a party setting, in a heavy shorebreak and out on reef break a short paddle out from the shore.  Has not let me down yet.  This is not suitable for a main digicam, and I don't really see myself getting prints from it but for web, email and general electronic use it's great.<br /><br />Some issues with battery life however, be prepared to get a backup set or two of the rechargable sony bateries. Also as others have mentioned the \"burst\" mode resolution is tiny and the video mode is really only usable as a last resort, and I mean aliens landing/second coming type last resort.  Don't buy it for those modes but still consider it, at $150 it's a bargain.","I really like this camera. It takes great pictures. It easy to use when out kayaking. It has fallen in the water and been entirely submerged with no problems. It's sporty looking and very easy to use. I highly recommend it.","as a long time film user, this was my first digital cam. I'm fairly active, and since purchased in Aug 03, have taken it sea and whitewater kayaking, into the break, sailing, sledding, skiing, etc. While the resolution wasn't up to what I was used to with even fast film, I took pictures where I just wouldn't have been able to before. I took care of the o ring, and have experienced none of the problems reported by other reports here.<br />All was good w/ it until it just died last month. I'm probably going to check out some other alternatives, and am not even going to bother calling sony or the place where I bought it.<br />Even with that said, the camera's just about paid for itself in the past year.","The U-60 is a gem. I bought it for water sports and to have a small rugged carry-anywhere digicam (I also have an Olympus C-700 for more technical and telephoto shots). I keep it in my pocket and often get those \"I wish I had a camera right now\" spontaneous shots that I used to miss. It's fast to start, easy to understand, very user friendly, small to carry, and gets decent resolution pics. It goes surfing every time I do. Especially fun and useful is the \"burst mode\" that takes five shots in a row. It addresses that frustration of \"shutter lag\" and \"shutter timing\" that can happen with digital action shots. More info:<br />PROS:<br />Small, cheap, rugged, easy to use, good software, good battery life, decent resolution, well waterproofed, cheap batteries, burst mode, battery-saving lowlight LCD mode, card reader unnecessary.<br />Cons: No viewfinder, tiny LCD, no opt. zoom, burst pics are only 600x400. (although I adjusted to all these shortcomings and didn't miss them!)<br />For it's intended use, it excels."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix A210 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["For an older, used product, this camera worked great!

He paid for it with his allowance so his $30 or so went a long way.  It zooms, takes video, and you can download to a computer or flat screen tv, etc.  My son is happy, my own $200 camera is safe in its case.  He can do whatever he wants with it and I know it's not an expensive iPad/iPod Touch that can be easily dropped and cracked or broken or lost - giving parents too much stress.<br /><br />We are happy with our purchase.","For today it is a very old camera and only good as a gift for kids. I have it for 4 years and it is still working. The only problem we have is some kind of abrasion on the lense which gives a glare on the images so we are not using it any more. It has a macro option and video capability without sound. Picture quality is good for outdoors. The flash is not powerful so not recommended for indoors. I was amazed to see that they still have some on sale.","Camera was exactly as described. It arrived quickly and was very well packaged.

I have found that 256MB is plenty.<br /><br />It does take a while to store pictures and calculate focus and exposure, so I have lost oportunities for good shots because of this, but I have still captured crisp, colorful images.<br /><br />I recommend you always carry spare batteries, but at least AA batteries are cheap and can be found anywhere.<br /><br />My A210 has survived trips from the boundary waters (MN) to the summit of Mt. Fuji (Japan).<br /><br />All that said, today (March 2007) you can find many better cameras for about $100. I just placed an order for a Fujifilm V10 for $125. It promises to provide better performance in a pocket size package.<br /><br />If you don't mind carrying a bigger camera, my choice would be a Canon Rebel XP. This camera has fine optics and Canon's Digic II chip allows rapid fire shooting. For the street price of $575 this is a good value.","I recieved this camera as a gift about 2 years ago when i just started getting into photography. It's a very easy to use \"snapshot camera\" because theres not a whole lot of settings to change yet you still can get quality pictures. With the right lighting and atmosphere you can even create photos that look like they were done by professionals. Time and time again people have been amazed that my photos were taken with such a simple camera. I will try to submit some of my photos on amazon.<br /><br />I also have dropped this camera at least 5 or 6 times and it still continued to work. One time i dropped it and the lens would not retract but this was only because the lens became unaligned. After popping it straight it worked perfectly. Only when the wind took it and caused it to hit some blacktop did i finally have to have the LCD screen replaced because it cracked.<br /><br />The video quality is at a small resolution but i had no issues with that, only disappointed because there was no sound on it. I did have some issues with the exposure time because you cannot control it. You can only get long exposure on night shots and even then its only about 3 seconds of exposure. Would have been nice to have more control over that but as i said not expected with a snapshot type camera.<br /><br />Overall i was really impressed with Fujifilm and would recommend a camera like this for those who take a lot of snapshots. As for those getting into photography, its a nice starter camera but it needs an upgrade to open up how creative you can get with it. I just bought a canon S3 IS so we will see how that works out.","This was my first digital camera and it served me very well for about two years. At the time I bought it, it was a tremendous deal - 3x optical zoom, 3MP for less than $130 - with macro and movie capability.<br /><br />About two months ago, it began eating batteries, even when turned off. I notice a number of other people have also had this problem. Now, I can put brand new batteries in it, take 3 or 4 shots, turn it off, and the next day the batteries are dead. When it was new, I could take 10-20 photos, leave the camera for weeks (sometimes months) and then take many more.<br /><br />On a week-long vacation where I took close to 100 pictures, I used only one set of batteries. Now, a set of batteries usually won't get me through 24 hours, even if I take less than 5 pictures with no flash.<br /><br />I read about another battery defect in a different Fuji model that was helped by taking out and re-inserting the batteries before putting the camera away but haven't had a chance to try it yet.<br /><br />Bob","I'm 15 years old and I got this camera a little over a year ago. This was my first digital camera that I had and it's very easy to understand. Now I'm ready for a new camera because the size of the camera is inconvienient and the pause in between pictures/start-up time is very slow. I like to use my camera to be able to capture a moment right away and by the time my camera turns on and is ready to take a picture, it's too late. The quality of the pictures are good except randomly a few pictures will be blurry(even if i wasnt moving the camera around). The flash doesn't reach very far but if the objects close then it works well. If you do get this camera I would recommend buying a battery charger and rechargable batteries. The batteries are more expensive but last a lot longer than normal batteries. The nice thing about having a camera that took AAb batteries was if my batteries would die it was easy to find AA's instead of having to carry around a charger.<br /><br />Overall I would say this is a good product, but not good for long term.","I was given the Fujifilm 2400 as a baby shower gift in 2001. I knew that my beloved Nikon FM was just too slow to keep up with all the baby pictures I wanted to take. The colors & definition was awesome. But the MP's weren't there for great enlargements. So when my husband suggested I upgrade & he use my 2400 I went for it. I liked the Fujifilm enough to go with another one. I got the A210 and was disappointed. The colors & definition just aren't there. I've had it over a year & have yet to have a photo that I want to enlarge more than a 5x7. I find myself using the older 2400 when it's nearby. I do still carry the A210 in my purse all the time & use it very often. But I keep window-shopping for an upgrade. Another Fujifilm?? I'm not sure. I'll keep reading the reviews.","I initially bought an EXTREMELY cheap digital from Wal-Mart for $20 (i know, it was stupid), so I saw this at Best Buy for $125, which seemed like a very good deal for a camera with 3.2 Megapixels.<br /><br />Well, i still kind of stand by that, its hard to beat that price for so many MP's, but that doesnt really mean you should buy it.<br /><br />this camera does not come with a charger or rechargeable batteries. I knew this when i bought it, but didn't think it would be to bad....wrong, it takes 2AA at a time, and with normal use (an hour or so every couple of days) it goes through about 4 or 6 a WEEK! if you like taking photos all the time, but can't afford a pro camera, dont buy this, the flash is decent (although it takes a while between taking pictues) but when it is off, it is TERRIBLE in even the slightest darkness.<br /><br />I recently upgraded to an Olympus Stylus 410 4.0 Megapixels, and am SOOOO much happier with it, it comes with a charger!!!<br /><br />the \"cradle\"....don't start thinking that this is any sort of dock or something, its more of a \"stand\" really, it's a cheap plastic square to set the camera in/on, and doesnt really serve any use.<br /><br />if you need a cheap camera, decent pictures, and rarely take pictures, get this, for everyone else, dont bother.0","This camera takes great pictures for a cheaper digital camera. I sell items on ebay and my pictures come out great. Check out my pictures on ebay. My user name is monte.ss  My last camera was an Olympus and it left white spots on a lot of my pictures. This one does not and takes very good pictures even close up. It is also very easy to use and understand. The video movies are good but I wish they had sound with them. The battery life is very good and this camera only takes two standard size AA batteries compared two the four my Olympus took. The camera seems very durable as well and I do not get concerned when my family (younger kids) uses it for fear of them damaging it. I am very happy with this camera.","This is pretty good ya know it is really it is","This thing is a steal!!!!  Easy to use, great pictures, great software, small and light.  The only problem that I have with this camera is that i had to buy a rechargable batteries.  Also be sure to pick up the cradle.","This is my first digital camera. Friends of mine who know about digital cameras said I should find one with at least 3 MP and 3X Optical zoom (cameras that only have digital zoom lose quality when they zoom in). This was the best deal I could find with those features. The camera is easy to use even though I've never really messed with digital cameras before.","This is a very user-friendly camera.  It's fairly light and nice looking.<br /><br />It has quite a lot of different functions that should satisfy all beginners.<br /><br />The picture quality seems good, clear, and sharp, and the software is easy to operate.<br /><br />For macintosh users like me, there is no software needed actually.","This is one great camera. My sister who is a professional photograher oftens borrows my Fugifilm because of the ease of use, great quality of pictures and it is compact. I am really impressed that I can finally take a decent picture and now have many of them as my wall paper on my computer.","I am so pleased with this camera, and I love the program. The only thing I wish it had voice when you are recording movies. The program is easy and I know where my pictures are. I had Kodak easy share, and I spend hours locating my pictures. I am still learning how to operate it, but I am happy with it, so I had to let you know.","This is one awesome camera.. (I now have 2) I don't scan documents I use the camera and its macro setting. (also with a stand so there is no movement. Some people might say it is FAT;<br /> I say it is HUSKEY and with the great pics it takes, who cares that you can't drop it in a shirt pocket.. When in Review mode, it is great to be able to magnify so you can check expressions<br />and make sure all eyes are open. Fuji did it again( I also have the 602 and for ease of use I take one of my A210 and leave the<br />602 at home  unless I have some real serious work to do...","I have 2 of these and talked a friend into getting one. Gave her about 20 minutes of instruction. MB then went on safari to Africa and came back with about 170 pictures. She had some photos of Victoria Falls that I would have been proud to have taken. Planning to give a class to a Senior Group and guess what--<br />This will be the camera that I will demonstrate. With what you save on the camera, you can invest in more memory","I bought this camera while on a budget and in need of a quick camera. I bought it for one trip and it worked so well I now use it every chance I get. I have gotten quality 5x7's and for transmiting over the internet there is no loss in resolution, I was completely surprised. I was seriously considering an HP model at the same time, that's when size became a factor, it is convenient to carry and was easily put in my pocket when visiting an Amusement park. The only downfall is the size of the XD cards, I misplaced my spare the first week, fortunately It was at home and in my compter area so after shifting some CD rom it was found. I would definately by another or similar Camera in the future.","Same as most reviewers on this camera, my first one and I love it! I've had it close to two weeks now and am finding myself addicted to taking pictures just because I know I don't have to worry about buying another roll of film. I haven't upgraded from the 16mb card, but that hasn't been a problem since I download my pictures onto my computer everyday. I already had rechargeable batteries and they come in use now more than ever (I used them pretty much just for my cd player). Like another poster stated, the alkaline batteries it came with died soon after playing around with the camera trying to figure things out - approximately 19 pictures at 3.2mp, not to mention checking out the menu on the LCD screen. Defintely happy with the purchase.","Great deal for the money. Other user's are right about buying a charger with rechargeable batteries, and a larger memory card. It comes with 2 alkaline batteries, they won't last long, especially if you play around with it like I did. I just got mine a few days ago. I noticed leaving the display off helps to save on batteries a little though. I love mine, I would recomend buying the power adapter for the camera too for when you download the pictures onto you're computer, I think that's also where the camera uses a extra battery power too. I just ordered a 128MB picture card and a charger with 4 batteries for mine.","I love this camera.  After being a great fan of 35mm, I changed my mind.  I just sent some pictures to be made from the JPEGs and they came back beautifully.  You could not even tell they are digital!  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of five stars is because the only criticism I have is the flash.  The flash does not carry very well in low light situations.","Great camera all around. Have had it for 1 week and sofar have taken over 1,000 pictures. The photo print's turn out better then regular cameras (35mm/throw away) and the best part is, you dont have to worry about pictures you dont want, like of your thumb.....","Good and fine prints and fantastic picture quality for a starter.","this camera takes excellent outdoor pictures.  indoors it seems to have a problem adjusting the light correctly...on close up shots indoors(e.g., taking pictures of stuff to sell on ebay) the flash overpowers the picture.  but, overall, for the money i think it's a good deal.","Yeah, if you're a professional photographer, this is not the way to go. However, if you want to take beautiful, vivid, detailed pics, this camera is for you. I sell bearded dragons and chameleons on the internet, and needed something that would show the colors, markings, and detail needed to make that side business successful. I was using the Oregon Scientific camera that is the size of three credit cards stacked on top of one another, and i could not get a close up shot to catch the detail I needed (however that camera is perfect for my OTHER side job, being a spy!LOL) Anyway, don't listen to others when they say it is not user friendly, they are just seriously mentally challenged. IT IS VERY USER FRIENDLY! One drawback is indeed the battery life. DO NOT use regular AA batteries. Use the NiMH rechargeables, spend a little extra for the cradle that is like $15, and you will never need to worry about the battery life. They recharge completely from being fully dead in an hour. Great little camera.","I have had my camera for about a month now and am very happy with it.  I had been using an older Sony Mavica and had issues with it.  So far this has been well worth the price I paid.  I was very happy with all the photos the card held verses a floppy disk.","I have had this camera since October 2003 and I'm very satisfied with it.  It's my first digital camera and got it for a great price (considering its features).  It is compact and it doesn't consume a lot of power. The image quality is good.  I'm no professional photographer, so I mostly e-mail my pics or take the card to somplace and have the pics printed.<br />There's no escape: you have to read the manual & get to know the camera .  The controls are handy and you can say that it is a point-and-shoot product.<br />Outdoor pictures with plenty of light are excellent. Can't say the same about night shots. They tend to come out dark and blurry (at least with the auto mode on).<br />Bottomline: This camera is a great choice for non-professionals and starters.","I recently got this camera from amazon and with just 130$ for 3.2Megapixel it was a steal rather than a deal(also read 3.2 optical zoom along with 3x digital zoom)<br />when i was buying it i was tentative for the price it was been offered but i must admit i was wrong and all of my friends have liked it and one even thinking to sell his other digital camera and get this one.<br />this is the simplest camera to operate and is highly recommended for those who just want to use it for family purpose<br />Great job done by Fujifilm and thanks amazon.","At the current sale price of $129, this camera costs about the same as an equivalent film point and shoot camera. If you are looking for a digital camera for everyday snapshots, this is the BEST DEAL available. If you are looking for a digital camera with professional quality pictures,this is not for you.<br />This camera takes two AA batteries and is good for around 20 pictures.  If you don't have one, get a battery charger with four rechargeable batteries.","The price is the best part about this camera. I played with it for about two weeks and did not have a good deal of luck. Pictures outside in bright light were good. But any pictures indoors with light and flash were not as good as my other digital camera.  Lot of blurry pictures. Flash would completely blackout the rest of the picture. LCD display not very crisp to check for blurriness of snapped pictures. Easy to use, just very slow in saving pictures, erasing pictures and shutter speed. I don't know how good a deal it is when the pictures don't come out well.","I've used a pretty wide range of digital cameras so I feel comfortable grading the Finepix 210 a solid 3, possibly a 3.5. I bypassed inexpensive 2MP cameras to make the jump to this, one of the least expensive 3MP ones around that had decent reviews.<br />After using it I can say that it is definitely lacking the sharpness of competitors like the Nikon Coolpix 3100. I only use it at the highest quality level and even closeups for portraits are obviously not razor sharp like I've become accustomed to with the 3MP Nikon and Sony products.<br />On the other hand this camera is at least $50-$70 less than the competitors and when accessories are factored in I was able to get the camera, a 128MB xd card and the handy USB cradle (with rechargeable battery) for $100 less than I could've with Nikon or Sony.<br />The bottom line: this is a decent camera that puts 3MP in reach of the average casual user but it is not very sharp.","THIS IS MY FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA PURCHASE BECAUSE I WAS WAITING FOR THEM TO COME DOWN IN PRICE.  I AM GLAD I DID AND HAPPY I CHOSE THIS FUJI.  EASY TO USE AND GREAT PICTURES! WHAT MORE CAN I SAY?","This camera takes great pictures for the price. It's also fairly easy to use.  A couple major drawbacks: 1.The length of time for the camera to reset for the next picture is extremely long (up to 10 seconds). 2.The camera goes through batteries very quickly.<br />I must emphasize the great picture quality produced by the A210. Compared to other brands in the same price range; you'll get better prints from the A210.","We got this camera and the extra card for our trip to Hawaii.<br /> Didn't know what to expect, pictures turned out great! We loved<br /> the movie mode too. The only exception that it does eat up alot<br /> of batteries. Next purchase we make is the rechargables.<br /><br /> Glad we got this, its a great purchase for the buck.","Wow, I have to say that I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this camera for only 140 bucks. I was thinking it must have something wrong with it! When it arrived and I opened it, I was proven wrong! I loved it immediately. I loved the sleek design, and the ease of use. Whats better is that you can choose if you want to take pics in 1mp 2 mp or 3, as to save room on the memory card I guess. I also like that once you take a pic you can edit it right with the camera , right after you take it. You can zoom in with the camera , then crop the picture as well. I figure that the price is one of the best things as well. It is 3mp and you would think it would be at least 200 bucks, but at 140 I think its an unbelivable deal.<br />Now I know nothing is perfect, this is so close, so now your looking for a con, the only one I see is the feel of it, the camera does have a little cheap feel to the plastic. But come on, I only paid 140 bucks. This is the perfect camera for the middle class family, besides who needs all the bells and whistles that one would never use!","I've just purchased the Fuji A210 for my daughter and found it to be a very good camera.  The photographs came out rich and in living color.  The camera is easy and user friendly. Not a bad camera for those of you just starting out into the digital photography world.  Are there better cameras?  Yes there are.  But at the price you pay for the A210 this is a decent camera at a fair price.","I have owned several digital cameras and bought this as a low-end bang around every day use camera.  Takes great pictures and is easy to use.  Battery use is not really that bad, although I do recommend getting rechargeables.  The case design is not all it could be....is a little blocky","as I have never owned a digital camera before.  But I must say I'm quite impressed.  I took several shots, thinking they were on the 3MP setting, and they looked great even when fully blown up on a 19 inch monitor.  It turned out that they were only on the 1 MP setting, and the 3 MP were of course even nicer!<br />It was definitely bulkier than the other models I browsed. But since I'm coming from a traditional 35 mm, it actually seems lighter and smaller than I'm used to.  And so far, battery life seems decent, although I don't have a great feel for that yet.","The Fujifilm FinePix A210 digital camera is a great buy.  You can't get a better camera for under $200.  I just got one for Christmas and I had it working in under a minute.  Very user friendly.  Easy to use and figure out.  Great looking pictures and movies.  You may want to buy a larger memory card though, if you plan on using the movies often.  Great all-around camera!!!","I love this camera!  It's good on batteries, focuses nicely (thank goodness for 3 mps and above!), is super easy to use, and came with a nice size memory card.  I would definately recommend this!","Very basic review: I have shot 35mm since 1978. This camera is my first experience in the world of digital photography. I've only had it a week or so, but I am *very* impressed with its versatility - allowing full auto mode or my choice in manual set up. Picture quality is so much better than expected. I'm enjoying very much working with my photos at home instead of picking them up \"developed\" at the local drugstore. Highly recommended.","I just bought this camera and I think it's a tremendous value for the price. It's compact enough to carry around and the pictures it takes are great. I read some of the reviews about the batteries but I didn't have that problem at all. I took at least 75 shots and still have the same batteries in it. A real great value.","This camera is great as a starter digital camera, especially for people who are usually afraid of photography.  The camera body is easy to hold and the buttons are laid out user-friendlily.  It's the usual snap-and-go type, and anyone who half a brain can use the basic functions after picking it up.  The memory cards have come down *a lot* in price so there's no reason to whine any more.  BTW, speaking of price, the A210 can be had for under one-fifty if you shop around.  For that price this is simply the best 3MP camera.<br />Image quality is excellent outdoors when light is aplenty.  Night shots do tend to be dark and noisy (noise refers to the coarse-grained color dots you see in a poorly exposed picture).  But after you read the manual you can do things to improve night shots.  Besides, no camera takes great picures when there's insufficient light.","Ive been on the search for a decent DigCamera, and this has reached my expectations in every level. I see some complaints about the LCD getting grainy. #1. Yes its not that great of an LCD, but what would you want a better LCD than picture quality? I think not, its all about the Picture Quality, this thing can hit up to a 2048xWhatever, And still its better than a 35MM picture, All In All I took pictures in pitch black from about 30 ft away, and my pictures turned out better than you think. Get this camera while you can. And yes ive taken over 200+ pics with the standard batteries, that came with the camera, and yes the LCD was on. No battery's dead yet.","I like this camera because:<br />a) Its batteries last for more than just a few pics (so far the first set has taken more than 15 pics).<br />b) It's comfortable to use (nice size and shape) and nice looking.<br />c) It takes great pics. Color is rich and image is realistic.<br />d) It connects easily via USB and the software is simple if a bit more than what i need.<br />e) You can connect it directly to your video viewer (TV, another cam, or VCR) with the included video cable.<br />I don't like that:<br />a) The power switch slides instead of clicking off and on (could leave it on by mistake since its position is always the same).<br />b) You have to switch it to another mode to view pics easily (you CAN see them in the main view, but it's a pain).<br />Excellent buy at $200!","A lot of camera for the price. Excellent feel and easy to use. Setup was easy. I was taking pictures and printing in less than 15 minutes. Entry level price with more than entry level features.","I have had for three weeks since my Fuji 2650 was dropped in my local lake....The moral is to make sure you keep the camera on a neck starp when not in use.  This new model has better battery life and quicker start up than my Fuji 2650.  The shutter lag is not as long and the color balace on indoor flash shots has less red eye.  A definate lot of camera for the money. I did get the optional docking cradle that comes with rechareable batteries and also make loading pictures into your PC a snap.","Fuji 2600 sold very good in 2001 because it was cheap & solid camera (with below average build quality). They removed some features and downgraded its screen & lens speed to make 2650 in 2002 even cheaper. Come 2003 they have added video-out/3MP and futher downgraded it, made it uglier and zero innovation.<br />Basically its gotten thicker (well above 2 inches), poor night capability, grainy LCD, cheapo plastic body, expensive xD cards and average build quality. The picture quality in daylight is very good though. Battery life and user interface are also good.<br />Meanwhile cameras from Canon, Sony, Nikon and other companies have improved a lot, added many features and have gotten cheaper. Right now Canon A60/A70 is much better option.<br />Ofcourse first time users (who never had a digital camera before) will give it 5 stars and will be very happy."]},{"name":"Olympus Stylus 400","amazon_reviews":["nice camera. the door switch broke.  bought a second one cause I like the pictures. it broke in same place.<br />do could not switch parts. two for two broke in same weak plastic switch","Very pleased with price, spped of shipping and the quality of this purchase.","One feature that this Model has that you rarely see on the lower priced cameras is it has a view finder which takes the guess work out when taking pic's in a dark environment.<br /><br />The Olympus quality is there and the pictures turn out great.<br /><br />If your OS is newer than XP I recommend using the Olympus View 3 software (downloadable on the Olympus site) rather than the older Olympus Master software.","Purchased this after I dropped my Stylus 310 and it stopped working.

It's compact size allows me to stick it in my pocket if I want to. It has been a rugged little camera. I do a lot of camping and hiking and have dropped it on rocks before and it keeps on taking great pictures. I originally bought it for the fact that you could buy an optional waterproof case. I wanted that feature so I could use it while participating in water sports, it worked great in those situations too. The outdoor picture quality is exceptional for a point and shoot camera. I use another camera for serious photography but this camera takes extremely good photos for someone looking for a simple to use camera. The XD memory cards were expensive at first but they have gone up in capacity and down in price.<br /><br />The battery life is very good between charges. I always have at least two batteries for my cameras. I've found that the battery will last through a three day weekend with a lot of picture taking without a need for the back up battery.<br /><br />One very cool feature that no one here has mentioned is that this camera came with a remote control. This is great for setting the camera up on a tripod and having the ability to get in the shot without having to set the timer and run in front of the camera to get in the picture. You can take as many pictures with the remote and never have to reset the camera. I don't know of another camera that has a remote like this.<br /><br />Drawbacks: The first drawback I noticed was it's small size and flat shape. I know I'm getting a little contrary here but the same small size that allows you to put it in you pocket also makes this a camera that is hard to grip with your hand. I have dropped mine several times and learned early on to always use the wrist strap that comes with it. It would be nice if this camera had a little shape to it that allowed you to grip it.<br />I've had some problems with the sliding on/off door that also acts as a lens guard. This can be annoying at times and you'll be getting ready to snap a shot and it will suddenly shut off because the door has slid just a little toward the off position. This can be avoided with a little pressure on the door while using the camera. I think some of the problems with the door has been due to my rough treatment of this otherwise durable camera.<br />A good buy for the money.","This is a great Camera! We bought this camera for a family wedding noy knowing if we would be happy since it was our first Digital.  It is so easy to use and the quality of the pictures is fantastic!  We haven't looked back and only regret not getting a digital sooner.  The battery life is fantastic!  We bought a second battery just in case but have had to use it only once when we were assigned to be photographers at my parent's 50th wedding anniversary.  We took pictures all night long and also took posed pictures of everyone with my parents.  The 256 MB XD Card will hold approximately 250+ high resolution photos!<br /><br />The Camera is durable, well made, and weather resistant.  Every opening has ruberized gaskets to keep water out!  The display is a good size, easy to view even outdoors, and the buttons are easy to access. It is easy to use, and you can learn how to use this camera in about 5 minutes just by fiddling with it!<br /><br />It has a great panoraramic mode!  The XD memory card is about the size of a stamp, and its small size helps conserve battery life. You can get an adapter for the card to make it compatable with other formats.<br /><br />My wife was interested in buying a cannon SLR but after using this she is no longer interested.  She uses it to take pictures of nature and Extreme Close-Ups of flowers, for example.  The Quality, Detail and Bright Colors are absolutely Awesome!<br /><br />You won't be disappointed!","I used this camera for about 20 months, taking thousands of photos. It was my first digital camera and I really enjoyed using it. It survived some falls as well as taking pictures in light rain.<br /><br />Some room for improvement:<br /><br />Indoor and shaded photos require the flash or a tripod.<br /><br />Macro mode couldn't focus on red items (flowers).<br /><br />Viewfinder was off center when using extreme digital zoom.","When I first bought this camera, I loved all the simple-to-follow features. It was lightweight, took clear pictures and was very simple to download. Everything someone looks for in a digital camera, right?. . . Wrong! After approx. 2 years of owning this camera, the sliding on/off \"door\" started to act up. When you open the \"door\"/turn it on and go to take a picture, it will retract and shut off on it's own. After a while it constantely did it to the point where taking pictures was a hastle. Now, I am seaching once again for a new digital camera and the $300 I paid for this camera (at the time) is wasted and thrown away. They should test cameras more thoroughly before putting them on the market for hard working buyers to select from.<br /><br />My next camera, being that the expensive memory cards only are compatibale to Olympus and Fuji, may be the Olympus Stylus 500 5MP. It seems to have gotten very good reviews and I'm willing to give them a second chance but I am doing a bit more studying this time before spending my hard earned money!","My Husband and I found this camera to be great. It is also great for transferring into computer. I have been able to make a photostory with the pictures and download it to a CD, for the purposes of entertaining our family. The pictures are great and it is easy to understand how to operate. I'm not too good in understanding electronic gadgets, but I certainly picked this one up pretty fast. Sometimes, my husband will ask me how to operate the camera. Now, that's a switch :). He usually is the expert in cameras. I bought it for him for Father's day, in 2004, and it's been a fantastic camera. People have asked us where did we get it from. I let them know, we ordered it through amazon.com.  I would recommmend this to all who are looking for a great digital camera.","I love this camera and have had it for a little over a year.  My only complaint is that pictures taken by looking through the view finder come out slightly off center (while the monitor is accurate).  I encountered this problem immediately after receiving the camera as a gift.  After returning it, I encountered the same problem with the new camera.  I wrote to Olympus and received no reply, which made the situation twice as aggravating.  I love my camera and consider this problem a minor flaw, however I have likely made my last Olympus purchase.","In our quest for the perfect digicam, we bought the Stylus 400 in February of 2004.  The camera had a lot going for it: small, lightweight, quick start up time, short shot-to-shot lag time.  The \"weatherproof\" feature was also big for us, we're tough on our stuff.  We liked the all-metal body for durability, too.<br /><br />After 10 months of using the camera, these features all lived up as advertised.  It survived being dropped and wet or sandy conditions very well.<br /><br />We purchased a spare battery and charger, and swapped them out every day so we always had a full charge on the camera.  We NEVER ran out of charge on a battery.<br /><br />The driverless USB connection allowed us to unload pictures FAST and very very easily.<br /><br />Having a camera that could survive the abuse we heaped on it was important, but when it comes right down to it, if the pictures are NO GOOD, then what's the point?  And on this the Stylus 400 REALLY disappointed us.  Pictures taken without the flash were blurry, (unless under bright bright outdoor light).  Pictures taken with the flash were blown out and the colors completely unnatural.  And the flash is no good at all beyond about 6 feet.<br /><br />Olympus is on the right track.  Maybe someday they'll combine their quality optics with this sexy, sturdy camera body and they will have the PERFECT camera.  But for what we paid (nearly $400 for camera, extra battery, charger, and 64M xD memory chip) it would have been nice to actually get decent pictures.<br /><br />I don't buy the \"if you want good pictures, spend more.\"  I've had cheaper digital cameras that took MUCH better pictures.  But they would break the first time I dropped them, then I'd have to duct tape the battery compartment closed or whatever.  Or the shot lag was intolerable.  Or they'd burn through AA batteries like candy.  Good image quality does NOT have to be expensive.  It is a darn shame that we can't get it all in one package.","Have used it for 1 1/2 years.  Bought it here on Amazon.  Have used it at parties, kid events, etc.  It's been banged around and used for thousands of shots.<br /><br />One thing really ruins it...The flash on this unit is abysmal. The slow lens prevents available light photography.  Don't expect to light up a family group shot with it.<br /><br />Otherwise, the camera has it all... The other reviews pretty much cover it.","I got this camera a couple of weeks ago and I have to say that it is a very good quality product. I had other digital cameras before and the main reasons I selected this one was to reuse my existing xD-Picture cards from my Fujifilm camera and the great form factor and overall style of this one.<br />One thing got in my way from the get-go: the battery compartment cover is positioned exactly where most people place their right thumbs when using the camera. This causes it to slide open way too frequently for my taste, sometimes causing the camera to shut down. Another problem I see is the tiny buttons that are intended to be pressed using your right thumb but prove to be too small for the thicker thumbs I have.<br />The flash also seems to be a little too weak for outdoor night shots and to focus on not-so-close objects indoors.","Look, I understand that the pictures won't bring you to tears of joy with their intense colors and riveting detail.  If you want that, spend more on a camera that will be much larger and feature laden.<br />However, if you want to throw your camera in your pocket and run out to a bar, the beach, or wherever (knowing full well that you might not even use it on said trip) it doesn't get a lot better than this.  It's stupid easy to use, it's light, to this point it's been indestructible, and about 95% of my pictures, even from dimly lit places have been high quality.  For some reason the quality suffers when you DON'T use the flash, but it really doesn't make much difference.<br />So it's really all about what you're looking for.  If you're in college or are a young person looking to document adventures, get this camera.  If you're taking family vacations, probably you could do better.  Either way, I love the thing.","I bought this camera to repalce a film camera. I am trying to wean my wife from film and on to digital and<br />I needed a camera that was as easy as the film cameras to operate. Basically just point and click. This is<br />what this was designed to do and it does it well. No complicated controls and no messy confusing<br />menus. I have been taking photographs for over 25 years, I have had one other digital camera in the past.<br />It was also a pHD. I did not need to go thru the manual to get this Olympus working. I have nothing to compare it<br />with but the start up from the off status is decent. Focusing and shutter lag is about what one would<br />expect. Like most things out there it is rather slow compared to a film SLR that I am used to. It gets worse underlow light since there is no focus assist. Prefocus helps reduce the lag<br />enormously. Photographs are excellent in terms of color.  Tend to have a little barrel distortion in the<br />wide angle.  Use in telephoto for head shots to correct the distortion. Flash is adequate. Size is perfect<br />since it is easy to carry around. Battery life is decent. I can take about 250+ high quality shots with<br />mixed use of the flash before I need to recharge. One warning, take care when closing the clamshell<br />since being abrupt with it can disrupt the lens mechanism. DO NOT MAKE THE CLAMSHELL HIT THE LENS WHEN CLOSING/SHUTTING OFF THE CAMERA. This is the best way to damage this camera. I did it once and knew right away that this was an achilles heel. When closing, there is a click that is encountered, hold the clamshell in that first click and allow the lens to retract before fully closing the clamshell. Otherwise, it works like a charm. I own a Macintosh and it synchs flawlessly with iphoto. All metal case seems indestructable and is very attractive. Haven't really dropped it in water yet but the weather seals are reassuring. Wish it had picture bridge so that it could work with the new p-10 dye-sub printer also from olympus or some other printer with this technology. Best of all, my wife is starting to use it a lot more. She just wants to have hard copies of certain photographs and I insist on a decent small dyesub printer to go with it.  A real smart pHD digital camera.","Looking for a great, compact, high quality digital camera?  Look no further, the Olympus 400 is tough to beat.<br />I'm no photography pro but if you are looking for a great camera to take pictures for the web or to use while on vacation, this is a great selection.  It's been to the slopes in Colorado, Utah & South America in (kept in a jacket pocket) snow, sleet & rain.  It's taken phenomenal pictures and produced beautiful printouts.<br />The 16 meg memory card it comes with is a joke; it just doesn't hold anything.  If you plan to buy this camera, plan on an extra $150.00 or so for a larger membery card or two.  I got a 512 mb card which holds nearly 600 photos that print at high quality as 8x10's.  It holds more than enough pictures for an extended vaction but with the 512 mb card it takes a while for the camera to ready itself to take a picture.  A 256 mb card is probably the ideal balance of storage space and speed.<br />The camera is easy to use, looks nice and is comparable to the 35mm stylus series from Olympus that was fantastic as far as 35mm cameras go for the casual photographer.<br />Bottm line, give this camera serious consideration when shoping for a digital camera and plan on picking up at least 1 256 or 512 meg memory chip if you buy it.","Just got mine last week. Took it to work and took some great shots of people in my work group. Used the florescent mode flash and the photos turned out very true to color and printed out beautifully. The download with the usb connection was a snap to use (a no brainer) and was so FAST! The camera is very simple to understand and use - had it all figured out in one evening. Very easy instructions and the icons are user friendly.<br />Nice compact and rich looking body. Perfect for travel and the new and casual digital camera user. Looking forward to playing with it more.","A word of caution to those considering a digital camera. Pay close attention to the size of the monitor. When it's really small, as in this Olympus camera, framing the shot is more difficult so you have to pay very close attention to what's in the shot.<br />The user's manual is the worst I've ever seen for ANY product. It leaves the user guessing how to utilize the camera's many features. Example: The page on downloading pictures to a computer was of absolutely no help. I spent an hour of trial and error to figure it out!","The Olympus Stylus 400 is a very good camera. It is one of the tiniest I have seen, and the body design feels sturdy. It is the ONLY camera that is all weather, and the menu system is fairly easy. The picture quality is just OK, and I would not recommend this camera for anyone who is a serious photographer. It is a very good point-and-shoot camera for a novice to intermediate photographer.","The Olympus Stylus 400 is a nice camera for outside, well lit shots. What is missing is the Olympus milestone 1.8 Super Bright lense. That lense is on the Olympus C-5050 that they are discontinuing, and replacing it with the C-5060. Unlike the 5050, the 5060 has a darker lense. The Stylus 400 has one of the darkest, with a 3.1 to 5 aperture range. That is why their is so many complaints about the inside shots.<br />  What the 1.8 super bright lense means is that it lets in more light, with a larger opening. More light means faster shutter speeds, which means non blurry shots. It is even more important for indoor shots with low light.<br />  I have an Olympus C-2040 which has the super bright 1.8 lense, and was Consumer Reports number one rated camera a couple of years back. It actually outperformed even the 5 megapixel cameras in printed picture results, and in the follow up review, it rivaled the 5's.<br />  When I am indoors, I purposely turn off the flash, and take pictures with just the normal existing light in the room. That way you get warm natural skin tones. With a darker lense, you are totally dependent on a flash, which eats up your battery life, and gives you washed out bright area shots.<br />  Right now with the C-5050 going for less money as a clearance to make way for the 5060, which is also 5 megapixels, but with the darker lense, makes me want to suggest the 5050 is the one to have.<br />  Myself personally, I am keeping my 2040 because of the great results I am getting. I can print out an 8 1/2\" x 11\" on photo glossy paper, and you can't tell it from a 35mm photograph.<br />  I like the entire Olympus line, but their caveat is that super bright lense. Normally you have to sacrifice some of that to get an increased zoom beyond the normal 3x. In the Stylus 400 you don't even get the additional zoom, while sporting the darkest lense. If you are outside, in sunlit conditions, that is fine. I don't know about you, but I take most of my pictures indoors. That is where the super bright lense shines.<br />  I'm sure the 400 is a great little camera, but I thought the aperture range should be brought to the forefront. A lot of years ago, I bought a 35mm Nikon with a 1.4 50mm lense. It was more money than the smaller ones, and they also had a 1.2 that was all glass in the front, and very expensive. The same rule applies here. Get the 1.8 instead of a 3 plus if you are doing some indoor shots. Nobody knows what is best for everybody, but I hope this helps.","This little camera has everything you need. I've been dealing with digital cameras since they started comming out with them for my work.For most of us, we only need a camera with a very simple operation and that it not so hard to navigate.This little camera does everything you need it to, unless you plan on producing profesional pictures.I have learned with these cameras over the years the simpler the better.This camera is very small and great for traveling.Takes a matter of a couple of hours to work this camera RIGHT.READ THE MANUAL and this camera will take good quality pics anywhere inside or out with  a little adjusting.","Excellant pictures. Ease of operation. Downloads quickly . Small and esay to carry without hanging around your neck or hand. The  housing is also water-proof.(can't use underwater) Great little camera, but I think Olympus could do better on the price. The 4.07 megapixels is great.","I PURCHASED THE 400 JUST PRIOR TO A CRUISE TO ALASKA, I TOOK ABOUT 80 PICTURES AND HAD THEM PRINTED ABOARD SHIP.AFTER LOOKING AT HALF I WANTED TO THROW THE CAMERA IN THE OCEAN.[THEY WERE THAT BAD] I THOUGHT I HAD MADE A REAL BAD PURCHASE. WHEN I ARRIVED HOME I SENT MEMORY CARD TO PHOTO-WORKS WHO I HAVE USED FOR YEARS.THE DIFFERENCE WAS NITE AND DAY,6 OF WHICH I HAVE BLOWN UP TO 8X10 AND THEY ARE JUST GREAT.IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A POINT AND SHOOT DIGITAL AND TIRED OF CARRYING THAT LARGE 35MM YOU WILL LOVE THIS CAMERA","I bought this camera based on the quality of Olympus.  I really love the size. I usually don't us the 4meg setting since it uses alot of the memory, but it is good for snapshots.  I personally think that a 35mm point and shoot gives better pics, but if the person blinks you don't know until 2wks later.  The Digital Camera give you an instant view.  The computer jpegs look better than my prints off the printer, but it maybe my printer.  The focus on the stylus is alittle slow, but good camera.  Update 1.5 years later it broke had to buy new camera since motor went out until then was working good and printing the pics at photo center came out great.  xd card kinda expensive, too","I purchased this camera new from Ebay for $350 with a 64MB card.  I have been very pleased with the camera.  It is exceptionally compact and takes very good pictures.  The camera is easy to operate for someone who isn't big on reading manuals.  If you have Windows XP, the camera requires no software to transfer pictures to your PC.  In fact, I have used the camera to act as a removable drive and used it to transport MS Word files between computers (I copied the files to the camera using Windows Explorer).  So far I have printed out photo quality pictures up to 8.5 x 11 inches using the second highest 4megapixel setting (about 1 mb per pic).  One criticism I have is regarding the included memory card.  16MB is really too small to do much with.  The highest resolution consumes about 2 megabytes per shot and the second highest takes 1 mb per shot.  You really need at least a 64MB card and preferably a 128 or 256MB card or you will be forced to use the lower resolution.  Overall, I have been very happy with the camera and it is small enough that we have it with us most the time.  And when our new 256MB Card arrives, I can take 250 pictures between downloads!","Good Point's:<br />1.)Weather resistance (note- it is not waterproof, but does have a nice rubber seal under the access port for it's I/O and card slot).<br />2.)Small Size - easily fits in front pants pocket<br />3.)Metal,relatively tough outer body - also more scratch \"resistant\" owing to anodized or matt texture to the metal surface making scratches less apparrent.<br />4.)integral, tough lens cap - you'll never loose it.<br />5.)XD memory cards - expensive but very fast, hence compensating somewhat for the minimal integral frame buffer to improve shooting speed.<br />6.)Rechargable Lithium battery - bucks up front (get a spare), saves big in the long term.<br />Bad Point's:<br />1.)Cost - cheaper cameras for the price - though none that are weather resistant.<br />2.)XD memory cards - Costly and \"yet another USB dongle\" to buy for your PC if you transfer your px by removing the card and plugging it into a card reader. At least Windows XP will recognize the camera (when connected by USB cable to PC) as a simple card reader without the installation of any additional drivers on WinXP<br />3.)Images - 4 megapixels are nice, but the lens is clearly a little \"soft\" compared to more serious cameras like the Olympus E20, Nikon 7000 etc. Abberation less apparent beyond short focus distance to my eye, consistant with others reports of better outdoor pictures. The Camera appears to try to add contrast and unsharp mask internally before saving the images.<br />4.)Lack of manual controls, plus the fact that everytime you turn it on it defaults to a relatively lower quality JPEG save mode, which wastes a few seconds while you change it to save in Best quality (Which I would recomend- get the 256MB XD card if you can)<br />Summary: If you like the outdoors (camping, boating, other water sports), then this really is the camera to buy while waiting for the Digital Nikonos (which will likely cost big bucks). Otherwise, look seriously at the new Cannon Elph for a small form factor.","We already have another digital camera, but it was very bulky.  So we went by the Best Buy to see what they had for our upcoming trip to Orlando.  We bought it two weeks ago and it is fantastic!<br />Takes great photographs, the battery charge lasts a long, long time, and it's so small without being wimpy...like I'm gonna break it.  But love, love, love!<br />My husband is a photographer with regular film, and he even thinks this takes fantastic photographs.  I like the versatility of the options that I didn't have with our other digital.<br />The xD card is very cool and small!  We also purchased a 256 card because the card that came with it is sort of puny and I like to take pictures and then delete what I don't like later so I like to have a lot of room.<br />We are quite pleased with this little camera.  It's about the size of a regular point and shoot 35mm.  Highly recommend!","If you're considering buying any digital camera, you should check this one out. Great for travel and outdoor activities.<br />Pros:<br />- Excellent quality pictures<br />- Rugged construction/classy design - great 'feel'.<br />- Reasonably waterproof - has endured being left out in the rain with no damage<br />- Very good battery life<br />Cons<br />- None at all","If you're considering buying any digital camera, you should check this one out.

I bought this camera right before a trip to Las Vegas and have no regrets. In fact I can't imagine my trip without it. I took over 120 pictures on High Quality resolution and still had 140 shots left with my 256 card. The Camera is so small that I went clubbing with it in my pocket and was still able to bust moves on the dance floor. The display screen is a good size and the buttons are easy to access.The features are easy to access and take about 5 minutes to learn. The different shooting modes come in handy depending on your shooting conditions. Panaramic mode is awesome! I took a great shot of the Las Vegas Strip using the panoramic mode and stitched it using the software included. You have to have an OLYMPUS BRAND MEMORY CARD to use panorama mode. Some people complain about the new Xd card, but there are so many good things about it. It is so small; about the size of a stamp. The size helps consume less battery life. I never had a problem with my battery running low; I just charged it whenever I went to bed. Also, you can get an adapter for the card to make it compatable with compact flash or smart media formats. The quality of the pictures look incredible and you can notice the most minor details when zooming in. In movie mode the movies are crisp and smooth. Length of the movies depend on the picture quality that is set. Some people complain that there is no sound in movie mode. If you want a DV camcorder that can record audio and video, then buy a DV camcorder. Otherwise movie mode is great when you want to capture those little memorable moments.  When you are ready to print the photos you can set options on your camera to decide the quantity of each photo you want printed. You can also decide whether or not you want the date or time printed on the pictures. The information is saved on your memory card. When you want your pictures printed out just take your card to the photo lab and the printer will automatically know how many pics you want and if you want the date printed. I just took my card to Costco and was set to go. This camera is a little costly but definitely worth the price. If you want a nice camera that will last for at least 5 years then get the stylus 400. If you want to save money then get a 2 megapixel camera that is bulky and will be obsolete in 2 months. Again awesome camera! Did I mention that it is all weather and can take water sprayed in any direction. You don't have to worry about taking this camera to the beach and getting messed up with sand and water. The Stylus 400 is Stylin'!","I have not bought yet, but this is my primary consideration for this little beauty!","I love that it's so compact and takes great pictures.

Cdn at ...)<br />- self-portrait mode, where you can point the camera at yourself (is this mode unique to Olympus?)<br />- lens barrier, which doubles as power switch (lower-end cameras like Kodak's often don't even have a lens cap)<br />- quality: 2 megapixels are adequate for 5x7's<br /><br />Tips<br />- by default, all the settings reset when you turn the camera off. Set it so that it doesn't do this (see manual for details)<br />- set the flash to be always off! On one shot it made my mom look like a ghost. Besides, with it off, pictures will appear as in their natural light.<br /><br />=====<br />Update 2004-11-29<br />My mom just got a Canon A-75, and I am sooo jealous! It just pampers you. And macro mode is a physical control - no wading through menus to get to it! Be good to yourself and buy a Canon A-75 (or the A400, which is almost as good and costs a hundred bucks less).<br /><br />=====<br />Update 2005-04-01<br />Figured out a way to avoid wading through menus to get to macro mode -- simply leave macro mode on all the time! It only kicks in when the camera is pointed at something close anyway. Problem solved!<br /><br />Like I said though, if I were to get another camera I would get one of the Canon ones I mentioned. The D-390 easily blurs if your hand shakes ever so much.","I recently got this as a gift and it is my first digital camera.  I am quite pleased with the pictures and features. You get what you pay for. To an extent there is slightly more noise than most camera's in its class but this can be easily corrected with noise reduction software. With a little patience and practice you should be able to get satisfactory results. My advice is turn off the flash and take pictures in ambient light as far as possible and hold camera extra steady. The pictures are good enough for upto 5 X 7 prints. Normal 6 X 4 prints are very good.<br />The reset function can be turned off. Please get in touch with me if any wish to see sample pictures. shinebob@hotmail.com.","I just bought this camera and find that it takes good pictures and downloads easily to a computer. As for the movie mode if you were looking for something that has sound or lasts longer you should have read the box it clearly states that the movie mode does not record sound and is only 15 secs. You cannot expect a camera that is under 200.00 to act like one that is priced over 300. You get what you pay for don't expect professional grade pictures from this camera if that is what you want dig a little deeper and shell out the extra cash for a better camera.","This camera is perhaps the easiest, most user friendly I have ever seen. I didnt even read the manual, and I have figured out how to navigate the menus, change picture resolutions, do video capture, work the zoom, and review photos. Transferring files to your computer and managing the flash disk is just as simple, as the USB mass storage lets you connect w/out drivers or software. Maybe one day they'll start making blue tooth ready cameras in digital SLR formats. Very easy to use. Great for internet based applications like ebay photos, propery viewing, and general photo taking. I love it. I bought mine for $50 from an online classified, and the camera came all the way from Antarctica. For those of you that complain that it resets to the default settings at power off and eats batteries, you're right. however, if you read the manual, or even search the on screen menus, it gives you the option to turn that off, and why in God's name would you not use a lithium battery?! Thats what all cameras should be using, and they last forever. Think people. Train smarter, not harder.","Hallo Colleagues,<br />Could you please help me with the CD-ROM product key to install  on my computer to print pintures. I bought Model D-390 camera and this numder was not found on the pack on the cd rom<br />I have tavell to a place in africa where I can not get the number from any ome as they are  no olympus dealers there.","I recently went on vacation and used this camera (my Mother's) since mine was in the shop.  I didn't have my rechargable batteries with me and boy did I pay - and pay and pay for new batteries over and over.  (Four day trip!)  Although the pictures turned out fairly good, the shutter speed was very disappointing to me.  There was a good 2 or 3 seconds after pressing the button before the picture actually took.  When you are trying to take a picture of someone snowboarding or skiing, in 2 - 3 seconds, that sucker is down the hill and you've got a nice picture of snow.  I came home with too many pictures of snow!","This was my first digital camera and for the two monthes or so, I really enjoyed it. It's really simple and easy to use. Taking pictures of people? Forget it. It washes out faces and makes you look like a ghost. It also eats batteries. A new set of batteries once lasted me 5 minutes... or about 8 pictures. That is PATHETIC. I would reccommend spending a little more money on a better camera. Or else buy lots of rechargables.","I started out with an HP 635, but after a month, decided it was to complicated for me. I found this camera to be very easy to work with- (read the instruction booklet!!). Takes great pictures-even flew over the ocean in a small plane and took great pictures, which I had developed without editing and they were great. Don't need the software, I find Kodak Easyshare the best to work with, and free to download on the Kodak sight.<br /> I highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants an easy to use, small, lightweight camera that is not looking for PRO pictures. Also, the battery life is great with rechargable batts.","You can use the USB port for Windows 98 or 98 SE to e-mail photos.<br /> Even if you are using AOL. Merely go to my album, right click on photos and place in My Documents or where ever you want your photos stored.STOCK UP ON BATTERIES! Or purchase a battery recharger.I know of several realtors that use this camera to photograph homes to list in the newspaper. This Olympus D-390 Digital Camera is a good starter camera.","I just figured out a cure for what everybody is blabbing about!  Everybody is saying \"the d-390 doesn't save your settings after you turn it off!\"  Well, you are wrong!  All you have to do is this:<br />1. Push the OK button<br />2. Go to Mode Menu<br />3. Go down to \"set\" with your down button<br />4. Go to \"all reset\" and pick \"off\"<br />5. Now your camera will NOT reset everything!  Perfect cure!","My name is Tyler and I live in Washington State.  I got this camera for Christmas and it is my first DigiCam.  You will NOT be dissapointed!!!  Everybody who says that the cam doesn't save your settings is right, but most of the time you don't even mess with the settings and if you do, it's really no big deal to change them.  I love the way you can hook this cam up to your computer with just a USB port without installing any annoying drivers (unless you have Windows 98 or Windows 98 SE).","I am somewhat of a photography buff, and really wanted a digital camera, so my husband bought this camera for me for my birthday. At first, I was thrilled-a digital camera, emailing pictures, yay. And it took some pretty good pictures. But, the zoom is pointless. Skip that option-it created very grainy pictures. The batteries, as other reviewers have pointed out, do not last. I live in a very picturesque area, and took a number or scenery shots--if you are too far away, like, from a mountain in the distance, the focus is miserable. The focus is also unreliable-it doesn't always focus on what is centered or forefront in the viewfinder. The pictures look great when you first download them, but then enlarge them--major disappointment-totally grainy and unfocused. The red-eye reduction doesn't work-90% of my people shots have red eyes. It is too slow-like others have said-AT LEAST 10 seconds between shot and next shot, and NO ACTION photos-if I take a picture of my dog, by the time the shutter snaps, the dog is out of the frame. And then every once in a while it surprises me and I get a really great picture, where everything works out. It is pretty user friendly, and is kind of fun-at first.After a while, it just gets frustrating.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun camera just to play around with, maybe to email photos with. Beyond that, look for something a little more sophisticated.","Good camera.  Definitely worth the money for your first digital camera or if you don't need an optical zoom.  Disregard all the reviews stating the you can not save your own personal settings.  They are wrong.  You can save your setting if you simply read the manual.  It's easy to do and all you have to do is read the instructions.","This camera is absolutely great. It takes very sharp and non-grainy pictures.<br />The batteries last very long on this camera (around 4 hours with the screen at low brightness), especially considering it only uses 2 AA batteries.<br />The 16mb xd card won't be enough for most users, so I recommend the Olympus 128mb xd memory chip to go along with this camera. (Other brand cards will not support the panaromic feature)<br />The camera uses USB mass storage, making it very compatible with every OS. This means that when you plug the camera in on windows, it creates a virtual drive and you can simply drag the pictures out of the camera. (Avoiding the horrid software all together). You can also store non-image files on the camera if you want to.<br />The Olympus D-390 also saves very complete EXIF image information, which includes things like shutter speed, light source, date/time, flash on/off embedded into the .jpg. Many image viewers support EXIF tags and you can see these details.<br />The manual is very complete, the only thing I found missing was tips for creating panoramas. The software included assembled the panoramas adequetly, but further cropping is needed in an image editing program.<br />Disadvantages:<br /> - doesn't rotate images automatically, even though it detects  orientation<br /> - underexposes images slightly, requiring a photoshop 'levels' change<br /> - no AC adapter<br /> - no optical zoom<br /> - flash sometimes fires in bright outdoor conditions<br /> - sometimes requires going through long menus to access a basic option (for example, macro mode)<br /> - movie mode is low quality and without sound<br />I'd greatly recommend this camera to anyone that's looking for a cheap digital camera that takes sharp pictures.","An excellent value, highly recommended.  The quality is much better than we expected for the low price.  We just point and shoot and get great pictures.  We have had ours for 2 months, have taken hundreds of pictures - many with the flash - and we're still on our first Olympus LB-01 CR-V3 Lithium Battery.  (Dunce cap to the AA whiners.)  When you get your camera, just spend 30 minutes with the manual and it's a breeze.  No problems at all downloading pictures with Windows 98 SE.  Only one gripe - the Camedia software on the PC tries to make it seem hard to e-mail pictures.  Tip: go to the editor in Camedia, and from there, save it to a file.  Then you can e-mail the picture as an attachment (never mind Camedia's awkward system for e-mailing).","This is my 3rd olympus camera, the previous ones are 35mm, so this is my first digital.  I have always liked this brand cause  for the price you pay you get a great camera.  My sister has the D-380 and I was very impressed with it.  I decided to upgrade and buy the D-390.  Kind of dissapointed to find out that halfway the fun the two AA batteries run dead (you wont survive a party without an extra set), the time lapse between one shot and when the camera is ready for another shot is too long, almost 10 seconds.  Is hard to catch good images with kids because once you push the button it doesnt take the picture for another 2 seconds, and the timer is harder to program than in other cameras.  My recomedation is to purchase de D-380, the previous model, is more user friendly, it holds 4 AA batteries and cheaper.  Good Luck","Bought this camera for the family last summer, it is a breeze to use.  My technology averse wife has really taken to it.  There is a mode where it remembers your last settings and always starts up as you left it.  Just read the instruction manual, page 84 tells you how to do this.  (The manual is posted on the Amazon page for this camera.)<br />The picture quality is very good.  I actually like the fact that it no zoom lens, only digital zoom, it is a very sturdy design.","I bought a Stylus Zoom regular 35mm several years back and was really impressed.  That purchase was the result of a lot of research about the quality of various cameras in that price range (low range of quality merchandise).  After reading some great comments about this camera, my wife and I decided to upgrade our camera from a cheapy to something nice.  WOW, we were not dissapointed.  It's a fabulous picture for the money.  The flash uses a lot of battery power so as many people comment, we simply bought an ac adapter (which has a very long cord).  We love it.","well, I have an older olympus camera and I love the way it works and takes pictures.  I bought this camera for my mom and the most annoying thing about this camera is it DOES NOT store your settings.  If I change it to 640x480 resolution, it won't stay after I turn it off and back on.  It defaults to 1600x1200, which is nice and all but not for my very newbie mom who will never be able to change it to the lower resolution.  I mainly bought it so she could simply take the pictures, plug it into her iMac, and email up pictures.  With the default resolution settings, she would be sending us 1 MB of pictures with 2 pictures. Not being able to store my setting is annoying and unacceptable. All of my other cameras did it just fine.  For this reason, I have to return this camera and find one that can store settings or default to a lower resolution.","I highly recommend this camera! For its price range, this is the best digital camera I have tried. The picture quality is excellent, the settings give you a lot of options, and the camera, as well as its software, are very easy to use. If you are looking for a decent digital camera for a lower price, this one is the perfect choice. However, I will agree with many other people here in suggesting you buy lithium batteries, as regular alkalines will go fast!","I love this camera my mom and dad got it for my 15th b-day and I have hardly sat it down I love it so much. If you want one of the most affordable cameras you can get with awesome quality pictures get this camera. The hardware is so fast and easy to use I wouldn't trade it for anything. The only bad thing about this camera is the batteries supplied by Olympus are not made for cameras so get a charger. The one that I got was 9 bucks and is made by Rayovak. In the long run this camera will save you so much money, for instence no trips to develope film no batteries if you get the charger and easy to e-mail pictures. The only really bad thing about this camera is the idea of you not getting it. This camera ROCKS!!!","This fun little camera is so convenient and reliable.  I took it to a baseball game and It was very easy to use, even in low light images were clear and consise. Indoors and normal daylight it was excellent the quality of the images is amazing. The controls are easy to learn and use.  My only complaint is that it eats up batteries so carry some spares with you.","I was looking for a decent but inexpensive digital camera and I gave this Olympus a try. I am very happy with this unit with one exception; it has a delay after you press the shutter button which means you have to be ready for action pictures. Once you get used to that, it will give you very good pictures and ease of use in a compact size. This is a camera for beginners or intermediate users. The memory cards seem to be a bit more expensive that competitors but in this price range, you probably won't buy many. In this price range this camera will be hard to beat.","I've had mine for about a month now and I am generally impressed. I bought it primarily for taking pictures of stuff for auctions, but have discovered that it works well as a general purpose camera.<br />In particular, it is good at catching quality pictures in less-than-ideal conditions. For instance, the other day I was out getting tossed around in a small boat on the ocean trying to take a picture of another small boat that was also getting tossed all around. Even though both the camera and the target of the photos were in constant motion, the images were sharp. It also does a pretty good job of balancing color in lighting conditions ranging from blindingly bright sunlight on the water to dark restaurants.<br />I do have a couple gripes with it. Most annoying is that it forgets your settings, such as whether to flash, image resolution, etc, every time you turn it off. This is really a pain since in many case these settings are only available by navigating menus and if you want to quickly grab a picture you're stuck with it's defaults. Also, it really does eat batteries -- forget about using alkalines -- get several sets of 1850mAh or better NI-MH rechargables.","I have purchased this camera and I am very happy with the results. All I wanted to do was to take quick pictures for emailing to friends and family and this camera is excellent for this and absolutely a good bargain for the low price. Advantages for the first time digital photo user: 1) Affordable 2) Excellent pictures 3) User friendly features<br />Forget about the video mode; if you want to make a video film buy a video camera !","I bought this camera with wishes of quite good quality and I didn't know anything more but possibility of doing 2.0mpixels photos, some movies and I've been informed about the outputs only, The price made me ready to buy.<br />And what? When I opened the box and took first photos I was totally shocked of extremely easy and proof photo system. Quality of pictures is very good. The colors are professional, nice and true, flash brights good and ppl look naturally (i had kodak cx4200 which took horrible pictures, ppl's skin looked so artificial)<br />Also ISO is nice, with very bright lens and ISO to 200 is enough and pictures are clear and there is no noise.<br />Everything automatic, and fast shot makes this camera very useful.<br />Very good for ppl who need to have cam on standby, to shot fast pictures, family cam or cam for kids.<br />Very good also for pictures in home. I haven't tried this cam to landscapes, but in home it works just perfect.","i have one of these but the bad thing is that the video is only 15 seconds long and doesn't have sound but in the oder hand it has a great zoom.","i have one of these but the bad thing is that the video is only 15 seconds long and doesn't have sound but in the oder hand it has a great zoom.","Bought this to take photos for my business. Since I don't need anything but small photos and web photos, this seemed like the right price with right amount of functionality. Only things I don't like are:  a) setting the resolution to anything besides the default (which is HQ), is reset back to the default after turning the camera off and back on. The manual and menus on the camera do not mention how to make the setting stay after turning off the camera. Noticed another reviewer found an \"obscure\" method of making it stick, but I haven't found it. b) the zoom is virtually unusable because the resulting image is significantly degraded from the non-zoomed image. I bought an upgrade memory card (64MB) and got four NIMH rechargable batteries and I'm happy. If you really need a zoom, buy another camera.","I received this camera as a lovely gift from a friend.  I was very impressed when I opened it...really classy and tiny looking with a nice, sleek look and the cute LCD screen.<br />This camera is very good with picture quality!  It beat my sister's ... digital camera with the quality!  It records short videos (no sound) and does the auto-picture thing (set it and it takes the picture in 10 seconds).  It has great options like the redeye mode, landscape mode, night mode, portrait mode, and more!  You can even make your images black/white, sepia (old ancient look), or normal of course.  Good customizations!<br />The bad.  The batteries don't last very long.  I'll say in about 1 hour of use, dead.  So get some good batteries or at least rechargable ones to save you money.<br />Another bad.  The zoom.  The zoom is almost pointless.  First of all, it doesn't zoom very close.  Second, the picture quality is just terrible with each zoom you do.  Because of this, you're almost without a zoom.  Oh well.<br />Besides those 2 bad things, the camera is A-OK!  Worth the money and a great gift for anyone.  Really easy and fun!","I bought this one just yesterday. I am happy for its features. Except for one thing it doesn't have optical zoom. But considering price and other features, i greatly recommend this camera for you.","This is a great digital camera but forget completly about the zoom. Whenever (any condition) you use the zoom, you get a blurred picture. The higher the zoom factor, the blurrer the picture. The problem is so important that I would say the zoom function doesn't exist on this camera (I would had like to know it before I got it). All the other features are great but I'm quite disapointed anyway.","this is a good all around camera i would recomend that any one who is looking for a digtial camera that is a good one get the D-390.","think about what you are going to be using this camera for...is it to make gigantic murals that are as big as a wall this is not the camera for you, but if you are just taking normal pictures to show on your computer and want up to 11 X 14 printed pictures  this is the best thing going for the money.  you don't need a big expensive camera for everyday pictures.  be ready to buy a bigger memory card the 16mb will only hold about 30 pictures and you will need batteries too, the ones that come with it are not really meant for a digital camera, rechargable batteries are best especially if you can find nickel metal hydride at 1800 milliamps.  radio shack has them for about [...].  the software that comes with it is fantastic...get this camera.  no one hould be without an Olympus Digital camera espically the d-390!","I've checked out many digital cameras in the under $250 dollar price range, and this one really performs the best. I've only had it for a small amount of time and already see how many times better it is than my older HP 1.3 mgpxl digital camera. It's xD picture card is very lightweight and small and is easily accessible. The auto connect USB has worked just as well requiring NO DRIVERS to install and transfer files. The Video Out port also has worked quite well in displaying pictures. The snapshot button to take the pictures does not have that awful delay that other digital cameras seem to be plagued with. The batteries do not last very long if you're using standard alkaline so NIMH is heavily recommended, or the lithium CR-V3. Even with the batteries installed and the xD media card, the camera was very lightweight and compact, easily slippable into a pocket. The pictures that I've taken so far have come out beautiful. Even the digital zoom did a pretty good job of maintaining picture quality while using it due to Olympus' good interpolation algorithm. At 2.5x digital zoom, the pictures still looked very printable. It also offers a lot of adjustable settings from white-balance, flash settings, contrast, brightness, other editable effects built-in, and program modes to manually get the optimal picture, or everything can be in AUTO mode to easily take the pictures. The interface is easy to use and efficient. The pictures tend to take a little bit of time longer than what I would like to store them (about 5 seconds) for the higher quality pictures, but even this is still reasonable. The 2 megapixels are enough for any casual user and the price ... cannot be beat. Overall I greatly recommend this camera for anyone looking for the biggest bang for the buck in this price range."]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE E323","amazon_reviews":["This has been my back up camera for years now I use it when the latest and greatest compact cameras I buy turn out to be junk and break.

The design is so completely intuitive, I didn't even look at the manual and was shooting pictures within two minutes of opening the box.<br />It takes exceptional photos in low light even handheld.  Add a tripod, and the lowlight images are truly beautiful.  The redeye flash works great, and the variety of settings available to choose from make this much more than a point-and-shoot.

It's a pity they stopped making them.","This was a great transaction, the product was as described (new), everything was great!","This takes very nice pictures, and outpost.com/Fry's has it for 99 bucks!  Picked up a 256 Duo (DIFFERENT from the normal Sony memory stick...had to return the one we bought the same day as the camera!) from outpost.com as well for 50 bucks after shipping and rebate, and started snapping pictures...475 2MP pictures on the 256 stick.  The only thing we regret is that it does not have a zoom.  Never really used the zoom on our other camera (Olympus C211...huge but cool) so didn't worry this time.  Went to a concert and the pictures from there were worthless.  Oops, but knew there was no zoom going into the purchase.  Also purhased the little black case that is available from Sony, and it goes nicely on my hip.  Very cool camera...fun and we love it!","This is my second digital camera. I wanted one that is for candid shots and for moments where my bulky Canon Digital Rebel is just impractical to carry.<br /><br /> The camera is built very solidly with anodized metal construction. The buttons, albeit small(given the small size of the camera), are well constructed. The quality of the pictures is very good, given that it is 2MP max. size. I took vga(smaller sized 640x480 resolution or 100 kb files)shots and they were decent even at 8x10 size. A small amount of blurriness was visible-- but this was a large blow-up for such a small file.<br /><br /> I have yet to print a 2 MP file picture, but the quality of the print should only get better.<br /><br /> The neat thing about this camera, outside of its very small size, is that it almost instantly comes to life and is ready to begin snapping pictures as soon as you see something to take. GREAT FOR THOSE ULTIMATE CANDID MOMENTS!! Because of its shockingly small size, people do not even think you have a camera on you. In its case, it looks like a small cell phone.<br /><br /> I purchased a 64mb duo memory card for this one. I am now sorry, since the 256mb pro grade duo memory cards are about the same price now. If you purchase a memory card, look into the pro grade cards.  They write shots to memory faster, making the camera ready for the next one. If you get the 256mb card, you can take up to 445 2MP pictures or up to 2,380 vga pictures!  You will seldom need to erase your card.<br /><br /> I bought the case for the Sony DSC-U50 camera(next size up).  It allows room for the lanyard and has storage for the card adapter.<br /><br /> This is the perfect complement to a larger digital camera--for that ultimate candid shot!","I have spent about a month and taken about two hundred pictures with this camera.  I was wary about it after reading the reviews below, especially related to the graininess comments.  I spent a year or so as a photography major in college, so I know a thing or two about photography.  If I found these problems, I had planned on selling it on eBay soon while the prices were still close to retail.<br />I purchased this camera because I often don't take my other digital camera (Canon G4)with me due to it's size and the fact I'm worried about damaging it while traveling.  I do end up taking the Sony as it is small enough to put in my pocket or in a hip case.<br />I am happy to say that I have not experienced any problems with graininess, outside of the normal circumstances when graininess is a problem (not enough light).  I shot in a number of settings, indoor and out, etc. and did not have any problems with graininess.  In fact, the tiny flash on the camera puts out a surprising amount of light when needed.  I shot a picture of my cat in an almost completely dark room, and it lit up the whole room (granted, it was a fairly small bedroom).<br />I just received my first set of prints back.  I chose to have some prints done in 5x7 to test the graininess, and there was not sign of any.  The prints looked great.  I purchased a 128MB card for it, and it holds well over 200 pictures at the 2M (larger) size.  I'd say based upon some of the comments made, a little knowledge of how to edit (size, dpi, etc.) digital pictures would go a long way.<br />Not to say that this camera doesn't have some downsides, it does.  However, if you want a small camera that you will take with you because of it's size that takes fairly good pictures, this is the camera for you.","I got this camera a few weeks ago, and I love it. I read a ton of reviews of \"micro\" cameras before deciding on this one and it drives my nuts when someone says \"The quality sucks compared to my Mofo 6000 Digital Camera from Canon that cost me $2000\". It is not a super high quality camera, how could it be, it costs $200?!?!<br />It is tiny, it fits in your pocket and it takes nice little pictures. It has some neat features such as burst and movie mode w/o sound.<br />The biggest thing though is the size. I thought that the absence of an optical viewfinder would drive me nuts, but I haven't really noticed. If you order this camera, go ahead and order a new memory card with it. The 8MB one it ships with doesn't hold many 2MP pictures though it will hold about 70 shot on VGA (perfect for Websites and E-mail).<br />A great purchase.","The latest in the U series Cybershot is great!  I've owned the original U10 and the Exilim and this is the most pocketable camera ever--it is roughly the size of my index and middle fingers put together and my hands aren't very big.  It is sturdily constructed and never feels cheap, so I never have any worries about it being damaged while in my pocket.  With its tiny size, you won't need to get a cameraphone that takes low-res VGA photos!<br />The photos are crisp and very good for a 2 megapixel camera this size.  It doesn't produce quality 4x6 photos, but can make very nice 3x5's.  Combined with its miniature size, its fast startup time and almost nonexistant shutter lag  (depending on auto-focus time) make this the perfect camera for those candid shots you wouldn't normally be able to get otherwise.<br />The U40 also takes MPEG movies with a beefed-up web-perfect 320x240 resolution (twice that of previous models) and unlike previous models, there is no time limit for the movie clip--it can be as long as you like, depending on free memory.  Please note, though, that the movie clips do not record sound.<br />Pros:  Small size, excellent photo quality, good startup and shutter lag time, improved MPEG Movie mode<br />Cons:  Uses the expensive Memory Stick Duo (rather than the standard Memory Stick), no optical zoom<br />This is a slick camera that is sure to cause a buzz when you take it out in a crowded room and the perfect camera to take around with you everyday for catching those memories you would have normally missed.","I absolutely loved this camera and am distressed to find that Sony doesn't make it or one like it anymore.  I was amazed at the high quality photos that I got from this camera.  It so small, cool, and easy to use.  Everytime I used it people would asked me \"what's that?\" and \"where can I get one?\"...SONY, Please bring this GREAT camera back!!!!!!","Great little camera, very portable and uses easy to find AAA batteries. Although only 2MP, it still takes nice snapshots and the size makes it unique. It's a pity they stopped making them.","This was a great transaction, the product was as described (new), everything was great!","This takes very nice pictures, and outpost.com/Fry's has it for 99 bucks!  Picked up a 256 Duo (DIFFERENT from the normal Sony memory stick...had to return the one we bought the same day as the camera!) from outpost.com as well for 50 bucks after shipping and rebate, and started snapping pictures...475 2MP pictures on the 256 stick.  The only thing we regret is that it does not have a zoom.  Never really used the zoom on our other camera (Olympus C211...huge but cool) so didn't worry this time.  Went to a concert and the pictures from there were worthless.  Oops, but knew there was no zoom going into the purchase.  Also purhased the little black case that is available from Sony, and it goes nicely on my hip.  Very cool camera...fun and we love it!","This is my second digital camera. I wanted one that is for candid shots and for moments where my bulky Canon Digital Rebel is just impractical to carry.<br /><br /> The camera is built very solidly with anodized metal construction. The buttons, albeit small(given the small size of the camera), are well constructed. The quality of the pictures is very good, given that it is 2MP max. size. I took vga(smaller sized 640x480 resolution or 100 kb files)shots and they were decent even at 8x10 size. A small amount of blurriness was visible-- but this was a large blow-up for such a small file.<br /><br /> I have yet to print a 2 MP file picture, but the quality of the print should only get better.<br /><br /> The neat thing about this camera, outside of its very small size, is that it almost instantly comes to life and is ready to begin snapping pictures as soon as you see something to take. GREAT FOR THOSE ULTIMATE CANDID MOMENTS!! Because of its shockingly small size, people do not even think you have a camera on you. In its case, it looks like a small cell phone.<br /><br /> I purchased a 64mb duo memory card for this one. I am now sorry, since the 256mb pro grade duo memory cards are about the same price now. If you purchase a memory card, look into the pro grade cards.  They write shots to memory faster, making the camera ready for the next one. If you get the 256mb card, you can take up to 445 2MP pictures or up to 2,380 vga pictures!  You will seldom need to erase your card.<br /><br /> I bought the case for the Sony DSC-U50 camera(next size up).  It allows room for the lanyard and has storage for the card adapter.<br /><br /> This is the perfect complement to a larger digital camera--for that ultimate candid shot!","I have spent about a month and taken about two hundred pictures with this camera.  I was wary about it after reading the reviews below, especially related to the graininess comments.  I spent a year or so as a photography major in college, so I know a thing or two about photography.  If I found these problems, I had planned on selling it on eBay soon while the prices were still close to retail.<br />I purchased this camera because I often don't take my other digital camera (Canon G4)with me due to it's size and the fact I'm worried about damaging it while traveling.  I do end up taking the Sony as it is small enough to put in my pocket or in a hip case.<br />I am happy to say that I have not experienced any problems with graininess, outside of the normal circumstances when graininess is a problem (not enough light).  I shot in a number of settings, indoor and out, etc. and did not have any problems with graininess.  In fact, the tiny flash on the camera puts out a surprising amount of light when needed.  I shot a picture of my cat in an almost completely dark room, and it lit up the whole room (granted, it was a fairly small bedroom).<br />I just received my first set of prints back.  I chose to have some prints done in 5x7 to test the graininess, and there was not sign of any.  The prints looked great.  I purchased a 128MB card for it, and it holds well over 200 pictures at the 2M (larger) size.  I'd say based upon some of the comments made, a little knowledge of how to edit (size, dpi, etc.) digital pictures would go a long way.<br />Not to say that this camera doesn't have some downsides, it does.  However, if you want a small camera that you will take with you because of it's size that takes fairly good pictures, this is the camera for you.","I got this camera a few weeks ago, and I love it. I read a ton of reviews of \"micro\" cameras before deciding on this one and it drives my nuts when someone says \"The quality sucks compared to my Mofo 6000 Digital Camera from Canon that cost me $2000\". It is not a super high quality camera, how could it be, it costs $200?!?!<br />It is tiny, it fits in your pocket and it takes nice little pictures. It has some neat features such as burst and movie mode w/o sound.<br />The biggest thing though is the size. I thought that the absence of an optical viewfinder would drive me nuts, but I haven't really noticed. If you order this camera, go ahead and order a new memory card with it. The 8MB one it ships with doesn't hold many 2MP pictures though it will hold about 70 shot on VGA (perfect for Websites and E-mail).<br />A great purchase.","The latest in the U series Cybershot is great!

Works great and was in excellent condition.","good","very fast delivery-camera is in great shape-camera takes wonderful pictures- I'm very pleased with my camera! I am very pleased with the whole experience.","The Sony Mavica series started it all with the Floppy disk Cameras ( that are still the most popular camera for internet pictures.)<br /><br />Starting with the Mavica MVC CD1000 20X Zoom Sony did it again..<br /><br />Mini Compact disks, the CD1000 could only use read only disks - CD-Rs.<br /><br />With the CD200 Sony set real lead in Media with a camera that uses CD-R and rewriteable CD-RW disks. General Cost 50 cents for a CD-R and $2 bucks for a rewriteable CD-RW.<br /><br />Using the Small ring in CDrom drives the mini CDs work just like a normal full sized CD. Capacity from 150 to 220 Megabits, or 200 to 2500 pictures depending on your selected resolution for each picture.<br /><br />With all the newer operating systems XP ect the Camera Scanner wizards and viewers make it Childs play to download pictures and look at them. The camera is easy to use, anyone can pick it up and soon be taking digital pictures.<br /><br />The entire series of Mavica MVC CDs are great.. with the CD500 at 5 megapixels with upgraded Lazers and CCDs is the top of the line.","I have had the CD500 for about 2 years now and offer the following pros and cons.  Pros first:<br /><br />The CD media is excellent.  These can be bought at Walmart or on line in bulk or in computer stores all very inexpensively.  I use the standard 160K or so size picture which is easily e-mailable and the CD will hold about 1,200 of these.  If you use the smaller 80 K you can double that but the clairty losses some.  I have made 8x10 prints of the 165K size and they picture is excellent, even won a place in a national calendar with a shot of that size.<br /><br />One psrson said she could not do black and white, if you scroll thru the excellent menu or read the manual this is not at all a difficult task.  There are many options from full automatic to full manual and many other options if you read the manual or scroll thru the index.<br /><br />The CD holds so many that a small inventory will last for a long vacation with lots of pic taking.  Extra 3rd party batteries are easy to find as also are external battery chargers including adapter cords for the cigerette lighter in a car.<br /><br />Uploading is a cynch.  In XP just plug the USB in to the camera and computer and turn the camera on.  In a moment the system sees the camera as an external hard drive and you can simply copy and paste at will.  I user the CD-RW so when all done I reformat the CD in the camera and am ready to go again.  I use 3rd party software for photo enhancement/cropping which adds an excellent dimension to your end results to fix what a novice messed up but now to look perfect.<br /><br />Camera has built in flash which works fine but with optional lenses you need the external add on flash.  I have both and they are awesome.  The camera has a laser to read ambient light and distance, it talks to the flash for sync and the photo is perfect.  Macro needs a pro for close ups but even an amature can do well if careful.  Repeat shots to experiment are so cheap why not do so and learn!<br /><br />The optional lens adapter ring is invaluable even if you do not use optional lens add ons where you can put a filter on to protect the lens.  The adapter ring also protects the moving lens from dust and damage, a most important safety feature, well worth the cost.<br /><br />Third party manufacturors make products from lenses to flashes to batteries to chargers to CDs and anything else that camera could use at a cost far less than Sony asks and they all work fine.<br /><br />Over all this is the finest camera I have ever owned, have had a wide variety of film cameras and quite a few digitals.  The only option that is worthless is the add on view finder, that really needs to be thrown out and re-engineered from scratch.<br /><br />Sony and others offer add on wide angle, fish eye, and telephoto lenses.  I really do not see need for any but I do have the wide angle lens on my camera and use it all the time.  One needs to be careful on zoom that if you zoom in with the optional lens and especially if you have a filter you will get rounded corner shadows.  That is not a fault of the camera but moreso of the lens.  The standard camera has a wide enough field of view as is for indoor shots and tele capabilities for distance.  Again add on lenses usually are not needed where the camera is all but totally self contained camera set.<br /><br />Cons:  The buttons on the back are located where your thumb will go and you will  inadvertantly toggle things you never wanted to toggle.  Also the main control button is very small and difficult use.  The Cybershot uses the same kind of control but the center button is larger and flat making it much easier to use. This camera could use that part and a better location.<br /><br />There is a lag time between shots especially between movie shots.  Movies can be a few seconds to over an hour per CD. But the record time is a mechanical process that takes time as opposed to the memory sticks, but the record time is far less but does require a bit of time.  The longer the movie the longer record time needed.  The camera needs to be held gently and still during recording, but this is a camer, not a jack hammer.  But the flexibility and cost effectiveness makes the CD over all the choice to beat all.<br /><br />The CD will not work in your computer unless you finialize it in the camera.  If you do that, then any unused space on the CD is lost, but the cost of the CD is cheap enough that this is moot.  This camera will work fine on XP and a CD is included for W-2000 which also works well.  With the CD huge storage of 2,400 small pixel up to 90 large pixel shots per CD they put the memory stick into the trunk, way past the back seat!  As of Jan 2006 I don't see Sony offering these anymore, but is a shame where this is the vest camera they ever made.  Maybe the next one will use the new DVD which makes all this even cheaper by adding many times the storage on the same size media.<br /><br />Over all the camera is fully inclusive for the novice or pro giving any level of photog almost any option he/she may want. The manual is well written and complete.  The menu on the camera is also complete.  As with any very high end camera you will need to spend some time learning all this camera can do and has to offer.  If you don't want to do that, then buy a cheap camera and live with the results.  If you buy this one you will have photo quality and versatility equal to or better than the most expensive film camera.  Buying this camera will not ever be a regrettable move unless you do not follow instructions (duh).<br /><br />The external lenses are fine but if used with the internal flash you will get a shadow on the picture.  The only way is to have the external flash unit if using the optional lenses.","I love this camera. It takes great pictures. Simple to use. The best thing about it is the CD it uses. You do not have to take up space in your computer. Your pictures are already stored on the CD.","My late husband loved digital photography. When he passed away, I looked at this Sony camera sitting on the shelf and decided I was going to learn to use it. I'm not a technical person so I can't go into all the technicalities of the cells, apertures, etc. that so many other people speak about.<br /><br />But what I CAN tell you is that I started an online website, Atlanta Vintage Jewelry dot com, and all the pictures there (over 1400 so far) have been taken with this camera. I found it relatively easy to learn (with the help of the instruction book). It has great features, close-up capabilities, various white balances, spot metering, timer, and such that I use regularly.<br /><br />My graphics program is Photoshop. After taking the pics, the camera simply connects to my PC, and after reading the CD source in the camera I can import them right into the program for editing. It also has a threaded lens so it accepts filters and additional lenses, if needed.<br /><br />I love this camera. My husband also had some other camera brands (i.e. Olympus) and after working with them, I chose this Sony as my favorite. Bulky? A little. But it's immaterial.<br /><br />The only negative I can say is that you have to keep the camera steady once you've snapped the picture until the red light goes out (writing info to the interior disc). Otherwise the data may not show up. To virtually eliminate this problem, I now use a tabletop tripod and the camera's timer.<br /><br />I've taken self portraits successfully. It takes great distance shots. I've only changed the little CD once, and they're relatively inexpensive compared to memory sticks. The camera has a built in flash but also a hot shoe to accept bounce flashes or whatever.<br /><br />I like it and I think you will, too.<br /><br />Gail Gupton, Author: 'The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment', and 'Seekers of Truth'.","I prefer SONY MAVICAS because they so easily accommodate the 3 inch disk CD-R/CD-RW which hold 156MB - 190MB per disc giving me the flexibility of unlimited memory storage and costing 0.50 cents per disc as opposed to the overtly pricey habit of replenishing COMPACT FLASH memory cards (or precious memory-sticks as SONY calls them).  More importantly, I don't have to lug around my laptop on holiday excursions... !<br /><br />I have a Sony MVCCD500 CD Mavica 5MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom .<br /><br />Instead of the laptop, I'd rather carry along as well my devoted 35mm Canon film SLR longtime companion (for old times' sake) along with my 8-month old Mavica.  Any thoughts to share?!<br /><br />Can't wait for the new 6MP SONY MAVICA dual video/still to come out.","I've had this camera for over a year now, have used it under varing conditions (cold, rain, dust) and it works perfectly.  One of the best features of this camera is that you can save the small CDs in your library, and never have to worry about your computer crashing and losing all your valuable photos!  I buy the read-only CDs (which are cheaper) and don't delete any photographs that I take.<br /><br />Granted, the camera is a bit heavier than the little ones that seem to be so popular, but not as heavy as you'd think.<br /><br />I use the camera to take photographs for various web sites that I host, and the quality of the photographs are amazingly good.  Another plus is that no matter where you travel with it, if you can find a computer with a CD-ROM drive you can see the photographs.  No need to travel with your camera's software and plugs... This way I can leave an electronic version of photographs with those I'm visiting, and still take them home.<br /><br />Simply a five star camera.  I wouldn't trade it in for any other type.","I have owned this camera for about 6 months now and I am glad I bought it.<br /><br />Pros: 1) Brand name Carl Zeiss lens, known for its excellent quality. The colors are true and sharp in pictures from broad daylight through flash and still captures very good details under low light conditions without flash. Closeup photography is outstanding and I have taken some excellent pictures from a distance of about 10 cms.<br /><br />2) Very easy menu selections - One other reviewer also mentioned this as a point that many users tend to overlook and I second his opinion. You don't have to dig 2-3 levels deep to change camera setting, especially if you are using manual setup.<br /><br />3) Big fat LCD screen allows easy viewing.<br /><br />4) Though its not meant to operate as a camcorder, it does make an excellent movie. The sound capture is very sensitive and the in-built speaker is very good.<br /><br />5) Easy transfer to you computer thought USB cable (provided). I use Win XP and it is a breeze for me to transfer the pictures from camera to the computer using XP's camera wizard. Can also be connected directly for viewing on a TV screen.<br /><br />6) For permanent storage, you can also finalize the CD and just pop it in the computer whenever you want to view. Mini CDs are dirt cheap (compare them to flash media of equivalent capacity). SONY recommends using MAVICA CDs (of course), which are a little costly. I have been using Maxell mini CDRs without hitch (available at Wal-Mart for about $6.00 for a 10 pk). Camera keeps giving annoying reminder to use mavica CDs, just ignore it.<br /><br />7) Hot shoe pod to attach external flash for enthusiasts, though the built-in flash has a very good range (about 14 feet under auto exposure conditions).<br /><br />8) Like the weight and feel of it.<br /><br />9) Very Good battery life between charges.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) 3x zoom is a minor disappointment especially as the digital zoom is worthless.<br /><br />2) There is no temporary storage for picture, where one can review a picture before deciding to burn it on the CD. The camera does have option to \"delete\" which is a misnomer. All the camera does is not show the file if you choose delete, even though the picture will be on your CD. If its a CDR, you are stuck with it as soon as you have clicked the picture, at least you can reformat if using a CDRW.<br /><br />3) The bundled software from SONY is C-R-A-P. As I mentioned before, I use WinXP (home and professional) camera wizard to transfer the pictures by USB. (Cons # 1-3 are my primary reasons for giving this camera 4 stars).<br /><br />4) The lag time between two pictures can be as great as 6-10 seconds, especially as the CD gets full, so it may not be the best for taking a series of single pictures rapidly. You can however take upto 16 exposures at a time in multiburst mode (and I am guessing here, the lag time might be greater before you can take another multiple series with a single click).<br /><br />5) The laser lens for burning the CDs might be sensitive if the camera experiences more than the usual rough and tumble. I have taken this camera on many vacations, through all sorts of weather without any trouble,  still I take care not to bang it against something hard. (Rock climbers, members of the press - this may not be the camera for you to take along on one of your excursions).","I am a professional radiographer and photographer (25 years now) and I used both the Sony CD500, CD400, CD350, CD300, as well as a Nikon Coolpix for field research x-raying mummies in Peru. This means the cameras were pushed hard.....blowing sand, huge contrast ranges, high resolution radiographs needed, fast manual control of radical light conditions, etc.....essentially most of the tough conditions and imaging requirements you can imagine. Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sony Mavica CD500 & 300 beat them all. It's not the most expensive or the best resolution but we all thought it did the best job.<br /><br />Mavica CD500: best of all....resolution, reasonable recording time, great image control for exposure, close-ups, better controls, pretty much everything<br /><br />Mavica CD400: best resolution but extremely slow recording time made it impossible to work with most of the time....the CD300 often got 3-4 shots while the 400 was recording one.<br /><br />Mavica CD350: not enough manual control for us, but usually got great images on automatic....some problems with exposure range for close-ups though<br /><br />Mavica CD300: not the best resolution, but now that I've done some prints for publication from it's highest res setting I will not be buying any more 400s....just not a significant enough difference,<br /><br />plus it's not as heavy or bulky.<br /><br />Nikon Coolpix: not in the running by comparison with the Sonys....although it is more lightweight....we are buying mini CDs for 33 cents each in bulk... and getting 140-180 high res<br /><br />images per CD.....they are so easy to format, initialize, and copy on any CD burner that I can't believe we even considered using memory stiks, or USB downloads.<br /><br />The best features are common to both the Sony Mavica CD300 and 400 series though.....manual control of the images, excellent close up abilities, decent wide angle (which can be enhanced with add-on lenses if necessary), and both rapid video and automatic functions with night focusing for flash, etc., etc.<br /><br />Finally! There is a great digital camera!","I love the camera and all the features . I don't miss 35 mm as much as I thought I would with this camera . I love that you can just click and e-mail right away . One problem is that I used the mavica discs and found them to be great , but expensive . So I did what every one else did , used a cheaper disc , not Mavica . They worked for a while but now , won't work at all .It won't intialize or finalize . They were not kidding when they warn that other discs will damage your camera . I called Sony and they tell me this is what happens .  I have a useless camera now , it won't even work with the Mavica disc. I can still see all the already recored disc from the past but can't make any new . It's ashame because the camera takes the best digital pictures i have seen .They need to work on this since you can't even find the mavica disc in my area .Thanks alot Sony .","I have been using this camera for about a few months now and I love it.  The picture quality, with 5 mega pixels is amazing.  The detail and colors that come through are great, much more than what I would expect for a digital camera.  There is so much you can do with the camera and still have not learned everything.<br />I was concerned when I purchased this camera that it would take long before you could take one picture to the next- due to the CD burner.  I read in someone's review that this was a problem with them.  I have not have had any such problem and I am able to take a picture right after another.  It appears it stores the photo within an internal memory if it is still recoding the prior on the CD.  I also love the fact you can store so many photos on single CD which I can buy for less than 50 cents a cd.<br />I also enjoy using the movie mode to capture videos. Although it is not the quality of a camcorder, the quality is pretty decent and you can record about 6 minutes on a 210mb 3 inch cd-r.  I would be careful not to have the lens zoomed when recording because it seems to lessen the video quality.  You also can not zoom in or out while in the video mode.<br />I would also be careful when buying accessories for this camera.  I bought two filter and the adapter that attaches to the camera and I think they are great because I can protect the lens.  I also bought the starter accesory kit which includes the carrying bag, an extra battery and 3 CD-RW.  I believe I purchased this for 60 dollars.  If you factor in the price for the battery and the CDs, it is a little over 60 dollars so I thought this was a deal because I was getting a camera case as well.  Unfotunately the case just fits the camera (and it is a VERY SOFT case- so do not expect it to protect it if you tend to be rough) but now it no longers fits in with the adapter/filter attchment.  That is something to be careful about.<br />One other point is the LCD screen.  It is very large and I think it goes great with the camera.  There is no viewfinder though and it can be a little difficult to see if there is bright sunshine on the screen, although it does work well outside.  There is also an atchment sold for this where you can use a view finder.  I plan on purchasing that as well in the future.<br />The zoom on the lens is only 3x.  Although I would prefer more it still is great.<br />As my last note, between the camera itself and the attachments I have, it is large.  Some people have complained about the size of the camera.  It is about the size of a small SLR camera.  If you are looking for something small, don't purchase this one, go with a simple point and shoot.  Yet, if size is not an issue and you want a great camera than this is the way to go.  I bought this camera for 450- on sale.  I would definitely wait and look around before shelling out 600 which most places have this priced for.  Overall though- it is worth it.","I've been using the SONY MVCCD500 CD Mavica for about 9 months in forensic engineering work.  The camera has been completely reliable inspite of some rough handling and adverse conditions. Disc media has huge capacity and is great for archiving photographic evidence.  Read only media helps defend against accusations of digital photo tampering. Resolution is adequate for some surprisingly good enlargements. Zeiss lense is supurb.","I owned a CD300, a CD400, and a CD500.  Why is it that they had a perfectly wonderful menu system on the 300 and 400 but felt the urge to mess that up on the CD500?  Everything is difficult to find now!  Don't get me wrong, it is a great camera, but the ease of use is part of it too.  And what in the world happened to the Black and White photos?  I can't find any setting for taking those pictures!  Another person mentioned that on the review.  I don't think it does Black and White.  I miss that feature so much!<br />The 3x optical zoom is very mediocre...  and their \"smart system\" of zooming is a bit of a joke...  you can only really use the zoom properly if you are taking lower resolution pictures, or you can't take advantage of it.<br />It is reasonably priced for a 5 megapixel.  The CD recording is absolutely fantastic and the media price is just right (provided you don't waste your money on Mavica disks).  Just purchase the less expensive ones.  I have yet to see a bad disk that is not a Mavica one.<br />Love the camera, but could use some improvement.  I would wait for an eventual CD600 though...  they might fix the shortcomings I mentioned above.","the picture quality is excellent.  Focus and view finder options are excellent.<br />The only thing that is limiting, is a slow  recording and  disk access time.  This is not an action camera and not for shooting pictures  of something in a sequence.  Great for brochures and gives you the ability to take a picture, crop it on your computer and still  have enough quality to blow it up again.","i got this camera 2 months ago, i used to have a dsc s 85 by sony, and the cd 500 its not as fast as the dsc85, logically because of the cd r media, but its just matter of time to get used to it, its just an advise<br />u can get pretty good images with this camera<br />nice videos at vga mode, i got some maxell mini cds at office deppot pretty cheap which are 210 mbs  u can get about 8 minutes on vga mode video<br />when u use cd r media its better if u dont delete any image cuz althougt u delete it u will still have the same space as if  u havent delete an image, thats why those mini cds are pretty cheap, u can us 1 cd each session and still pretty cheap<br />u most get the 3 cd rw sony package which is about $18<br />i got a 50 pack memorex mini cd-r at amazon at about $20 very good deal i guess<br />u have to get used to the finileze thing if u want to read media on any cd rom<br />i had have only one problem with it: when i try to get images from the camera via  usb cable the pc doesnt recognize the camera, i dont kwnow but maybe i m doin something wrong, i m just so new at the cd 500<br />i m trying to find a wide angle lens, i think i have to buy the vda 70 adapter  or something like that  and then buy the lens<br />sometimes its a little bit difficult to use because  i m not too much into manual cameraing, but have to learn, i m thinkin about takin a photography training or something<br />go ahead and buy this one!","Easy to use.  Pictures are wonderful.  Love the fact that I don't have to waste space on my hard drive.  I have made each disk like a 400 photo album.  Great.  The Mpeg movies are great too.  I have been without a video camera for over a year.  This is all I use.  Proud ownder","Our first digital camera.  On our trip to disneyworld, we shot about 100 frames each day for 8 days.  The CD format works wonderful.  We did not have to carry extra memory cards or rush to download them to a laptop.  The pictures have incredible detail which you will expect from a 5mp camera.  If you want a standalone camera, do not want to lug a laptop or be limited in the number of pictures you take,This is the one. The small CDs are inexpensive and permanent (we do not have to keep the pictures on our hard drive or another CD).","I agree with all the positive statements from other reviewers. Sony CD cameras are really good. Only downside you should be aware of is the relatively long write time to transfer image to cd at high resolution. During this time the camera isn't usable. I found myself frustrated at times wanting to take the next picture and waiting for the write to finish, which is frustrating when you really want the next shot.<br />If you can afford it, step up the the entry SLR's (such as the new Canon EOS Rebel) and you get all the benefits of this sony, plus more, and very fast picture taking -- closer to film cameras.","It took me awhile to come on-board to the digital era, I couldn't see the point on buying one when I can get great pictures with my SLR. We bought the CD Mavica and the more I use it, the more I like it!!! . My (our) CD Mavica is ready when you need it, no film to buy or to drop off. Discs are inexpensive and easy to find, even in Sydney.  Crickey!<br />Once you get used to the delay, you'll get pretty good at \"seeing\" a photo opportunity. Delete and have another go straight away, recommended for fidddly toddler subjects.<br />The size of the screen allows people with less-than-perfect vision to have a look a the pictures. My in-laws love that.<br />To me the best quality of this camera is it's flexibility. Although I must say that the software that comes with it did not work in my  iMac, I still can download still photos without any problems or special settings. I use the USB port on my keyboard and iMac starts iPhoto automatically, one more click and we're home!, without finalizing the disc. I have not been able to watch any of the movies yet.<br />Another great way to see the photos and is on TV, playing them straight from the camera. As far as I know families are more likely to gather in front of the TV rather than around the computer.<br />And last but not least. I like the weight and the feel of the camera, the controls are easy to reach while holding it with both hands.","The Mavica CD500 was a replacement for a Mavica FD-75. I am very happy I made this purchase. The picture quality is much better. The camera is easy to use, although it has a ton of features my previous Mavica didn't have and its giong to take a little while to figure out how to use them all in different settings. The 3 inch CDs are easy to find, I paid 21 bucks for a 50 pack.<br />The USB cable supplied is excellent, couldnt have been easier to transfer pictures to windows XP. The reviewer that said they couldn't load a driver for windows XP, well if they would read the manual, windows XP doesnt need a driver, just plug it in and go.<br />Also included is a cable to plug into your TV, and you can view your pictures on a TV. I wish I had this camera a few months ago at a wedding, would have been nice to put all the pictures on TV later at a relatives home for everyone to see.<br />overall this camera is excellent, the mini-CDs are easy to find, and inexpensive. And after searching the internet, I decided Amazon had one of the best prices for this camera, and free shipping. I ordered on a thursday and had it the next wednesday. I was taking pictures about 10 minutes after opening the box. You can't go wrong with this camera, especially if you have previous Mavica experience.","This camera is excellent.  I use this camera to take pictures for my school's yearbook and it's made my job 10 time easier.  The pictures are incredible.  It's very easy to use, you can just point and shoot.  I've been fiddling with the different focus and lighting settings, and i have snapped some simply amazing shots.  The disc makes it easy to tranfer your pictures.  All i have to do is pop it in my cdrom drive then copy and paste.  The disc gets filled up fast, especially when \"deleting\" pictures, so buy alot of them. Movie mode shoots in the mpeg format and is pretty good quality, but use a camcorder if movies are all you plan to do.<br /><br />The only problems I found would be the 3x zoom (it should be 6x at least) and the slow write speed to the disc after taking the pictures. **Also use CD-RWs, because once you finalize that CD-R, your stuck with what's on it.**","It is very easy to use...I love that my pictures once on the cd rom are basically safe forever...from what I understand; some dvd players will play the pictures on the cd rom.  The only bad thing about this camera is that when you want to look back at pictures you have taken previously on the camera; it takes a while for the pictures to focus on the lcd screen...maybe 4-5 seconds of waiting for each picture.  Like I said; that is the only thing I do not like about this camera.","I got this camera a few days ago. I love it. One problem though. It advertises that it can take black and white pictures. And I have been looking online for some technical help to find out how to do this and I can't seem to find any. One of the main reasons I bought this camera was for the black and white pictures. If anyone can help me with this please e-mail me at mommapunkin@msn.com. Otherwise its awesome!!!","The Sony Mavica CD500 is a fine digital camera. I've enjoyed using it very much. Once you learn the controls, you can almost effortlessly take great photos. On many occasions people have remarked how clear the photos are. The high quality Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar glass lens and 5.0 megapixel resolution see to that!<br />The camera is smart enough to adjust itself for most lighting situations. If you must, you can manually set the camera to get the effect you want. The large, bright, clear color LCD screen on the back of the camera works very well - it seems to be \"what you see is what you get\". There is no problem viewing the image in bright daylight.<br />Besides the high resolution and fine lens, the BIG selling point for me was the built in 3-inch CD drive. Being able to store approximately 50 snaphots at the highest resolution setting is just fantastic. No more film to buy or have processed. I bought a 5-pack of 210MB CD-RW disks for $10. Compare that to the expensive, low capacity memory sticks that other digital cameras require and it's a no brainer.<br />Once the CD is full, I connect the Mavica to my Macintosh with the USB cable, download the pictures into iPhoto and that's all there is to it. Then I use the format function of the camera to erase the CD-RW and I'm ready to use the same CD thousands of times!<br />I love the feel of the camera as it simply oozes quality. It doesn't fit in your shirt pocket, but since it's packed with so many features that's okay by me. I bought it here at Amazon and got it at a great price.<br />I would like the Mavica CD500 even better if it had a 10X optical zoom rather than just a 3X. But even with a 3X zoom I can get outstanding results. I've had the camera for over a month now and I'm still pleased with this purchase.","I purchased this camera as a replacement for a Sony Mavica about 4 years old.  I had a really good experience over those 4 years with the other Mavica.<br />Wanting to take advantage of the current technology in digital photography, I don't think I could have chosen better.<br />The quality of the 5mp photos is outstanding.  This is a digital photograph that can really compete with film photography.  I can't say enough about the clarity and detail that this captures.  You'll have to see it to believe it.<br />I was able to install the software on my Windows XP home edition after a very quick phone call to the software mfg which is listed on the envelope.  For XP - don't download the first driver on the list of options.  The second option - Image Maker - is the only one you need and it installs fine.  You see - the first option on the list isn't needed for Windows XP.<br />The storage on mini-CD's is perfect...and a much cheaper alternative to having film developed.  With the USB connection, no need to remove the disc or finalize it until it is full.<br />In only 24 hours - I know this was a great decision.  You'll love it!","This camera is great. This camera is loaded with features that can make even a novice look like they know what they are doing.  If you are new to photgraphy, the auto settings make taking quality photos easy.  If you are already an expert, the many adjustable settings allow for needed tweaking for special effects and different environmental conditions.<br />The camera uses pocket CD-R/CD-RW's which are the three inch version of a tyical CD.  With a little effort one can find these CD's for very low prices at stores that carry computer products.  The pocket CD's work in almost every PC with a CD-ROM drive and are handy to pass around between friends.  For the cost of other types of digital media it is possible to buy hundreds of pocket CD'S.<br />Overall, this camera spans the gap between novice and expert, new guy to old pro, and makes photography fun again.  No waiting for prints and no need to sit around wondering if your shot turned out like you had hoped.  Instant gratification, who could ask for more?","This excellent camera takes terrific photos.  With Windows XP & USB 2.0, I was taking photos and viewing them on my PC within minutes of opening the box, although I see that some of the more advanced features will take me a while to master.  I chose this particular camera for 3 reasons; my previous experience with a Sony Mavica, the 5MP quality and the mini-CD.<br />I frequently wish to access the images on my PC after taking only a very few photos, so I quickly learned that \"finalizing\" the CD-RW each time before inserting it into the PC is impractical (I was unaware of this step prior to purchase, but it is necessary for the PC's CD drive to read it).  Not to worry!  Using the USB cable, (no drivers required for Windows XP/USB 2.0) the images are accessible immediately, so you can wait until the CD is full & finalize just once.  Of course, you would want to wait until a CD-R was full before finalizing it anyway.<br />Amazon's product description of the camera's features is excellent, so I don't need to restate them all here.  I am pleased with my purchase of this camera and recommend it highly to others.","I went looking for a camera to use so I didn't have to pay huge amounts of money for photocopies doing archival research. This is by far absolutely the best camera I could find, and I've been using it for everything lately, not just the research. Combined with a photo printer (fairly cheap anymore) you can't go wrong.<br />Pros:<br />I thought it would be bigger, but it's actually very comfortable to hold and not that heavy.<br />The battery lasts forever (actually about 3 hours).<br />With the cd-burning piece, you don't need to download your pictures to a computer. mini cd-rs are very cheap and hold about 200 MB (depending on the size of the pictures between 50-400 pictures).<br />The 5 MP resolution allows you to zoom in on a document so you can damn near analyze the ink content.<br />The menus are easy to figure out, even for slow kids like me.<br />Cons:<br />None yet, except for maybe the zoom - it's only a 3-power, but I don't need much more than that.<br />I haven't used the USB connection at all, because I DON'T HAVE TO! (CD-Rs are awesome).","First i want to dispell any misconceptions: just because this is a CD-based digicam does not mean it's big, slow, loud, and a battery hog. It's not exactly tiny, but it's not huge either. It's about the same size as a 35mm SLR with a small normal lens. It's as fast, if not faster, than digicams without moving parts. You can't hear the disc spinning unless you're in a quiet room and you actually put your ear up to the camera and listen carefully. The rechargeable battery that comes with it lasts over 2 hours easy (or well over 200 shots). Not bad for a cam with a CD burner and a huge LCD.<br />The pros:<br />Carl Zeiss lens. Name brand lens known among professionals for its high quality.<br />Big fat beautiful LCD. Its impressive. Several people can gather around and watch movies or images taken with the camera.<br />It can record movies. I know a lot of digicams can do this as a bonus feature, but lets face it no one uses this feature because most digicams [are bad] at taking movies. NOT THIS ONE. it takes very good movies. so you'll actually use the movie feature. about 6 min of video (640x480) with audio on a 156MB CD. There is a good mic and good speaker (for playback).<br />The MENUS ARE GREAT. A lot of people overlook this detail. What do i mean? well, digicams use menus for changing settings. with most of them, the menus are confusing and stupid. like you have to dig through 2 submenus and hit ok 5 times before you can change the image size/resolution. not this camera! the menus are clear and simple and there are no submenus! even a novice can pick this up and figure it out without studying an instruction manual. for example: to change image size/resolution you simply hit the image size button push up or down (theres 5 different sizes) then thats it. also there buttons for commonly used things like changing flash mode and switching to macro (close up) mode. i also love the jog dial. this is for manual focus as well as for changing the shutter speed and aperture on the fly WITHOUT ANY... MENUS! you have to actually use the camera to appreciate how important this is.<br />the infolithium battery that comes with it is nice. it tells you EXACTLY how much time you have left (like 113min instead of a stupid little meaningless battery icon). if you want another battery, (strongly recommended) its expensive though. it's nice to be able to use the camera without constantly worrying about how much battery life is remaining.<br />CD-RW discs cost next to nothing. its very cool to be able to take a disc out and pop it into any computer to view images. it comes with usb cable and a/v cable for tv viewing. no remote control though :-(<br />the built-in flash is very good. range is little over 16feet. not bad at all for built-in. there's a hot shoe if youre hardcore and want to get a bigger flash.<br />The cons:<br />expensive proprietary rechargeable batteries and no streaming USB. whats streaming USB? with it you can hook up a digicam to your computer and use it as a webcam on steroids. not many digicams have this feature though. WHY?????????<br />you will not be disappointed with this camera. now click yes this review was helpful! >:O"]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P52","amazon_reviews":["I have two of these one purchased new, and another I purchased later from a seller on amazon used. both are great cameras. one is appox. ten years old the other about four years old. nice picture quality, but I really like that they use 2 AA batteries. if your looking for an inexpensive camera, you can't beat it.","nice camera","Arrived in a timely manner and works great, would do more busy in future if possible.

Especially since, on high-end digital camera double A batteries, the average battery life was approximately 50 pictures.<br /><br />Overall: Great camera for someone new to digital photography and looking to gain some experience with it.","I had gotten this camera for a christmas present from my dad loved it takes great pictures and the battery ran out fast for me but i went away on a trip and forgot the camera at home my brother uses it and plugs it into the computer and now its broken. GREAT camera a lot of money to fix if not under warranty but excellent camera LOVED it wen i was bale to use it","This camera takes really fantastic pictures....if you just look in the pictures that people have taken with it you'll see a few of mine.  They always turn out really well, I like all the features it has too.  The only thing I wish is that it would've had at least 3x optical zoom.  Other than that I don't have any complaints.  This has been a great camera for me & I think most people would like it!","It depends what one is used to, I suppose. Myself, I am no kind of expert in either cameras or photography, and not even much of an enthusiast. I got this camera in a fit of exasperation at a series of mishaps with my 35mm effort, and I can only say that as an unadventurous amateur I have been absolutely delighted with it and I don't grudge one penny of what I paid for it.<br /><br />I chose it at random, and the only comparisons I'm able to make with other digital cameras are with those I've seen my friends use. This one is certainly on the big side - it doesn't fit comfortably into a coat pocket, for instance, but it can still be carried there. When taking photos there has occasionally been more restriction than I might have liked as regards width, but that could well be because I have not troubled to find out all the options it gives me. In fact I have left everything at the default settings, as I have seen no reason to change these. Now and again the occasional photo comes out a little darker than I wanted, but that is easily edited with good p/c software - I use PSP8.  Otherwise I have to record complete customer satisfaction. Battery life is excellent (I prefer to use disposables), and the camera switches itself off after a short idle period. The memory stick no longer has to be a proprietary Sony one, as it seems that this technology has been standardised. Above all, the photographs have pleased not just me but everyone else with an interest in them, and that I can assure you is not because I am any great photographer. Others who have used the camera include complete strangers and very un-technical friends. Their photos have turned out as well as my own have, and no elaborate instructions have been needed for anyone. No special software is required if you have a Sony p/c, and the delayed-action when used with the Sony tripod works a dream too.<br /><br />Obviously more ambitious users than I am will set more exacting standards. For a humble amateur like myself who wants only simplicity, reliability and good-quality output this little machine leaves little or nothing to be desired. There must be plenty like me.","Having lived with the DSC-P52 for almost 2 years now, I feel that it's time to throw in my 2 cents!  I'd previously used a Minolta Dynax SLR, but this Sony was my first digital camera and I've never looked back since.<br /><br />I've divided this review into segments:<br /><br />EASE OF USE:<br /><br />Using the camera is child's play.  I only read the manual briefly, but I quickly became accustomed to the controls.  The large LCD display makes taking decent photos a piece of cake.  It's very easy to navigate your way through the functions.<br /><br />ERGONOMICS:<br /><br />The camera fits nicely in the hand and feels quite sturdy.  It may seem a little brick-like by today's standards, but it means that camera shake is kept to a minimum.<br /><br />QUALITY OF PHOTOS:<br /><br />The quality of the photos is superb.  I've taken hundreds of photos - holidays, weddings, portraits of family and friends.  There are limitations, however. The shutter speed isn't particularly fast, so don't expect spectacular results if your subject moves quickly.  I intend to invest in a digital SLR in the future to address this problem.<br /><br />PIXELS:<br /><br />Even though this camera is capable of taking 3.2M photos, I rarely using this setting.  For one, it uses an enormous amount of memory stick space.  For enlargements up to A4, 2M pixels is more than adequate<br /><br />VALUE:<br /><br />Overall, the camera is good value for money.  I would invest in either a 64mb or, better still, a 128mb memory stick as the 16mb specimen provided is fairly useless.<br /><br />WOULD I RECOMMEND IT?<br /><br />I most certainly would, but it depends what you intend to use if for. As mentioned earlier, this camera is ideal for snapping friends, family members, and special events such as weddings and holidays.  Just remember the shutter speed limitations for your Brands Hatch days!","I purchased my DSC P-52  two years ago for $425 CDN, and it has never failed me, after 4,600 pictures.<br /><br />I do not understand why people seem to have problems with this camera. However, read my other reviews, and you'll see that I am no stranger to bad luck. I suspect there are always a couple of lemons out ther, or perhaps these people are extremely careless with it, or possibly use it in locations which are sandy. A few grains of sand will destroy a camera.<br /><br />I also do not understand why people do not use their Warranty. This camera comes with a ONE YEAR warranty, so there are no excuses for saying \"Sony sucks, my camera broke after 6 months and they won't fix it!\" All Sony products come with a minimum 1 year warranty in Canada. Can someone please let me know if the warranties are less in the U.S.?<br /><br />I have dropped my Sony on numerous occasions. I might even go so far as to say I've \"abused\" it, and have three (3) half-inch dents in the metal piece surrounding the lens to prove that. Despite the rough-handling, this camera has never given me a single problem.<br /><br />I find this camera to be extremely solid and well-constructed for an essentially plastic unit - My only complaint being the cheap paint that rubs off the buttons on the backside. Tsk Tsk Sony.","I Have to agree. I have used this camera many times for Wakeboarding photography and all i wished for was for a<br />bigger zoom range. But i lived with it and the pictures<br />this camera takes in well-lit invoirments is great!<br />The quality is mostly well enough to be edited.<br /><br />The only thing i don't like about this camera is when<br />you take pictures in places with low-light activity, and<br />on the pictures you can see some red graininess, especially<br />on skin surfaces. Second is the memory. Unfortunately here<br />it's impossible to buy memory (128 Mb = $255), so<br />i had to stick with the 16 MB. It doesn't hurt, and it's<br />not really a downside, because of the fact that anyone could<br />spend a few more $$$ on some extra memory, that isn't<br />very expencive.<br /><br />What i enjoy of using this camera is the rechargeables. Enough said. Thank you Sony!<br /><br />I think light photographers would make good use of this camera,<br />but alot of light is needed for perfect shots. That's my lesson<br />well learned.<br /><br />A few months ago, the LCD started melting, then the whole screen whent poofy.<br />So now i'm planning it's funeral, because it spent a good 1 1/2 year taking great pictures.<br />I don't expect more than that.<br />And you people shouldn't complain about it breaking and stuff cos probably you let it fall off your<br />table and it suddenly  broke infront of your eyes. It's your fault. deal with it.","Worked great for two years, for vacation and fun photos, and for my web page and printed business pieces.<br /><br />Broke yesterday while in the middle of shooting. Same problem other reviewers are having with the lens buzzing...seems to  be stuck.<br /><br />Sony quoted repairs ($185.11 on 3/14/05) are more than the cost of the camera. I may be able to get it fixed locally for $48.60 evaluation fee, plus the cost of the actual repair, or they may have to send it to Sony too!<br /><br />Well, at least I had it 2 years! Can anyone recommend a more reliable brand?","I have owned this camera for less than a year.  I have actually really enjoyed owning it.  Very easy to use, nice features.  I have always been impressed with the pictures.  About 5 days ago my wife turned it on and it started making a loud clicking noise and flashing an error code.  I did a little google search and it turns out that quite a few people have had mechanical failures with this model and it has to be sent back for repair.  Well, if you are outside the 90 day warranty period you are responsible for labor, and Sony charges at a flat rate of $140 for anything...hmm.  Almost the cost of a new camera.  This is simply outrageous.  Highway robbery.  I am having serious thoughts about just ditching the camera and going non-Sony because of this experience.<br />Read around at some of the problems people have had with this camera before buying - and Sony's unwillingness to take responsibility for it.  That is my advise.","This little camera takes wonderful quality pics. It's also got a video feature with sound which is really nice. So if you are in the market for still photography great. If however you want action shots (like trying to catch the perfect pic of a 2 year old) you are out of luck. It just outthinks itself. By the time it's done analyzing to make sure you get the best possible pic for that shot you've missed the shot. The so called burst feature doesn't make it any faster, neither does eliminating some of the auto features. About the only way you are going to get the shot is to record a movie and then capture the individual screens later.<br /><br />**************UPDATED 12/26/06**************************************<br /><br />I've hated this camera nearly from day one.  About the only thing I do like about it is that you can take stills and video.  At least when it was new it did take great photographs, however you had to wait forever to be able to actually snap the picture as it's auto-focusing is very slow.  Now it won't even take good pics.  It's often blurry or dark.  The video feature has always been dark unless you have a lot of natural light.<br /><br />If you are trying to take pictures of a non-moving object and have plenty of time to capture the photo then it's fine.  If you want a shot of something moving forget it.<br /><br />The zoom function is nearly non-existent.  The sound on video is wonderful.  Must have an upgraded memory card if you want to take any videos or you will run out of memory very quickly.","This camera is a great gem for the price and offers great versatility. The camera is very good quality (sturdy) and can take a few bumps and scratches, unlike many other flimsy cameras in this price range. I have owned digital cameras before and many of the typical problems are solved with the P52. I take a lot of pictures at family events, and vacations. Its a great take along camera.<br />PROS -<br />- The camera turns on super fast, like in 2-3 seconds it is ready to take a shot. (this is an annoying problem with many digital cameras) And it also saves the pictures to the memory card is very fast, less than 1 second and its ready again to shoot.<br />- The battery useage is excellent. Even with regular alkaline batteries I've been able to take pictures for several hours, at 2Mpix Normal setting. With the included rechargeable Sony batteries it is superb on battery life.<br />- Camera menu is very extensive IF you want to use it. If not you can leave it on \"Auto\" and the pictures turn out great, most of the time.<br />- Can take pictures in COMPLETE DARKNESS. This I have done many times using the flash on red-eye reduction setting, it works in a regular size room (10 x 14). Great for sneaking up on sleeping family members and taking funny pictures. The flash is very powerful up to about 9-10 feet.<br />CONS<br />- The pictures tend to have redish atifacts in them, particularly when taking very close up shots of people.<br />- Pictures taken out doors can sometimes look too bright, almost washed out. You can make some adjustments to the ISO to fix this problem.<br />- Movie mode eats up the memory stick quickly, so I had to upgrade to a 256MB Memory Stick Pro ($65 at [...]) and now its great.<br />- Marco mode ...forget it, not good on this camera. So if you plan on taking close up shots of flowers or something, choose another camera.<br />Overall this a gem of a camera for any regular picture taking, and can even be used by kids without having to fiddle with a lot of controls. Just press the power button and you are ready to take pictures. It really takes the hassle out of digital photography.","If only this camera had a larger zoom range! This is what I keep asking myself time after time. I love the picture quality of the camera, and the fact that you can switch the mega-pixel range from under 1 mega-pixel to 3.2 mega-pixels comes in very handy indeed. I purchased this camera because of the size, just small enough to carry around wherever I go and yet, large enough so that my fat fingers have space to get to all the buttons.<br />I highly recommend this little gem! So, why only four stars, well, I would have liked a larger zoom and IMO EVERYONE has room for improvement.<br />Ciao!","This P-52 Cybershot camera is an incredible value, and I couldn't be happier with it. I've compared this camera with 2003 Canon, Fuji, HP photosmart and Kodak models, and the Sony wins hands down. Except in the case of the Canon, the Sony P-52 is far superior. There are almost too many pros to even list.<br />=====PROS=====<br />-The most advanced \"Super H.A.D. CCD\" exclusive to Sony.<br />-CCD is  2x as sensitive as any other company's CCD, & 6 dB less digital noise!<br />-beautiful, accurate colour<br />-extremely versatile lens takes perfect pics from 3 inches away<br />-very fast autofocus (1/2 a second)<br />-autofocus illuminator light for taking pics in the dark<br />-extremely fast start-up. Around 1.5 seconds!<br />-very fast LCD: almost no lapse time from real life to LCD.<br />-LCD has 6 settings for good viewing indoors or out.<br />-Aperture stays open up to 2 full seconds in dark. Anything longer can damage the CCD, or let in too many unwanted artifacts<br />-full array of manual functions (aperture [ev], focus & ISO)<br />-snow mode keeps the detail of the white snow<br />-beach mode captures the perfect blue of the water<br />-up to 1 GIG of memory - supports memory stick Pro!<br />-5 pic size settings - VGA, 1.2 mp, 2.0 mp 2.8 mp & 3.1 mp<br />-2.8 mp is \"3:2 ratio\" for perfect 4 x 6 photos<br />-cool multi-burst mode. Takes 2 pictures in a row, under 1 second. 16-shot option as well.<br />-smart flash. Even when taking picture in daylight, will sense if it is needed, and come on appropriately.<br />-Smart Zoom. Not a digital zoom. Picture quality does not degrade like standard digital zooms.<br />-very long battery life. 2 Ni-mh \"Stamina\" AA batteries last 67% longer than 2002 batteries.<br />-metal threads for tripod. Most other companies use plastic. Bad idea!<br />-menus are beautiful: incredibly easy to understand and navigate.<br />-prints at \"photo quality\" up to 8x10. After that, starts to lose some quality, but 11x14 still looks excellent.<br />-USB 2.0<br />-fun modes like Sepia, B&W, Solarize and Negative Art.<br />-voice function: records audio for 5 seconds after taking a picture. (40 sec. option available too)<br />-instant \"review\" button of last pic taken, when the LCD screen is off.<br />=====Mpeg Movie=====<br />-film mpegs with sound, limited only by the size of the memory. Example - 128 mb memory stick = 6 minutes of 640x480 or 1.5 hours of \"email\" quality (160x112)<br />-filmed at 16 frames per second, although after filming, camera info states that it was filmed at 25 fps.<br />=====CONS=====<br />-flash is off too far to the side of the lens. It makes big shadows on the left side of your subject.<br />-Snow mode seems to overexpose the shot a little.<br />-Optical viewfinder only shows roughly 80% of actual picture area. Use the LCD.<br />-only 2x optical zoom. The standard seems to be 3x. Sony needs to catch up here.<br />-zoom only works before you start filming. Can't change the zoom during filming.<br />-flash will charge slowly if batteries are running low.<br />=====CONCLUSION=====<br />An absolutely perfect and versatile camera. Only a professional photographer would, or could, find fault with it. But a professional would likely be using an SLR style camera worth at least double what this camera is worth.That being said, the price is great and Sony has really found a winner here.<br />This is a very fast camera in all respects, and that is important. Takes fast (and accurate) pictures, and saves info almost instantly. There are  no load times for pictures or movie files, like the Hewlett Packard camera line.<br />5 stars all the way.","I have had this model for almost 2 years and I have just upgraded to the D-7 (which I am yet to use). This camera has gone 10000 pics and kinda gave up. It no longer uploads pics in order and you have to search thru the tiny images on the screen to see what you just took.<br /><br />The quality of the pics is now sub-par. I took the pics for my friend's daughter's birthday party and almost all were blurry. The flash does not work properly anymore either. Mostly I just need more than 3mp to take decent pics.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* The flash is too far from the lens and casts a large shadow behind the object<br />* the ends of the camera are curved - good luck taking vertical timer pics, it tips over!<br />*it is clunky and oddly-shaped<br /><br />PROS:<br />* It does take a good movie, in two sizes (10 seconds in high setting is the max for my email capabilities)<br />* The memory stick plugs into my Sony TV so I can view, edit, and play movies on my TV. Obviously only a 'pro' if you have a sony tv!","This was our first purchase of a digital camera, and we have been very pleased with it.  We bought the camera because of the wide range of features, the competitive price, and the Sony name (to which I'm admittedly partial).  A big selling point was the fact that with the expanded memory stick (a separate purchase) you can shoot up to 90 minutes of video - nothing else on the market in this price range even compares to that!<br />We have found this camera to be easy to use, and it takes great pictures.  I would recommend definitely recommend this to others looking for a good value when buying a digital camera.","Great camera! How ever two minor things wrong with it......One, The 16MB memory stick that comes with it is too small. Second, the 2x Optical Zoom is not powerful enough for excellent close ups. However it does take excellent pics!","I purchased the Sony DSCP52 a week ago and I am VERY impressed.  The picture quality is excellent (3.2MP), the screen is easier to see than many other digital cameras I've seen, and the battery life is much longer than many others I've looked at.  Sony makes the best digital camera on the market.","Its a sweet deal for a sweet 3.2 pixel camera.  Got it for $239, then added a Lexar 128 MB memory stick for $39 bucks.  The P7 may have one more X of optical zoom (and be a bit smaller when turned off), but who cares...?  Smart zoom corrects that without losing resolution and/or you can clean it up on the PC if need be any way.  The movie feature is fun to play with, and the overall features are very user-friendly and intuitive.  You'd have to be a moron not to love this camera.  But do your homework, read reviews, ask your sketchy buddies, see what they like or dislike about digital cameras.  I gurantee you'll be back to Sony and buying this model or its big brothas.","What else can be said but WOW! - I have used several different cameras in the Sony family and this is by far the BEST of the line to date! It's so easy to use - out of the box - I installed the rechargable batteries, plugged in the provided 16MB Memory Stick and I was taking pictures!  I haven't read the manual yet, which I do recommened for advanced features, but anyone can use it right out of the box!  I also recommend getting a SanDisk Memory Stick reader as well, to help pull the pictures off the camera onto your PC. We got this camera for work, and I have it for home and several of my family and friends plan to get this one too! Why not you?? A+A+A+A+A+)","After thorough research of which digital camera I wanted to purchase, I finally decided to get the Sony DSCP52. This is one of the best buys I have ever made. It's extremely easy to use, and the pictures come out great in every enviorment I have tried. I would recommend purchasing an additional 128MB memory stick with the camera, the 16MB that are included are not enough for long outings or for video feture this camera includes. Great product!!!!","if you want a digital camera which enables you take excellent pictures and record video with many interesting features YOU have to buy this camera. It has an excellent functionalities/price relationship","Not too complicated for first time user of any digital camera.<br />Pleased with performance of camera and picture quality.<br />Memory stick media compatible w/Sony PDA is a nice bonus.","I am very much satisfied with this camera, very sleek, smart camera. The resolution of the screen is also excellent. The best part is the battery last for ages.","I loved my new Sony Digital Camera. Now I can either take digital photos and tape my family and friends."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P92","amazon_reviews":["Before the cameras on the smart phones, this was the bomb!","this is a great little camera, i have a P32,P52,P72 and now the P92. great pictures and easy to operate, only 5.2 mg. but that's all I needed.","It's adequate for what it is - only 4 megapixels with a very small screen.  It is hard to get used to how it focuses - you only give the shutter button a small amount of pressure, not half way down like more modern camera.

I would recommend to others.","Great value.. I bought this in Feb, 2011: It is working very well and is better than expected. I would by another","This is a reliable camera in my experience. My first one lost its movie function after three years of use. It got confused between playback and picture-taking mode in year four. Lost its ability to take pictures even though it could play them back, this after a night outdoors in the rain. I like the file size for what I do with digital photos. I use 35mm and 2.25 square film cameras for higher quality images.","I brought this camera in Oct 2003 (so its almost 5 yrs old). This is the most amazing camera i've owned. It takes amazing pictures. These days there are so many new cameras in market that I also wanted to have one so I took this camera to its last trip on labor day weekend. Yeah you heard it correct \"its last trip\"... to Niagara Falls. I soaked this camera in water for couple of hours. At cave of the mist it took a whole 1 hour shower with me (Although i was protected with plastic, it was not). I never imagined in my wildest dream if any electronic equipment can survive that abuse. But i failed and this camera did not. It worked like a charm the whole time and even when water went into the camera compartments it worked. i just took out the battery and memory stick and drained the water out. Its still working and is amazing me more and more.","I've had this camera for 4 years, and it is still taking great pictures. The quality of the pictures is great, even better than two newer cameras that I have.","This camera is good for point and shoot.  Low zoom power, but makes up for it by being compact enough to carry around.<br /><br />More importantly,  for those interested in infrared photography or IR + visible photography, this camera is a 10 minute project to disassemble and modify.  10 screws, swap out the ir filter and you're set.","I have had this camera for 2 or 3 yrs. now... let me start of saying this is an excelent camera... i love it.. if i had to go back and do it all over again i would have still chosen this camera... now i will tell you the problems that i have encountered...<br /><br />The Flash- this camera has a red eye reduction feature that works wonderfully but, the flash goes off about four times before the picture is taken and if it is a posed picture and the subject doesn't realize this about the flash then they are likely to move by the time the picture takes...<br /><br />Lens- about 6 months ago the lens started getting stuck i took the camera apart and blew all the stuff out of it... after that it started working again... about 4 or 5 months ago the there was something wrong with the focus.. all i had to do was zoom in just a little bit before i took the picture and it would focus just fine...<br /><br />let me end by saying most of the problems that i encountered with this camera where about 98% self inflicted by me... this camera has made several trips to New Orleans... a few dozens falls from fairly high places.. i used it outside on a front porch to take some pictures and video of hurricane Katrina.. (live in south Ms)... but this camera is still going...","I received this camera as a present from my mom.  It has to be probably the best camera that I have ever owned.  It is wonderful because you can just point and shoot with faith that the image will come out clear as day.  Also the movies are impecable quality.  As a photographer this camera is great to carry around in order to just grab life as it happens.  It is light weight, easy to handle and even easier to use.","Overall I like the the camera very much. There are a few things that I wished were better, e.g. focusing, battery life, but you get what you pay for. If your looking of a good 5.0 MP camera and don't want spend big bucks, you probably can't go wrong with this camera.","I have had this product for 19 months now, Only now have I come into serious problems.<br /><br />As you can see, the lens will not go back in- and it's out to full zoom.<br /><br />I turn on the camera and get a really nice rhythmic electronic groove- but i'd rather my lens go back in...  This has happened several times in the past, but it would sort itself out within 30 seconds...<br /><br />The onscreen message tells me to turn the camera off and back on again, and I do so, but the noise carries on for a good 15 seconds after and it doesn't help.<br /><br />I have no working camera!!!!!<br /><br />I'm off to check out the insurance papers...<br /><br />As for the camera, It was great- I used it for a lot of concerts and got some unexpected results/flukes- but never really what I saw (a common problem with digital).<br /><br />I still haven't to this day found the suitable settings for live concert situations-  They're either vibrant and blurry or 'white coated', dull  and bitty.  If anybody has some settings tips for this situation, please mail me them!<br /><br />Also, yes, the screen is lacking a hard, clear, protective coating... It is difficult to view the pictures at an angle.  Mine scratched after just a few days...<br /><br />Another thing- shutter lag... It's PAINFUL... you shoot, the screen goes black, and I have dealt with *20 SECONDS* of paralysis recently... On spanking new batteries, too...<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm upgrading shortly- I want to do some A0 prints, Not sure what to upgrade to but something with a shorter lag time is preferable...<br /><br />But, I do love Sony's products...","I actually have not bought this camera, I borrowed it from my aunt for a few days and I must say that I was only some-what impressed with the camera.  The main reason I wanted to try this camera out is because it is a very compact, high pixel resolution, point-and-shoot camera.  I mean, five mega-pixels?  That's amazing for the size, I currently own a Minolta Dimage Z2 and it has 4.0MP resolution and it is a much bigger camera.  I am quite impressed with the pictures this camera takes, I can blow up the pictures quite a few sizes larger on my computer and it does not pixelate.<br /><br />This camera uses two AA batteries which is something that I prefer over lithium batteries. (lithium batteries cannot be found everywhere, and you must take care of them because they are not as easy to replace)  However, the battery life seems to be a little short.  Fully charged batteries may last you one full day, so I would recommend buying another set of batteries.<br /><br />If you are not looking for professional photography, then this is probably a pretty good choice of camera for you.  I didn't find so much satisfaction with it because I was looking to play around with the manual functions, but there are so very few, and you cannot even change the shutter speed which is something that I really want in a camera.<br /><br />The 3x optical zoon works nicely.  It's fairly silent, not as noisy as the start-up (which is not too bad itself, but is definitely noisy). However, once you go beyond 3x you switch into the digital zooming...which is not so good because you dramatically lose picture quality.  For that reason, I never zoom in beyond 3x, and 3x hardly seems like anything when you know that there are other camera out there that zoom in more.<br /><br />I found trouble taking pictures indoors...you either have to have a tripod to set it on or have very bright lighting.  Most people who buy this point-and-shoot camera probably are not looking for proffessional cameras, therefore many may not use tripods, meaning that if you take pictures indoors you must be sure that there is plenty of light, or else it will result in blurry pictures.<br /><br />It comes with a 16mb card...this, I found, to be quite humorous.  I mean, how many pictures can you fit on that thing?  Five to ten, about.  I was laughing a bit, luckily I also had handy the 128mb card, which I found worked out fine.<br /><br />Overall, under the right conditions it is a fairly nice camera.  It is not something that I would recommend to everyone, though.  Are you looking for a simple, point-and-shoot camera?  Then this is not a bad choice at all, 5MP, and under the company name Sony...that's pretty good, I think.<br /><br />Like I said before, I borrowed this camera from my aunt, and after trying it out I have decided not to buy it.  Mainly because it is point-and-shoot and that is not what I am looking for.  My aunt who only uses point-and-shoot loves this camera, though.  So ponder a little on that before buying this camera.","We bought this model new at Staples which was our first mistake.  We also bought an extended warranty through Staples which was our second mistake.  This camera took good pictures until it starting humming after less than a year of use.  Turns out there is something wrong with the shutter and the total bill is $375.  Staples will not pay to get it fixed even under their extended warranty.  They are cutting us a check for the purchase price but will not refund the $50 for the warranty or the $25 deposit I paid to get it fixed.  Bottom line,  probably a decent camera but never buy a camera or extended warranty at staples.","For the money and features it's worth it.<br /><br />Think about what you're buying before you buy it. If you are looking for SLR features, don't buy this camera. You're not paying for them here.<br /><br />This is a point and shoot camera with some features to play with. Some of the settings are a waist and only produce blurry pictures. Low light shots, this camera sucks. I've never owned a camera that didn't, even my old Nikon 35 mm SLR. The outdoor shots are awesome. If you get bad pictures read the manual. Your shots should be clear and bright.<br /><br />I really don't worry about babying it and it has been problem free for a year now. The camera is well built and has traveled with me all over. Toughest test was roaming many ruins in Mexico, banged off rocks, heat and humidity.<br /><br />Yes buy a larger memory stick, that's a given.","I had a 3.2MP Sony camera about two years ago. It was great. Why I got rid of it, I'll never know. Even though it was a bit bulkier than the DSCP92, it took great photos and MPEGs and I could fit so much on a 128MB memory stick. With this one, five photos and a 30-second MPEG are all I can fit on a 16MB memory stick. But what bothers me most is that it doesn't offer Black & White as an optional photo mode! WHY IS THAT? It's such a common option and yields some beautiful photos. I mean, come on, how often do you take photos in Sepia, Solarize or--what's the other one--Sunburst? PLEASE! I'm tempted to take this camera back. Even my parents' cheap Kodak digital camera offers B&W.","I've had this product for 4 months now, so I feel I'm ready to write my review.<br />When I bought this camera, there were two things that compelled me to select this camera over others. the 5-mega-pixels, and the fact that it was made by Sony, a company that I've come to trust.<br />I'm sure you've probably already heard what's good about this camera, so I'm just going to skip all that and cover what I think the buyer should be aware of, namely... what they can expect to go wrong.<br />The point-and-shoot architecture is very intuitive, but not for professionals. One thing I was looking forward to with this camera was playing around with the manual camera settings. I quickly lost interest in this because you can't change the shutter speed, which is what I really wanted to play with.<br />The size of the camera is nice. It's a little smaller than the 1-time use film cameras, although much heavier. maybe about the weight of a small coffee cup.<br />The 3x optical zoom is great, but going beyond 3x the camera starts to use digital zoom. You can get up to 12x, but the picture quality really, really drops off beyond about 6x.<br />The camera takes pictures in standard computer screen proportions (although it has one wide-screen option). This is great for computers, but can pose a problem for people wanting to actually develop their pictures, as standard picture sizes are proportionally wider than computer screens. The top and/or bottom of your pictures may get cut off.<br />For indoor pictures, there is a problem. To function as a hand-held camera, you either have to have ROCK steady hands, or extremely bright lighting. Anything other than this will give you some problems with blurry pictures. After about a month of finding shelves and countertops or books to set my camera on for picture-taking, I bought a 5 dollar tripod that has expanded my options for using the camera and also just made it less troublesome on the whole. Taking pictures in the pre-set \"landscape\" mode can also result in blurry pictures, even if the lighting is magnificent.<br />The battery life can be troublesome, but a fully-charged set of batteries can last you an entire, fairly rigorous day of picture taking. I suggest buying an extra set of batteries, but if you can tolerate the thought of needing to take a picture, but having your batteries be in the charger, then it's not necessary.<br />When you turn on the camera, the lens twists and moves out of the body. This very cool to watch, I think... but compared to other cameras it is a little noisy; perhaps about the decibel level of a person next to you listening to loud music on poor-quality headphones. It's not annoying, because the sound only happens when you turn the camera on or off, or use the zoom feature.<br />There is a strange sound I discovered that is always going with this camera when it is on though. It's inaudible for the most part, but if you hold your ear directly against the display screen, you hear all sorts of cool mechanical beeps and stuff. it's probably not too healthy to do this... but it can't be worse than talking on a cell-phone all day :-P<br />The 16mb memory stick has got to be some sort of cosmic joke. You can fit at most 5 high quality pictures on it. I suggest, nay, DEMAND that you get AT LEAST a 128mb memory stick. But, keep the 16mb around as backup (you never know when you will run out of space and need to take one quick picture).<br />The screen was great, no pixels on mine were burnt out (check for burnt out pixels on your camera if you are buying from a retail store where you actually get to test the camera before buying it). But the screen is missing something. Most Japanese cameras and cell-phones put a clear, hard-plastic cover on these screens, which is very useful for those people who always feel they need to touch and point (those wierd colors that you see when you touch the screen are BAD).<br />The movie mode is nice for catching moments like kissing your lover, friend's falling off their skateboards, and so on. But don't plan on becoming the next Steven Spielberg with this. The camera will record directly to .mpg format, which is nice because you can play this format on almost any computer without needing to install anything. I say 'almost' only because I'm sure there are some linux distros that don't include a video player.<br />The cord that hooks your camera up to an AV-in port is great. you can watch your movies in decent quality on the TV screen, and do a slideshow type thing of your pictures. I like to use this in conjunction with my VCR to record movies, this gets MUCH better quality than the built-in video mode and records to a VHS, which can be handy. But the cord is rather short, so I can't record anything outside or in another room.<br />The USB hook-up to your computer is very handy. And transferring a full load (128mb) of data to my computer never takes more than 2 minutes, which I think is very reasonable considering how easy it is to set up. The camera will pop up in your computer and you can browse it just as you would any regular folder. Your pictures are stored as JPG pictures (of course) and in windows xp, you can switch to 'thumbnail' view and find the picture you are looking for right away. I have had some problems getting my computer to detect the USB connection, but I've always been able to fix this by rebooting.<br />This is a great camera. Under the right conditions and with a fair amount of awareness, you can take magnificent pictures. But it's not the magical camera that is going to work perfectly all the time and under every possible circumstance. I don't think such a camera exists. If you want 5 megapixels of power and a name like Sony, this is the camera for you.","I been working with cybershot since a couple years ago. First I got the DSC-71 and then the U-30.  Now I'm using the P-92 with great results in my pictures.  The 5mp and the zoom works fine and it's easy to use..","With 256 MB and larger memory sticks, this doubles as a camcorder. The only issue is that the zoom does not work during video capture. Video is high quality. Much better than analog camcorder to digital conversion. Small size means it fits in a pocket.","I picked the DSC-P92 because of the quality of the pictures,size of camera & affordability.This things takes awesome pictures.Ease to handle and easy to use.Only drawback is the memory stick they include but no big deal,I purchased the 128 memory stick and will purchase another soon.Once you start taking pictures you don't wanna stop.I have a 35 millimeter but in order to email pictures you have to have them developed and then scanned,with the digital you just shot,load to computer and email,all within a matter of a couple of minutes.Thanks Sony for creating another fine product.","I love my Sony DSC92 It does every thing I need and more.<br />People Can not beleive the photo sharpness and I love how eazy it is to use ,with a camera that fits in your pocket.","The reason I bought this camera was my Kodak dc290 stopped working after dropping it on asphault from about two feet (dragged out a car door with a jacket).  The camera was 5 years old and I was really happy with it up until that point.<br />I wanted an excuse to get a new five megapixel anyway.<br />Just a few weeks ago I handed my Sony DSC-P92 to a friend and it slipped through our fingers and landed hard on the sidewalk.  It fell about four feet.  The Memory card fell into a nearby pond, the memory door flew off and my heart sank. \"Oh no not again.\" I thought.<br />The camera is fine.  The memory door snapped back on easily, the memory card dried off and worked fine, and EVERYTHING works.  Amaizing.  It even has minor scratches on every side from it bouncing and rolling - but it works like the day I bought it.<br />Maybe I was lucky, but I am still impressed, and after using the camera for a few months, I believe it survived because it is simply well designed.","I searched for months trying to decide which digital camera to buy. The Sony DSCP92 was my choice after lots of research. Easy to use, brilliant photos, clear, crisp, colorful. The movies are great too. This camera does a lot of the set-up work for you when shooting pictures. The kids can even work through the buttons and menus without any trouble. I bought rechargable batteries as well as two 128 meg memory sticks. The one Sony supplies is basically useless. The software that comes with the camera is also fairly lame. I downloaded Adobe's Photoshop Album 2.0 and have been using that with great success.","I've had this camera for a few days and I've been impressed with its quality.  The camera itself is great, the software is horrible.  If you use Photoshop or another image program--keep using it. Overall, good price and good quality.  If you can't afford a Kodak or Olympus, this is a great option.  Small size makes it ultra portable.","I received this camera as a Christmas present and have used it off and on since then.  I'm not an avid photographer, just one who likes to take shots of the grandchildren around the house and occasionally pics for inclusion in a Word document.  I don't use any of the more detailed setting and I've yet to read all of the manual.<br />But it takes beautiful pictures using just the point-and-shoot mode.  The color balance and color correctness looks very good, even in those pictures shot indoors using incandescent lighting.  Importing the pictures into Win200 is simple and quick, and when printed on my Canon I860 printer the result is simply gorgeous.<br />I'm very pleased with the results and even more so when it's coupled with the Canon I860 printer.  A great combination.<br />03/31/2004 update:  I have to agree with the reviewer who said the 16M memory stick is inadequate.  It only yields 24 pictures at 1.2M resolution in Auto mode (wherein pictures are forced to Fine mode instead of Standard mode, effectively halving the number of pictures one can fit on the stick).  I've since purchased a 256M \"Memory Stick Pro\" made by Sandisk, to keep from spending a lot of time transferring pictures to my computer in order to clear the 16M stick for more pictures.","Considering I'm one that avoids reading instructions first...I found this camera idea for me.  However, I was so impressed with the quality of picture, and easy of auto operation, that I started reading.  This camera has a world of features, and offers a lot of fun.  I highly recommend it.","I had the Sony DSC-P71, and changed it to this camera Sony DSC-P92. It is great, the 5MP is fabulous and the MPEG with sound is another great feature. I recomend it, the pictures you get are better than any other camera I have seen or used that some of my friends have.<br />So, go out and buy it, and as some said already, do buy a 128MB memory stick or higher, you will need it.<br />The shipping servie by amazon is awesome! It's not the first time I buy from Amazon, and every time my packages have been on time and in excellent conditions.","I just got this camera for a replacement to my Kodak LS443 which broke.  This camera, being less expensive than the old  one (the LS 443 cost more than this one when i bought it ). The camera,  for the price it has, is Great! What other camera can you get under $ 400 with 5 megapixels?<br />The quality is great, it comes with red eye reduction, MPEG movie mode, and voice recording feature too.<br />What i really liked about this is that you can cjange the quality- from 5.0 MP to 3MP to VGA mode, so sending emails will not be a problem.<br />The camera comes with a 16MB memory stick, which allows you to take up to 7 photos with High Resolution.<br />The camera is great, for beginners and experts!","I had such high hopes for this camera. I have been using an Olympus 3030Z (3.3 megapixels) for a couple of years, and I'm sorry to report that my old Olympus does a better job. I bought this partly on the basis that we already have Sony computers and I am sick of fighting with card readers, and most reviews of this camera on the web that I saw were positive. But I think for many this was their first digital camera, and if you have nothing else to compare it to, it probably seems fine. However, it does have serious issues with blurriness and less-than-perfect lighting. I took comparison shots with my Olympus--same object, same lighting, same everything--and the Sony blew it every time. I saw graininess in most of the low-lit Sony shots, and none with my old Olympus (and no blurring, either). Low-light shots without a flash are no problem for my Olympus. But you could never get away with no flash with this camera. Bottom line: the price of this camera was great, but even so, I can't look at the pictures without wincing. The picture quality is barely above disposable camera-level. It's too bad, but I'm afraid this one is getting returned.","First of all, I compared this camera with the Sony's P10, and they have basically the exact same specs, the only noticable differents is the design, P10 has a 16MB more capacity on the included Memory Stick, but for a price that is more than $50. I bought this camera and bought a Sony 128MB Memory Stick for $50 bucks.<br />What I don't understand what amazon is doing is that I had one item in my shopping cart for 10 minutes at one moment, and the price had increased. Also amazon.com prices of most of their products are actually higher than their other retailer listed on amazon.com web site.<br />What mystified me also is when I make an order, the order doesn't show up until like the next day, and when its about to shop, it does the same thing. What's going on with amazon?????","We were very disappointed with the image quality from this camera.  I have finally returned it and am still searching for one with acceptable image quality.<br />The photos from this camera came out very red and were not sharp and clear.  I tried multiple film developers including snapfish.com, shutterfly.com, Walgreens, and a local custom film developer.  The Walgreens and local developer's prints were almost acceptable, but the others were horrible.<br />I played around with the white balance and other adjustments and could not get them with good color balance.  Perhaps more adjustments were possible--but I just finally decided that I didn't want to have to manually adjust for every picture situation.  I want more of a point and shoot camera, with the ability to adjust things if I want.<br />The other controls, battery, and operation of this camera were excellent.  It felt very solid and durable.  I loved the little sounds it made when you made menu selections.  It is easy to use and a great price.<br />But, in the end, the most important thing is the image quality.  I suppose I could take each picture and manually fix it in Photoshop or something--but that isn't something I am interested in doing.  A digital camera should be able to take the majority of it's pictures without software tweeking with Photoshop...","This camera was actually a \"replacement camera\" for an HP 5 megapixel camera I purchaged a few weeks ago. I was extremely disappointed with almost everything about HP's camera. However, this Sony model is leaps and bounds better than that one.  The battery use was a huge reason for me to return the HP camera, and this camera has excellent battery use. The Macro focus was pretty much broken on HP's camera, and works wonderfully on this one. The only thing that HP has over this camera is image quality, and even then it's a negligible difference.","I was having 2 options when buying digi cam fujifilm finepix 3800(now 3000) or Sony dscp 92<br />I bought dscp92 becs of high pixel range 5mp against fuji's 3.2mp and small size but after comparing its result with Fuji I m really disappointed. I think Fuji's finepix technology is best for better color quality and sharpness. (6X zoom and 4 battery power is bonus!!) I was lucky I bought it form C'city so I can go back within a month and gat it change or return it!! ;)<br />for those who are high pixel rage maniac(like me)- high pixel doesn't affect ur picture quality if u wanna take normal postcard size prints it will help u to just take big copy and 3.2 range is good enough for around 10X12 inch picture.<br />never buy HP digi cam i bough 1 from Amazon and return it in 2 days becs of poooooooor picture quality(Sony is not so bad)<br />-----<br />UPDATE: actually i returned this and bought another one see all my reviews<br />--------","This camera really does deliver the goods, and for much less money than other models out there. I couldn't be happier with it!","This camera is beautiful! It isn't at all plastic, it's strong and it takes very clear pictures with great color! This camera is worth much more than it's price! It even sends out an orange focus beam on your subjects face to help it focus. You can change the resolution from 1 MP to 5 MP, it even has a setting to take low resolution email pictures to send them quickly. It has lots of different settings. The only &quot;cons&quot; of this camera is that it only comes with a 16 MB memory stick and that allows you to only take 6 pictures at the highest 5 MP quality. But hey, for this price overall it's fantastic!","I've only had my Cybershot for a week, but so far, I've been very impressed with the quality of the camera, the clarity of the pictures, and the ease of use of the camera. I was able to use this camera for Thanksgiving, just a day after receiving it, and was still able to get some great pictures, so the learning curve is very small. I have settled on 3:2 mode, which is about 4.5 megapixels, versus the full 5 megapixel mode. The main reason for this is my desire to produce accurate 4x6 prints, which the 3:2 mode does to a \"T\". This camera takes breathtaking outdoor shots, and very good indoor shots. I've taken most of my shots in the point n shoot mode, with everything set to auto, and the pictures have all, for the most part, been great. I like the fact that I do have some degree of manual control over exposure, metering, focus, etc., because I do intend to explore all the different ways to take a picture with this camera, but for now, I'm very happy just shooting everything in auto mode. The movie mode is cool, if not a little on the jerky side (due to only 16fps), but I do like having the capability to record small movies, if the need arises. For now though, I just use the camera for taking pictures. The batteries and charger that come with the camera are top notch. It took me days to run them down. I did buy an extra set online for 9 dollars, so I should have no problems with battery life. I recommend buying a memory stick, as 16MB is a joke. I bought a 256MB (128MB x 2) memory stick online for about 80. I'd stay away from the memory stick pro. The magic gate stuff takes up way too much of the memory sticks memory. I highly recommend this camera to anyone.","My friends brought it to me from the US (i bought it at AMAZON), in a week i threw away my old film camera, even though i thought before that the pictures i had are excelent! To tell you the truth, i was expecting something really cool, but when i got this baby, and printed several pictures afterwards - i was simply blown away by the quality of prints, colors, sharpness and etc.<br />Words of warning: when you get it, you will suddenly start shooting and shooting and shooting, so buy the second set of batteries and the bigger memory stick! It's a must!","This camera worked amazingly since I got it in May.  It has been all over the US and Europe with me.  I do like the P-10 because it is smaller, but this is definitely a great value for the price.  The unlimited mpgs are wonderful and really allow you to bring the experience home with you.","I bought this camera recently at 360 bucks. It¡¯s a bang for the bucks, with 5 megapixels. Batteries are good. The Nimh batteries the camera came with have shooting life up to 50 pictures, to fill up a 128-MB memory stick. Since it¡¯s AA, you can get cheap batteries anywhere in stores.<br />The body is plastic, but thick and firm, though not as delicate as I thought it to be. Noise of zoom lens is a little annoying. Low-light focusing is always a trouble.<br />Pictures shot in daylight outdoor are superb. When I printed one on Canon photo paper pro on 4x6 size, you cannot tell the difference from pictures shot with films.","Well, I have to say, this is the most wonderful camera I have used.  I have always loved the pictures that my sister's camera takes (Olympus).  Her camera was very expensive and this one was quite affordable and takes as good of pictures if not better than hers.  I have not a complaint about this camera except for the memory stick that comes with it.  The pictures are crisp and clear!  I love it!  Thank you Sony!","This camera is fantastic.  I got it about 2 months ago and it has been invaluable.  I will never take a picture with film again!  The quality of the pictures is absolutely amazing!!  '[m not an photography expert, so I wanted something that was easy to use but did not want to sacrifice quality and this is it!  The batteries last much longer then other digital cameras I have used.  Of course the memory stick is very small, but that it typical for all digital cameras.  You will need an extra one, and b/c this is 5 megapixels the memory stick will hold less pictures that images taken at 4 megapixels or less.  And the great thing about this is if you need extra batteries you can buy any rechargable batteries and use that!  No expensive extra ... batteries here!  The size is nice and small so it fits in my tiny purse.  I've tried other cameras that were so small they looked so fragile.  Not this!  I have no complaints at all about this camera!!  To download the pictures you just plug the USB into your computer and you can pull them off without even downloading software to your computer.","If you love photography, if you like digital imaging, if you like making fun MPEGs, and if you enjoy shooting high quality pictures, then you gotta have this camera. I have never seen such an easy-to-use camera. Like with most Sony digital cameras, the DSC-P92's user-friendliness and image and lens quality are what it's all about. Having family living all around the world, it is also great fun to make short MPEGs and send them through e-mail.","For the most part, I love Sony products. I used to use the old Sony Mavica when they first came out and was looking for a replacement. To my suprise, a group of very good friends did research & found that for the price, this camera was hard to beat & ended up gifting this to me. Nice friends eh?<br />The camera is very well thought out with controls that are not only easy to understand, but easy to use as well. There is not much I can say bad about the DSC-P92 except for the 16M memory stick like others mentioned leaves a lot to be desired. My friends saw fit to include a 128M stick & I just recently went and bought a 512M PRO stick, so available space for pictures is no longer an issue.<br />Picture quality is simply amazing and if you use software like Adobe Photoshop 7, anything in your imagination can be done. This is one of the best and easiest cameras to use out there. Virtually all my friends have digital cameras ranging from Cannons to Nikons. When price, quality, features & ease of use is considered, the DSC-P92 is a winner in my book.<br />If you consider buying this camera, keep in mind that you'll definetly want to get at least a 128M memory stick upgrade, and that the batteries are not Lithium-Ion, but are 2100 mAh NiMH rechargeable AA batteries instead, so getting extra batteries would be a must as well.","Way to go for Sony Digital Products, but what happened when they designed it? It is a great digital camera with a fine 5.1 Megapixels resolution, it supports Memory Stick Pro, it has MPEG movie capabilities...wow Sounds Great, but it uses 2 AA batteries (included) instead of the Infolithium battery system. If you are tired of having too many things that require AA batteries, go ahead and buy Sony's DSCP10 camera instead, you will get the same cool things (but with an Infolithium Battery) and the price difference will be none when you compare it to how much you'll spend in buying AA batteries when the ones included are no longer useful.","I got this camera less than a week ago and I have nothing but good things to say about it. The photos that it takes are amazing. It is wonderful to get the 5MP quality at such a price and with such features. Also, its acceptance of the Memory Stick Pros just makes me giddy. 1GB o' photos at 5MP? Yes please. It is so light and compact. I can carry it easily in my pocket (which already has my cell phone in it). Being able to choose the quality of the movies that one makes is truly a bonus as well, as one does not need to waste quality on MPGs that are simply going to be e-mailed. Very well thought out design. I'd expect nothing less from Sony.<br />(Still, it does not begin to compare to my Nikon SLR, but at a tiny fraction of the cost of the body and lenses, it seems like quite a nice trade-off. Plus, I don't have to fumble with lenses, filters, and the like in order to catch a shot. This will be a great hanging-out-with-the-friends camera for sure!)","I did a lot of shopping and searching before I discovered this model.  Then I had to wait about 2 months before it came out, but I am thrilled with it.  The menus are easy to use.  The AUTO mode takes great pictures, but you have the flexibility to make adjustments if you want.  The files are big, but that is what you get for 5 megapixels.  Memory sticks are a convienient media, and prices will continue to fall.  I am amazed how much you can zoom into a picture that you've taken and it still looks clear. . .even on the camera's LCD.  I was resistent to digital photography because I love great 35mm pictures, but this camera makes it easy to switch.","Looks great, feels great, and takes great pictures.<br />5MP truly gives you a great quality, and surprisingly (to me) I'm using the Audio/Video MPEG mode more often then I thought.  The quality of the movies won't replace your video camera, but quite handy for clips that you want to capture.  Packed with features and a very easy to use menu system.  Overall I really love the camera.<br />Cons:  With the camera, none.  With the package, the memory.  16MB is absolutely terrible.  5MP you'll get about 6 pictures.  Wait for deals, here on Amazon as well, and you can find 256MB sticks for [some money].  So DO consider this in your pricing (with other cameras as well), but if you pick up a 128 or 256 stick, you have a great system that you will be happy with.","I'm rating the camera, or else the package would have got 4 stars since a 16MB stick is totally inadequate.  Aside from that, the camera is absolutely great.  5MP gives you obvious great quality.  A feature that I didn't think I would use much is really becoming more of a handy feature, the A/V MPEG mode.  It will not replace a video camera, but being able to snap 50 pictures at 5MP and take about 7 minutes of footage has been really nice.  (I have a 256MB Stick)  Overall, I'm very happy with the camera.  Like the Sony name, and it feels nice and durable in your hands.  I certainly can recommend this camera, but honestly, buy a memory stick, and I would not recommend anything below 128MB.  256MB is nice as you get about 100-120 5MP pictures.","Update! We have had the camera for several month now and it is probably one of the best products I've ever owned. We've been in several trips now since we bought it and I can not imagine leaving on vacation without it. Stop thinking about. It is well worth it, a very reliable product, and the picture quality is outstanding. You will get your money back along the years by saving in development, and you will be able to share your memories with your family and friends through email.<br />---<br />I bought this camera the day it was released. The day after receiving it we left, along with the new camera, for our summer vacations in Las Vegas. I'm glad I bought this camera, otherwise my wife would have used 5 or 6 24 exposure films. The camera is very easy to use, very compact, and it comes at a good price. The quality of the pictures was beyond my expectation. I was surprise to see how well the camera automatically adjusted at different light conditions. I was able to take good pictures with just a click of the shutter. I need to mention that this camera is replacing my 35mm Canon EOS 650 from which I took excellent pictures, but it was just too dificult to carry around. The battery life of the included NiMH is very good as well. I was able to run  the camera the whole day without recharging, taking about 25 pictures per day, and of course watching the results right after.  Make sure you buy additional memory sticks, because you are going to need them. At 5 megapixels and fine resolution you only get 51 pictures in a 128MByte memory stick. Fortunately, the price of the memory stick has dramatically dropped in the last couple of weeks. This camera also supports the new Memory Stick Pro, which comes in 256,512, and 1024 MByte configuration. I also recommend buying the LCS-CP2 Soft Carrying Case, and a Sony 128 MB Memory Stick Media MSA128A along with the camera. The only cons with the camera are that the included memory stick of 16Mb is only good for 6 pictures at 5 Mega Pixels, and that is very difficult to adjust new lenses/filters as you need the Sony adapter."]},{"name":"Olympus Stylus 300","amazon_reviews":["Glad I was able to get one of these to use my snorkel/dive case again without having to buy everything all again,these actually took decent pictures on land ...so for being able to take underwater pics again with my dive case on it for under 20.00...that's a win","We had three of these - my brother and I got them and liked them so much my mom wanted one. I shoot otherwise with a Pentax K10 SLR (and SLR film cameras, or a square-format when I have spare time to play). I have gotten prize-winning photographs from this little camera and am rarely unsatisfied with the images it produces. It is easy to use, small enough to fit in my pocket or glove compartment or clip on my purse when I don't want to take along one of my 'big boys.' I like metal-body cameras for durability - especially at low temperatures. I've had this outside shooting in below freezing conditions and haven't had to worry that if I drop it the body would smash in a million pieces at impact. I've taken it traveling in Europe and the Middle East, and road tripping across the United States. It's an absolute gem! In addition my original 300 ended up (after 2 or so years of use) dropped behind a car and partly backed over. The LCD cracked and there was some bent metal involved, but the amazing thing kept working for another 5 weeks - including a quick trip to England with friends - and shot great pictures until it died (i didn't feel it owed me a thing at that point!). I replaced it with a 410, and have now been loving that for about 5 years. The 410 is a little slower to be ready to take the next shot - i think maybe they used the same processors that the 300 has and the extra information in the higher megapixels means it takes a touch longer to record. Also, I would say with either model if I have a 1 or 2 GB card in there and it gets full the camera does take longer to get fully powered up when i switch it on.<br /><br />LOVE LOVE LOVE the REAL viewfinder. None of this shooting only with the screen business. You can shut off the screen to save battery power if you are using it on a long hike or rafting trip or whatever and won't be able to charge it for a long time. Hard to find in the newer point&shoots.<br /><br />I would get a used or refirb of this camera in a heartbeat before most of the newer 10mp cameras i've handled for friends. The 3mp shoots quick, clear, photos that can be blown up to 8x10 easily. i think it's pretty rare that you would need more if you're not a national geographic pro.<br /><br />More is surely not always better when it comes to a higher # of megapixels. This little beauty is a lovely example of that!","I think one of the number one reasons this camera gets poor reviews is due to a flawed design of the front sliding cover. Over the years the cover begins to bend outwards, allowing it to 'miss' the internal switch. The cover acts as an on/off switch and, when it malfunctions, leaves the camera useless.<br /><br />To fix the issue:<br /><br />* Remove the two lower cover screws using a \"dollar store\" precision screwdriver. Watch out as a metal screw plate will drop.<br />* With the cover removed, gently bend the entire cover inwards along its horizontal axis (\"creasing\" the olympus logo)<br />* The idea is to bend the cover just enough to create a snug fit once again onto the camera body.<br />* When you feel satisfied, reinstall the front cover. Make sure to align the metal screw plate. I found the best way to align the cover was to install it in the closed position (lens all the way it, cover slide closed, install two screws)<br />* Test camera cover functionality. Readjust if necessary.<br /><br />I have had 100% success with this on two 'broken' cameras. One was my original and the other was one I bought from e-bay specifically sold as 'for parts- broken'.<br /><br />Anyways, aside from the obvious manufacturing flaw here, these are not bad cameras. They take descent 3.2MP pictures and are small enough to slip in any purse or pocket. Battery life will last you about 500 photos (give or take flash and zoom use). The 'All Weather' stamp is really just a joke. Any fool can tell by examining the body that it was not engineered for 'all weather'. Yes it has rubber grommets and rubber boots at the doors and buttons, but they really were not designed for a rainstorm. Best I would recommend is trusting it for a few moments longer than a standard camera during a misty day.","I have now owned this camera for about four years.  I purchased it to take kayak fishing.  I have taken over 10,000 photos with this camera. I use this came about 90% of the time taking construction job site photos. The camera is great.  After four years the only problem is that the movable cover has gotten real loose and closes way to easy to the point of frustration.  It costs about $90.00 to send it back to Olympus for repair so I just purchased a new Olympus Stylus 850 SW.  This camera is a real step up from the 300.  You can not go wrong with any Olympus point and shoot cameras.  If you are a Sams Club member the 850 comes in kit for about $159.00.  This is a real killer price. Better than what I paid for my 850 via Amazon.","Super fast to turn on and shoot imediately- I have never missed a shot!<br /><br />Durable- I cant tell you how many times I dropped it!!! This camera traveled with me around the world and never let me down!<br /><br />Easy- Easy to shoot, change the settings, upload<br /><br />1 down- the flash is a little weak and indoor shots need a flash- grainy without a flash, but never blury! The shutter speed is great!<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good price, easy, for a fast-paced point-and-shoot camera.<br />Love it!","did not get a chance to use this, as it was a gift for someone else,<br />but i think, it is a good one and might consider in the future mainly due to its all weather protection feature","Product arrived in a timely manner.  Price was OK.  Camera was in good shape except the sliding lens cover was a bit loose.  That problem seems to have resolved itself.  Fits UW housing OK.and seems to be functiong as expected.","Glad I was able to get one of these to use my snorkel/dive case again without having to buy everything all again,these actually took decent pictures on land ...so for being able to take underwater pics again with my dive case on it for under 20.00...that's a win","We had three of these - my brother and I got them and liked them so much my mom wanted one. I shoot otherwise with a Pentax K10 SLR (and SLR film cameras, or a square-format when I have spare time to play). I have gotten prize-winning photographs from this little camera and am rarely unsatisfied with the images it produces. It is easy to use, small enough to fit in my pocket or glove compartment or clip on my purse when I don't want to take along one of my 'big boys.' I like metal-body cameras for durability - especially at low temperatures. I've had this outside shooting in below freezing conditions and haven't had to worry that if I drop it the body would smash in a million pieces at impact. I've taken it traveling in Europe and the Middle East, and road tripping across the United States. It's an absolute gem! In addition my original 300 ended up (after 2 or so years of use) dropped behind a car and partly backed over. The LCD cracked and there was some bent metal involved, but the amazing thing kept working for another 5 weeks - including a quick trip to England with friends - and shot great pictures until it died (i didn't feel it owed me a thing at that point!). I replaced it with a 410, and have now been loving that for about 5 years. The 410 is a little slower to be ready to take the next shot - i think maybe they used the same processors that the 300 has and the extra information in the higher megapixels means it takes a touch longer to record. Also, I would say with either model if I have a 1 or 2 GB card in there and it gets full the camera does take longer to get fully powered up when i switch it on.<br /><br />LOVE LOVE LOVE the REAL viewfinder. None of this shooting only with the screen business. You can shut off the screen to save battery power if you are using it on a long hike or rafting trip or whatever and won't be able to charge it for a long time. Hard to find in the newer point&shoots.<br /><br />I would get a used or refirb of this camera in a heartbeat before most of the newer 10mp cameras i've handled for friends. The 3mp shoots quick, clear, photos that can be blown up to 8x10 easily. i think it's pretty rare that you would need more if you're not a national geographic pro.<br /><br />More is surely not always better when it comes to a higher # of megapixels. This little beauty is a lovely example of that!","I think one of the number one reasons this camera gets poor reviews is due to a flawed design of the front sliding cover. Over the years the cover begins to bend outwards, allowing it to 'miss' the internal switch. The cover acts as an on/off switch and, when it malfunctions, leaves the camera useless.<br /><br />To fix the issue:<br /><br />* Remove the two lower cover screws using a \"dollar store\" precision screwdriver. Watch out as a metal screw plate will drop.<br />* With the cover removed, gently bend the entire cover inwards along its horizontal axis (\"creasing\" the olympus logo)<br />* The idea is to bend the cover just enough to create a snug fit once again onto the camera body.<br />* When you feel satisfied, reinstall the front cover. Make sure to align the metal screw plate. I found the best way to align the cover was to install it in the closed position (lens all the way it, cover slide closed, install two screws)<br />* Test camera cover functionality. Readjust if necessary.<br /><br />I have had 100% success with this on two 'broken' cameras. One was my original and the other was one I bought from e-bay specifically sold as 'for parts- broken'.<br /><br />Anyways, aside from the obvious manufacturing flaw here, these are not bad cameras. They take descent 3.2MP pictures and are small enough to slip in any purse or pocket. Battery life will last you about 500 photos (give or take flash and zoom use). The 'All Weather' stamp is really just a joke. Any fool can tell by examining the body that it was not engineered for 'all weather'. Yes it has rubber grommets and rubber boots at the doors and buttons, but they really were not designed for a rainstorm. Best I would recommend is trusting it for a few moments longer than a standard camera during a misty day.","I have now owned this camera for about four years.  I purchased it to take kayak fishing.  I have taken over 10,000 photos with this camera. I use this came about 90% of the time taking construction job site photos. The camera is great.  After four years the only problem is that the movable cover has gotten real loose and closes way to easy to the point of frustration.  It costs about $90.00 to send it back to Olympus for repair so I just purchased a new Olympus Stylus 850 SW.  This camera is a real step up from the 300.  You can not go wrong with any Olympus point and shoot cameras.  If you are a Sams Club member the 850 comes in kit for about $159.00.  This is a real killer price. Better than what I paid for my 850 via Amazon.","Super fast to turn on and shoot imediately- I have never missed a shot!<br /><br />Durable- I cant tell you how many times I dropped it!!!

Price was OK.  Camera was in good shape except the sliding lens cover was a bit loose.  That problem seems to have resolved itself.  Fits UW housing OK.and seems to be functiong as expected.","I've had mine for years. I take it everywhere with me. I've even dropped it a few times. It still works wonderfully. The only problem I have with this camera is that you have to hold it still so it doesn't take blurry photos. (I think it takes a while for the aperture to close.)","This is the first digital camera I have owned, and I have used it for 4 years (only one battery!).  I always wondered what I was doing wrong when the pix were so blurry with the flash off--but now that I read the other reviews, I see I'm not the only one!  And my sliding door has the opposite problem--I can't shut it, and my camera will not turn off.  I'm ready for something much better, with a stablizing feature, but this camera was a pretty good basic way to enter the world of digital photos.","We have had this camera for almost two years, possibly longer.  This little camera was a good for our workplace to take photos of people for reference.  Overall, the quality of the photos can go up to 3.2mpg, good enough for a 11x14 photo, but all we need is 3x5-4x6 maximum, so excellent for this.  Also it features a 3x optical (still low end standard zoom today) and a 4 x digital zoom (which relies on megapixels).  total zoom 12x, not bad for this little design.  The price on this right now is excellent for the features, the software still very similar to the newer stylus models (710,740,750,760,810,and 1000).  This does not have a digital image or optical image stabilization, which was not available from olympus at this price range back in 2003.  It does featrue the panoramic feature available with type m and type h olympus brand xD cards (a code that comes with the branded card unlocks the code in the master software on your computer).  What this feature does is allow you to stitch up to 10 photos together seamlessly for a 360 degree view if wanted. Neat.  Check this out as an everyday use, on the go camera.  It is weather resistant (sealed to prevent splashes ect, good in rain).  Good entry level camera for kids today.","The camera was average in my opinion. Did what you would expect from a camera in this range, but never liked the low lighting pictures. I was always concerned about the sliding door, as it seemed like a bad design from the get go. Well the door broke yesterday and now I see these reviews of the problems others have had. It confirmed my suspicions. Since it's an older camera now, continue to use it, but sooner or later the sliding door will get you. Now I'm trying to figure out a way to take the door off and rig it, so i can still take pics.","Overall the camera is a good, sturdy camera. I've had it for 3 years, and it hasn't suffered from the defective slider syndrome. However, the picture quality significantly worsens when you don't use flash (for example at a museum, or certain exhibits). The image is very blurry, no matter how steady you keep your hands.<br /><br />If not for this factor, I would have given the camera a 5.","After falling in a river with my last digital camera (don't ask) I wanted a durable camera that I wouldn't kill myself over if I lost or broke. This was my concluded answer and thus far I've been pretty happy. I will say this though; as far as I can tell you can't view pictures in a gallery format without closing the lense and shutting the camera off. You can see the picture you just took and leave it on, but not all of your photos. I didn't think this was a big deal but I find it annoying. Also, the buttons on the camera are very small and built low to the frame of the camera. This makes it good for durability because they won't snap off or crack from getting bumped or such, but, they are kind of hard to push. Also, the screen is smaller than I realized and the zoom is practially NOTHING. It didn't really seem like it on the pictures I viewed, but it's pretty tiny. I was surprised at the memory capacity of the camera though, being a smaller megapixel it of course requires less memory space, but a 256 mb memory card holds around 325 pictures. I think this is a good camera and is very functional for someone who just candidly takes photos. NOT for a photographer buff.","I just got back from Kenya, and this camera captured all my moments with the highest quality.  Ive gotten compliments from people commenting on the photo quality of the pictures and how great it is (in addition the the beautiful scenes I captured).  Compared to my friends' cheaper digital cameras, this by far is worth the $250+.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Beautiful design and very sleek, sturdy and small.  Comes with a handle you can put around your wrist, which comes in handy<br /><br />- Has many features and modes for use in different situations.  Althought the AUTO mode is sufficient for most situations, if you learn how to use all the different modes (which I admit, Im still figuring out) you can take better quality pictures<br /><br />- Being a college student who takes the camera out with me a lot when Im very inebrieated and because I am a clumsy person, Ive dropped the camera several times, including on concrete.  Its held up beautifully with minor scratches<br /><br />- Its also water resistant for spills<br /><br />- It has digital zoom which allows you to take pictures of things that are pretty far away.  Although the pictures come out more fuzzy than normal, It allowed me to get sufficient pictures of things that I could only see through my high powered binoculars<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- You definietly need to get a bigger memory card with this camera since the one it comes with only takes about 24 picures.  Although. this is the case with most digital cameras nowadays<br /><br />- The fuzzy digital zoom pictures (see comment above)<br /><br />- If you forget to completely close the lens door, when you take out the camera again the battery is drained. Also, lately Ive been having trouble with the lens getting stuck in place when it comes out and retracts, but I have the sinking feelings that that is correlated to the drops that the camera has undergone (see comment above)<br /><br />Overall, I did a lot of research when looking for a digital camera and although this does run a little but more pricy than all the $100 cameras that are out there, I think the camera is very well worth the money, and  even a steal for the quality of the camera.<br /><br />5 STARS!!!","I really liked this camera for the first year that I owned it, and then the slider (which reveals the lense) broke and now I have a really hard time taking pictures. If you barely bump the slider when the lense is open, it will think you're trying to close the camera and it will turn off. Also, the lense will slide open when the camera is in my purse and turn the camera on and off. This really kills the battery.<br /><br />Otherwise, I really liked the camera. The battery life is great and it is really lightweight. I love the fact that it is weatherproof, and have tested this characteristic many times. It's a pretty tough camera (other than the slider breaking). I have taken it all over the world and back again, and it's still taking great pictures.<br /><br />Since the slider is broken, I'm planning on getting a new camera... another Olympus, but one with a different lense-protection system.","The picture quality on this camera is impressive. Even after three years and many bounces on concrete. I must have dropped this camera at least 10 times and the thing is solid as a rock. The picture quality is unbeleivable as well as many people look at the 3x5's and say, \"this isn't a digital\" The only reason I gave it less starts is because it doesn't have a built in date feature, or a built in microphone. The date feature is super convenient when you want to capture certain events.","Good points:<br /><br />(1) Reasonable price<br /><br />(2) Very handy to carry and light weight<br /><br />(3) Lithium battery - Once charged this lasts for a long, long time (I don't know exactly how long, but I think you can take some 80 pictures for atleast 3 times and download them. Even after this you can reliably carry the camera for more pictures - it's that good!!)That way you can save on batteries cost also.<br /><br />(4) The picture quality looks nice on the computer<br /><br />Bad points:<br /><br />(1) When you want to view the pictures you have just taken, you have to press a button twice like we double click on the mouse. Sometimes, its a little annoying to do that as it is not as exciting as just clicking on a mouse.<br /><br />(2) Although there are number of mode options available, night mode is not very straightforward to operate. It needs some special skill to hold on the click button for a second or so, and then again click it (not exactly double clicking). Once you get skilled with that, the pictures come out very clear.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the camera.","The reviewer Katphish correctly noted many of the good points of this digital camera, especially lightness and quickness of use.  I, too can whip the camera out of my \"shirt pocket\" and squeeze off a shot in about 10 second or so.<br /><br />BUT, to me, the biggest disadvantage to this camera is not lack of manual controls, but lack of acceptable iris abilty. If it opens to f3.5 I would be very surprised. The shutter compensates in lower light conditions by staying open longer --much longer. The previous Olympus model I owned had a much wider iris ( maybe f2.0 or f1.6) and I was able to take many sharp interior low-light shots with no problems ( Hotel lobbies, a yummy food dish, person across table,  night shot of street ambiance), with no problems. Sure, the flash attachment would sometimes be ok, except for the intrusive flash. It may be just me, but with the Stylus 300, too many shots come out blurry, even when braced. What was standard in the older model, becomes very difficult in this one. The many cute features of this camera are made slightly difficult by having them buried in layers of menus. One can't always carry the manual with them, to say nothing of spending time to look up, say, how to delete one pix without accidently deleting them all. Some everyday situations and controls can be memorized, but well, isn't the camera supposed to be for folks \"on the go\"?","I liked the size of this camera, it is very small and take good picture. The only  thing that I did not like about it is that it has the option of taking movies but without audio!!! but otherwise it's a good camera :)","I have had this camera since July 2003.  Now I am about ready to buy a newer, different camera.  Overall, this is a good camera for someone who wants a simple, easy to use, 3.2 megapixel camera.  Being 3.2 mp, it gives great quality for 4 x 6 photos.  If you are someone who wants a standard digital camera and are not intent on taking artistic photos in clubs, or high -definition landscape photos, then this is for you.<br /><br />As a run down:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />+Sturdy casing (I have dropped it and it is fine)<br /><br />+Many photo options (if you need them, i.e. manual white-balance, macro mode, self-timer)<br /><br />+On auto mode as soon as you slide the cover open (ON) so you can point and shoot<br /><br />+Water resistant (great for all my travels)<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-The slide cover (though initially I thought it was great that the camera lens has extra protection from dust and the lens retracts completely, the slide door has started to malfunction.  A few times, I slide it open and the camera doesnt even turn on.  After another try, it is okay.  Consider, that I have used this camera very frequently in the past 2 yrs so I am not completely surprised)<br /><br />-Dim Light conditions produce bad photos when object is far away, i.e. people on beach at sunset<br /><br />-Dark conditions produce bad photos (when on night mode, the exposure is just longer, which creates extremely blurry photos)<br /><br />-Video mode is ONLY 16 seconds and no sound<br /><br />If you don't have the need for the newer 5mp+ cameras, then go ahead and buy this camera for a cheap price off amazon or similar because it is a decent camera for day-to-day shots if you are not picky.  (I guess I have developed into a picky photographer!)","For the snapshot photographer, you'll get great results with this little guy.  It's almost hard to take a bad picture with it.  And, with a little care, you can take really great pictures.<br /><br />The cards are easy to use, and the camera can take some serious abuse and shrug it off.  I'm very happy with it.  I wish it was less expensive, though.","I was very pleased with this Olympus camera.  I can't believe I found a camera that small and feature packed for so little!  The camera was bought as a birthday present, and I am starting to wish I had got one for myself!  I like how you can download pictures to any computer without the use of a software program.  Great Product!","I like the camera so much I bought three of them.  Takes great pictures and is perfect for a novice.  It doesn't have the features of my Sony but is more than adequate for a \"point & shoot\".","I am a freelance writer and when I can't get a photographer to come with me on jobs, I have to take photos myself. This is where my Stylus 300 comes into play. The editor of one of the magazines I work for was very impressed by the quality of this camera. Some of the photos I have taken with it have been published in various publications. <br /><br /><br /><br />The only con I have is that the quality of photographs taken indoors with poor lighting are not very good. <br /><br /><br /><br />In addition, this camera is perfect for me due to the style and size. I don't have to lug around a huge camera bag with it, I can just put it into my jacket pocket. This came in handy during a recent ski trip. I would and have recommended this model to friends and family.","As the first time digital camera buyer, I loved the price and size. Photos are as good as it ought to be (IMHO, this is a given - Olympus is a name to reckon with in the world of imaging). Photos taken by Canon and Olympus looked the same.<br /><br />Pros - It is sexy and beautiful (the metal case is really cool), very attractive size (fits in my shirt pocket), great battery life (have charged only once so far - I have clicked over 50-60 photos so far), rugged (I do not carry it in a camera pouch), easy interface (very intuitive - on the contrary, found Canon to be a bit complicated), media is xD Card (great size compared to the bulky CompactFlash); xD Card is also is superfast.<br /><br />Cons - The only one I can think of - xD Card is expensive - I had to pay about $40 for an Olympus 256 MB xD Card on eBay.","i'm not a professional photographer and mostly use this for pictures of my family and friends during holidays or when i'm bored.  It's very simple, stylish, compact, lightweight, and it has some easy to use features.  on the other hand, and this may be my fault, almost all of my pictures are slightly out of focus.  there have been about ten out of 300 pictures that have been perfectly clear, most of which are taken of my cat.  Now for my purpose this doesnt affect me too much, so its' not a huge deal, but i guess you get what you pay for.","i have now owned this camera for 6 months. it was completely worth the money. the pictures were amazingly clear. then the sliding lever to close and open the camera malfunctioned. i was warned that opening and closing the camera too much would make it become no good. i did not believe Olympus would allow a problem like that. now i have to return the camera to be repaired. great camera, bad feature.","this camera takes awesome pictures indoors and at night. this is a great camera. it eats up batteries like crazy, though.","For a basic digital camera,the 300 delivers good results in general use. Do not expect it to produce what a $2000 Lica will. the camera was built for, point-and-shoot,and it delivers good color with generally great results. It is compact,small,well protected,and a treat to use. A great general camera.","this camera has survived falls on concrete, mountain hikes through drizzle, and constant crushing at the bottom of my backpack. i take it with me everywhere, every single day. if you are like me, and abuse your electronics, but require a constant camera companion to capture unexpected moments, the olympus is worth considering. it's tiny and portable, takes satisfactory photos---excellent ones in daylight---and its battery lasts me days, even weeks. this is useful, since i'm very busy and do not have time to perpetually recharge the thing. i rarely have to think about it, but when i need it, it's there.<br /><br />if, however, you are going to baby your camera (as well you should, this stuff is expensive), and immortal battery life is not an issue, then the benefits of the olympus 300 probably do not outweigh the cons. some things that have prevented me from snapping that \"perfect shot\": a noticeable shutter lag (although it is considerably reduced if you get the chance to half-press the shutter release to focus beforehand), mediocre shot-to-shot times, a weak flash (frustrating when your target is just out of range), no sports/action mode, time-consuming menu navigation for limited preset scenes (no manual controls to compensate for this either), and in low light situations, a tendency to focus on an object directly before your intended target if flash is employed (even if your subject is as obvious as a group of people...if there is a table or something in the way, you'll end up with an image of a brilliant table and a bunch of silhouettes behind it). to be fair, these seem to be problems common in many compact digital cameras. but some cameras have strengths where others have weaknesses, and vice versa, so if these details are important to you, you may want to consider other models.<br /><br />i tolerate these deficiencies because the olympus 300 serves my specific needs well (priorities: size, durability, battery life, satisfactory image quality).  i snap some fine landscape and impromptu city-life shots with this little camera, and the automatic preset works well for the vast majority of situations. i don't know how accurately my needs represent those of the average user, though...so make sure it serves yours before purchasing!","I bought the camera a couple weeks ago and I've been very impressed by it.  It is very easy to use.  The menus are very organized and the manual does a great job explaining all the features.  Landscape pictures and portraits are incredible.  The camera does a good job reducing red eye, and skin tone is captured very accurately.  The zoom isn't great, but I was willing to sacrifice the zoom for the size.  The 16 mb XD card that it comes with is very small. I would recommend getting atleast a 128 mb card.  If you get a new XD card and you're planning on taking panorama's, make sure that you get an Olympus brand card (other brands don't support panorama shots).  Battery life is great.  I was able to take a little over 250 pictures with a fully charged battery (about 200 of them were in the lowest resolution and the other 50 were in the highest resolution).  It can be difficult getting clear pictures if you don't have a steady hand.  It is also difficult to determine if the pictures are clear from looking at the LCD screen.  Sometimes they'll look clear on the screen, but when I download it onto the computer they'll be slightly blurry.  The one negative thing about this camera is the slow shutter speed.  Don't even try getting action shots.  All you'll see is a blur.  Also, night shots or lowlight shots within the flash range (with the flash on) come out very nicely, but anything beyond that comes out blurry.  Overall, it was well worth the price and I am very satisfied with it.","If you use a digital camera, you need to get off those 4 AA from your drug store. They are just not practical, the battery on this camera last for a whole 250 MB card at max resolution. Additional battery is cheap (cheaper than buying those 4 AA batteries over time). Just like you would charge a digital video camera, you plug the charger in the wall, place the battery eaily on top and leave it. In less than the time it takes you to drive to that drig store, you got a full charge!<br />The media card is the one you would use for this camera, why would you want CF for example? Average user would have one digital camera with one card, that easily download into your PC.<br />I bought the Canon powershot and this by far has a better color especially for Macro shots. Go ahead and get it, it can be used everywhere, it wont run out of battery even if you store ity for a month as long as it is charged and it wont die as soon as as a little increase in humidity hits it. I have been useing it for 2 years and no problems, highly recommended.","This was my wife's christmas present.  I love the camera and learn to love Olympus products. I like the idea of an all weather camera.  This must be a standard for every digital camera.  Like the airbag for the cars.  I took this camera everywhere, USA, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Mexico City, Cancun, in te mountains of Colombia in south america, and back to the USA. Excellent!!! No problem at all.<br />I recommend the Fujifilm memory cards, Lowepro camera bag and Lexar Media Multi-Card reader.","This is the first digital camera that I have ever purchased for myself.  I must say that I am pleasently surprised with its' capabilities.<br />When using a STEADY hand, the picture clarity is unbelievable, this is great!  Not only that, but I was completely unaware that there was a movie capability on it...silent and short, but still it is pretty cool and fun.  For 16 seconds, one can chase cats all over the place.<br />The video out function is cool too, being able to plug it into the TV and view all the photos and movies is swell...although it runs off of the camera's power.<br />My only complaint is the the battery case slides open for me, and it might be just how I hold it - but it is a little annoying.<br />Purchase this at Best Buy - for $60 you can get the service plan and they will replace the batteries for free when they are below 100% and will cover all wear and tear on it.<br />I expect this to be the only one I get.","This is a fantastic little camera.<br /> 1. It takes great pictures and has some specieal features like the night shot.<br /> 2. The book could be a better written for clairity to explain some of the special features like how to get the digital zoom to stay on and not require an extra step to turn it on every time the camera is turned on. The viewfinder works great but would be nice if it was larger and includid the number of pictures remaining and battery condition. Outside in full sun the monitor screen washes out and is hard to view so the viewfinder is very handy when the screen washes out.<br /> 3. I bought and extra lithium 3.7 v 1000 ma battery (...) and it has been handy a few times. Very good company and very fast.<br /> 5.The delay from turn-on to actural taking a photo is more that a 35 mm camera but I am getting used to it. I plan to sell off some of my 35 mm cameras on ebay since the digital works so well.<br /> 6.Some have said the included software is lacking. Well I have not used it. I just uploaded images to the computer and then to the free Sony web site. It works great and allows some editing. Did I mention it is for free. They have some nice options for printing, and mugs with your prints that are worth checking out. Yahoo also has a good free site for free online storage of your images. Each image takes about thirty seconds to up load with a  fast DSL connection.<br /> 7. Have taken the camera to Sam's club do  prints using their computer to do the photo editing for 17 cents a print... they are printed in about 25 minutes am I am on my way... Works great and they can enlarge images up to 10 by 14 for about 2 dollars. Wow... try it you'll love it.","I made many searches when buying my new camera. Finally, I was between the Olympus Stylus 300 and Sony DSC P8, but after seeing some photos taken by the Sony I decided to purchase the Olympus, and I am quite happy with it. The pictures taken by Sony indoors were very dark and blurry compared to the pictures taken by the Olympus. The picture quality in door and outdoor is great, the camera is very user friendly, the battery life is awesome, the shutter speed is good, and the flash is pretty strong for indoor pictures.<br />I would highly recommend this camera for the amateurs who want to take good quality pictures with a user friendly camera.","I have a higher-end Olympus camera, which I absolutely love. However, I am going to eastern Europe, and wanted a smaller camera that, were I to lose or break it, would not be such a major financial loss. I stuck with Olympus when making my purchase, and was not expecting much from this camera. But it has turned out to be an excellent purchase, and I like it as much as my other camera.<br />First, the size is great. There are smaller cameras, but this one is tiny, and doesn't get heavy when you carry it around all day. The picture quality is good, and there are more features than I expected for the price. The zoom capability is not bad, either. And, of course, it is attractive, though a purchase probably shouldn't be based on that reason alone.<br />I actually like the movie-taking ability. I have a camcorder for real video, and don't mind that this camera takes short \"movies\" without sound. But, it's more of a novelty than a selling feature. Much like the panorama feature, it's useful only for recording particularly beautiful or interesting places for a more realistic memory.<br />The things I don't like about this camera are probably due more to personal preference than anything else. First, I don't like the fact that it doesn't take AA batteries. I like to bring a few sets of rechargeables on a trip, and know that I can buy regular batteries if necessary. It's also disappointing that the battery cannot be charged inside the camera. I suppose that the lithium battery is to be expected with a small camera, however. The battery life of this camera is good, and I bought an extra battery just in case. I don't expect that I will have to bring a charger and adapter unless I am going on an extended trip.<br />The xD media card is also not thrilling. It is small and makes sense with a smaller camera, but for those of us who already have digital cameras, it is annoying to have to buy expensive new cards when buying a new camera. It was not important enough, though, to deter me from making this purchase.<br />Like another reviewer, I have had some issues with blurry pictures, though the problem is not unique to this camera. I figured out that using the viewfinder rather than the screen greatly reduces this problem.<br />Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something small and relatively inexpensive for travel, or to someone who takes casual pictures and doesn't care about attaching lenses, f-stops or that type of stuff. Olympus makes a great product. Almost everyone in my family owns one of their cameras, and the one time there was a problem, Olympus was very accomodating, and replaced the camera free of charge.","The Olympus Stylus series of cameras are very unique in their functions; they are weather resistant. There are two models of the Stylus series; a 3.2 (Stylus 300) and a 4.0 (Stylus 400) mega pixel unit. Today we will examine the 3.2 mega pixel Stylus 300 unit which is very similar to the 4.0. This compact camera fits into any shirt pocket with ease, it weighs a bit more than most cameras (5.8oz. or 165g), which is probably due to the additional materials needed to weather-proof the camera. The 3.2 megapixel camera packs a punch, but has a hefty price tag. Is it worth its price tag, or is there a better alternative? Read on and find out what we think. (check out the full review @ bytesector.com)","I spent months reading reviews for cameras and decided to purchase the OLYMPUS 300 stylus. I bought it for these main reasons:<br />weather proof<br />compactness<br />3X optical zoom<br />included rechargeable battery<br />If you know alot about photography I wouldn't suggest this camera.  If you want to point the camera at you grandma and snap a shot i do not think you will be disappointed with it.","My pictures look incredible with this Olympus Stylus!  I can go out in the rain and shoot some different looking images and not worry about my camera getting wet.  Its small, so I can slide it into my pocket and it is metal so it feels more durable.  In doors, I find if I turn on all of my lights when shooting I get better lighting (but I had to do this with my small film camera too).  I would HIGHLY recommend this Olympus Stylus to anyone looking to purchase a digital camera.  My wife enjoys it too because it is simple but we still get pro results","I had touble with the camera 2 months after I bought it. The camera just went dead one day. I was living overseas and the warranty didn't cover there (Beware!). I mailed it back to Olympus service center in CA. After 15 days I got the camera back, as good as new, just in time for Christmas.  Now I love it! I carry it with me everywhere. Absolutely pleased with the quality of the pictures and ease of use.","I looked at just about every digital camera on the market that fit my criteria: small, good picture quality, sturdy, and three plus megapixels. This is the camera I settled on and I couldn't have made a better choice. The system is easy to learn, the camera works perfectly, and the quality of the photos is better thatn I expected ( simply beautiful). I added a 64MB memory card to my order, an extra battery, and a PC card adapter for use on my Powerbook. I am operating my Powerbook with OS X, so I didn't need to load in any software. I just pop the memory card into the adapter, slip it into the Powerbook, and just like magic, i-photo opens up and all I have to do is import the photos. Depending on the number of phots being imported and size of the files, this entire process takes less than a minute. Amazing. I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking for a great camera at a great price.",".<br />If you're looking for a digital camera for all weather situations, this (or the Stylus 400) is it.  Otherwise, move on.  There are better choices in the market for the money.  Yes I know, if you're looking at this, you've already decided on the minimum megapixels and optical zoom capabilities...<br />This camera is compact with a metal casing.  It fits well in the pocket and feels good in the hand.  And it takes decent pictures outdoor too.  However, the slow shutter delay can make you miss your shots.  In addition, don't expect all pictures taken in low light (indoor) to be sharp.  I consider myself as a pretty well versed photographer, and I've ended up with some blurry shots.  You'll have to hold the camera very still while waiting for the shutter to finally snap.  Please note that you won't know that the shots are blurry until you've uploaded them onto your computer - the camera screen is too small for checking this.<br />This camera is good for toting around (small, rugged, and all weather) in case you want to take a quick snap shot for the collection and sharing of your memories.  However, my brand-new camera broke down electronically one week after purchase (second day of usage; and no, it wasn't the battery) while on work assignment off the shores Puerto Rico (and no, it didn't get wet... much).  Luckily, I had my professional Nikon SLR with me.  It took the Olympus America Inc. repair shop in Hauppauge, NY one month to repair it - they didn't have the parts on-hand.  I didn't return the camera to the store because I needed the all weather feature (note that there are no features for adjusting f-stops, and such).  By the way, I also have an all weather Olympus Stylus Epic Zoom, which uses regular film (film image resolution is still far superior to digital).  OK, gotta stop messing around and get back to work now...","This is the first digital camera I myself have owned, but I have experiance with many of them.  I've had mine about 3 monthes.  This camera is very small and light - which is important for me, because I take it almost everywhere I go.  It is also durable, and weatherproof.  I've taken it out in the pouring rain, and taken pictures, and it's held up great.  The 'night mode' setting is my favorite feature, and I wouldn't buy a camera without something like this.  It keeps the shutter open until the camera feels it's gathered enough light (and it's almost always right) - meaning you can take pictures in near total darkness.  This allows for some great shots that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get...of course, you have to hold the camera perfectly still while it's taking the shot (I ussually prop it up on a railing or something).  Yeah, in conclusion - i's a great camera.","We used this camera on a ski trip, and at the beach, with wonderful results.  It was raining on the gulf, and we got fabulous shots, and didn't have to worry about the camera.  I've emailed copies to people without buying additional software, also. I highly recommend this camera to anyone who is computer knowledgeable.  You can crop, resize, etc. with great results.","I just bought this camera with these in mind:<br />1. price<br />2. shutter speed.<br />3. resolution<br />4. form factor<br />The remaining characteristics were sort of secondary (but still important) such as flash memory type, zoom (zoom is a relative new technology so I'm not expecting much in terms of the zoom lens).<br />So based on those, here are the pros and cons:<br />PROS:<br />1. Nice and small.  All weather is a plus. I can drop it in the sand and know it won't break (Of course, the camera has to be in the off mode.  If it's on and the lens is extended, then sand will definitely get inside and break it.)<br />2. Excellent resolution and clarity outdoors.  I took many at both sunny days and cloudy/twilight nights and the clarity (without the flash) was outstanding.<br />3. I like the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery.  I've heard nightmare stories of dig. cameras that eat up batteries.<br />CONS:<br />1. Shutter speed was disappointing.  indoors with flash, it took just over 2 seconds to register the picture.  I timed it.  Outdoors, it took a touch over 1 second (1.1).  I don't know much about digital camera shutter speeds but those values seem a little long for me.<br />2. The card type is xD. Proprietary and expensive.<br />3. It wasn't intuitive to learn. I had to read the manual.  For instance, I was trying to view the pictures on the LCD screen without learning how from the manual (it was a user-friendly test) and I couldn't.","This is a great camera, with an excellent price value.  It is better than a 'point and click' camera because it has some additional features and adjustments if you want to use them.<br />It is compact, stylish, well designed, and relatively easy to use.  If you are completely inexperienced with cameras, and don't understand how to use a flash indoors, or can't figure out how to save a picture on a computer and then email it, perhaps something from Kodak would be more appropriate.<br />I wanted to have at least 3.2 megapixels of quality, and Consumer Reports shows Olympus with one of the better track records on camera durability (less repairs).  I didn't want to pay some serious bucks for a camera, and then be worried about letting my 11 year old son use it.<br />By the way, I gave him the manual, and he figured out how to use this camera in one hour and then showed me how to use it. Still, this is not a good camera for a 'beginner.'","this is a great camera... took me a while (and i am young so i know technology) to figure some of the buttons out--- but once i did it was fine...<br />takes great pics...<br />program is kind of confusing on the computer but you can get around it...<br />costco has the best deal.. and best return policy if you decide you dont like it :)","The picture quality is fabulous. The controls are easy to use. Review of pictures taken, especially being able to zoom in and out to get a better look of what you have just photographed.<br />Red eye reduction was not very good, primarily in dark areas.<br />Also dont expect the flash to pick up anything more than 20 feet, especially people (red eye will result).<br />Get the 128MB card. Its worth it.","Incredibly small and asthetically pleasing, this is a major upgrade from my 1 megapixel Olympus.  Being able to keep this in my back pocket is great (it's actually so small that my major worry is leaving it on the table in a restaurant somewhere).  The battery life is excellent (and the battery, like the XD card, is tiny).  The major drawback--even on a very bright, sunny day, it cannot take pictures indoors without a flash; without the flash, pictures are dark yellow and severely blurred--surprisingly, they were yellowed and blurred sometimes WITH the flash.  Given the weather-proof design, this is clearly meant as an outdoor camera.  Overall, though, a keeper.","First, the bad: indoor, no flash pictures are poor.  We took about 60 pictures this weekend for my brother's graduation, about half inside with no flash, and only 4 of them came out okay.  Even the \"good\" ones weren't particularly sharp when I reduced them to 800x600.  We mostly took pictures of people; any movement on the part of the subject or the camera made the picture very blurry.  Guess it's using a slow shutter speed to compensate for the low light, though I'm surprised that it's as bad as it is!  Though, this is the only digital camera that I've used, so it might just be that I had high expectations<br />Besides indoor no flash shots, this camera is great.  It's pretty.  It has some weight to it which makes it feel more solid.  It's small---it easily slips into a jeans or shirt pocket.  The lithium battery that comes with the battery is great---it lasts forever.  The camera comes with a charger.  I used the camera off and on over the weekend (~60 pictures) and didn't run out of battery.  Outdoor shots are sharp and the colors are good.  The memory is pretty speedy.  I transferred over 100 meg worth of pictures in just a few minutes.  Oh, and since the battery is so good, you don't need to worry about buying one of those special download hookups.  Just plug the USB cable into the camera and start downloading!<br />One thing that I particularly love (being the computer geek that I am) is that I can mount the camera as a USB drive under linux, no special software needed.  I just \"mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt/usb\" and copy the files over.  No hassling with Windows!<br />In summary, if you don't mind using the flash for indoor pictures, this is a great little camera, well worth the money.","A friend showed me the next model down, and liked it.  I decided to get this model with lithium batteries.  I take close-ups of flowers, and it does a great job, and viewing them through the display allows centering of the bloom every time.  My only problem is that the pictures make huge files, which take time to attach and send on the internet.  Perhaps there is a way around this, but a friend compresses the files and that serves. I agree with the comments on the button sizes on the rear, but it isn't a big problem.  I'm happy with my new toy","After searching for several months for a good digital camera, I found that the Stylus provided the most \"bang for the buck\".  It's compact size and user friendly interface makes it a breeze to use, even for first time digital camera owners.  The software provided makes downloading and emailing pictures easier than ever and it even allows you to do simple touch-ups to your pictures (resizing, cropping, changing quality, red-eye, etc.) before sending them out.  Kudos to Amazon.com for offering a US warranty product at competitive prices, not to mention free shipping, free picture cards and no tax!<br />The only reservation that I had about this camera is the fact that it uses the new xD picture cards.  This is definitely not a knock on the camera itself, but rather a concern that this media type may cease to exist.  Hopefully this media will be supported as much if not more than the others and won't die a tragic death in the same way that BETA did with the VCR.","This is a snap response after recieving this camera today and playing with it for about an hour or so.<br />First, THE GOOD:<br />The first thing you're gonna notice about this camera is it's apearance. It's simply GORGEOUS! It's called the STYLUS for a reason! It's STYLISH! It's hands down the most attractive looking camera I've seen, it just looks cool. You're bound to get compliments any time you whip it out among company. The shiny aluminum case is no just very classy looking, but also makes for a durable and sturdy frame.<br />The Stylus 300 Digital by Olympus is very well made, and feels firm and durable in the hand. It does'nt feel flimsy at all. You get the feeling that if you dropped it on a sidewalk a few times it would probably survive with little more than a dent (Although I wouldnt try that!). Also, it's supposedly made for all-weather use, so you should be able to take pictures in driving rain if you wanted to. You'l notice that all the ports and connectors are protected by rubber covers and all the little compartments with plastic doors (for example the little cover that you flip up to put in a memory card) covering them are sealed with rubber rims to keep out water. This is a great camera for anyone who tends to be a bit clumbsy or who wants to be able to have take pictures in bad weather.<br />The camera is also pretty small. It may not be the smallest camera out (when compared to other super-tiny models) but it's pretty damn small! It's about the size of a pack of cigarretts! It's actually smaller than my wallet!<br />The camera is also very well designed. There is no lens cap to loose or have to remember to put on. Instead a door slides over the lens and protects it. This same door/sleave is used to turn the camera on/off. Turning it on is as simple as flipping the door over. Start up is very quick! I was able to turn the camera on, take a picture, and turn the camera back off and in my pocket in about 10 seconds! It's pretty responsive. It's pretty quick taking pictures too, the wait time between pictures is very short (shorter than my 35mm), not quite as fast as would be wished for though.<br />Olympus also through in a remote control! This is great for self portraits or when you want to actually be IN the pictures you're taking. The battery life apears to be pretty good, and a lithium Ion battery is included as well as a charger. Also included is a 16 MB memory card. I wish there was a little built in memory or a larger card had been included for the money. The card technology is either a new one I am not familiar with or a proprietary one - it's called \"XD picture card\". The 'card' is a TINY (about the size of thumbnail).<br />USB is supported (as expected) and you can ussually plug the camera right in and windows (XP and ME) will automatically recognize it as a removeable drive. This is great as you can even use you're camera's memory to carry around or transfer other types of files as well which might be useful in a pinch. It also supports video out so you can view pictures on your TV.<br />Finally there is also a movie mode that lets you take 16 second video clips. The down side is that this is in quicktime format (I would much prefer MPEG or AVI). Another thing is that the length is ALWAYS limited to 16 seconds - even if you have a 128 MB card in there, you can only take 16 second clips... that's just dumb. If I have enough memory why cant I take longer clips? Come on Olympus, release a firmware patch to allow us to take longer clips or use a different video format. There is also no sound, which is a feature that IS present in models made by cannon and Kodak (who provde both built in mics, built in speakers, and the time of your movie clips is only limited to memory restraints). This is a significant drawback if this featureset interests you, but isn't enough to weigh down the rest of the quality present.<br />The interface is also pretty easy to use and supports plenty of features. It's not QUITE as easy as the Kodak DX4330, but most people will find it pretty simple with a minimal learning curve.<br />All in all, this is a GREAT camera. While you're probably going to want to buy a bigger memory card, you'll probably be VERY happy with this as a choice. The only cons are the lack of support for video features - the lack of sound and the time restraints are both unexcusable considering the price.<br />Still I give it a 5 star rating for the quality of construction and the over-all design. Im very happy with this camera, they just need to add sound to the next version. Heck, if they would just release a patch t allow video clips to use MPEG or even just allow us to take longer clips, then I would call this the ONLY CHOICE in digital cameras for the price range.","Wonderful camera, easy to learn, long lasting battery and amazing color and quality!  So small and so convenient to carry around.  I would reccomend this camera to anyone.","I love the size and the look of the camera. It's very compact and look like a million bucks.  I don't usually carry a camera with me at all time. With the size of this camera, I kind of forget that I have it in my purse.  Picture quality is great. This is my first digital camera. I figure if I didn't like it I would just simply return it. I ended up keeping it. The camedia software that comes with the camera is very basic. Nothing much can be done with it except downloading the pictures to the PC...","We received the camera on the eve of our trip to Florida and we were able to learn the basics on the plane.  We just loved its ease of use and styling and quality of pictures taken.  The only drawback I found was not enough memory to hold more good quality pictures.  Hopefully Olympus will improve this feature.","I purchased this camera a couple of weeks ago and couldn't be more happier with it.<br />I bought this camera for its size (small and compact)and I am delighted.  I'm a point and shoot type of guy and love to take photos but hate to carry a camera.  After buying the Stylus 300, I took a 5-day trip to the desert with it in a small carrying case on my belt.  After five days of hiking and climbing, I didn't even know I was carrying a camera on my belt. If you carry a cell phone on your belt, you won't notice the Stylus 300 there.<br />Compared to my previous digital camera (Kodak 4800)this camera is a dream to carry.  In addition, the battery life appears to be much better than the Kodak. I bought an extra battery for the trip and took approximately 150 photos during the five days and didn't run out of battery life.<br />A couple of small gripes.  First, the camera doesn't allow you to date stamp a photo. I like to use the date stamp on occasion and the Stylus 300 won't allow you to do it.<br />Second, there is a setting that allows you to reset the camera's settings when you shut the camera off.  Or you can choose to keep your setting when shutting down.  I would have like to see a chose to lock certain settings and have the camera reset the remaining settings you don't wish to lock.<br />Third, the camera doesn't come with a carrying case.  I bought one for less than $10 that worked fine but an Olympus case would have been nice.<br />However, these are minor issues that do not distract from the overall performance of the camera. I am very happy with the Stylus 300 and would recommend it to those \"point and shoot\" folks that don't like the hassle of carrying a camera around all day.","Pros: Weatherproof with excellent photo quality, Small design, easy to use, excellent resolution, great features, Stylish(cute), metal housing.<br />Cons: Shutter lag is a little slow, No manual controls, Movie mode doesn't have sound, short video length.<br />Summary:  have to admit that this is the only digital camera I've ever owned, so consider all of this novice information. I just went into Best Buy and Curcuit City and asked, \"What is your best compact model?\". Both recomended the same. I purchased this one from CC, along with a 3-year replacement warranty. I figured I would just return it if not completely satisfied. They offer a 30-day no questions deal. I think I'll keep it, though.<br />Picture quality is amazing, both on my television screen or printed via PC. I will never own another 35mm again. I have 2 Olympus SLR's(OM 2000) and 3 lenses. You'll probably see them on Ebay soon. Great cameras, but I just got tired of carrying the units around, which later led me to not using them at all. I was going to purchase a high quality compact 35mm to replace them--glad I waited.<br />Construction seems to be very durable. The entire housing is made of metal and almost has a jewelry-like look to it. It's hard to see in advertisments but the \"OLYMPUS\" logo on the front of the camera is holographic, and changes colors at different angles to the person viewing it.<br />It is sold with a 16MB memory card that stores anywhere from 99 images in the lowest pixel mode, to 6 in the super high quality mode. I noticed they had larger capacity cards at the store, but I wanted to see what I needed before I started purchasing extras.<br />The zoom feature is very nice. The manual says the maximum is \"a maximum of approximately 15X\". This is when optical and digital are combined, however that works.","Awesome camera.  I bought mine right before a trekking trip to the Patagonia.  I used it indoors and outdoors.  The camera took great pictures regardless of the lighting.  The digital zoom is very surprising.  The camera has many settings that one can use to get the best possible picture for each situtation.  The camera can also record short movies.  I would suggest investing in a larger memory card than the one it comes with if you are not going to have access to a computer on a regular basis.","I've had the camera 3 moonths now and I still love it! It is compact, takes great pictures, and easy to use. It took very little time to learn how to use it. If you're looking for a point and shoot digital camera, this is a great choice. I was initially concerned that it only uses a rechargeable battery, but the battery life is surprisingly good. I used it on vacation took 70-80 pictures and still had plenty of battery life left. The compact size is also a plus - can be comfortably carried around in a pant pocket. Compared to other digitals I've tried, the Stylus 300 has a solid, sturdy feel to it. For the everyday photographer, this camera is a great choice.<br />I've had no problems with indoor photos unless trying to take a shot a a great distance.  Picture quality is always excellent unless I don't hold the camera steady. The Olympus software is simple but let's me do everything I've wanted -  e-mail, print, etc.  I rarely used my old film camera,but I carry this camera with me everywhere now. With a 128MB card I snap all the pictures I want with no concern about space.  This is the best toy I've bought in years.","I am very pleased with the Olympus Stylus 300.  I have owned other digital cameras and this one is by far the the best.  Small and compact, lots of features, easy to use and produces high quality photos.  No fumbling around with lens caps with the built in slider.  The camera is weather resistant and has a nice big display for viewing photos.  It is everything I wanted in a digital camera and not overpriced.","This is the first digital camera I have purchased and it is wonderful.  I would recommend this camera to everybody.  The body of this camera is great its small, light and compact and its fits right in your pocket. It also takes great pictures the zoom could be alittle better but its still good.  Easy to use the software installed it the same day I got the camera.  If you want a camera thats small and user friendly than this is the camera for you."]},{"name":"HP Photosmart 945","amazon_reviews":["If you wanted to have a good solid camera, this would be your choice.

You can't really see the pictures very well, and they look nothing like they do on your computer screen or when they're printed out. Also, the body is not very sturdy. I recently dropped this camera and it completely shattered and is now useless. However, if you use it properly, it's a nice little camera. The pictures always turn out well enough for me.","I got this digital camera after having my son last year and it has done well for just getting the BASIC 4x6 photos, though if you dont want a flash, thats too bad cause youll never be able to hold still enough to get a non-blurry (ie:good) picture. The red eye was pretty bad too in alot of photos, though the editing software that comes with is OK at taking the redeye out, though sometimes didnt work there either. Ive also had a few problems w/ the software stopping working and having to \"re-load\" it. I am upgrading this year to  a different brand and more MP.","This was my first digital camera. I bought it because I've had good luck with other HP products, notably printers and a scanner. I will admit price was a major factor in my decision to buy it: $80 after the rebate. So far I haven't been disappointed.<br /><br />The PhotoSmart 435 is gloriously uncomplicated and, I think, rather handsome. It avoids some of the stylistic excesses that clutter up some of its competitors. And it has a few surprising features for a $100 digital camera.<br /><br />At 3.1 MP, the PhotoSmart 435 has a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536, which is enough to create photo-quality 8 x 10 prints. It has a minimum resolution setting of 640 x 480, but I've never used it.<br /><br />The LCD is on a par with other slightly more expensive cameras, and is just large enough to compose pictures and easily navigate menus. In Live View, the LCD records through the lens, rather than the viewfinder. To conserve power, it goes to sleep in a short time.<br /><br />It also has 16M of built-in memory, which allows for up to 13 high resolution photos. You'll probably want to buy a larger memory card. It can take 32M, 64M, or 128M Secure Digital (SD) or Multi Media Card (MMC) cards. The built-in memory is disabled as long as a card is in it. But when you're out somewhere and have filled up your memory card, you can remove it and have 16M of memory again.<br /><br />Since it has no optical zoom (digital zoom is pretty useless), it is limited to snapshots. It does best with outdoor shots anywhere from a few feet to infinity. In fact, it produces surprisingly good pictures under those conditions. It does less well with indoor shots, especially without the flash. It doesn't do close-ups.<br /><br />The accompanying CD includes some useful software - HP's Photo and Imaging software, Memories Disk Creator (Windows and Mac capable), and Hemera's Greeting Card Creator (for Windows only). I didn't install it because it duplicates software already on my iBook.<br /><br />Downloading pictures to the Mac is simplicity itself. Just plug the camera into the USB port, turn it on, and iPhoto opens automatically. There's even an option to erase the pictures from the camera when the download is finished. Turn the camera off and unplug it. Some digital cameras show up in the finder as a drive which has to be ejected before unplugging the camera, but not this one. The camera comes with a dock insert, but I haven't found it necessary to use that either.<br /><br />Power consumption is predictably heavy. It went through the supplied alkaline AAs before I'd taken a dozen pictures. With rechargeable NiMH batteries, it did much better. I use the Monster Cable MB 4-DCRC, sold by Amazon.<br /><br />The PhotoSmart 435 is designed with the amateur photographer in mind, and because of its simplicity, it succeeds. If you accept its limitations and are looking for an easy-to-pocket snap-shooter, you can't go wrong with the PhotoSmart 435.","nice camera that you can get here [...] thanks for read","This camera is awesome. All of the pictures I take come out crystal clear and It doesn't eat up my batteries. And for that women who got a bad one, oh well you should've traded it in for a correctly working one. Mine is great all of the moments I want to catch with my friends come out awesome. I am very smart and I know for the price this camera is selling for on the internet and in stores, it is better than more expensive camera's dollar cameras. My dad uses mine now. That's all.","Takes great pictures, but however it is a little bit expensive and it could use some more memory. 4 stars for PhotoSmart.","The 435 is an excellent camera for its small price. For a 100-dollar-camera, its tools are very useful, and even surprising. It's so easy that even a small child can use it, with no problems. All buttons are well-identified, and all options inside the camera are well-explained. The joystick is well-placed, specially to the right-handed people. Its design's very attractive, too.<br /><br />But the absence of an optical zoom, and the fast spent of batteries, even when it's not being really used, are two camera's problems.<br /><br />If you photograph as a hobby, and don't want to spend a big craze of money in a camera, you can buy it confidently.","this has to be the best(low budget)camera i have ever put my hands on. light wieght, good quality pics, and a nice price.<br /><br />it's such a good camera that sombody stole mine. i got it for<br /><br />b-day and had it 4 days when it was stolen. well if you can hold on to things better then me then this would be a good camera to buy......","Being as this is my first camera, this review goes out mainly to my fellow teens.  Until I bought this thing, I only used disposables, so my thoughts on uqality can be somewhat subjective.  I personally love this camera, it works really well.  The price is great for teens and well in our reach.  The picture quality can be a bit on the bad side sometimes, but you get what you pay for.  I really enjoy this camera and reccomend it to whoever is just gettting started into photography.","This is a great camera.  We got it for our daughter for Christmas (she is 12) and she has thoroughly enjoyed it!  You do need rechargeable batteries, which I thought was no big deal.  We got a charger and 4 batteries for $28 (15 min. charger at that)<br /><br />She enjoys taking video with it.  And you can also add audio clips to each picture which you can listen to on the computer.  She has had a ball doing that.  (She is a budding director)  Picture quality is great for home use.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to anyone who loves to take pictures.","Bought this bundles with the 2175 printer/scanner/copier. So far, I am very satisfied with the purchase for the price i paid. So far, i think the camera is a great value. Only two things i dont like, which are fairly minor: The batteries, like every digitial camera, go real quick and also, i dont like that the shutter is the on/off switch. Otherwise, the HP is a great first digital camera.","I saw my friend had had this camera so i had to get one for myself! The looks of it are so cute and the pictures are great for the price you pay...Just don't let anyone else mess around with it and drop it...it will shatter! I liked it so much that I took it back and just got another one... I think this camera is worth buying...","When i use the camera, it feels really cheap and boxxy. The button feel like toys and the reaction time on the lcd is quiete slow. But when you transfer the pictures onto the comp, it comes out out pretty good. It just he style and feeling of the camera that makes crappy. But overall it will be ok for the average user.","Dollar for dollar some of the best features I have seen. So far I have had it 2 months and LOVE it, really. Great features found on more expensive models like audio, video capture and a digital zoom (versus the old style flick the switch zoom)  For the money I rate it a very good buy.","This is a user-friendly camera, quick as a wink to figure out.<br /><br />Quality pictures. No complicated directions to read. I like<br /><br />the feature of the slide bar over the lens.<br /><br />  I would strongly recommend getting a battery charger kit though, if you plan on using it alot. Worth it.","( Written 11/26/04) OK...this is not the camera to buy if you're trying to win a pulitzer prize...but if you are in need of a cheap camera that does a decent enough job...this one will work...<br /><br />if you get this camera you need to get rechargeable batteries since they will last longer and be cheaper than constantly buying reg. batteries...and always have a spare set of batteries on you...<br /><br />the best thing (other than the price) about this camera is that you don't need to get additional memory...with the lowest quality setting..you will get 171 pictures...granted these are low quality...but if you're like me and only want to send the pics online...then this works fine...<br /><br />the menus are really simple to use and the USB cable works great with my Mac...i've never had a problem transferring pictures to my computer (knock on wood)...i can't rate the included software cause i don't need it with my mac....<br /><br />bottom line...if you find this camera for under $100...then your golden...but it's not worth more than that...i can say that i'm happy with it...it works great for me...<br /><br />Hello again...it's 4/21/06...about 2 years since I bought this camera. And I can tell you it's still working! Granted I would love to get a better camera, but I'm a poor college student so I work with what I've got. I've even dropped it before and it hasn't shattered! In fact I just loaned it to my parents for thier 25th wedding anniversary trip, and they got some great pictures for some wonderful memories! The only down side that really bothers me about the camera, is that when you zoom in, you lose picture quality. Other than that, I have no issues with it! This camera has survived treking around Greece, Poland, college and is still going strong! Like I said before, if you need a CHEAP camera, this one will work for you. Hope this helps! :-)","I have this camera and i just bought a SD 256 SanDisk Card and it didn't work on it, every time i turn on the camera, it has to format the camera and i loose all my photos. In te manual they specify that they didn't test any 256 card....but i did, and dont works.","This camera is a very sleek camera and works great for the price.<br /><br /> Pro's:<br /> Inexpensive<br /> Easy to use<br /> Looks<br /> Nice sized screen<br /><br /> Con's:<br /> SUCKS up the Batteries<br /> The Front slider(which is the On & Off button)<br /><br /> This camera is overall a nice camera for the family or the Real Estate Agent but should'nt be used for enlarging.","This camera has all the features of the big boys at a fraction of the cost and size.<br /><br /> Takes great snopshots<br /> Video/audio is so-so but still fun to play with<br /> Well constructed and has many features<br /> Can be played back on TV which is a plus<br /><br /> I'm really enjoying this camera and have as much fun with it as my brother is with his $800 camera.","I bought the hp 435 as my first digital camera.  It is everything I expected and more.  the picture quality is fine.  I used it on my vacation and the pictures were great. I took over 200 pic on my vacation and have no complaints. It uses batteries fast, but I expected that with a digital camera.  I bought two sets of rechargable batteries so I always have a set charged.  The camera is very easy to use as is the software.  I would recommend it to anyone.","I think the key here is to evaluate your expectations, and this camera meets my expectations and then some.  Seems like some of the reviewers on here are scolding hp for creating a camera targeted at the \"snapshot\" crowd.  If you bought a $25 Forman grill and expected it to do a pig roast you'd be disapointed too.  Look back at the pictures your parents took of you when you were a baby, its likely that the hp435 is a big step up.  I like the ease of use, and the superior printing to the digital camera I bought 5 years ago, and the battery drainage is drastically overdraumatized,  I got aquainted with the new camera on the included batteries and in future plan to use the rechargables i bought with the camera, because again, I EXPECTED IT TO DO THAT.  if you want a magazine cover outcome, keep shopping, but if you want a fun little camera that is surprisingly flexable and has a lot of bang for the buck, you're here.","This camera is great!! I don't see why it gets bad reviews!! You people just must have really, really high-quality taste, like expect it to be god!! This camera has everything!! From black and white pictures, to color recording!! I have printed off several different pics; and they all have came out EXCILLENT!! So, YES!! I would recommend this camera to anyone who has a brain!! This is a great camera, where do you get &quot;-5 stars from??&quot; That is really underexagerating!! You are probably just stuck up!! So, believe me!! This camera is wonderful, and I could, I would give it 10 stars!!","I think this is a REALLLY GREAT CAMERA!! It has everything you need!! Great for everyone!! Perfect for indoors or outdoors! Once it was pitch black at night, and when I went to take a picture, it turned out to look like it was sunny outside! The only problem with this camera, is the fact that the batteries die out fast, but over the years that I have seen other cameras, those ones are no different!! But, yea, this camera is really fun and exciting!!","This printer surpassed all of my expectations.  I had read both biased and unbiased reviews--and some of them left me worried.  However, once we took a few pictures and printed them on the HP PHOTOSMART 145 printer that come with it---we were blown away with the quality.  It definitely meets up to the quality of your local photo processing store.  I would advise anyone thinking about purchasing the HP 435 CAMERA to go through with it.  The features are great, as it allows you to take black and white pictures also.  The 5X zoom is great because it seems to lose no quality.","This is an excellent camera especially for the price. I have gotten pictures at least comparable to my 2 35mm SLRs. It is very compact and easy to use BUT YOU HAVE TO READ THE MANUAL and not simply start taking pictures without knowing what HP recommends.<br />I have sent a number of pictures via email that are as sharp as can be and that is with the lowest of the three quality settings available. Sending the pictures to an email is extremely easy with the excellent software provided with the camera. The Photo Editor feature included in the software works better and easier than an editing program I downloaded from a leading manufacturer<br />I have taken close up pictures in the house that are excellent in detail and color. The outdoor photos are also excellent. When using the zoom feature, I adjusted the \"quality setting\" to the hightest level and got a nice clear picture. It was only on the lower levels that I got the pixilated shots.<br />It is small, fitting easily in my hand or a pocket. I do recommend that you also get an AC power pack as it will recharge batteries in the camera and can be used while transfering images to the computer thus saving battery life. Rechargable batteries are also recommended.<br />Another plus for this camera is that it comes with excellent software. The Photo Editor feature works better and easier than an editing program I downloaded from a leading manufacturer.<br />Perhaps the negative reviews are from photo geeks who have outrageous expectations, but for a normal user, this is a really good digital camera.","You get nice pictures at the daytime, though the digital zoom doesn't help much, When you get used to the light adjusting features at night, you can take decent quality pictures. i had problem when using it on cold temperatures because the camera didn't turn on but after several attempts. This could be the major drawback of the camera, but in summary I recommend it for those who don't need an excellent quality on their pictures. The price tells us that.","Great for outdoor pictures and travel: fast, light and reliable. Pictures taken with flash at night are not great, and tend to a blue tint, but they are pretty decent, you can fix them with Photoshop. This is not a big deal, since practically all the pictures I take with a canon Powershot G2 always need a fix in Photoshop too.<br />It is quite obvious you can't do professional photography with this camera, but if you have to travel, and don't want to risk an expensive digital equipment, this is a great choice. Buy from the start a couple pair of recharchable batteries, because the life of an alkaline in this camera is a joke.","I agree with other reviewers who found this to be a well-priced, but underperforming camera.  I received this camera as a gift, and decided to keep it to supplement at Kodak DX6490.  Of course, there's no comparison in terms of quality and performance (or price), but the standout features of the HP are worth mentioning.<br />First of all, this is a nice pocket camera, except that the sliding lens cover (& power switch) is altogether too easy to open.  On a couple of occasions, I've downloaded pictures of the inside of my jacket pocket.  Other than that, the size is right.<br />The camera runs through batteries like a Suburban runs through gasoline - if you buy this camera, get it with a recharger & several spares.  The battery indicator on my camera is also a little fickle - I don't know that I've every seen it showing a full charge.  Of course, the LCD display can be turned off to conserve battery life, etc., but it really is quite quick to consume juice.<br />The picture quality is excellent for the size and price.  I really have no complaints with the digital zoom's quality, but its performance leaves a lot to be desired.  The digital zoom is slow, and the control is unwieldy.<br />One other irritating feature is the USB port on the side, which is covered by a fairly rigid piece of rubber.  This makes connecting the camera a two-handed operation - and it can be a little bit frustrating to try to connect it in a hurry.  I imagine that the Photosmart dock would be preferable, but my DX6490 came with a dock and I'm not in a hurry to buy another.<br />I haven't used the software yet, since the Kodak software works so well, and iPhoto on my Mac works beautifully with both the Kodak & HP, but the rest of the HP imaging suite (image editor, scanner & print software) works pretty well when it isn't leaking memory (HP has a fix for this, but the download is huge & I can't be bothered ordering the CD).<br />Overall, this is a nice camera to keep in the car, in a pocket, or in a briefcase - but it's not the camera I would choose for challenging or critical photography.","Ok, so I'm no camera expert, but I assume the experts wouldn't be looking at this camera anyway.  This is a cheap camera, that allows you to do a lot with it, considering.  Digital photography is not my field, however I did study photography and understand the importance of image quality.<br />This camera isn't meant for your professional shots, but it's really small, and easy to use, and the pictures come out just fine.  I use the camera mostly to take pictures of my family and friends, and for trips, and have yet to be disappointed.  I haven't missed out on any really important pictures, and I actually managed to catch some really great serial pictures with the speed of the recharge of the flash, while my friends Nikon Coolpix 5400 which is about five times more expensive, took like three seconds longer per shot.  Some pictures do come out blurry, and wierdly tinted, but it's just a gadget and I've seen that happen with the best of 35 mm cameras, and better and more expensive digital cameras.  How many times have you had pictures developed to find that some of your favorite shots didn't come out??  It happens to the best of us.  At least with a digital camera you can see when the pictures don't come out right, and try again.  No gadget is perfect, and without any glitches.<br />I also caught some really sweet videos of my niece, with decent image quality, and the sound was great.<br />The zoom could stand to be a bit less pixelated, but I haven't missed out on any pictures yet for lack of zoom, which is the alternative for a camera this price.<br />The alkaline battery life is ridiculously short, even with Duracell and Energizer super-duper batteries.  But, you can manage just fine with two sets of rechargeable batteries, or Photo Lithium batteries, which have a nice battery life.<br />Overall, I take this camera with me everywhere, it's just that small and light.  Captured some really fun shots of friends, and family, and even some great videos (assuming there is good enough external lighting).  And have even managed a whole day with rechargeable batteries, and longer with photolithium.<br />A cheap, user-friendly camera perfect for travelling, and everyday use.  Nothing too spectacular, but a good priced camera for everday people.<br />If you're looking for optical zoom, and amazing image quality invest the extra money.","I may be the only person who isn't horribly offended by this camera. Personally, I don't see what's wrong with it. Yes, it hogs batteries. You use rechargeables, carry an extra pair, everything's fine. Don't use alkalines; it even says in the manual that alkalines WILL run out faster. I haven't had trouble with the picture quality - indoors or outdoors. In some cases, pictures may have to be touched up on the computer after they're taken. I can accept that - it's a cheap camera. True, the video quality sucks. But who uses a digital camera to take serious video anyway? I've never seen a digital camera take videos that actually look good. I don't see what's wrong with the screen, either. If it moves slowly, it's becuase the picture is constantly being adjusted for exposure time and white balance. When centered on a constant space, it doesn't have this problem. Personally, I think looking through an optical viewfinder will always give you a better idea of what you're taking a picture of than a screen.","I am a lover of Hewlett Packard products! However this is the absolutely most frustrating product I have ever purchased!! It runs through batteries like water! I have spent over $30 in rechargeable batteries in addition to the 2 batteries that comes with the Hp Dock 8886. I purchased a didgital camera to be able to use the LCD view screen but this screen is very blurry!!! Overall for the price it's what's you get.<br />I'd recommend this camera only to some one who is interested in investing in the battery market ...with no return.","After receiving this camera as a Christmas present, me and my husband quickly learned how to use it. (Which is not always easy for my husband to do!) Yes, it is true that the battery life of the camera somewhat stinks, but as long as you buy the rechargeable batteries and the AC adapter- you should be fine. If you are a photo fanatic, with hopes of becoming the next Olan Mills, this camera is not for you. But if you are the average, everyday photogropher, who enjoys taking simple pics of family and friends at a low cost- this camera is definatly for you. Not a bad price for a dependable, little camera, that is also very portable.","I received an HP Photosmart 435 as a Christmas gift this year, totally unexpectedly. I've been wary of getting into the digital camera thing, due to the cost of a decent camera. After a few days of playing around with it, I've come to some conclusions about the 435 that you all might find useful.<br />My photo quality is fairly good, better than what some other reviewers have experienced. It does appear to take better pictures outdoors, but I've had good results indoors, and with the flash. The digital zoom is useless, it results in terrible photos.<br />Some have complained about the LCD screen quality. I haven't experienced any problems. It's a little small, but isn't blurred or otherwise flawed.<br />The 435 is indeed a battery hog, and frankly, that reduces the value of the camera - your $100 or so savings will be going into the corporate pockets of Duracell or Energizer quickly enough.<br />I have a 35mm camera that I adore and plan to keep as my main camera, but it's becoming more and more useful to have a digicam of some kind in this day and age. Given its low cost, the HP 435 is a decent camera, with decent photos. It gets the job done - no more, no less. But if you are looking to buy a camera for yourself and plan to make digital photography your main picture-taking tool, save up a little more money.","This camera is great for those nonprofessionals out there.  It takes great pictures and the movie mode is awesome.  It's very lightweight and easy to use.  For the money and quality you can't beat this HP camera.","this is a great camera that has a lot of pixels and comes at a low price. it is the best digital camera i have ever owned. i have had 5. this is also cool looking","This is a cool looking camera with small size and affordable price. The image quality is amazing and the prints look very professional.<br />Its a perfect camera for most people, don't waste your money or more expensive ones. Get an hp and you won't be disappointed!","HP PhotoSmart 433/435 (same camera, two different model numbers) is a superb 3MP digital camera.<br />Pro's,<br />0. Fits easily in any pocket.<br />1. Feels great in hand, solidly built and looks sexy.<br />2. Picture quality in day light is awesome, average in low light.<br />3. Prints from 3MP come sharp even at 8\"x10\" size.<br />4.

No free prints offer from hp.<br />In short if you are looking for a small, easy to use and reliable digital camera then HP 433/435 is perfect. Its one of the best digital camera's of 2003. Thanks hp!","The HP Photosmart 435 is a fantastic camera.  It has alot of features (5x digital zoom, video cam mode, 3.1MP) and is a great little camera for the price.  First off the 5x digital zoom is a sweet touch, and while using the maximum zoom is not recommended, it still works great up to 3.1x zoom.  Second the video cam mode is awesome nice clarity, and perfect audio qualtity round off a smart addition to the camera.  As far as the picture quality the 3.1MP is EXACTLY as advertised.  I use advanced photo editing software, and speaking from over 4 years of photography experience the photo quality is quite close to 35mm. I can enlarge the pictures to 8x10 with no visable loss resolution.  So, while not the best digital camera on the market today it is the best digital camera out right now for the price.  Oh, and don't forget to buy the docking station.  Directly connected via USB is great, but the with the docking station you can transfer images and video in an instant.","If you're looking for a camera with lots of creature features and super clear pics, look elsewhere.  This is a basic camera, with the right amount of features for the price.  It's a good starter camera, but do not expect to use alkaline batteries with this one.  You WILL NEED 2100mah or better AA NiMH rechargeables.  It does have decent battery life with a set of those, but for all day shooting, I'd recommend carrying at least an extra pair of these batteries.  The software that comes with the camera has good features for a beginner.  If you're looking to do professional pix with this camera...FORGET IT.  If you want something that will take acceptable pictures for digital storage or email, then this camera will fill the bill.  It does decent 640x480 video with audio, with a 256MB SD card, it will give you about 20 minutes (provided your batteries do not run out first).","hp has finally begun to make some cool cameras. hp 435 is an entry level digital camera perfect for those who are new to digital photography.<br />At 3MP its a great and the camera looks veyr (nice). Its small, pocketable and works fast. The image quality is excellent and the shutter lag is minimal. You can even make your movies using it!<br />Once again to summarize the hp 435 is an excellent bang-for-buck camera. Thanks hp!!!","i have tested a few low budget digital cams (kodak cx6200 (awful), HP 620 (bad pictures), canon a300 (also a great cam) and the fujifilm a205 (too much price for what you get) and i don't understand the problems with the quality of the pictures. the hp 435 can make very beautiful and clear pictures, very sharp and colourfull (30bit!). you must have 2100 mah nimh batteries, then you can take a lot of pictures (about 450!!!) with TFT screen turned on.<br />-??????????LCD viewfinder shows everything in yellow and moves in slow motion, so you really don't have an idea of exactly what you are taking a picture of??????????- i think it's a joke or something, my viewfinder is good, good colours and no slow motion.<br />in my opinion the hp 435 is a great cam with great futures and beautiful and very sharp pictures. fast picture taken and video with sounds (it's just for fun).<br />with the 3.14 CCD the 5x zoom is good to use. software is very friendly to use.<br />and the price..........<br />(sorry for my english, I know it's not very good)","The Photosmart 435 is one of the lowest priced 3 megapixel cameras in the market. It combines ease of use, high-quality materials, and diminuitive size with all the features you would come to expect in this price range. One of the nicest features is video recording capability with sound limited only by camera memory.<br />This is an ideal second or spare camera. With the low cost of ownership, you can feel free taking the Photosmart 435 along on those trips where you would think twice taking your $500+ camera. This camera would make a great gift for teenagers and students. Forgo any HP accessories, and just pick up some decent rechargeable batteries and a case.<br />HP created the 435 by omitting the most costly features. What you won't find here are an optical zoom lens and the normal bundled accessories (such as rechargeable batteries, memory cards, cases, AC/DC charging adapters, etc). The Photosmart 435 also sacrifices high-quality imaging in favor of lower cost, so don't expect archival digital images. If you consider the cost of the camera, then the images are more than adequate and well suited for email and web pages.","this is a really sexy little camera.  hp's nicest looking attempt at digital photography, this lil guy looks far more expensive than he really is.  however, the HP name is not synonymous with image quality. when compared with canon's 3.2mp a300, the hp 435 may look like its competition, but it won't act like it.  on best mode, there's really no comparison in quality - the canon wins hands down.  however, for the price, and ease of use, this HP wins.<br />Pros:<br />-one sexy camera<br />-lightweight<br />-looks like it cost $500<br />-fast shutter speed<br />-long movie clips w/ sound<br />-2 second bootup time<br />-USB storage device mode<br />-battery life is decent<br />-white balance/ev compensation<br />-software is a no brainer<br />-inexpensive<br />Cons:<br />-3-4 second image processing time on best mode<br />-digital zoom is useless<br />-image quality could use improvement<br />if you're considering the hp 320, spend a lil more and get this camera instead.  if you're considering the more expensive canon a300, then get that because the quality is there.  the hp 435 is your basic point and shoot camera with decent quality dressed up in a sexy outfit.  it gets 4 stars because its sexy! but image quality is a 3.  so in reality, this camera is a 3.5.","this is a really sexy little camera.  hp's nicest looking attempt at digital photography, this lil guy looks far more expensive than he really is.  however, the HP name is not synonymous with image quality. when compared with canon's 3.2mp a300, the hp 435 may look like its competition, but it won't act like it.  on best mode, there's really no comparison in quality - the canon wins hands down.  however, for the price, and ease of use, this HP wins.<br />Pros:<br />-one sexy camera<br />-lightweight<br />-looks like it cost $500<br />-image quality is pretty good<br />-fast shutter speed<br />-long movie clips w/ sound<br />-2 second bootup time<br />-USB storage device mode<br />-battery life is decent<br />-white balance/ev compensation<br />-software is a no brainer<br />-inexpensive<br />Cons:<br />-3-4 second image processing time on best mode<br />-digital zoom is useless<br />-image quality could use improvement<br />if you're considering the hp 320, spend a lil more and get this camera instead.  if you're considering the more expensive canon a300, then get that because the quality is there.  the hp 435 is your basic point and shoot camera with decent quality dressed up in a sexy outfit.  it gets 4 stars because its sexy! but image quality is a 3.  so in reality, this camera is a 3.5."]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE G500","amazon_reviews":["I have the Minolta Dimage G400.

The only time I have had issues is if the camera is in night mode and there's ANY movement.  You almost need a tripod or you'll get streaks of light in your pictures from the movement.

I bought is two months ago and have taken hundreds of pictures with ease and great clarity.  I definitely recommend this camera.","I can't say enough about this camera. I researched a load of models before buying it and have had no regrets. I've used Minolta film cameras for years and the G500 is a great addition for anyone. The 5 megapixels are astounding. I took a quick snapshot of a flower in my wife's garden and it came out looking like it could be on a poster or calendar.<br />The only feature I wish they had was a better battery meter. The one it comes with isn't precise enough to give you an accurate estime of how much battery time you have remaining. With that said I purchased a 256 meg memory card and can store more images then I know what to do with.<br />It's also incredibly small but very solid feeling. Yes the metal case gets fingerprints on it but so what? You can easily remove them with a cloth. One issue I have had to adjust to was the lens cover which slides to the right side of the camera and being right handed my fingers tend to cover the lens as it extends from the camera. I would occasionally brush the lens and leave a fingerprint it but I learned to open and avoid leaving smudges.","The DiMAGE G500 is a stylish and versatile camera, packing high-quality 5 megapixel images and powerful imaging controls in a compact body. The G500 can be easily slipped into a pocket, purse, or fanny pack. And weighing a mere 7 ounces, this camera will not be a burden, even on long backpacking trips.<br />Despite its small size, the DiMAGE G500 is packed with great image-making features. The camera gice the photographer total creative control.  Color saturation, contrast, and sharpness can be controlled to create the picture you want. You can shoot full manual, aperature priortiy, shutter priority, or use the program modes.  And a maximum 9X zoom ratio (3x optical, 3x Digital) provides powerful photographic potential.  The lens is equivalent to a 39mm - 117mm zoom on a 35mm camera.  Both Memory Sticks and SD Cards can be used alone or in combination. When both memory card types are used in the camera at the same time, up to 640MB of data can be saved depending on the capacity of the cards.  The camera has a fast start up time, so you won't miss the great shots, and even has a macro mode.  You won't be dissaponted.","Beautiful, compact camera by Minolta, recently purchased at Amazon.com<br />I'm very happy with the purchase. This is my first digital camera, and I've never thought it's going to be so easy to use and operate.<br />Pros:<br />Great picture quality, good battery life, good value for your money.<br />Can't bid the $30 credit, when you pay with the new Amazon credit card.<br />Cons:<br />Not enough of the memory. You'll be needed to add more memory at some point.<br />Plus, you definitely should buy a carrying case.","One of the worst low light focusing i've encountered. As to the \"lowest price of the season\" that Amazon claims, actually is one of the highest at $339. I got mine 4 months ago $312 at Buydig.com and currently sells $290 elsewhere although it seems discontinued. Pity for Amazon used to have better prices.","There are few things a good digital camera should have. First is that it should be small so that it's easy to carry and occupy little space of your purse/backpack. You wouldn't want to have a huge digital camera to carry around. Secondly, it got to be light. You will be too lazy to carry your digital anywhere you want to take pictures of if it is heavy. Some digital camera's flash light is not bright enough. There's no point of having a high resolution digital camera if the flash light is too dim. It won't be able to take any good quality picture under limited lightings. Therefore thirdly it has to have bright far distance flash light. Fourth, the starting time and shutter time has to be fast. Sometimes the pictures you're required to take constantly in motion therefore you would like your camera to start up fast and take down the picture fast. You would miss some precious moments if a camera starts up slow. Some pictures you took will be smired if the shutter is not fast enough. Lastly, a high resolution camera is always the best and this cute little, light, bright, fast and clear Minolta Dimage G500 5MP digital camera has it all. It is so small that you can use a small cellphone carry bag to carry it around (which I did). It is light that you won't be lazy to carry it around with you all the time. Its flash light is so bright that you can take a beautiful birthday cake picture in the entire darkness (which I did). Its starting time and shutter time are so fast that it's rarely I missed out any precious moment I want to take picture of. It has 5 mega pixels... what else can you ask for?! GET IT!","Guys:<br />I just bought it from Amazon think that they should have better price but find out that Newegg's price much better with free shipping also. Hope Amazon will drop their price soon.","This is a great camera.  Very easy to download into the computer. Takes great, clear pictures.  Nice size.  Durable.","I have been looking to buy a digital camera for myself, and read the reviews for several cameras. I have narrowed the selection down to Canon s400, s50, sd100, Olympus stylus 400, and the Minolta G500. The Minolta G500 appear to be a great buy comparing to the other brands. However, as I searched the web for info on minolta cameras, I found out that the two companies Konica and Minolta merged last year, and Minolta assumed the brand name for all digital cameras produced by Konica. In comparing the Konica KD-500Z and Minolta G500, I found the two to be almost identical. So I am asking the abvious question here, did Minolta simply repackage the KONICA Digital Revio KD-500Z and marketed it under G500. I also read the review on KONICA Digital Revio KD-500Z, and it came out average. I would appreciated if someone has an answer.","The Camera is small and easy to handle. The picture is as sharp and clear as it gets. The operation is simple. The finished product is beyond satisfaction. I am thrilled that I chose this camera, it is the optimum for me.  Brand new from the amazon store, well packaged and a state of the art camera: The lens opens quickly without a hitch, The zoom lens is well protected. Turning the camera on and off is easy. The price is competive and affordable, I feel I got more value than I paid. The assessories such as the usb cable and battery charger, Disc etc. makes it so easy to put the pictures on your PC, and charging is simply a breeze.  The camera can be placed in your pocket for taking pictures at your leasure. Does Well In dark areas because of the built in flash. I am so glad I went with the 5 megapixils, there is no comparison for me. Again I am beyond pleased with this great deal, at a great price. There are so many features to this Digital Camera that are very useful, I suggest you read and see for yourself.  Thank you amazon for selling this quality product!!!","I used to have the oplympus stylus camera, and it was quite disappointing.  Most of my pictures were blurry!  Now, I am using this camera, and most to all my pictures are fantastic!  I increased the exposure setting, and got even clearer/brighter pictures at night indoors!  The flash helps the macro for more detailed & finer shots. This camera has a few main menus that lead to many options.The macro is great at 3mp & 5mp (there's no 4mp option).  This camera takes both SD & memory stick!  The only complaint is that the battery isn't long lifed, but just enough.  The strap is long to wear around the neck & take pictures at the same time without worrying about the dropping the camera or losing it.","I just got this camera this month and I love it.  I have another Minolta digital as well (good quality) and this one is small, you can fit it into a pocket, its lightweight, easy to use and navigate the menu, battery life seems to be good, and it has a quick start up so you don't miss opportunities waiting for it to be \"ready\".  You can also snap a few shots in a row without much delay at all. Takes great quality photos, the 30 second video is great for quick shots of the kids when they say \"Look at me!\"","I picked this camera up for my wife's use and as a general purpose point and shoot. It's small size, good resolution, and ease of use appealed to me and I'm not disappointed. The camera has a solid weight and feel to it. As a bonus the rechargeable battery seems to have a good capacity. Pictures have good color. Red eye even with reduction pre flash was sometimes a problem. This camera also has a hard focus that brings out every pore in your subject. I found myself sometimes applying some softening in image editing. I used Corel Photo-paint for editing instead of the included (basic) software. I haven't used the 30 sec. video or audio recording features.<br />The one unforgiveable negative is the tiny 16MB memory card included (only holds about 6 best quality images). A camera with this kind of resolution should have a memory card bundled with it that holds at least 24-36 images (64MB). I purchased a 256MB SD card with a more than adequate 100 image capacity.<br />I found the kiosks at some discount stores great for prints @ 29¢ for a 4x6. I haven't tried any larger prints yet.<br />Overall a good buy.","The comments of the reviewers led me to purchase this camera, and I was very pleased with the camera and its results. The colors are stunning, the depth of focus is nothing short of amazing. The finest resolution photos occupy approximately 2 megs of space on the SD card. The menus are intuitive. Transfering photo files to your computer is a snap, first time, every time. Even after the technology inevitably becomes outdated, this camera is destined to become a display piece on your shelves. It really is a beautiful design. If another 1/4 inch had been taken from its thickness, it would be a true work of art. The elegant leather Minolta G500 case, sold separately, is a must to protect the exquisite finish.","I am using this 5 megapixel camera for about 1 week. My thorough research of review sites (the best is [...]) convinced me that I should go with DiMAGE G500 and I was not disappointed. Everything seems to work very well: the pictures are sharp in various conditions, color rendition is accurate (although somewhat on the cool side; try to play with white balance), it is easy to use and the resolution is great. On the latter aspect, follow Minolta instructions in the manual and you will be pleased with the results. The biggest file size is about 1.5 MB, which is quite all right with modern computers. Awesome sharpness, depth of focus and detail! Red eye for me is always a huge problem since my pupils are naturally dilated. However, at point blank range the flash with red eye reduction produces very nice pictures with only a slight red visible. The pictures are best viewed in QuickTime viewer; Photoshop darkens them a lot. However, simply tweak brightness and contrast and it will be OK. Did not have a chance to try the supplied DiMAGE viewer software. The learning curve is short when you print the 127-page manual (only supplied as pdf. file; customer service also a problem) as it has all you need and provides nice recommendations. When buying more memory, consult Minolta compatibility chart ([...] Not all cards are created equal; to avoid problems with bigger memory, use Panasonic or Toshiba SD cards. Do not buy a card reader since the camera connects seamlessly to a USB computer port and all works well. I did not care that much about fingerprints although they are in fact all over the place. Overall, I am very impressed with ease of use, style, size and (!) picture quality and can heartily recommend this little pocket-size gem. Lately (2 months use), I got some disappointment about the viewfinder and saw the same complaint in another review. On wide angle, the lens side becomes visible in one corner of the viewfinder, which I have to use in bright sun (initially thought it was a defect). Also, there is a big discrepancy between the picture sizes in the viewfinder and on the screen. Fortunately, the screen picture is bigger so try to use it as much as you can.","Minolta recently released their DiMage G500 5.0 mega pixel digital camera after their merge with Konica. The G500 is one of the first products introduced by the merged Konica Minolta duo. Offering a fairly compact and lightweight design, and a fast startup, this camera shows potential. Konica Minolta has combined design aesthetics as well as enhanced functionality to bring the user a good quality product. With a startup just just over a second and great capture quality, this camera is a great buy! (full review @ bytesector.com)","I've used the Fugi FinePix S1 Pro, Nikon Coolpix, and Minolta Dimage 7i.<br />This camera will suit your purposes well if you:<br />1. want to shoot on the fly using automatic controls<br />2. have a steady hand (as shutter priority doesn't exist)<br />3. require a compact camera<br />4. you want 8x6 prints<br />5. don't want to pay a lot, esp. since better cameras will be out in a couple of years (as technology goes...)<br />6. you would be willing to sacrifice a few extra features for a good all around shooter<br />The color is really good on this camera- other cameras have had a problem capturing a good red. However for the picky, the optical lens could be of better quality.<br />If you like to have a decent amount of manual control, I would say try the Dimage 7i- which has a lot more features, but a low battery life.  That camera also has a better menu. The cost is twice as much.<br />I wanted this camera to just have good quality images I can use to compose into composited art photo stuff. Not pro portaits.  This camera has a high enough resolution to crop out things you don't want to use while still retaining a large, good quality image.<br />Its a great value and I would recommend it to any family for general purpose use.<br />And as a tip, if you are shooting somewhere and run out of media card space, you can take your digital media card to many Walgreens stores, where they now have a Kodak Digital Picture station that will burn your raw images to a CD-Rom for about $4.00.  That way you can go out and reshoot immediately without erasing too many images- you can worry about deciding what to print once you're back home.<br />The Kodak machines read all formats: SD, CompactFlash, CD-ROMS, Smartmedia, Memory sticks, etc.","The Konica kd500z is the same camera.  Minolta and Konica are one company now with the merger.  I have used the camera for several weeks, finding that the pictures obtained were great.  The zoom was great when capturing images, was even able to use the movie feature to capture realtime video of kayaker flipping in the rapids.  No loss of resolution.  I consistently use the 1600 X 1200 mode, and have used the higher settings.  The images are spectacular, on the PC monitor, was obtain to enlarge images to view the smallest details.  I waited 6 months to buy a digital.  Glad I waited!","This is a great point & shoot digital.  It is very small, fits in your pocket.  The lens cover is very convenient.  It takes great pictures at 5 megapix.  Start up time and time between pics is very fast.  The movie made allows you take 30sec audio/vid clips which is very cool and convenient and they come out great.  Its nice for those times when you don't have / or dont feel like getting your camcorder out.<br />My only issue is the red-eye - which seems to happen on all small point and shoots.  Most photo software packages allow you to zap out the redeye pretty effectively with the click of a mouse - so it's not a big deal.<br />Battery life is awesome.  I've taken about 15 vids and 100 pics and the battery indicator still reads full-charge; and I always the display (not the viewfinder).  My old camera used to chew through 4 AA's after some 30 pictures.<br />I was going to get the canon s40 which is very comparable but the price is better on this + its 5 megapixle + there is a 25$ credit towards memory card upgrade. You'll need to get a bigger mem card.","This 5 megapixel camera delivers stunning detail, and has more accurate and vivid color than any other camera I've owned.  The camera is very small, has a startup time of about a second, and is the best value out there right now.  I compared this camera to the Canon S400 and its competitors, and the decision was easy.","This camera is very compact and will easily fit in a shirt-pocket.  The 5MP resolution is astounding in such a fun little camera.<br />The software included is a little sparse, but useable.","There are a couple of other cameras that rank right next to the g500 in features, size and quality. But they rank $150-200 higher in price. There ends some of the debate.<br />It's usability and the final product (in this case, the pictures) that attest to the thought that goes into a gem like this. All control butons are well-placed, and clearly defined. The interface is very intuitive - you'll be shooting away long before you have to turn to the cd-rom manual (thankfully - would it be so costly to provide a printed book?) The default settings on this camera are excellent - but if we must, there are manual choices available.<br />My tip on that long strap: adjust the slide to create a wrist length, knot the cord above that and cut it off. As for a case, I'm using a neat leather cell phone case for a \"flip\" type phone. There are lots of them around: carry the camera with you and try some out till you get one that fits.Or maybe a vintage cigarette pack slip case.<br />Utlimately, this is a beautiful camera with features (like 5mp) that belie it's easy to handle price.","i've researched Canon 400S Elph, Sony Cybershots, Minolta F100 - all that jazz (see dpreview.com, cnet.com and steves-digicams.com for thorough reviews) and nothing pocketable held up to this Minolta G500 (Olympus left out for consistently poor image quality and construction).  Why is the G500 the best?<br />For starters, 5MP vs. 4 - not always the main concern, but it's easily the finest 5MP in its price range.  Sure, Sony has some new 5MPs out that are only about $50 more (although the ones as small as the G500 are around $100 more)  but they feel cheap, have inferior reviews, and lack the picture quality of this Minolta.  The only real competition for high-res digicams that are highly-pocketable is the Canon Elph 400S, but this Minolta is at least comparable in every respect, and of course it has 25% more megapixels.<br />Makes fun camera shooting sounds when you snap pics.  Gorgeous displays and intuitive controls.  Quick and easy... start-up with cool green light on front.  Zoom very quick - zips open and shut.  great weight to it - not too heavy by any means, but feels solid in your hands - nice ergonomics.  I spent $350 - nothing else around that price point compared.  Buy it.  Peace!","I hightly recommend this camera for someone who wants a small, easy to use, fast responding camera.  Very solid feel and good quality output.  I wanted something small and simple that took good pictures.  After going through several other cameras, this is it.","I've owned 4 different digital cameras in the last few years, but this is the first one that I'm in love with.  Compact, light-weight, 5 MP, brilliant screen, ultra-stylish, easy to use, and takes two types of memory (SD and/or Memory-Stick). Add to that the nifty green light bars on front which zoom back and forth when it turns on (reminiscent of a certain talking car from an 80's tv show) How cool can you get?<br />Few things to note.  The strap that comes with this camera is about 18 inches long...way too long for my tastes.  The included memory is a very stingy and virtually pointless (in my opinion anyway) 16 MB.<br />So far the only really bad thing about this camera has been my difficulty in finding a case that isn't too big.  I've tried everything from a pda case, to a mp3 player case, to a small camera case and they're all too big and bulky for this little beauty."]},{"name":"Kyocera Finecam L4V","amazon_reviews":["I have owned a Kyocera L4V for 2 years now.

I considered the Olympus Stylus 300/400 but didn't care for some of the reviews and the kind of batteries they use (I'm a rechargeable AA fan). What I read on the Optio 33WR was impressive, it has more mode features than I'll probably use (even a specialty mode for fireworks!) Although not quite as easy to use as the Kodak 6330 I feel this is offset by the extra features of the Optio 33WR. Since the Optio 33WR is \"immersible\" it *should* be able to handle rain and splashing from white water rafting and other water sports (I'll find out the hard way next summer) which greatly appeals to me.

A docking bay w/battery charger for downloading photos would be nice and very convenient, I can't locate the optional AC adapter *anywhere*, a *slightly* more powerful flash (adequate as is) would be good, the power on/off button is a little too close to the shutter release for my comfort and the camera strap can dangle in front of the lens/flash when holding the camera at 90 degrees for more vertically oriented shots.

However, it requires hi-speed memory to achieve 30fps and the SanDisk 512Mb Ultra II will provide 7.5 minutes of movie recording time at 640x480@30fps.

After much research and agonizing compromises, I waited and purchased this Pentax Optio 33WR.  It is small, but fits my small hands well. All the controls are nicely defined and laid out. I began using the camera prior to consulting the manual because the camera is logically engineered. The manual is well done and thorough, and Pentax also spells out the accompanying ACDSEE software - not needed if you own a Mac. You can also download the manual and specs for this and many Pentax cameras directly from Pentax's doc site - free, prior to purchase if you want to study this.  The specs available are quite accurate.  Output is great! Sharp lens, fast focus, accurate exposure, and it fits in my pants pocket.  It has a lot of flexibility for a P&S and a fair number of manual features if you need them.  Nicely sealed, all weather unit. solid feel! Lots of positives! Negatives are: Came with 2 inexpensive alkaline batteries instead of lithium versions -  I replaced them, but one can find power for this camera anywhere.  The camera comes with an 16MB SD memory card which is good for about 8-10 hi-res pix, so I replaced it with a 64MB version ($34).

I'm not expecting Nikon or Canon 35mm camera body responsiveness, but the F300's sluggishness removes some of photography's capture-the-moment joy.<br />I have become addicted to the convenience of previewing and sharing photos with a digital camera, but if I had to do it all over again I'd buy a nimbler 5 megapixel digital camera.","Compact size. great quality picts. Can't fit many at hi-res setting on the 32 MB card so I suggest getting an additional memory card with at least 128 or 256MB. But over all i've been very happy with this cameral and it's fun and easy to use. Two thumbs up!","the minolta dimage f300 is a solid camera but there are a few complaints that lead to this 4 star rating: no AF assist light, noisier images than competition, a slow moving lens, and all but useless TIFF mode (takes too long to save).<br />pros:<br />- 5MP resolution and 3X optical zoom.<br />- good photo quality, very sharp images.<br />- LCD on top of camera displays essential info (very rare in this camera class) - to be truly useful though, this should have included shutter speed and aperture.<br />- subject tracking autofocus performs well.<br />- good color balance.<br />- full set of manual controls - aperture/shutter priority, manual exposure, manual focus.<br />- intuitive user interface plus simple menu system.<br />- wide ISO sensitivity range for a compact (ISO 100 - 800).<br />- good macro performance.<br />- solid build quality, aluminium body.<br />- good shot to shot times.<br />- selectable AF points, reasonable AF speed.<br />- tracking AF workings for slow moving high contrast subjects.<br />- USB connectivity.<br />- non-proprietary AA batteries used.<br />- automatic lens cover.<br />- small and light: 4.4\"W x 2.1\"H x 1.3\"D, weighing 7.8oz.<br />cons:<br />- more noise in images than competition.<br />- no auto focus assist light - makes focusing in low light difficult, if not impossible.<br />- slow moving lens - over 3 seconds to go from wide to telephoto!<br />- slow moving lens leads to slow startup time.<br />- shutter lag is noticeably worse than competition.<br />- noticeable barrel distortion from lens at wide angle.<br />- default tonal balance leads to lost shadow detail, clipped highlights.<br />- no flash power control.<br />- only TIFF format is supported, if you prefer RAW format, look elsewhere.<br />- saving a TIFF file means a virtual camera shutdown for about 30 seconds!  this is a deal breaker for me.<br />- metal case scratches easily.<br />- doors for memory and battery feel flimsy.<br />- the included 32MB memory card is inadequate; be ready to shell out additional $$ for more memory.<br />as already mentioned, the f300 is a competent camera that is compact and quite stylish.  if you don't plan to use the TIFF mode, the long save time is a non-issue.  the shutter lag is troublesome though and the lack of an AF assist light is annoying.  nevertheless, this camera has a lot going for it and is worthy of consideration.  in the end, i would recommend the canon s50 over this.<br />i hope this helps your purchasing decision.  peace.","You guys convinced me to get this camera last week, and I'm very happy with it.  There are so many features that they will please everyone in the family, from kids to pro wannabe's.  It's image quality is superb!  I compared with Canon and Sony and while those were also *great* cameras, they don't offer as much value and \"fun factor\" as the F300, so I think I made a totally right choice.  I also want to thank Minolta for choosing the 2 AA battery path; it really saves a lot of money down the road because prop Li-ion batteries are real costly, and they die after 8-14 months.<br />IN a nutshell, this is a highly enjoyable camera.  No more film photography for me!","After weeks of research, online and in stores, I picked up the F300.  What drew my money in the end were 5 megapixels (5.3 on CCD but 5 efective), fast and bright LCD viewfinder, highly rated picture quality, 3x optical and 4x digital zoom, and finally, the ability to use AA batteries.  On this last point, the F300 only needs 2 AA batteries, but you must use the NIMH type, which can last a long time and are real cheap at Walmart, etc.  Minolta throws in a lithium battery, which cannot be charged, but lasts forever.  And they give you 4 AA NIMH so you get two sets to rotate through, very thoughtful of them indeed. So power shouldn't be a problem. Picture taking is as easy as turning the knob to \"automatic\", point and shoot.  There are tons of controls if you are so inclined, but the automatics do a great job for me. The elongated shape makes the camera easy to take out of the free case and to hold, another browny point for Minolta.  Zoom lens is a bit slow, that's my only gripe.  Overall the VERY BEST value for a 5MP digital camera that does not compromise quality and convenience at all.  A total winner.","Camera is easy to use. The battery life has been plenty long enough for me. I took photos in the 2 highest JPEG resolutions with 2 different compressions and all looked great when I had them printed out at [local store]. They have a computer you stick the memory card into and then the one hour department processes them. They came out in a matte finish(default I guess) and you can't tell the difference from a 35mm camera unless you're a professional photographer maybe. Printing at home is fine and looks good but not as good as the store. Plus it's more expensive at home with ink and paper costs. $0.27 each at [local store]. I highly recommend this camera.","I own the mighty Dimage 7i, which for my money is still the best 5MP camera out there. But the 7i requires a lot of support and accessories to lug around. I needed a little camera for those unexpected opportunities or places where I really don't want to advertise I have a camera with me.<br />My first solution was the very good Canon Powershot A200 which I have reviewed favorably. The biggest problem is that once you get used to the bigger formats that higher MP brings, 2 MP gets real old, real fast. So when Minolta came out with this 5MP point and shoot with a reasonable price, I sold the Canon and bought the F300.<br />First this camera has a lot of features and controls. But it is not a Dimage 7. The F300's controls are less intuitive and clunkier owing to its small size. Secondly, the lens cannot compete with the 7. But again this is basically a souped-up point and shoot. It is designed for the automatic modes.<br />My advice is to forget the contols and rely on photo-editing software. At the larger image sizes you have plenty of opportunity to edit without picture degradation.<br />This is a wonderful addition to my camera bag.","After having the F100 and loving it I just HAD to upgrade.  This camera builds on the many great features of the F100 and adds a few new ones.  I find picture quality to be truly outstanding.  I will admit that almost all small digicams have tiny, underpowered flashes and the F300 is no exception.  I use an auxiliary flash when taking pictures inside a large room.  Full auto and fully manual and everything in between.  There are so many features you can do almost anything with this camera.  Bottom line - nothing compares with the F300 at the price you can buy it for.","I've been testing the F300 for a client and am happy to report this is one excellent digital camera. First of all it's an *affordable* 5+ megapixel digital camera that doesn't exhaust your retirement savings. Second, it sports top-notch picture quality, with well-saturated colors and well-defined clarity. (Fuji's cameras still have the \"best\" color richness.) Then there are tons of features for the geeky type to play with. 3X optical zoom works smoothly, and as you can see from the product photo it's the traditional telescoping type, not the periscoping kind on the X series. Battery life is about average, which is to say \"not bad\" for a 5+ megapixel camera.<br />The most amaing thing is the number of manual controls Minolta pakcs in with the F-series, which will make every SLR enthusiast at heart leap in joy.  I didn't play with the manual controls much except the aperture mode, but I think if you want a digital camera with every imaginable manual adjustment you can think of, Minolta's F-series is the only product line that gives you this power.<br />If you want a dependable digital camera, the F300 deserves a very serious look, and perhaps your next paycheck.  (Update: since I first wrote this brief review the F-series has been getting rave editorial reviews from \"professional\" reviewers.  Hence I'm getting one myself when my next paycheck arrives.)<br />Update (9/10/03): The original review was written in May, not long after the F300 came out as successor to the highly acclaimed Dimage F100 3MP camera.  Now I'm a proud of owner of an F300, I want to add some additional comments.<br />Starting last month Minolta added four NiMH AA batteries with a 16-hour compact charger, a case, and a bonus CD-ROM to the original camera kit, and also upgraded the included SD memory to 32MB (from 16MB).  This move boosted the F300's value and competitiveness against other cameras in this class.  Amazon now also has a great price, which makes the F300 cheaper than its competitors from Canon and Sony.  The camera itself is made in Japan and exhibits the highest level of build quality.<br />Minolta's user's guide is the best I've seen in a long time.  Printed on nice paper and written clearly, it comes in only English, so you don't have to pay for a user's guide in Spanish or French.  Lots of high-quality illustrations, and they use a big font.  I wish every manufacturer would print their manuals like this.  A+!<br />The best features of the F300 are (1) 5.3 megapixels for a great price, (2) lots of manual controls -- great for prosumers, (3) easy control - unlike Canon, Minolta makes it easy for you to adjust resolution and compression level, (4) uses 1 CR-V3 lithium non-rechargeable battery, or 2 AA NiMH batteries, to achieve good battery life -- and NiMH batteries are dirt cheap nowadays.  In short, this is a powerful camera with lots of likable features, plus excellent image quality, in a compact, carry-anywhere package.<br />My wish list for Minolta: increase the optical zoom power!  3X is standard, but you guys can win over even more buyers if you go to 5X or 6X.  It can't be hard for you guys, can it?  :)","The images I can produce on this camera in its plethora of manual modes is amazing.  The controls are fast and intuitive.  It's in the same class as the Canon G2 and other \"pro-sumer\" cameras - full manual features, large CCD.  The only thing it (and others) lacks is a professional class lens.  I'm absolutely happy with it, but if I were to object:<br />The camera works best indoors with a tripod (which I have) because the ISO 400 mode generates too much noise.  Outdoors this isn't a problem, but night photography seems to suffer a tad.<br />Battery meter only has \"full, warning and shutdown\" so it's hard to tell how far you can go.  I use up my 2 NiMHs in 40-50 shots, including post-view of the shots.<br />I wish the movie mode also had a time lapse mode (where you can set the time), because it's just something to add to software.  This would make the camera so much more functional.<br />The autofocus indicator works well, but it's sometimes hard to get focus on indoor portraits.","I recently purchased this camera, took it out for a few detailed 'spins', and -- discouraged -- am sending it back.  While I'm aware that I could have taken advantage of the bevy of manual controls to improve the look of my photographs, I was disheartened to see average-to-poor results from shooting in the default \"Auto\" mode, particularly when shooting at 5MP in dimly lit situations.  Admittedly, these sort of circumstances are pushing the limits for any compact-or-smaller digicams, but I still expected better from the F300.  For more details, reviews, and sample galleries, I encourage you to check out Epinions, MinoltaF300, and other dotcom sites that offer rich perspectives on the F300.  I just wish I had bought this camera direct from Amazon -- then I wouldn't be having so many problems in trying to send it back :-(","After much research, I decided to purchase the F300 because I was looking for more than just a \"point and shoot\" digital camera.  The F300 offers a good balance between manual control and point and shoot or any combination of the two.<br />Most reviews I read (and Minolta's website, of course) said the camera's buttons ,menus, and function were very \"intuitive\";  while this is true for the Auto mode, I did have to read the directions for quite a few things--and the directions were not always that clear (see p. 68 then 73 then 54) but I managed to blunder my way to what I wanted after a few minutes of button- pressing.<br />The software that comes with the camera is cruddy compared to my Photoshop and luckily I didn't have to rely on Minolta's software.  I have a Mac, though, so maybe the software looks/functions better on a real computer.<br />You'll definitely have to get more/ 256 MB SD memory cards since the 32 MB one provided only holds one high-quality picture ( I'm guessing you want a 5 mp camera in the first place because you want  many good pictures).  The photo quailty is really excellent in many modes and this camera is great at noise reduction.<br />Lastly, I know this is supposed to be a product review, but kudos to Amazon for not skimping on the accessories and trying to sell off things separately!  Everything was included that the mfr recommends and everything was shipped to me EIGHT DAYS EARLY!!"]},{"name":"FujiFilm FinePix A205 Zoom (FinePix A205s)","amazon_reviews":["Works great","Our toddler loves this camera.

It's not as easy to work & figure out as a Kodak Easyshare, but still, it's not that bad.  The colors aren't as vibrant as Kodak's, but again, it's not that bad.  The color LCD screen is a little faded & orangy, but when the photo is taken, the photo on the screen is brighter & more true-to-color.  The video is rather grainy, so I wouldn't rely on the camera for video purposes.  I didn't try the software....I was able to plug the camera into my computer & upload pics straight to my computer without the software.  That was neat.  There is a loooong lag time between shots.  It runs on alkaline batteries pretty well.  The macro setting works well, and the zoom is good.  Overall, this camera is dated & not very fancy, but it serves its purpose fairly well.  If you want the latest & greatest, this camera is not for you.  But, if you want to just take everyday pictures & don't care about too much fancy stuff, then this camera should be fine.","The A205 is easy to operate and renders sharp images for web or prints. The case is bulky by todays standards, but I use a tripod mostly.

I find the viewfinder and recharging/download cradle very convenient, I wish my other Fuji camera had them. A205's can be found for as little as $30 today. I have had no problems at all with it.","I bought this camera brand new in late 2003 to become more \"modern\".  I didn't really need a digital camera, but I wanted one.  Now, more than 4 years later I have thousands of pictures on my PC that are priceless.  The camera finally died 2 months ago and I've replaced it with a 10 MP Nikon Coolpix.  Although this camera is now considered bulky by today's standards, and the LCD screen is now considered tiny (1.5\") I can't just toss this camera away.  It's served me very well the last few years, so I guess it'll just take up drawer space.  It's taken excellent pictures, but it took a little getting used to.  To focus on anything, you have to press the button down \"half-way\".  Try saying that to someone who's not used to digital cameras.  Most of the blurry pictures occured because of that.  Want to take pictures of your kids playing sports?  Faggedaboutit!  Action shots come out blurry.  Not enough light?  You'll get grainy pics.  Like to take videos?

Works fine for my use and I don't need to spend a lot of money just for a higher megapixel camera.","I have absolutely enjoyed this camera. It has delivered more than I ever expected. It produces wonderful crisp clear pictures, and is so simple to use. It has lasted me 3 years of wear and tear, with MINOR cosmetic damage. I have dropped it more than 100 times, it's been through water damage, when I'd take it w/me on trips and my water bottle leaked...oops! This is a great product, has minor issues now and then, nothing a restart won't fix!  There were only a few downsides to it, the zoom isn't huge, but it worked well enough for me, and the stabilization stinks on selected days... nothing a flash won't clear up though. However, I love this camera it has served me well. Hope you enjoy this product as much as I have!!!! God Bless.","I recieved this camera free with my dell computer and I used it for 3 years and loved it because it is so easy to use. Then I dropped it.

I have found that buying the batteries made specifically for digital cameras work the best and last the longest.  Rechargeables don't work very well or as long on this camera.  I have found if I pay a little more money on the batteries everything else works great.  If you want professional pictures then buy a 500.00 camera. If you want to just take everyday pictures.... well, this is a great camera and more than I expected from it. I think some people want a miracle camera that does everything for them without sacrificing cost...

We wanted a second camera and this was a 'what the heck' buy on Amazon. It worked very well until recently. Took great pictures as well as our older $400 Toshiba.

I'd have to agree.","I got this camera for free, when i bought a computer from dell. I was pretty happy with it from the get-go, however a few days later i got the zoom-error screen when i dropped it. I couldnt get it to work no matter what- so i called dell and they sent me another one, no hassle. However the new one now is acting up. the lens cover that slides back across the camera has some sort of sensor behind it, that tells the lens to come out, and mine doesnt work all the time, so i have to work the cover back and forth until it catches correctly. ANNOYING! it always happens when the baby is making a cute face ...<br /><br /> I think it does take really great pictures, although with the little<br /><br />screen you cant always tell the quality of pic, i havent been dissapointed when i downloaded to computer. THey always look crisp, and colorful like a decent camera should.<br /><br />As far as the features on the camera, it is very easy to use<br /><br />with minimal buttons, easy to find the menu buttons.<br /><br />with the 16mb fuji xd picture card that came with mine, you have 3 options for photos:<br /><br /> 3mp 25 photos<br /><br />-1mp 33 photos<br /><br />-.3mp 122 photos.<br /><br />i think i usually use the 1mp option, and the pics are really nice. ive used the .3 option also and they honestly arent bad, they look like 2 mp. to me. ive not yet opted to buy a bigger card, although i guess i would if i was going away and planned on taking lots of pics.<br /><br />i like that you dont have to use the fuji photo program to download the pics, i just plug in the usb, and the computer automatically recognizes it as a removable device, you can dowmload straight from the wizard and send them to my pics.<br /><br />you will need to buy rechargables for this baby, as the flash eats up lots of power. i think i took maybe 15 pics and the battery was low. I went to wal-mart and bought a cheapie rechargable set, and they really last longer per use than the others. now i can go probably 3 rounds with the camera before it goes low.<br /><br />to sun it up, i do like the camera, but its not reliable enough for me to say i woould buy another one. its very plastic and lightweight, wheras i would feel safer with a smaller denser one. however if you do think the price is right and want to risk the errors, it has good features.","Had this camera and (OUCH) dropped it.  Was thrilled to find it on Amazon at an even lower $ than originally purchased.

It has lasted very nicely, which is more than you can say for most electronic gadgets nowadays.  I am passing it on to my spouse as I have just gotten a newer camera.

After reading some of the advice on CNET.com, I tried a to pull the zoom lens out with my fingers--and it worked!  Seems that this error represents the lens getting \"out of alignment.\"  I was amazed that after dropping this camera hard on the floor, I was able to get it to work by simply pulling on the lens to pop it back into realignment. There was no permanent damage and the camera works just as well as it did before.<br /><br />I am very happy with this camera. Thanks, Fuji :)","This was my first digital camera and I still use it. The ease of use and price were a couple of the factors I considered when I purchased this product. It is pretty much point and shoot. It's also lightweight and small enough to carry around if you're more of a vacation photographer.","I received this camera last year as a 13th birthday present. It worked great for about 4 months. But then I noticed that it was gradually giving me less and less pictures that I was able to take. I recently took a trip to Utah and it only alowed me to take 10 pictures when I should've been able to take 30. Last week it wouldn't let me take any pictures because it said my memory card was full but I didn't have any pictures on it. Yesterday I turned it on to see if by some miracle, it worked but it didn't work and became even worse. Now it won't close and I can't get the LCD screen to work.<br /><br />  I defitently wouldn't recommend this camera for two reasons:<br /><br />1) The size: I found it very inconvenient.<br /><br />2) It broke very easily for me and now I can't take any pictures.","I've had this camera over a year and I have about 50 other assorted cameras including a canon SLR (non digital) and and Arca Swiss view camera (ooh la la) and this is pretty much the only camera I have used during the year. OK mostly I do family photography and ebay product shots and not \"serious\" photography but even so this is telling.<br /><br />I paid $99 on sale in Dec 2003 and the price has not come down much since. I get mostly excellent pix with this camera although I have yet to figure out how to avoid red eye with it. I need to experiment with sticking a piece of stamp edging over the flash or use an off camera slave or something. I use 4 rechargeable AA cells and this works well. When the 2 batteries in the camera are too low I swap them with the two charging in the charger and this way I am never short of batteries and it's all paid for. I use a 256MB xD card and just leave it in the camera all the time. I think if you are constantly changing cards they or the camera might be less reliable but that's just conjecture. I got the 256MB xD card cheap as I bought a lot of 5 of them on eBay and sold the remaining 4 individually for about what I paid for all 5. A couple of things could be improved. The white balance menu is too small to read the symbols and needs some text. It is slow<br /><br />to shoot after you press the button - action shots are hard to time right. It could do a better job on flash portraits with red eye - pre flash to get peoples irises to narrow before the picture is taken. I should invent and patent some kind of sliding flash reflector/diffuser that will distribute the flash better.<br /><br />Camera is a bit bulky for a shirt pocket.","I bought this camera mainly to take pictures of my kids as they grow up, and to satisfy the clamoring from relatives for pictures of the kids.  In both indoor and outdoor lighting, I've taken a whole bunch of great pictures, and I have no particular training or even track record of taking good pictures with previous cameras I owned.  The software that comes with the camera is pretty easy to use and install, and I have an aging G3 Mac, so that's not a small accomplishment.<br /><br />I have found that for indoor shots, there is a delay between when the electronic shutter button is pressed and the image is captured.  I attribute this to the camera adjusting to the light.  With small children that simply don't sit still, or for other indoor pictures, this can be a bit of an inconvenience.  The delay isn't so bad that I usually get the shot I was expecting, and the image quality is good.<br /><br />Given the low price for this camera, I've found it to be an excellent value.","Great digital camera Everything is as advertised. However sometimes it can't fit in your pocket because it's a little chunky.","This camera takes quite nice pictures under the proper environment and settings. If one is outdoors with lots of light or if one uses the flash with the LCD turned off, then the pictures produced usually turn out very well.  However, if one is indoors and uses the LCD to compose the shot, then pictures can get blurry. What seems to happen in this case is that once one gets a focus lock on the subject, if the subject moves after the focus lock is registered, the photos end up blurry.  To avoid this is to turn off the LCD and rely on the viewfinder. Pictures end up clearer this way, however, that way the way one sees the image appear in the viewfinder isn't a true representation of the image like it would be if composed by the LCD screen.","I love, love, love my digital camera!  My boyfriend got it for me for Christmas last year and this is my first digital camera.  I totally love it!  It's SO easy to use and takes amazing pictures that 35mm cameras, or even those one-time use cameras, just can't compare to.  Just snap, snap, snap away and you instantly have your pictures.  Just download them onto your computer and email them to family & friends or take them to your favorite photo lab and order digital prints.  I so can't wait until our amazing wedding and honeymoon in the Caribbean, memories in the making, and I will always have gorgeous looking pictures thanks to this camera!!!  This will be great for scrapbooking that I am just getting into too! Fabolous camera, easy to use, all at an amazing vaule.  Great gift idea for any digital loving person on your list!  I highly recommend this Fugifilm FinePix A205 digital camera!  You will love it! :)","this is a good camera at a real good price (i got it for $79.99 only!). The only real issue is that its VERY big compared to other digital cameras and has a manual shutter which can be a bit annoying !.<br /><br />Otherwise for $80 you can't ask for more. the picture quality is pretty good and prints from it look great too!. The zoom is nice and the LCD pretty good. Doesn't hog that much battery too!!","I bought this camera about 2 weeks ago. It's a pretty good one. Picture quality for outdoors are excellent, even it only has 2MP. But indoor pictures are not very clear. Anyway, what do you expect for a $100 DC?. I am very satisfied with it.","This camera is great for beginners and those of us who have a fear of anything digital. I'm technically impared and thought I'd have trouble with digital cameras.  With the A205 I didn't.  It is intuitive to operate.  The price was right.  The controls are easy to find and operate.The picture quality is good enough for my needs (snapshots of family and vacations) and its easy to operate.  I can play with cropping, titles and editing.  Batteries drain pretty quickly, but from what I've heard this is normal.  Would I buy it again?  YES.","I did all the research, read all the reviews and decided on the FujiFilm FinePix A205, to replace my Kodak digital which was no longer compatible with my new computer.  I've had it a couple of weeks now and can't complain.  I actually bought it to do minor stuff, but am finding more and more, I want to use it to take my nature photos for print.<br />The picture quality is not bad at all.  I went to a local garden and took a beautiful shot which I've since blown up and framed.  It does use batteries fairly quickly, (I needed a new set after about 20 {give or take} photos.)  So to invest in rechargeable batteries is probably going to be a good idea.<br />I haven't used the movie clip option yet, but as far as the pics, I've actually been amazed, that for the price, the pics are clear, crisp and suitable for my amateur photography efforts. The zoom feature is not as good as I would like, but you can compensate for that somewhat, by adjusting your distance from the object you are trying to photograph.<br />It comes with Roxio Photo Suite, which makes editing photos easy.  I like that program too.  The pics load easily to the computer for easy viewing, then bring them up with Roxio to edit and print, e-mail or whatever.<br />I think for the price this a really good value as far as ease of use and performance.","its a great little camera, specially for the price. i use it as my position in my college student government to keep track of my class's 4 years. it has the basic uses. its not as great as the few hundred dollar digital camera my parents have (which has a million more features) but if u want an easy point and shoot w/ great pictures and easy to use features this is definitely a great camera to get for any age.","I'm a total newbie to digital photography.  I do maintain web pages for my students (college writing) and figured a good \"starter\" camera would be a good investment.  I came across this one through an Amazon deal.<br />It was priced well within my budget, under $100.00, and was a nice little complete package.  (Even with batteries!)  Instructions were clear, and it's basically usable right out of the box.  It comes with PC software that makes it easy to transfer your pics to your PC.  And, a nice surprise, they even included the USB cable!<br />Well, it's so simple to use you think you're doing something wrong.  I've had it for a couple weeks and tried both indoor and outdoor shooting.  The zoom is very easy to use, and it's very simple to immediately check out your shots.  It's got all the features of a moderately priced, film camera (red eye, auto focus/flash, etc.)  Only personal glitch for me...there is a momentary delay between pushing the button and the actual shot, which I learned the hard way by taking shots of my daughter riding her horse.  I had a couple of my daughter actually riding OUT of the frame.  Still...more my mistake than the cameras.  Still, this is easy to adjust to, and other pictures came out fine.<br />I'm no pro with photography, but this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone wanting to cut their teeth on taking digipics.  I still need to find a camera case for it, but that's easy to do.  Somehow, I'm sure Amazon will manage to add accessories to my page...  :-)<br />Try it out!","The Fuji FinPix A205 Digital Camera is an outstanding piece of michenery. My Aunt got an A210 for Christmas, and absoulutly loved it. When I saw it, I knew I had to get one, but I was on a $100 budget. When I saw the A205, I thought it was the same. For 70 bucks less, I got a GREAT deal! If you look, A205 has even better ratings then the A210.<br /><br /> The first day I got it, I went straight to my PC and installed the FinePix Viewer Software. You wouldn't believe how fast it was. I just poped the CD in, and it was off. It's also very easy to transfer pictures from my camera to the computer. Including croping images.<br /><br /> It's very easy yet fun to to use my camera as a web cam. You just hook it up, and you're off.<br /><br /> Did you know you can even hook your FinePix up to the TV? It's just as easy as 1,2,3!<br /><br /> I hope this review was very usefull to you. Thank You.<br /><br /> -Ander","i just got this camera yesterday and everyone in my home is loving this digital camera. it takes really clear pictures...i was really surprised how easy it was to use this camera and the other features that came with it. picture quality is excellent, indoor pictures are great as well. why buy an expensive camera when this can do everything. it even records upto 30sec. of video. i just love it. if you really want a digital camera but dont want to pay so much then i think you should buy this digital camera, it does everything other digital camera's does.","We bought one because it was cheap and thought we would save up and buy a better one later. For our useage it is perfect. It takes<br />great shots with little interaction from the user. The pics are sharp and clear and the color is great. It comes with excellent software as well. We have given up thoughts of buying a different one. You can't go wrong for the buck!","Let me start by saying that I don't own this camera. My mother just bought it recently and asked me for some help in figuring out the fine details. When I saw the pictures she took, all 4X6s, I was impressed with the quality, which I thought was excellent. Contrary to some other reviews, none of her pictures seems dark or grainy. All were very sharp and clear. Then, I was looking at the settings on the camera and showing her the different functions (she is not very tech savvy at all.) and I realized that she only had the resolution set on 1 megapixel setting! Of course I warned her than if she tried to blow them up much they'd probably be pixelated, but I know 99 percent of her pictures will be 4X6. The menu and features were easy to figure out and the zoom worked well enough. The one thing I didn't like was that you couldn't turn off the digital zoom, which wasn't too big a deal since it is only about 1.5X and didn't seem to affect the quality on her pics much. Very nice for the price and she loves it.","I caught this at Amazon during a clearance sale for $84 and am thrilled with the purchase. I'll mostly be using it for closeup for auction site products, and it does an excellent job of showing details at very close range. It pays to read the instruction manual carefully, as there are several options for non-flash low light photography (useful for avoiding glare off shiny objects).<br />My only complaint is that the user has to be careful about running down the batteries. Once they get below a certain level the camera simply stops working for low-light conditions.  This applies equally if you are using cheap replacement types, even fresh out of the package. My advice is that you replace your good batteries for rundown ones (a very simple proceedure) when you are reviewing or uploading shots, then switch back to ensure proper voltage when it comes picture-taking time.<br />Other than that, absolutely no problems. The fact that it is thick actually enhances its caché: I take photos of other people's products and it looks very professional mounted on a tripod, something that slimline digital camera versions can't claim.","This is my first camera and I like a lot. It takes pretty good pictures indoor and outdoor. Is very small even is a little heavy. The only thing I don't like is that is a battery eater!!!. You take 20 or 30 pictures and you have to change it.<br />But I recommend it for first users.","I've been thinking and thinking and thinking of buying a digital camera for a long time, but kept putting it off. Everytime I saw something that looked promising, it seems there was a purchase killer somewhere-too expensive, no LCD display, too few pixels, whatever-and I kept passing.<br />Then my sister told me she was getting a grant from her school to take her kids on several field trips and had $100 to spend on disposable film cameras. Then the light bulb came on over my head. Why not get a digital camera, said I? So I rounded up the usual web sites for research, came upon the FujiFilm A205, and was impressed by the specs. Where, oh where, thought I, can I find some reliable real world reviews? Amazon, of course. After reading the reviews I bought the camera and a 64Mb memory card and I'm delighted with the results.<br />You need not hesitate any longer if you've been considering getting a digital camera. This camera is a real bargain. Picture quality exceeds my expectations, and I've even taken a few experimental pics at night and with a little more refinement of technique, I'll even be getting better night shots.","This digital camera is the best.  I bought one and have been totally 100% satisfied.  I love it. It is a great camera for anyone, so simple to use.  It takes great pictures too.  What more could you ask for?","Its a decent camera but it EATS batteries... LIKE CRAZY and the buttons go nuts sometimes.<br />I got this for free with my dell laptop so i cant complain that much","This is what I got for $85 dollars:<br />Crisp Pictures(provided there is good lighting, use a good slave flash for indoors please).<br />Amazing color reproduction.<br />Ease of use, i.e. light weight, easy connection with USB, good menu.<br />Great battery life(took more than 350 shots with AA NiMH 2100mAh), I believe one reason is the awesome<br />xD cards they use. I have no clue why people think its bad cuz' its easily lost, just use the package it came in, or let it stay in the camera. I got 64M for $28 and I can store 101 2M pics.<br />Pictures with a205 came out more vivid than my Minolta 4MP S414. It has a faster boot, faster focus than S414 and ofcourse a lot lighter. But I did pay 4 times as much for S414 for some extra controls.<br />So for everyday casual shots a205 wins. thanks amazon, best $85 dollars ever spent.","I just purchased this camera from Amazon and you just can't beat this deal. Less than $85 for a 2MP digital camera with a zoom lens!!! Get real!  I really like this camera.  The pictures I have taken were clear and crisp and these were just indoor pictures.  This is a great camera for beginners like myself. You don't have to invest over $100 dollars for a good 2MP camera.  The software that came with the camera isn't too bad. Since I am not an expert I think it works just fine with this camera.<br />I read all the reviews before purchasing this camera and I absolutely agreed with all the positive reviews.  You just can't go wrong with this camera and if I were you, I jump on the band wagon now!!!  Just remember....this is a lower end digital camera so don't expect bells and whistles, but it sure does a good job. It's the best $85 I have ever invested.<br />This camera deserves at least 4 stars so that's what I gave it. I am pretty sure there are 5 stars 2MP cameras out there but not for this price!","This is a great camera !!!!!!!!! This takes great crisp,clear pictures . Some people say it eats batteries but it doesn't .<br />It is the best digital camera you can have . I also like the zoom feature . All in all this is a great camera .","This product is great. However, DO NOT attempt to do business with ritz.com at all unless you're willing to go through the hassle of dealing with cheap customer service. They charge your credit card before shipping the product. The USPS tracking number doesn't work and they say it's USPS' fault.","This camera is an awesome purchase for its price.I have taken photos by it in almost all conditions-at night by using a stand and using the ambient light(flash off) and the photos are great;of fast moving vehicles in the daytime and the photos seem as such the vehicles arnt moving at all;photos of views from inside a glass surface and it seems there's no glass at all.It doesnt require as much light as some reviews say.It works well even in dark conditions with its different flash modes and it doesn't drain up the battery much.Its controls are simple too. The camera doesn't switch on until the lens cover is fully opened so no chance of damage to the lens also.Take pics at 2MP and there are no grains even on 8\"x10\" prints.I would therefore recommend this camera as an excellent piece of work by Fuji.","I bought this camera after reading lots of reviews at bunch of different sites. Camera for me has served well, actually quite well. Here are the facts<br />Pros :  - excellent colors, crisp pictures, even at lowest  resolution,<br />  - nice closeup pictures,<br />  - battery life ok (cannot say because donot know how others perform). I use rechargable ones so say per 40 pictures with flash and viewfinder on.<br />  - Easy to use and understand.<br />  - Cannot slip it in pocket, but still small but very handy.<br />Cons:  - You have to get used to using zoom. Not so precise.<br />  -  takes pictures a little after you click and flash flashes. So expect subject to move a little or warn them before hand.<br />Actually nothing is very bad that this camera should not be bought. It is definitely worth considering as an option. Get used to taking pictures under different modes and you can do wonders with this.","I bought this camera for my teenage son, so if he looses it or breaks it I won't have to cash in his college fund.  To get a 2 mpx camera with X3 optical zoom that works well for $99.00 is a bargin.","I got this camera free w/my purchase of my Dell computer...it is AWESOME!  I already own a Sony Mavica but this camera (Fuji) takes WONDERFULLY clearer pictures and it's just all around a better camera.  It is a nice compact camera.  I love shooting the little video clips so I can send them to family/friends online!  You can also plug the camera into your tv/vcr and watch a slideshow of your pics/videos!  It's a great product!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","The Fuji Finepix A205 is a very nice digital camera for those not ready to purchase a more advanced model yet.  It's a nice and very affordable way to get started in digital photography.  It takes generally pleasant pictures both indoors and out, and it's very easy to use.  The build quality is also very good.<br />If you are looking for a \"serious\" digital camera, however, go for one with at least 3MP, preferably 4MP. (But 5MP or more might be an overkill.)  2MP resolution gives you decent 4x6\" prints, but if you start cropping a little, you'll wish you had more pixels to work with.","This camera is easy to use and picture quality is pretty good. Good for starters. I thought the built in flash was not too bad. It worked O.K. for me. Pictures in the daytime come out great. Overtime, eventually I will want something stronger. But for being my first digital camera, it works just fine. I highly recommend this camera for those just starting out.","This camera was a steal and takes great pics for the money. Now I must say if you're a wanna-be photographer with a trained eye for detail, then by all means go for the high tech camera and by pass this one because you'll probably be disappointed. But for taking every day shots you can't beat it for the buck. I just brought this camera and it's so easy to use and even for a 2mp the picture quality is great, you can even get good quality with it set on the 1mp. This is my second digicam and my first had a little more mp, but this one by far is the better camera. It's not the smallest camera, but it's not the bulkiest either. The material is a little on the cheap side, but it is light weight and only takes two batteries instead of four (rechargeables highly recommended). I love the 3xoptical zoom (which my other camera didn't have) and it's very user friendly. To put it short, I'm not an electronics whiz or a photographer, and you don't have to be either for this camera. It's very easy to use from taking great quality pictures to downloading them to your pc and it won't take months to figure out how to work it. My sister who also just recently purchased a 3mp digicam likes mine alot better and is going to take hers back to get this one. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great quality camera at a bargain. And don't buy into that 'you get what you pay for rule', because you don't always have to pay outrageous prices for something to be good. This camera is proof of it!!!","My mom has a Sony Mavica CD something or other.  It takes 5 mp quality pictures and writes them on a little CD.  It is a very nice camer but cost around $600.  The FujiFilm A205 is an excellent camera for beginners or people who do not want to spend alot of money on a camer.  The xD expansion cards for the system are inexpensive now, I just purchased a 64 mb (101 pictures) for $38 dollars at Wal-Mart.  The camera does go through alot of batteries, I utilized the batteries that came with they camera 1 day after purchasing it.  Spend $20 and get two rechargable (Ni-Mh) and a charger and they will last alot longer than normal Alkaline batteries.  The camera does have movie mode, which is of poor quality but who buys a digital camera to make movies?  It also doubles as a web-cam and you can caputure video utilizing your PC.  The video functionality of this camera is poor, even through the web-cam function, unless there is alot of light.  If you are buying this digital CAMERA to shoot videos then you are in the wrong category.  Even though it is only 2 mp quality, the pictures are excelent in quality.  I have not had any problems with dark rooms or at concerts.  The flash effectivly reached around 15 feet for me. The camera comes with an adapter for the dock connector, the adapter is the little plastic piece, DON'T THROW IT OUT.  Since it is FujiFilm's lower end model, there won't be alot of accesories for it.  You can get the dock connector and a case for it along with extra memory.  Those are all the excesories anyone really neads unless you want to take widescreen pictures, but then you would not even look at buying this camera.  If you want a really high quality camera then look at spending at least $300. If you want a good quality camera at a really affordable price then get this one.  My mom has an older Sony Mavica CD model and this camera takes the same quality pictures, when printed (or even on the computer monitor) pictures of the same object could not be distinguished into which camera took the picture.  The FujiFilm A205 is a small, light weight camera.  It is pretty thick but for the price that is the only sacrifice anyone will have to make.  Is you want to spend around $100 then this camera will give you more band for your buck.  I hope this review helped you.","I bought this camera based solely on the Fuji name, since I have had good experiences with them in the past.  This camera was extremely easy to set up, and since it was my first digital camera, it was really important for me to not have to read a big thick manual just to take a picture.  For the price I paid, I think I got way more than I could have, had I bought a similar camera by a different company.  The pictures are crisp, clear, and contrary to what another reviewer mentioned, I have had no problems with the flash.  Since I am a beginner, I was quite suprised at how good the pictures came out!  My alkaline batteries started to die within the first day, but I think that was because I had the camera on pretty much all day, since I was taking pictures os everything.  I purchased some rechargeable Ni-MH batteries, and so far, my battery light hasn't come on, and I've had them in for 5 days.  Anyways, if you're not looking for a top-of-the-line 5 MP camera, and just want a camera that takes really good pictures for not very much money, I would definitely go for this camera.","I recently purchased the Finepix A205, and I am very happy with it's performance so far.<br />I was surprised when I took a close up shot of my cat and I could see the grains of sand on his fur in perfect clarity. I wasn't expecting that from a 2mp camera.<br />The design is a little puzzling, the height and width are fine, but the thickness is the same as the height. It's too thick, but that is a small price to pay for such a great camera.<br />The only other thing I do not like, and it seems to be true on all the Finepix cameras, is that, while it does record movies, it doesn't have any sound. Kind of a downside, but, I can deal with it, I wan't to take pictures, not movies. I'll buy a video camera for that.<br />I love using the little XD cards, I think they are great. The transfer very fast.<br />This camera IS NOT a battery hog, from what I have experienced. I am STILL using the 2 AA alkalines that came with the camera, and I have taken AT LEAST 200 shots, if not more, with the LCD on and the flash on. Only now am I getting the battery low light. I think that is pretty decent considering some digital cameras I have owned die on regular alkalines after 10 shots or less. I can't imagine how long the batteries will last with a couple of 2100mah NiMH's. It's also a plus that it only takes 2, rather than 4.<br />I don't even use the software that came with this camera. For all you XP users, this camera is great for you. All I have to do is plug it into the USB cord, or the cradle, and up pops the \"What do you want windows to do\" box with several different actions, I chose \"Copy pictures to a folder on my computer\" and I can transfer the pictures to my computer, and then delete them off my memory card. That's so much easier than going through a bunch of photo editing programs.<br />I also don't seem to be having any trouble with the flash in low light, I just went outside in the dark and took pictures, and took pictures of things in a dark room, and they look as if they were taken in the light. The flash seems fine to me.<br />This is a great camera!","I wanted an inexpensive and fairly small 2-megapixel digital camera for vacations and outdoor use, and at less than $100, this camera is beyond what I was hoping for. This is my third digital camera, and it's by far the easiest one to use, plus the image quality is excellent. Excellent, of course, is a relative term in the field of digital cameras... like many low-end cameras, it shoots at the equivalent of 100-speed film, which makes for grainy images if you are not shooting outdoors or with a good amount of light, but the flash does a great job and it's really not hard to get good quality images. If you want to take fine art photos, you need a much more expensive camera anyway. A big plus for this one is the 3x optical zoom. Most low end digital cameras only offer digital zoom, but don't let them fool you-- digital zoom is exactly the same thing as cropping your pictures and does not actually make them better. Also, many low-end cameras have a fixed focus, which will make all of your photos come out looking rather flat. The Fuji 205, while it has no maunal f-stop (aperture control) or focus, self adjusts these things to take nice pictures with the subject in focus and the background slightly out of focus. Full manual control is nice for some things, but for point and shoot, you can't beat the simplicity of this camera. Plus, I don't have to worry too much about taking it along when I go somewhere I wouldn't want my $450 camera to go, like the beach or on a boat.<br />As far as battery life, please do yourself a favor if you are buying ANY digital camera and get NiMH rechargable batteries. Alkaline batteries are simply wasted in a digital camera... they are not strong enough and you are throwing your money away if you try to use them. Get a quick charger and 2 sets of batteries, and you'll be happy and save money.<br />Pros: a quality camera that takes good pictures at a great price.<br />Cons: needs lots of light, no manual controls","We had two digital cameras in our household: an Olympus Camedia D40Z and a Pentax Optio S4. We bought the FujiFilm FinePix A205 a little over a week ago. My son and I spent two days looking online for a digital camera in the $100 price range. (This camera was purchased for him from his savings). Many of the cameras that we found in this price range were very limited. The A205 was a stand out from the rest. It even has a few features that our more expensive two-year-old Olympus doesn't have. My son was able to figure out how to use it quickly. The picture quality and battery life have been very good. (Although as other reviewers have said here and elsewhere, buy rechargeable batteries and a charger). Really an excellent first digital camera.","Love the camera! My second digital camera. Bought a low-priced unit 2 years ago primarily to learn what I would desire in an upgrade.<br />1. The first camera took excellent pictures, even to an 8x10  blowup, but it was damnably frustrating because it very quickly defaulted from settings. I knew then that any camera I would purchase should hold settings until deliberately reset!<br />2. This camera has (2) frustrations! First, ALL cameras ought to have (2) two carrying strap eyelets!!! Wrist strap doesn't cut it!! I thing most of us desire a neck strap attached to two eyelets so the camera can be carried conveniently upon the chest in a \"ready-to-grasp\" position. Second frustration! Phooey on the \"stylists\" who pretend to be designers! The lens cover ought to have a decent projection (\"tab\", if you will) on the end farthest from lens. To slide open the lens cover requires push or pull with fingernail on end nearest lens. As cover slides open one's finger is dangerously close to lens!! It certainly would be nice to have the people \"designing/styling\" equipment to use it before hardening design for production!!","We've been using this camera for over a month and love it.  It's our first one, so we were a bit leary, but we've had no problems with the camera (aside from going through batteries quickly) and the software it comes with is fabulous and very easy to use!  My adivise is to buy the power adapter right off the bat...you'll spend the same money in batteries very quickly.  We print our photos on glossy photo paper on our all-in-one HP color printer and even with only 2 mega pixels they still come out looking like a true photograph (coming from an avid SLR photographer).","I'm giving this 5 stars largely because of its value for money.  For $115, you get a 2MP with a 3X optical zoom... and it takes pretty good shots.  Don't expect an SLR shot from a 2MP $115 camera.... but this camera can hold its own against $300 ones.  If you are on a budget or you need a spare point and shoot, get this one.  Resolution is pretty ok... 36mm equivalent for wide is good... the tele, pretty ok.  Since its a 2MP, a 32 or 64 MB card can hold a lot of pictures already.  You can't get a $500 performance here... if you like that, get a $500 camera... I can't believe how inexpensive this camera is!","We bought this for our daughter, as she will be traveling to some exciting places, and she just loves it!  The ease of use and of downloading make this a very easy to use camera and the size is handy to carry around.  She has been the offical picture person in her dorm and has fun putting these pictures within minutes online.  Maybe we should consider one for ourselves!","It's simple to operate, takes fantastic pictures, and is extremely portable.  I have a fancier Fuji digital that's also wonderful, but I wind up using this one more than the other simply because it's so easy to use.  I carried it in my fanny pack all over Disney World for four days and it was so wonderful to be able to whip it out and get quick pictures whenever necessary.  It's on and focused within seconds.  Never a missed shot.  I can't recommend it highly enough.","This is the easiest point and shoot digital camera to operate that I have ever owned.  It is all automatic and it is so simple to operate, my wife can operate it.  This is our second digital camera, Our first camera was not all automatic and it was frustrating to set up.  The Fujifilm FinePix A205 takes great pictures that are sharp and clear, even up to and including 8\" x 10\" enlargements.  This is a great camera for those who like taking everyday pictures.","This Digital Camera is just excellent. I bought this camera a few weeks ago and then started reading all reviews about it and scared myself thinking that the camera would not work in dark rooms (as I read in a few posts). When I got the camera, the first thing I tried was taking pictures in dark rooms, and the quality of picture is excellent, the picture is very bright and you can identify clearly what's on the picture; even in it's lower resolution.<br />I rate this digital camera A+, 5 stars or anything else that would mean excellent...","This is a great camera for entry level people that have just chosen to use digital cameras. I bought this at Target at the right time and also got a gift card. The camera looks pretty neat but kinda cheap. It is very light and not that thick. The LCD is very good. Able to zoom in and span easily.<br />Ease of Use<br />This is probably the most easiest and simplest cameras on the market. There are probably about 7 buttons on the whole thing. The menu is very user compatible and the software is ok.<br />Picture Quality<br />The pictures come out very good especially for a 2mp camera. The 8x10 pics come out good.I have not yet printed a 4x6 picture but my guess is that it will come out very good. Also, make you sure you have a very good printer to really enjoy your pictures. I have a inkjet printer that prints very well but does not compare to photo printers. I am planning on buying a photo printer in a couple of weeks<br />Video<br />Video isnt that good. Of course video from a digital camera will never replace a digital camcorder. It records video without sound at 10 frames per second. That is like a almost semi-strobe quality. Video is only good if taken with alot of light. And i mean alot. One good thing is that you can hook it up to your computer and use it like a webcam. But like any webcam, you need alot of light.And you also need a MIC to talk on your PC.<br />Features<br />It comes with a very sufficient amount of features. A tv-out line out to hook upto your tv. But that is only good with a small tv. I have a big projection tv so it was little pixalated, but that doesnt affect the print. The software isnt bad. Lots of features to customize your pics anyway you want. It also comes with a new 16mb xd-card. This increases your battery life and is also faster. This camera eats up batteries but lasts longer than other digital cameras. They also give you all the wires and supplies to use right out of the box.<br />Cons<br />Dont get confused with what it says on the box. It says it comes with a dock adapter. That is just a plastic placement to attach to an optional dock. I wish the flash was a little better for wide angle shots. It would also been good if there were different photo-shot modes (ie.. nightshot, snow&sand, spotlight etc) But some of that you can do with the included software.<br />  So in other words, this is a fantastic camera. It is fun to use everyday and also show off. I am planning on using it as my main camera for a while. Then i am considering a very high mega-pixeled camera for very large prints. Also a 35mm SLR Nikon that i have had my eyes on for a while. I love using old fashioned cameras.","It was my first digital camera purchase and I'm generally pleased. I enjoy travelling to different countries, so many pictures are taken outdoors. For outdoor photos, this is a great investment. I usually set the camera at 1.0 mega pixels to take more pictures, and the quality is unbelievable. People who have seen the pictures cannot believe they were taken at 1.0 mps. In addition, it is extremely easy to use. Even if you have never used a digital camera, you will have no problem taking pictures (and erasing subpar pictures from memory).<br />Downside. Well, if you enjoy indoor photography, make sure the subject is close to you, or make sure the room is very well lit. I have had several pictures I have had to edit with the software (which, luckily, is easy to do) just to be able to see what the picture was. Like many digital cameras, it eats batteries like cheeseburgers. Finally, while lightweight, it is somewhat (and unnecessarily, in my opinion) bulky. Also, it is a new model, but the price has been slashed considerably ...this could be a sign of trouble, but it could also just mean its a bargain.<br />I'd recommend the camera for people new to digital cameras, and for anyone who wants to take pictures without a lot of hassle.","one of the greatest dig cameras i ever had. The picture quality is better than ever. If you are thinking about a camera get this one. I take a lot of pictures of everything and this camera is great. The 2.0 pixels has nothin to do with the picture quality, it is the camera and the pictures are fantastic","Since I'm on a college budget, I needed to get an inexpensive camera so I could take pictures during the Thanksgiving Break.  My requirments were at least 2 megapixals and decent image quality.  I read a number of digial camera reviews and decided to pick up the Fuji Finepix A205.  My first thoughts of the camera was the bulk; it's quite thick but it is light weight.  Not something you would want to stick in your pants or shirt pocket though.  The buttons on the camera do feel cheap, but it was only $150 so what?<br />Other than those small gripes, the camera takes excellent pictures but only in well lit environments.  Outdoor pictures are really nice.  Indoor shots can end up grainy if there isn't alot of light and I mean A LOT OF LIGHT.  The flash is only effective in close range (at least 5ft to 6ft)  Anything beyond that, make sure the environment is well lit or your subject is close.<br />Macro mode just takes a press of the button and it works really well.  There is also a movie mode, but forget about using it unless the room is very very very very well lit.<br />Comparing indoor shots taken with the A205 and a 3MP Sony digital camera, the A205 images were less grainy than the Sony's, but the Sony's pictures were brighter because of the better flash.<br />In conclusion, the Fuji Finepix A205 takes very excellent pictures outdoors and indoors in bright light or when the subject is close to the camera with the flash.  I could only give it 3 stars for the poor flash performance.","I was not looking for a confusing camera just something simple to use that can take great pictures. This is that camera. Minutes after getting it I had already taken numerous pictures of my daughter that I already treasure. I don't know what the more expensive models offer but I can't imagine the picture quality being any better. This is great for everyday use. Very easy to use.","the information in the site in paragraph PRODUCT DESCRIPTION says that the camera is comaptible with \"CP-FXA10 Picture Cradle\" and then further says that there is a \"picture cradle adapter\" included in the package, but the pakage has a plastic holder type thing and there is no adapter included in the normal package, so be careful while u order and do not expect an adapter with your order, as i have not got the same.","the pics from this camera are good only in really bright light ....but if the picture is taken in a room (of course with the flash) the picture is quite dim (a compormise for its low cost).<br />camera is small but thick, so u can't carry it very easily ...never in a pocket.<br />the pixels (of the pictures taken from this camera) can be easily seen with the highest  picture quality even at 100% magnification.. a big compromise for low cost.so it is advisable to go for another $15 investment for a 3 MP camera ..<br />also the accessories listed for this product are costly and are very limited. so u need to make at least $40 extra purchase to fulfil you requirements.<br />overall if do not care for the picture quality or have the accessories, u can go for this camera.","This camera has worked well for me both indoors and out.  It is easy to use and the user interface is staightforward and simple to navigate.  It has more than enough flash/focus options for most users.  I never enlarge photos so 2 MP is more than enough.  Anything more is expensive overkill.  It is not the most compact camera, but this is a compromise that I accept given its relatively low price.","I wanted an inexpensive camera with optical zoom for my wife.  This camera is very simple and when used with the optional docking cradle makes learning to use digital cameras very easy.  Of course the pictures at 8x10 are not as high as quality as with my Sony 717, but I could get 6 of these cameras for what I paid for my 5 mega pixel Sony.  I took me 6 months to fully learn how to use my Sony.  My familily is taking great pictures with this Fuji in one weekend...!  I highly recommend.","Fuji 2600 sold very good in 2001 because it was cheap & solid camera (with below average build quality). They removed some features and downgraded its screen & lens speed to make 2650 in 2002 even cheaper. Come 2003 they have added video-out and futher downgraded it, made it uglier and zero innovation.<br />Basically its gotten thicker (well above 2 inches), even worse lens, poor night capability, grainy LCD, cheapo plastic body, expensive xD cards and average build quality. The picture quality in daylight is very good though. Battery life and user interface are also good.<br />Meanwhile cameras from Canon, Sony, Nikon and other companies have improved a lot, added many features and have gotten cheaper. Right now Canon A60/A70 is much better option.<br />Ofcourse first time users (who never had a digital camera before) will give it 5 stars and will be very happy.","This is a great camera.  I did hours and hours of research before deciding on this one.  I'm glad I did my homework because this takes the greatest pictures even on the middle setting.  When I received it, I was a little dissapointed with the size because I was expecting a bigger camera but my dissapointment was gone quickly when I saw how incredible the pictures were.  I actually like the size now, because my husband can easily keep it in his pocket.  Battery consumption has been great.  I've heard alot about digital cameras eating up batteries.  I haven't had that problem with this camera but i'm still planning on buying the optional cradle to charge it through the computer or a/c adapter.  The owner's manual is a bit daunting and there are a lot of buttons and settings but once I read the manual, it was quite easy to use.  I hope this has been helpful for you if you're looking for a digital camera.  Buy it.  It's great!"]},{"name":"Kodak EasyShare CX6200","amazon_reviews":["This was my first digital camera purchase back in 2003.  The very same camera that I bought back then STILL functions perfectly.

That's a humorous way of saying this camera - at $75 sale price - is a great introduction to digital photography.  Kodak has produced at least 3 top-flight consumer/prosumer cameras and is known for the quality of their image and color capture software (see various camera reviews on [...] & imaging-resource.com).  Kodak also makes some serious digital equipment for top-flight professional photographers (DCS-1, I think).  So anyone implying that Kodak doesn't understand digital photography isn't providing the whole story.<br /><br />This camera follows a time-honored, age-old Kodak tradition to get the non-techie into cameras as cheaply and easily as possible.  Thus the Easyshare line, a line of cameras designed to make going from image to memory book as easy as possible.<br /><br />This camera is an ENTRY level camera in the Easyshare line.  The camera is the digital equivalent of Kodak's old Instamatic - that single-focus, 1 film-speed mainstay of KodaColor glory. The CX6200 is small, simple and shoots what it's pointed at.  It takes reasonable pictures w/the color Kodak is famous for.  And it does this for about $0.30-.70 per 4x6 print with a cheap printer.  If you are looking for a take-it-anywhere camera that lets you see what you've just captured, stores 75-150 pics and won't cause tears if it's dropped/lost, this will work.<br /><br />Problems?  Sure - it doesn't zoom, can't adjust exposure and could break its plastic case if it's dropped. It also isn't a good camera to \"learn\" photography on (not enough features).  But for some consumers, it's the right tool for the job.  [NOTE: I would suggest this camera to those already using SD/MMC somewhere in the household; just pass down the smaller-sized flash memory to whoever in the family gets this camera.  I would also ALWAYS recommend a memory card reader over installing the software.  I just don't like software I don't otherwise need cluttering up my computer.]<br /><br />Like any inexpensive item, there are many things it doesn't do.  But as an entry-level, memory-capturing scrapbook filler, most users will be satisfied.  Consider this a cheap intro that should provide results and pleasure at not-too-great a price. Are there other choices?  Always.  Be a wise consumer. Tired of shopping?  You could DEFINITELY do worse than this camera as a beginner.<br /><br />Make up your own mind - check those web sites out.<br /><br />And I'm buying one TONIGHT for my 5 year-old.....","I was looking for a digital camera for my almost 12 year old.<br /><br />I've had digital cameras for years, and expected to find something simple, like an older model I had. Very hard to find!  Only other simple models I was finding were strange brands I never heard of (and suspected wouldn't last long).<br /><br />My alternative was a film camera - I don't want to get into the<br /><br />cost or hassle of getting film developed any more.<br /><br />So far, quite happy with this simple little camera.  2M is quite large enough for what he'll use it for.  Tonight, he was photographing the sunday comics...  8-)","I would recommend this camera to anyone who needs/wants a camera that is really easy to use.  We purchased this camera for my 10 year old son 4 months ago as an alternative to a disposible camera.  He was able to use the camera immediately with very little assistance and has taken hundreds of pictures since. He loves viewing the pictures immediately to determine if it is a good picture or not.  The picture quality is very good (equal to our Nikon 800.)  The battery life is also very good, but you will probably want to invest in rechargeables. If you can live without zoom capability and want a simple; reliable and low cost camera that takes good pictures, the Kodak 6200 is an excellent choice. Note: Ecost is a good site to get inexpensive memory.","boughtthis cam for my girl,<br /><br />  works fine i guess... no bells no whistles, but 2 be real this take great pics for 2 mega pixels","Purchased this for my daughter and niece both under 12.  This is a very easy to use no frills camera at a great price.  If you are looking to replace your camera with a new digital camera - I would shop around.  I prefer Canon.  However, if price is an issue and ease of use - this is a great little camera.  Pictures turned out better than I anticipated with only 2.0.","Product was delivered as promised. Quality and performance are better than expected. I recommend it.","Great Camera.  This is my first digital camera and I'm quite amazing how good it is for $80. Clear pictures and quick flash.  Took a picture of my CPU fan running at 3000 RPM and the picture looked like it wasnt even moving. Just wish it had more internal memory.","For a 2.0 megapixel camera, it takes clear pictures. I don't understand why people want higher pixels, unless your a pro and its your job then you get higher pixels but just for fun and personal use, this camera does its job.","I came to this one because (a) I refuse to pay many times more for digital, and (b) I like the review & delete buttons on the back, instead of having to use a menu to delete.<br />By now the 6200 and 6320 models cost about the same (close to US$100), but the 6230 has 16Mb internal where the 6200 has 8Mb, and the 6230 also allows much closer-up pictures (special mode); so there's no reason to buy this one anymore.","I have always been interested in photography and like to experiment. I have a small camera which fits in the palm of my hand and wanted to get something bigger and inexpensive. Since I am a regular shopper at Amazon, I decided that there is where I would go to look for a camera. On receiving the Kodak Easyshare 6200, I immediately started to experiment. The Camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures. The software is also very user friendly as long as you can get it installed on your system. (I had problems at first. I have shown the camera to some of my friends and very soon they too will be ordering the Kodak Camera.<br />P.S I hope that Amazon can start shipping directly to Barbados.

It's pictures turn out like they would on a 4.0 mgapixel camera!  They took one great camera and simplified it to make it really easy to use.  The editing software is ok, but the great deal about it is it is user friendly and you can upgrade youre software for free!  I got amazing pictures of my trip to Arizona with it.  If you want a great camera get this one!","The camera is great, but the software is really annoying. If you have network it's terrible, you basically have to call customer service in order to get the software to work anyway. But overall the camera takes good pictures, after setup and installation it's easy to e-mail pictures.","This is a good camera, simple to use. Easy to use menu, easy to use camera. I was able to take all kinds of pictures without using the cd manual. Problems with the Easy-share software...it won't work. I would recommend, especially if using XP, to just go to the website and download the driver only, not the easy share software. Use other ways of pulling the pictures off the camera, it should show up as an extra drive. Don't even use the cd, but be sure to download the drivers first. It is easy to use, and fun too. The screen works great and the camera is a good size.","I've been a lousy (but dedicated) photo hobbyist for more than 30 years. Highly complicated cameras are great... but I always find myself doing most work on point-&-shoot cameras. Last year, when my 1960s-era Fuji started to fall apart, I spent $20 on a Fuji Smart Shot 35mm.<br />I was all set to drop $400 on a digital camera, so that I could finally move into the 1990s, as well as post & send photos without having to scan them. I got overwhelmed by all the questions, though: how many mp? what memory format? how much zoom? optical or electronic? movies? audio?<br />I was all set to give up the hunt & stick with 35mm, then I was buying office supplies & the CX6200 was on sale.<br />Sure, hardly top-of-the-line. Sorta fragile... like my Fuji.<br />My biggest -- & so far only -- gripe is that the Kodak doesn't have any sort of lens cover. I mean, come *on*, people, a camera that can't even take a rubber lens cap???<br />In all, if it only lasts a year, I figure the 6200 is a good investment. Between buying film & having it developed, I spend at least $80 a year, only to discard more than half the photos as necessary waste in getting what I want. It's a good camera for point-&-shoot use, yet also gives me a little flexibility as far as image quality, & the redeye-reduction feature has thus far been perfect.<br />Accessorize!! I'd recommend that you get a decent memory card (the 64mb seems to strike a nice balance for me between cost & storage), a NiMH battery kit (or a Kodak dock if you find a good price), & a $10 case. The Kodak software has its minuses, but I'd say to skip the cutesy bells&whistles, just buy an inexpensive USB reader.","The photos this camera takes are of high quality, and I would probably rate them as a 5. For the movies I would probably give a 4 because although the images are good there's no sound. But the REAL problem with the camera is the software that is given to you (the Kodak Easyshare program.) I would probably give the computer connection a 1. The whole point of the camera is to put all of the photos/movies onto the computer. Whenever the camera is full of photos and movies and is hooked up to an IMac and turned on, the Kodak file opens up but it always says \"no pictures on device\". Then if you go to Iphoto, it'll let you transfer the photos, but not the movies, which means the movies have nowhere to go. So the only way to get all of your photos onto the Kodak system is by importing them in from Iphoto. Every once in the while the Kodak transfer system works ONCE, and then stops working, so the way in which the transfer system works is pretty random. Even though the software stinks, if you are willing to deal with it for good photos, then you should buy it.","The most important thing first:  DO NOT, under any circumstances, install the Kodak Easyshare software CD which comes with this camera.<br />If you have newer versions of Windows, including XP, you don't need to install the software in order to download the pics from camera to the computer.  The computer will automatically download them.<br />What will the Easyshare CD install?  Some of the crappiest photo-management software I've seen, a bunch of programs which constantly connect to Kodak's web site, and a bunch of spyware which Lavasoft's Ad-Aware 6.0 discovered.<br />You can get rid of the spyware with Ad-Aware, but merely uninstalling the Easyshare software won't remove everything.  I still have a Kodak CCS process running, despite numerous attempts to get rid of it.<br />Ignoring the software, this is one of the easiest digital cameras you will ever use.<br />I've had several digital cameras since the late 90s and this is the best 2 megapixel camera I've had.  The menu is fairly intuitive.  Battery consumption, if you use NIMH rechargables, is reasonable.<br />Picture quality is very good, especially outdoors.  Indoors, the pics occasionally suffer from a weaker-than-it-should-be flash, but they're still quite good.  Red-eye, an occasional problem with using a regular flash is very rare.  There is a red-eye flash option if you need it.<br />The price, less than $100, is excellent value.<br />If you're looking for a semi-decent 2 megapixel camera, this is it - just don't install the crappy software.","I got this camera in December and I am very satisfied with it.  It's my first digital camera and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is inexperienced using them.  It has very few options so there's not a whole lot you can do to mess up.  The only reason why I deducted a star was because the batteries don't last very long (and aren't rechargeable); and because when taking pictures on their best quality setting the camera will only hold about eight.  However, for what you pay for it, the Kodak Easy Share is definitely worth the money, and worth splurging $30 for a rechargeable battery.","I bought this camera to take pictures of things I want to sell on ebay. I'm use to higher end digital cameras (Nikon 995, Olympus 4000?) and I didn't have super high expectation for this camera.<br />Here's what impressed me about this camera:<br />- The ease of use of this camera is incredible. I find most digital cameras extremely difficult and cumbersome, this was a snap!<br />- The delay between taking a photo and the camera ready for the next photo was very short. There was also a very short delay between hitting the shutter button and the picture being taken.<br />- The software (I was using the version for Mac OS X) was very smooth and useful. I think it's a bit quicker than iphoto.<br />The disastisffaction comes with the image quality at close range (<4\"). I didn't realize there's no macro mode, so I'm unable to take detail shots of things I'm selling at close range. These close up images were extremely blurry. When I zoomed in to a graphic file using photoshop there was a lot of jpg distortion, more than I've seen on other cameras. You can adjust the image resolution (number of pixels) of the camera, but not the level of jpg encoding. I tried taking close-up photos with the flash off, in my expereiene with other cameras, this can sometimes increase image quality. All of these photos were underexposed (even when I adjusted the image exposure compensation). I think this might be because the longest shutter speed is 1/2 second.<br />The photos I took at normal conditions seemed to be of good quality.<br />Synopsis: Great camera interface. Good regular condition photos. Very sucky close-up photos.<br />I'm probably going to return this camera and get a higher end 2MP camera. A good camera, but I've pushed its limits with my needs.","I used to own Kodak's previous 2MP digital camera, the CX4200 (only available used now).  I bought a CX6200 thinking I could get the same 2MP quality AND video capability for an even better price.<br />Unfortunately, while the CX6200 takes good photos, they just aren't as crisp as the 4200's.  The CX6200 doesn't have a real lens cap, to begin with.  It only has a clear piece of plastic covering the lens, and this cover cannot be removed or replaced.  ....Which means 1) photo quality suffers because of the filtering effect of this plastic and 2) if the cover is scratched or discolored, you can say bye-bye to picture quality.  In picture comparisons, the 6200's photos seem to have more \"noise\" than the 4200's pics.<br />The 6200 apparently does not have an auto-focus lens, and it shows.<br />The 6200 also does not have the incredible close-up-photo ability that the 4200 had.  The 6200 takes decent close-ups, but once you get closer than 18 inches from the object it starts to get a little blurry.<br />Video Quality: Really grainy.  I wasn't expecting much, but this was about the minimum I was hoping for.  There is all kinds of noise (by noise I mean red/green/blue-ish pixels the camera inserts to fill in picture information), the video is in barely compressed QuickTime format, and the maximum video length is 30 seconds no matter what size memory card you have installed.  Oh, and there's no sound.  Even without sound and with such mediocre quality, a 30-second clip will cost you over 7MB.  This capability is only good for very casual clips in perfect conditions.<br />Those are most of the Cons.  PROS:<br />- Pretty good battery life--at least as good as the 4200 (using 1800mah NiMH).  As with all digital cameras, you MUST buy rechargeables.  Good battery life in video mode as well.<br />- The camera is just slightly smaller than the 4200, thanks to the rounded corners, and is very portable (but it may be a bit heavy).<br />- The LCD is as bright as advertised.  Definitely an outdoor display.<br />- The directional buttons are separate buttons, unlike the 4200's pad, which was clumsy to use.<br />- The pictures are good quality, sufficient for basic photo taking.  Colors are pretty good and it adapts well to changes in light.<br />- The camera allows you to take photos in black and white, and sepia, as well as true color.<br />- In addition to Good, Better, and Best quality settings, you can take wide photos at 3:2.<br />It's not a bad machine, but you're definitely only getting what you pay for.","This review is written from a value-for-money perspective. It's surprising what you get for such a low price. One of the good point of this camera is that it's also quite suitable for night photography (a tripod is needed though). Just simply turn off the flash, put it on a stable platform and adjust the exposure time upwards to +2 (in the menu settings). You can capture the ambience and dynamics of the city at night (illuminated buildings and streets, traffic etc.) or even firework with this. The results & colors are surprisingly good (a flash would ruin such nightscenes). To the contrary to some of the reviewers wrote, you can turn off the flash for the entire session, so it's not disabled for one photo only. The flash would go back to its default status (\"on\") when you turn off the camera. However, the camera comes with \"hidden\" costs in that you will have to buy rechargeable batteries and memory cards.<br />Pros: easy to use, good color balance, adjustable exposure time, basic but good functionalities (for the price), acceptable video quality considering the price<br />Cons: no protection for lens, digital zoom is a bit disappointing, no built-in rechargeable batteries, internal memory is very low (only 8MB), LCD screen is small, the sofware is indeed full of spyware (as a previous reviewer had wisely noted)","That's what it is. If that's what you want, then buy it. Mine didn't come with the sometimes-mentioned memory card. Got it day after Thanksgiving for $80, though. Photos look great on the computer screen (Sony 15\" LCD). Haven't seen prints.<br />Problems are:<br />* No carrying case or lens cover<br />* Viewfinder is off significantly from the lens. About 20% of what I photograph is out of the viewfinder.<br />No lens cap is just cheesy. There's no excuse for the latter. Hence the 3 stars.","Santa Claus was very inspired to give me this present!<br />I enjoy a lot taking pictures, but I am not a pro and I often feel uncomfotable with high-tech devices. This camera is perfect for someone wishing to take simple pictures and make short length movies with an easy to use camera.<br />Even if has only 2.0 mega pixels, the quality of the pictures is very good and so are the colors. Transfering pictures into the computer is very simple and the camera is so small and light, that it fits into a pocket.<br />Just make sure you buy good batteries and an extra memory, so that you won't have to transfer the pictures too often to your computer. I promise you will have a lot of fun.","This camera is perfect for a beginner digital camera user.  I have taken over 40 pictures and 3 videos and still have life left on the original batteries ( as long as you do what the book says on how to prolong battery life).  I am so happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone.","A fun, easy to use camera.  Docking station might be useful but I had no problem hooking this up straight to my computer's USB port (Windows XP).  You can pay a little less and get a lot less camera.  Picture quality with 2MP is very good on a PC, and we got nice 4\" X 6\" prints after uploading to an on-line printing source.","I got this camra from Santa and I was so excited!  If you are a beginner at taking pictures this is the camra for you!  It is sooooooooooooo user friendly.  My only complaint is that there is no falsh on video.  If you want a great digetal camra get this!","I wanted a decent digital camera to keep in the car for a minimum cost and this one is the best buy I found. It is simple, takes good pictures, fits in a pocket and has some features that make it a pleasure to use. For Macintosh OS X users, if you download version 3 of the EasyShare software from Kodak's web site it is as good or better than Apple's iPhoto software and interfaces with the camera in unique ways. I am very happy with it, but highly recommend buying rechargeable batteries or buying Kodak's dock which comes with rechargeable batteries.","I purchased two of these for Christmas.  I kept one for myself and gave one to my son and daughter-in-law.  We are all enjoying this cool camera and having fun sharing pictures via email.  It is simple to use and I was impressed with the picture quality.  For the money this is a really good camera.","For a hundred bucks you can't beat this little camera.  It's up and running within minutes of leaving the box, and setting it up to transfer the pictures to a computer was very simple (in fact, user error was the only misstep in the entire process; make sure those cables are snug...).<br />The picture quality was surprisingly high, which is a nice bonus.<br />My only quibble is the internal memory isn't very roomy (8 pictures on \"Best\" quality, 30 on \"Good,\" which is the lowest).  But, media cards are getting quite cheap nowadays, and since I planned on purchasing one anyway, it's not that big of a deal (the 128 MB card will hold 149/595 respectively).<br />Overall it's a nice beginner digital camera -- enough options to take good pictures, not so much that they'll overwhelm the user.","This is my first digital camera. It is easy to use and very affordable. I highly rate this camera for anyone. My 6 year old daughter even uses it for scrapbooking, it is that simple and the quality of pictures it takes is excellent. My daughter loves the black and white pictures while I love the color pictures and it is very simple to switch the mode to your choice.","I originally bought this as an inexpensive digital camera for my 12 year old for xmas.  And boy was I immediately impressed with it. The quality of the picture was excellent; had a nice zoom capability; the viewing screen was very user friendly and intuitive; and it was very, very simple to shoot and operate.  Then came the true test: whether I could download pictures to my PC.  And to my amazement, it was surprisingly simple and wonderfully packed with great features.  Loading an accompanying CD program was simple and rebooting my PC with Windows 98 easily loaded the driver for my USB connection.  With the USB cable that comes with the camera, I connected it to the PC, and simply told the easy to follow menu to grab the pictures. After that it was very easy to organize and edit the pictures, including Kodak's red eye elimination feature.  Emailing the pictures was a snap, sending pictures in a nice 3x4 size to the recipient.  I was so impressed with the ease of operation and quality at this price that I had to write this review, something I generally wouldn't bother with.  Compared with my girlfriend's $400 Minolta digital camera, the decision to buy this should be a \"no brainer.\"","I wanted to purchase a digital camera for  my daughters ages 15 and 17.  It needed to be simple enough to use with a short learning curve on the software and cheap enough to buy that I wouldn't mind them taking it everywhere or be upset when the day comes that it is lost or broken.  I read all the reviews on this site and they were SOOOOOOOOO helpful.  I decided on this camera based on that information...bought some insightful accesories also mentioned in the user reviews and packed them up upon arrival for Christmas morning.<br />The cameras were a huge hit.  They were wonderful.  Without reading the directions the girls had taken pictures, e-mailed them to friends, edited out the red-eye, made movies, screensavers, slide shows, and used up the extra batteries (I need to buy the rechargeables...do it right away.!!!)all this activity in under 24 hours.  Since the kids will not be printing out any or many pictures the 2mega pixel camera is just fine.  I am satisfied that we will  never have to wait to see their photos, pay for film, wait for developing and labor over photo albums ever again.<br />We are very happy with the camera.  Thanks to all who reviewed this before me...it made all the difference.","This is a great litle point and shoot camera. Perfect for a beginner digital camera. The only thing missing is an opitcal zoom but if you want that it's only fifty bucks more for the CX6230 (Also a great little cheap camera).","1st off, price.  This camera is less than $100 bucks for 2-megapixels.  Is 2MP enough you may ask?  Yes.  At least for the avg. joe that wants to take pictures to store on his computer or for fun.  I've used this for the past 2 weeks and I love it.  My brother can't stop asking me to borrow it.  The picture quality is great.  It takes pictures at 1600x1200 (I think this is 8x10).  I don't really plan on printing any but the usual 5x7 or 4x6 will come out just fine.  The video quality however is mediocore.  What do you expect from a cheap camera, the best of both worlds?  Nope, I bought this primarily for the camera feature and it works wonders.  I have a digi-camcorder for my videos anyways.  One other thing is I didn't like the fact that it doesn't have a lens cover.  I'm afraid to scratch it but I keep it in a case.  I know Logitech came out with a cool wallet digi-cam but it's 1.3MP and it's around 70-100 bucks.  I'll take the 2MP.  This camera is very simple to use as I learned all the features within 5 minutes.  I'd recommend this camera for the simple enthusiast!","This is my first digital camera and at $100, I figured at that price it was worth trying.  It is well worth the price, the camera takes good pictures overall.  It takes excellent pictures if the lighting is good, but gets pretty grainy on indoor shots if the lighting is not great.  All the outdoor shots I have taken have come out excellent and require little to no color correcting.  The camera has a video option with no sound, and you can record video up to your amount of memory.  If you use the LCD review screen often, it will eat up the batteries quick.  Using the viewfinder to take photos will help battery life significantly.  The camera has no optical zoom and I found pictures using the digital zoom to be quite grainy, so I don't use it for the most part.  The camera also doesn't have a lens cover, which would be a nice thing to have been added to the camera.<br />As another reviewer said, if you have Windows 2000 with SP4, you might run into problems with the Easy Share software.  I had trouble installing the software on 2 different machines.  Just make sure to get the newest software from the website (version 3.2 at time of this review).  Also, make sure you are logged in as Administrator, I had problems installing the software logged in with an account with administrator priveledges.<br />Overall, if you are looking for a basic point and shoot digital camera that takes good pictures, it is well worth the money.  I have tremendously enjoyed the camera.","I brought this for my son to take pics of my grand daughter and it woeks great!!!","We've enjoyed our EasyShare camera and have already taken hundreds of pictures. The pictures aren't high quality but do look good on the computer and in small prints. For the money it is worth it.","This camera is more than adequate for the price range. I had to return it, however, because i have Win2K with SP4. Apparently, the software does not work with this service pack. I then tried to access the updated software on the website. After about a half an hour i finally downloaded EasyShare 3.2 (the problem i have is documented on Kodak's site). This version gave me a different error. I asked Kodak for help via e-mail (which, incidentally, they try to hide on their site along with separate drivers). Their e-mail said contact within 24 hours, they never got back to me until i called an 800 number. Bad customer service, rude person on the phone, not worth my trouble. I have never had software from a new product just refuse to install until this camera software.<br />If you don't have Win2K with SP4 and need a handy, little camera with enough features and ability for most picture-taking, i think it's a decent camera. If you have any problems whatsoever, return the camera immediately instead of trying to get it to work.","Is it wrong to be in love with your digital camera? I can't even start to explain my deep feelings for my 'Kodak Easyshare CX6200'. Maybe it is it's sleek body and smooth design. It could be the way I feel like I'm always in charge in the relationship and it goes with me everywhere. It's not ashamed to be seen with me in public. And it never makes me look well, a little hippy in my pics I email my friends from my trip to the beach. It could be the way it looks at me with complete admiration. It never gets hostle and makes a great listener, but it does get a bit gassy around the holidays, but all the same wheter it's wrong or not it really is my soulmate.","Pros:<br /><br /> Super quality<br /> Best flash<br /> Advanced Software<br /> Email compatable<br /> Super battery life (except for the one it comes with)<br /> Strong<br /> Lightweight<br /> LCD Display<br /> Automatically emails when transferred<br /> Organized<br /> Bells and whistles<br /> Video option (if you have a Secure Digital Card)<br /> Wonderful camera lens<br /><br /> Cons:<br /><br /> Flimsy battery door<br /> Pictures are a bit darker than wanted (it can be fixed)<br /> Zoom only works with viewfinder (which drains battery)<br /> Triggers on when you do not want it to<br /> And worst of all, the batteries it comes with are intended to be used while you immediately run out of the house to get the batteries it needs.<br /><br /> Suggestions:<br /><br /> You do not need a Camera Dock.<br /> Best batteries are AA NiMH rechargeable batteries<br /> Do not leave it on overnight by accident or whatever<br /> Get at a 256 MB (or at least a 128 MB) Secure Digital Card if you want any videos<br /> Kodak Accessories are a bit pricey, so get the cheaper ones that work better.<br /><br /> The one thing that irritates me the most is they jacked down the price right after I bought it (and it was previously the cheapest 2.1 MP camera besides Aiptek which works horribly).<br /><br /> Fortunately, I can get my money back since it was only two weeks! I am 90% sure.","This digital camara is a very nice camara.  You can take photos and videos with this camara.  This camara comes with a program for your computer to load photos and videos from your camara to your computer.<br />You can take photos by looking in the viewfinder or the screen. Looking at the screen to take photos is more fun, but I get better photos with the viewfinder and the screen uses more power.<br />The camera came with Kodak batteries, but I would recommend rechargeable Energizer AA batteries with a charger ($1$$) because they can last up to 205 photos before you need to recharge the batteries.<br />The Kodak batteries only last about 140 photos before you need to BUY more batteries.<br />The camera comes with 8MB internal memory and a memory card slot.  You can also buy memory card for the camera 16MB,32MB,64MB,128MB and 256MB memory cards.<br />The internal memory is if you plan on taking 9 photos in the best photo quality with the best (3.2) setting you can take 10 photos before the memory is full.<br />The better photo quality can take about 18 photos before the memory is full and the good setting can take 30 photos before the memory is full.<br />You can also turn the flash on and off, a 10 second timer for the shutter, you can change from color to black & white or sepia.<br />Overall this is a very nice digital camera."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot A300","amazon_reviews":["Just as advertised","Good!","originally had older model which I dropped and it was under warrantee so it was replaced as part needed was not available. really happy with service.

The actual picture quality is great in my opinion for a 3.2 mp camera. The build quality is also solid. I've owned this for three years and it still works like new. I would not claim to be a photographer or even a photo enthusiast, but I am definitely a gadget type of person. There are some decent features such as red eye reduction, landscape setting, ability to record short videos and 5.1 digital zoom.<br /><br />The most substantial downside to the camera is the lack of physical zoom (i.e. telescoping lens). Because of this really any picture taken while in digital zoom is going to be pixelated. Secondly, pictures are difficult to recall. In order to get back to the taken picture you must cover the lens and then turn the camera off and then on again. Another problem is there are not many features to speak. However, considering the age of this camera I can't really say it is a problem. For the average person this is a perfect camera.

I bought the new Canon SD700 and very happy form Canon stuff.<br /><br />Don't expect $100.00 camera to do a $1000.00 camera's Job!!!!","This little camera is a great camera for someone who is new to photography. The settings that this little things has is wonderful. You can either run on autopilot and have it do the work for you or you can set the manual settings to your little hearts content. There are a few fun settings that you can add the background startup photo to one that you have taken or you  can add your own sound tot he startup as well. The only downside that I found with this camera is that it is a little fragile and if you drop it you better pray that you can pick i up in one peice. The pictures I took with this are awesome and pleased me until I moved onto bigger and better things, I highly recommend this camera to anyone who would like a cheap camera that has excellent results.","Sure, this camera has its drawbacks, but you'll never find a digital camera that is perfect.  I wish it was more compact, I wish it always took perfect, in-focus pictures without me putting in any effort, and I wish it was faster, but one might say that about any digital camera.  This is my first digital camera and I'm now ready to move on to a more modern camera that's more compact with better zoom and possibly more megapixels.  But I'm not sorry that I bought this camera and when I bought it, it cost me about $300 or so.  I am not an optimist and am by far the most cynical person I know and I still say this camera is a good buy, especially now that the price has plummeted.<br /><br />My main reason for liking this camera is its durability.  I've dropped it countless times (hard) and it remains in perfect physical & working condition.  Many people complain about the FlashCard/battery door breaking on other models but this camera is a rock!  The worst that happened when I dropped it is that the door swung open and the batteries came tumbling out.  Each time, I thought \"Oh, no!  I broke it!\" but soon realized it was intact and still working like normal.  And most of the time, I toss it into my knapsack without putting it in a case first (tsk, tsk) and the camera is still going strong.<br /><br />Also, with Canon cameras, many people get the E-18 error message or whatever it is on their screen and then their camera stops working completely.  I believe this is caused by sand getting into the camera.  I've never brought my camera onto the beach or anything, but I've had it not-so-clean places before and I never got that message with my trusty A300.<br /><br />Many people have said that this camera eats batteries like crazy, and that's true, if you use regular AA Duracells or Energizers or what have you.  I highly recommend you buy a set of 1 hour rechargeable batteries meant especially for digital cameras.  I bought a charger that came with two sets of batteries for $20 and these digital camera batteries last MUCH longer than normal AAs.  It's great!  You can use one set of batteries while the other set charges (it only takes an hour!)  So I have to wonder what kind of batteries these people who complain about the battery-eating are using.<br /><br />Size: it is a bit bigger than you might hope for but it never mattered much to me.  It won't fit in your pockets (unless you wear very baggy pants) but it fits just fine in my  knapsack.  But ladies, if you carry around a tiny purse, this will take up a lot of room in it.  It would also be nice if it was a tad lighter.<br /><br />I've gotten many great photos out of this camera.  I would say about half come out good, half come out not-so-good.  Two pictures I took with it came out so well that they won photo contests.  I think it was fun to experiment with the 'flower' button and flash button, etc.  I wish the mini-movies it takes didn't come out so dark.  But it got the job done.  It's pretty easy to use, too.  I figured out how to use the camera quickly.  I didn't even need the manual until it came time to download the pictures from my camera onto my computer (which also turned out to be easy).<br /><br />The only thing that really bothers me is the very slow reaction time.  Don't expect get any photos of your cat yawning, for example, or anything that happens that fast or faster.  It takes a little while to load when you first turn the camera on before you can start taking pictures but I've gotten used to it.  I would say that this is the A300's only major drawback.  If you're in a hurry to snap a photo or if you want to take a picture of something fleeting (like a yawn), you might get very frustrated by the delay time (I have).  But other than this problem, this sturdy camera was a breeze to use and I am happy to pass it on to my sister when I get a newer model.<br /><br />See my two contest-winning photos that were taken by my A300 in the photo gallery ('Customer Images') for this product!  They are the two rat pictures... Thanks for reading this and good luck!","I have found this camera to be surprisingly resilient to the repeated abuse I have given it.  It's not been left completely untarnished, but it still KIND OF works.<br /><br />When I left it outside in the sand during a thunderstorm in the fair town of Dirt, Louisiana, it woke up in the morning QUITE gritty and the buttons were a little stubborn, but it still worked perfectly.  Photos are of beautiful quality.<br /><br />I've banged it around the Caribbean without a care in the world, and while it was always a bit too slow to take successive photos of Puerto Rican farmers getting into a bar fight, it held up quite well.<br /><br />Real problems came after I dropped the poor thing into a hot spring in the Andes of Venezuela.  Luckily, I was able to retrieve it, but it would never be the same again.  The LCD is completely trashed and unusable and the flash is now nonexistent, but the durn thing still takes pictures!!  I can't believe it, either.  As long as I'm outside in the sun, photos and video turn out great and transfer effortlessly to my computer.<br /><br />In short, this camera will take a lot of wear.  It's a great camera to take on adventures (especially to places that don't have lithium batteries!), but go easy on the hot springs.","This was a great first camera for me and I feel like I got WAY more than I paid for.  3.2MP and high resolution allowed me to touch up in Photoshop and still allowed fantastic print quality.  Video recorder has audio.  There is no Optical Zoom, which is why I decided to get another camera after I felt like I've \"graduated\" from this one.  Buy, Ni-MH rechargeable batteries.  They last WAY longer and this way, you won't have to own your own battery company to like this camera.<br /><br />Oh, and since Canon cameras all have digic chip processor and pretty much the same operating format, after you're done with this camera, you won't have any trouble when you upgrade to any of the fancier Canon models.","I recently purchased this camera with high expections. So far the jury is still out.  This is a good beginners camera, and beginners will love the picture quality vs that of 35 mm. I also love the fact of being able to print pictures directly from the camera (with the printer it comes with) without having to use a pc.  The cons are this camera goes through batteries. I am thinking about buying stock in a battery company. After pressing the shutter button, the camera takes it's time to produce the image. The user's guide is wordy. I just sat down one weekend and read through the guide and practiced with the features on my camera, only to have my batteries die out twice during the process.","I bougth this camera on January 2004 and I already sold it. Quality pictures was pretty good, but time between shots is really long. When you ask somebody to take a picture for you it is very very embarasing because many times the shutting button just doesn't work. I think this is not a good election to buy please check other trademarks since I have read this problem also occurs with other CANON cameras.","This camera is affordable and I should perhaps not expect any better.<br /><br />To sum up. It is qutie big, but that I knew when I bought it. But on the other hand it doesn't weigh that much. The quality of the pictures are good. The camera has a few times reset its clock. Making me having to set the clock before I could take the picture. There are also some troble taking the picture. You should press the button half down and wait for the camera to focus and be ready before you press it all the way down to take the picture. Otherwise it sometimes refuses to take the picture. It also takes a looooong time to take a picture. Making you miss some spescial moments. Otherwise however it works fine. It is easily installed, and used with the PC.","I purchased this camera a while ago, and while I was generally pleased with the picture quality and other functionality, the camera has an intolerable flaw: the slow shutter time.  It takes an eternity between the time you press and hold down the button and the time the picture actually takes.  This gets pretty embarrassing and frustrating when you're asking other people to take pictures of you and your friends.  I got sick of saying \"You have to hold it down for a long time...even longer...there we go\"  I gave up in the end, and bought a different camera.","This camera is extremely cheap.  Although it is a bargain and not a bad camera, I found it too frustrating for regular use.  I took the camera on an extended trip and discovered the following foibles:<br /><br />1, It eats through a set of 2 AA batteries in 20 - 40 pictures, depending on how much the flash is used (using LCD screen for every shot but for minimum possible time).<br /><br />2, If you close the cover before the yellow light has stopped flashing, the camera thinks the batteries are finished and needs to be re-set four times before it will behave properly.  Note to Canon: why not just take pictures until there's no more juice?<br /><br />3, It takes an age to take the picture.  Whenever I pressed the button, it always took several seconds.  Occasionally, the camera would just click and whir for 10 seconds without doing anything.  I missed several great pictures because of this.  If I asked anyone else to take a picture with the camera, I had to specifically warn them because this camera is UNUSUALLY slow.<br /><br />4, There is no obvious \"fill-in\" flash and the regular flash was too aggressive.  Under indoor daylight conditions, the performance was fine but indoor dark conditions were difficult.<br /><br />On the plus side, the pictures turned out nice and sharp, pretty well exposed, except for the flash problems I've already noted.  I guess that's all I could really ask for.  My next camera will probably cost four times as much but at least I won't spend my whole vacation foaming at the mouth.","The camera offers a lot of features for the price. It is also compact, and the case is sturdy, and appears to be good quality. From the get-go I had problems with the memory card. It got stuck at first (needed pliars to remove) then it would not even read the card. According to Canon.com, my problem was due to a defect in the camera, which I recently sent back. (needless to say, Amazon returns/customer service is awesome!). Aside from the card problem, I found the camera not particularly user friendly. I read the long user manual, but had to continually consult it to operate the cameara, and do simple point and shoot shots. I began to forsee myself in the future on a vacation needing to bring the manual with me everywhere I went, in case I pressed one wrong button and was unable to figure out where to go next with it. In additon, I was unable to access one menu option even after reading and re-reading the particular section to address it. Since I had to return the camera since it was defective, I chose not to purchase a canon again, primarily because of the lack of \"user friendly\" buttons and method of accessing and changing the menus. Lastly it takes a pause before recording the image you are trying to capture, because of the auto focus. So if trying to photograph a moving child (like I was) I continually got blurry pictures, and often missed the shot I wanted because the auto focus caused such a delay (in other words you press the button to take the picture, and about a second or so later, it actually takes the picture). Hope this information helps. Except for the issues I mentioned, the picture clarity, resolution, and ease of uploading to computer etc were excellent. Using rechargable bateries also was fine, they did not drain very fast.","I've had several digital cameras in the past, though some were cheap, others expensive.  I've been amazed of how fast these digital cameras have dropped in price. This once was over $200, & now it's just over $100. Checking out the features low-cost, high quality (both camera and pictures), easy to handle,perfect for first time user. My daughter who was going away to school was never comfortable w/digitals, (she always wanted the kodak throwaways). I wanted her to capture some of her experiences & to be able to share & relive them at some future time. So when I loaded it up w/new batteries and a new CF card, I stuck it in her luggage w/the instructions and nothing else. A week later I had to pick her up for an appointment. Her priority was not bringing home laundry but to have her camera! She wanted to share, put online, etc. with both family and friends. So if you want something high quality, a no brainer, inexpensive, for yourself or your kids, you've found it!","I bought this inexpensive camera for my young son and I to play around with, and it has met my needs and expectations. However...<br /><br />* I had problems installing the software under Windows 98. I eventually solved the problem, but it was time-consuming and not fun. See below.<br /><br />* The flash is pretty useless<br /><br />My PC is running Windows 98, and I could not get the software to install. The installation process hung at \"Please wait while installing ZoomBrowser EX\", and after connecting the camera the PC could not find a driver to update.<br /><br />I spent a fair amount of time tried many things (suspecting some sort of UCB conflict, and complications from preexisting problems with an external hard drive). I found one reference on the web to the same problem, without a resolution.<br /><br />In the end, I found a relevant Canon page (see below), and carefully followed suggestions AND was careful to install only the TWAIN driver at first. The installation succeeded, and I uploaded the pictures to Microsoft \"Picture It\". I suspect the crucial step is that the camera must be connected both during the initial install-from-disc, AND during the subsequent reboot. This is not emphasized in the Canon material about installation problems.<br /><br />After that I installed ZoomBrowser EX. I got the same hang, but after aborting the install the ZoomBrowser seems to be installed and functioning. Pretty good software, too. (...)","I'd been wanting a digital camera for a long time, but I just knew that I'd kick myself when prices came down. (My best pal bought one for 599 last year that is going for 199 now!) But when I saw the price for this one, I thought \"how can you lose?\" I'd read the negative reviews, and decided to take them seriously, but not let them swing my opinion. When I got the camera, I was really pleased with the size. It's pretty small, but it doesn't feel like it'll fall apart in your hand. Granted, the batteries that came with it were used up after about 10 shots (shooting, viewing and downloading). But the $1.99 energizers I put in are still going strong after about 20 more shots (including the downloads)(It uses two plain old \"AA\"'s). I just try to remember to turn it right off after I'm done shooting or downloading. It takes a few moments to turn on and to actually snap the shot (it has the shutter has this half position where I assume it's taking a light reading?) but I can't imagine, unless you're shooting rapid action shots, like a race or something, that it'd be a huge detraction. A plus is that it comes with the cable you need for downloading. The Canon case for it is about five bucks separately, and is worth it. Anyway, if you are using the camera for more specialized kind of photography, you probably want something better, and aren't looking for an inexpensive all around camera. But if you want something small to take on vacation, take snaps of buildings and landscapes or to shoot posed shots of family and friends, this is a great choice.","I recently received my camera & am very pleased with the features.  However, I was halfway thru setting up my camera when the batteries it came with started to go low & I was given the sign to \"replace the battery pack\".  I am also disappointed with the fact that MY camera DID NOT come with a flashcard - I had to go out and purchase that from the store.  It would have been nice to know that ahead of time!!!!","This camera works great!!!! I love the picture quality and all the things you can do with this camera. I still use the memory card that came with my camera because it can hold up to 32 pictures. I purchased some Sony rechargeable batteries and charger so battery life is not a problem. All in all its a good buy!","Installing the software for this camera was a nightmare.  It turns out there were conflicts with the Install Shield feature built into Windows.  Contacting Canon thorugh e-mail and phone turned out to be an exercise in futility.  I did a web search on the error message (1607), and found there are many others using Canon products having this problem.  I ended up having to reinstall Windows.  When I contacted Canon, I simply asked them if they knew of a downloadable patch to facilitate downloading their software.  They told me to contact Install Shield.  Install Shield's website refers you back to the manufacturer (Canon).  Had I known about the level of hassle I would experience in advance, I would have purchased an Olympus.","I bought this for my mother for her birthday.  Picture quality is outstanding and the videos you can take are great also.  Very easy to use, and for 50 bucks you can add a larger Compact Flash card so you can take hundreds of pictures or more video.  It does come with a 16mb card which isn't bad for starters.  Of course, as with any digital camera, rechargeable batteries are a good investment.  The only thing missing on this camera would be optical zoom.  I got this for under 100 bucks...unbeleivable!","My first digital camera frustrated me initially. I kept having to wipe of the batteries and reload them for the power to stay on. Then they died permanently. These were the batteries that came with the camera. But, I had much better performance with some Rayovac alkalines.<br /><br />As a beginner I also became frustrated with the myriad of settings viewed thru the LCD monitor.<br /><br />Now that I am familiar with the camera, I am happy with it.  It is easy to upload the pictures to a computer.","If you need small cameras, you have to typically settle for picture quality that LOOKS like it came from a tourist gadget.<br /><br />Not this one! Despite its budget price (and what a steal it is) the colors are vivid and the pics sharp as crystal. Occasionally you could get overexposed results, but that's easily sorted out with white-balance settings.<br /><br />The only potential negative is the legend of barrel distortion on small Canon cams, but I still have to see what that looks like (and I take several architecture pics).<br /><br />A great steal of a small camera, it sure doesn't behave like one!","This Canon PowerShot A300 3.2MP digital camera is great!  For about $109 it is a bargain with 64MB of CF card.  There may be no optical zoom lens but the digital zoom of 5.1x does a pretty good job.  It may look de-pixilated at the zoom of 5.1x but when the pictures come out it is better looking with a bit blurry.  There is a micro feature too that allow you to take picture of small stuff as close as 2 inch away.<br /><br />Overall, I have it for about two weeks and I am pretty happy with it.","This camera takes beautiful pictures for use on the web. Printed versions are not nearly the quality as those you take with a regular film camera, but that's a given.  We like the fact that this camera has video, but the video quality is nothing compared to the photo quality so I consider just a bonus to have that feature. If you want good video, I wouldn't get this camera.  It's been well worth the money, and while some reviews I read while researching this camera said it sucked up batteries, I haven't experienced that.  I use the monster rechargeable batteries and they last quite a while.","The other reviewers have covered this beginner's digital camera extensivesly. I just want to give you my two cents regarding two issues.<br /><br /> 1. Lack of optical zoom. For my primary digital camera I demand optical zoom, and no less than 3x of optical zoom. If you travel a lot like I do, optical zoom is a must. If, on the other hand, you shoot a lot of party pictures, it's not as important. The A300 lacks optical zoom, so it's better used as a secondary camera, which is how I use it, kinda like a pocket camera. Two advantages of no optical zoom: 1) the camera operates more quickly, and 2) the lens mechanism won't break as fast.<br /><br /> 2. Three megapixels. Nowadays even 5MP models have become immensely affordable. A lot of people overlook the facts that 1) most digital pictures never get printed, and 2) you can get great 6x4\" prints from 2MP, not to mention 3MP. In fact, you can get great 5x7\" or even larger prints from 3MP. On most photo printers, too many megapixels are wasted anyway. What's more important is the overall image quality. There are 5MP cameras that take underexposed and ugly pictures. The A300 continues Canon's tradition of superior image quality.<br /><br /> For this price, the A300 is a must-have for gadget lovers and people looking for an easy-to-use starter digicam.","I bought this camera as a spare for taking pictures while on vacation.  It is nothing like my 10D or Pro 1, but I only paid $150 for the A300. The pictures are very decent, and much better then most, if not all cameras in this price range and class.  Simple to use, readily availble AA batteries, and it shares the same Compact Flash cards with my other cameras.","The Canon PowerShot A300 takes some really awesome pictures.  It has a lot of features that are easy to figure out and is user-friendly to those new to the digital cam world.<br />A couple pros:<br />-Takes great pictures, even when set to low quality (1 megapixel)<br />-ISO<br />-Great quality for price<br />-Many features<br />A couple cons:<br />-Eats through batteries in minutes.  A suggestion would be to turn off the LCD when using the camera.  The LCD isnt very necessary for taking pictures, anyways.  Also, buy some Canon NIMH rechargable batteries.  I found some at Circuit City for $35.  If you dont get NIMH batteries, you'll go through a 12 pack of regular batteries in an hour.<br />-Flash doesnt reach far enough.  Sometimes I find that using the camera in low-light situations is pointless because the flash wont even reach the object I'm taking a picture of.<br />-Sometimes \"automatic\" features (ISO, flash, etc) make the picture come out blurry or fuzzy.  Try experimenting with the features to find something that suits you.<br />For the money, its a great camera, but dont expect miracles out of it.","This is my first digital camera. I wasn't looking for anything major. Mainly I wanted the camera for taking pictures that I might not want to have developed.  Just everyday pictures to share with family and friends. Also, I thought it would be handy for when I go househunting.<br />So far, I am impressed. I have been using the superfine setting for the medium-2 size.  The clarity of these pictures is wonderful. I haven't used it enough to speak on the battery eating that other reviews have mentioned.  But I did buy a charger and some NiMH batteries.  I have had to change the battery once and that was also because we left it open.  I have managed to take over 40 pictures and several movies if that means anything to you.<br />For the price and the discount on the memory card (I went for the 128 MB version), I think this camera is a great deal and perfect for someone wanting to get their first digital camera without breaking the bank.<br />*Updated*<br />I just took this camera on a weekend trip.  I didn't have to change the batteries.  I turned off the LCD screen (I don't like using that for pictures anyway), and I turned the camera off between pictures. Worked beautifully and the pictures look great too.","I was reeeally skeptical about this camera, regarding the battery problems that many of the readers encountered. But I got it anyway from Target. I haven't used the enclosed batteries, rather I went to Fry's Electronics and made a purchase of a set of 4 [no name brand] rechargable batteries.<br />To my surprise, I've had noooo problems with the camera draining the batteries! I've had the camera for 2 weeks now, I've turned it on and off at least 20 times... and have taken at least 50+ shots with the flash on, and I'm still using the the set of charged batteries. No joke. It's pretty amazing.<br />I've had an older model of the Kodak digital camera, and the batteries it used was a Kodak factory made, and it was very disappointing to say the least.<br />I don't know if it's a hit or miss with this Canon model, but mine's been working out just fine. Last note, yes, it's kinda strange without the optical zoom, but like another reader had stated, shoot it at the highest resolution, don't digital zoom, then just crop whatever you need [if needed], it'll come out just fine.","This camera is certainly not top-of-the-line, but it's not bad for the money. It takes beautiful daytime pictures, but night shots tend to be blurry (you can fiddle with shutter speed and white balance though). If you want to become a professional photographer, this is not the camera for you; but if you're looking for a decent camera at a decent price, this is a great buy.<br /> Also, I have to disagree with previous posts about additional costs - 128mb cards can be found as cheap as $30-40, and an Energizer recharger with 4 NiMH batteries is $20 at Target. With these minor additional costs, you'll have a lifetime of memory and battery life.","I upgraded to this model from a polaroid pdc640, so its lightyears better than what I'm used to.  I'm a bargain hunter so I got a good deal on this and a 256meg CF card.  As mentioned by most all previous reviews, this thing EATS regular alkalines.  Buy some decent NI-MH AAs and a charger...and save some benjamins, seriously.  Here's a list of what I like about this camera:<br />-easy to switch to movie mode and back<br />-15fps movies are excellent quality and have SOUND!<br />-easy to change picture quality (hit FUNC>left or right>FUNC)<br />-no drivers needed with Windows XP (just plug it in and POOF!)<br />-excellent quality pictures even at low-res<br />-changable startup image/theme and sounds<br />-powerful flash lights up a pitch black room<br />-lens protector keeps the lens cleen/unscratched<br />-auto focus works well in good-light conditions and easy to use<br />Things that aren't as good<br />-auto focusing takes a while in low light, I turn AF off most times<br />-EATS batteries, buy rechargables. do it.<br />-digital zoom...what do you expect for the money (compare a 3.2mp sony)<br />-no TV-out (no complaint here)<br />-16mb card will last you about 20 pictures at the highest resolution (fortunately CF is cheaper than memory stick, SD, MMC...)<br />This camera is great for close-ups, short videos, any generally any type of picture that zoom is not a priority.  Personally I love it, but if you want to be able to zoom in on your subjects, definitely pony up the cash and move up to a more expensive camera.","This is the second digital camera that I've owned. I had a Fuji<br />digital for the previous 5 years and it served me well for basic<br />photos, just a bit weak on the megapixs (1.3), and after the first couple of years; the controls became less dependable.<br />The Canon A300 has easy-to-use controls, takes digital movies with sound, stitches several pictures together to make a panoramic print, takes gorgeous closeups within a few inches of subject and transfers the pictures to a pc or other device in a snap with a excellent photo program that allows cropping, editing, etc...<br />There are drawbacks to this model - the digital telephoto isn't too good past 2.5X (goes up to 7.5x), no optical telephoto, uses AA alkaline batteries as if they were candy, the battery and compactflash card door isn't located right as I keep unlocking it when I turn the camera on with the protective lenscap that slides towards it. I would strongly suggest rechargable NIMH batteries and a recharger.<br />There are better digital cameras out there, but for the low price and features, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to<br />start digital photography with an inexpensive investment.","I rec'd this digi camera for X-mas and so far have been very happy with it. I'm an old school claims adjuster and very used to my Nikon 35mm camera that I have been using for 19 years. I can't believe all I need to do is take the mem card  to Wal-Mart and have the pics processed in 15/20 minutes. NO more film, processing and having to wait for a day or two to return to PU the film.  I did buy the 128K mem card ... and rechargeable battery ..., but I find these costs reasonable considering the films packs I used to buy and then the film processing costs and travel time to pick up the film. From what I hear battery life is not to great but again I have been lucky. Although I have 4 spare batteries in my camera bag; I'm still on the first set . My boss has an Olympus and he goes through a 10 pack in a day. The pics are great along with the photo detail (very sharp 4X6's).<br />Good luck with your camera. I'm very happy with mine.","I've purchased this camera on July 02.  Pictures are just wonderful!!!  Display is not intuitive ... but after a while features are easy...<br />Regular batteries last max. 2 minutes - I personally suggest rechargeable NIMH which last approx. 80/90 shots.","We got this camera as a Christmas gift so for the price WE paid it's great, but I would never have bought this camera!<br />What good is paying $159 for a camera that is only half decent AFTER you pay $100 for 128mb card and $50 for a battery charger and 4 batteries?<br />Sure, the camera takes fine pictures in good light with little or no digital zoom, so it's great for parties or close range, if that's what you need.<br />I took the camera on a trip to Europe and was sooooo disappointed with the battery consumption.  I was forced to buy batteries in all the most tourist-trap places, three times a day, for top dollar!  Then, the enemic memory card it came with filled up in one day, so I had to buy a bigger card in an equally tourist-trap store.  And yes, I bought a battery recharger on my trip as well.  How much does my entry-level $159 camera cost now????<br />And just a word about digital zoom.  NEVER use digital zoom if optical zoom in available, and NEVER buy a camera that has didn't bother including ANY optical zoom!<br />Save up a little money and buy yourself a better camera.","I am as happy as Larry with this camera. It takes terrific shots, fits in my pocket, so goes everywhere with me.<br />No excuses for having missed a fantastic shot wherever I go.<br />It's \"Quickdraw McGraw\" with the best gun in town!","I received this as a christmas gift this year. this is great i love it. all other digitals that i have used dont compare. the picture quality is awsome as is the movie playback quality when downloaded to your pc. cant wait to get the portable 4X6 printer to go along with it.!!!","I originally bought this camera when it was hard to get during the summer of 2003 (just out on the market) for work. We sell magazine photo guides and take approx. 75-100 photos per day. The camera takes EXCELLENT pictures for the price. Problem is the battery life. The cameras that we use previously lasted 1-3 days with one set of batteries. This camera I have photographers changing out batteries 2-3 times A DAY.<br />If you don't take pictures that often, this is great for you. If you use your digital camera often, research more. I've bought the A60 (despite peoples complaints about the E18 error message) and Nikons. Both have better battery life.","This is my first digital camera, a christmas gift from my sweetheart. It's great...it has great features...I agree with most of the other reviews that I've read. When I first opened it I was expecting to be able to use it with no problems as I'm pretty handy with things like this. However, I wasn't able to do so, I had to read quickly throught the manual. I wasn't able to take a picture until the next day. I took several videos the first night. The next day, the battery was dead...and I had only used it for 15-20 minutes max. I changed batteries and not too long after the same thing, dead batteries. Other than that the clarity is wonderful and once you've taken a read through of the manual you're good to go.<br /> I would recommend this for anyone young or anyone for a first digital camera.<br /> I'm planning on getting the rechargable battery pack as well as the AC adapter so that I don't have to get frustrated. These items are a bit pricey but less than continually buying batteries OR misisng a great shot due to battery failure.<br /> ENJOY...","I am 14 years old and received this camera on the back and it is great.  I bought a 128mb memory card to go along with it, the more the better.  So far I have clearly noticed the really good parts about the camera...and the not so good parts.<br />I'll start off with the not so good parts--<br />1) As with all digital cameras the batteries run out very quickly (and thats an understatement).  Although I do not own any rechargable batteries, I would still recommend them.  I litterally go through around 2-4 each day I use it.<br />2) A lot of buttons on the back.  The buttons are very confusing when you first start fiddling around with the camera but once you look through the guide, you'll figure it out.<br />3) No optical zoom<br />The good parts--<br />1) The camera is small and can easily fit in a pocket.<br />2) With a nice size memory card you can store tons of pictures.  With my 128 mb card I can store 77 on the highest quality but I don't even need to use the highest so I keep it on either the setting that allows 125 or 225.<br />3) The video mode is cool and can even record sound!<br />4) The digital zoom.  Sure digital zoom can make pictures grany but if you put it in a high quality you can zoom without giving up too much.<br />5) It's a fun thing to have.<br />6)  Great value!<br />I know that I am probably forgetting things but all in all I have enjoyed this camera and would recommend it to everyone!","I bought this camera right after it was released in April 2003 and I'm happy with my purchase. For less than $200, this camera gives you a lot.<br />I never use most of the features of the camera. If you like to play around with it, I guess you can create many neat effects on your photos or videos.<br />This camera comes with a 16MB CF card but I recommend using a 256MB CF card (although this might be way too much for most people) so you won't have to worry about memory.<br />Remember to format the CF card using the camera before using it for the first time to avoid problems. I have experienced lock-ups with this camera, but I suspect it has to do with my large capacity CF card. I figured that I can avoid this problem by formatting the card after every download to the computer.<br />Data transfer between the camera and computer is fast.<br />It uses 2AA batteries. USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES! The normal disposable batteries that were included in the package only lasted a few photos and some 2 minutes of video.<br />As an amateur photographer I can say that the picture quality is great. My pictures come out clear and sharp, with correct and realistic colors, so I don't have any complaints.<br />The video+sound quality is EXCELLENT.<br />I use this camera with a 256MB CF Card, four AA rechargeable batteries (2 for use, 2 for spare) and a battery charger. I also have the carrying case for the Powershot for easier storage.<br />I recommend visiting powershot.com for more technical details.","I've had this camera for 5 months now, and it has survived rock climbing, ice climbing and few high altitude drops (about 20 feet), and this camera has still survived it all. My only complaint, which I guess more a comment then anything, is that I wish Canon had tried to compress the pictures a little.  Anyway.  The picture quality is excellent, but I noticed that when you zoom to anything, the picture clarity diminishes a little, and at sometimes, depending on the conditions, can come out blurry.<br />The good is that the camera is excellent for those people who go out and are the outdoors type person.  This camera is a little light, and can be put into a camping bag or your car glove box.  The media this camera uses is Compact Flash.  Which by the way, is one of the cheapest media that is currently out in the market.  So it will be easy for you to upgrade from the 16 mb card that comes with the camera.  Trust me, don't be caught with 16mb, and run out when you are camping, or out somewhere and you're out of pictures. Done that, isn't pretty.  The connection between camera and computer (threw the USB port connection) is moderate and batteries consuming.  I would recommend a card reader for this camera, since at times, this camera can eat up batteries.  If you want longevity for your camera using the batteries, I had best luck and longer usage using Energizer e2 Lithium Batteries.  I tried the basic batteries, and after 5 shots, I would run out of battery usage.  With the Energizer e2, I could make 5 long movies (14 sec's each) and still could take more pictures afterwards.","This is my first Digital Camera!<br />I got this camera for my 15th birthday from my dad, he is VERY picky about how well it works, how fast and if it works at all.<br />I read through the manual, which is kinda long, but you don't have to read all of it to figure it out. After finishing the manual, I took about 8 pictures, and 4 movies, the batteries seemed fine, but when it came time to cut the cake and sing happy birthday, I couldn't take pictures because the batteries were dead!<br />I just flipped them (took the batteries out, reversed them so the batteries were switched) and the camera worked fine again, I still have to figure out how to get the best quality.<br />Speaking of quality, the reviewers are lying! When I use the digial zoom to the fullest, it is not fuzzy, choppy or anything! The images are still great, and the quality on this camera is EXCELLENT!<br />When I loaded the images to my computer, the set up disks were very easy to follow, and very fast. and Loading was a piece of cake! It took less than 10 seconds to bring everything to my files.<br />This camera is so much fun, but to enjoy it to the fullest, I suggest these purchases:<br />1. A Camera Case (to keep this baby safe)<br />2. A 4 pack of rechargeable batteries (you'll need 4, two to use, and two to charge, then between times, you never have to wait. You'll always have one pair ready to go)<br />3. A battery Charger (Unfortunately these can be pricey but they are worth it)<br />4. An AC adapter (the thingie that plugs into the wall, they're useful while you charge batteries or to save you $$$)<br />5. A larger flash card (I find the 16MB just fine)<br />6. A Warrenty in case something goes wrong (the camera comes with a one year warrenty through canon already, but I suggest one through the store you buy the camera too)<br />I'm very lucky to have had all these things from my CD player, so I my dad only paid for the camera and warrenty, which was an excellent price for 3.2 MegaPixels. With other cameras, you are bound to pay more on flash cards, batteries, equipment etc...<br />Remember to enjoy this Camera :) It's loads of fun!","This is a great camera for the price. I am a novice photographer and I need something with a good resolution. This is it! The few downfalls this camera has are that it eats up batteries so I recomend that you use the optional AC adapter. Another downfall is that it doesn't have an optical zoom. I don't recomend using the digital zoom because the picture becomes blurry. I recomuend using Picture It! and croping the picture.","I've been using Nikon and Leica film cameras for more than seven years and been a firm believer in prime lens, for the better image quality. Now that I'm shopping for a P&S digital camera for my wife, with the same kind of thinking in mind, I checked out A300, for its non-zoom lens.<br />After playing with A300 at Circuit City for a while, ironically, I have to say you do need a zoom lens for these little digital cameras. Not that I have suddenly developped inclination for zoom convenience, but that when shooting at close range, the lens distortion is so severe and shocking. The traditional approach of \"getting close to subject\" won't work here. You have to get further away then zoom in to bring the subject back, in order to mitigate the distortion.<br />Have to use a longer focal length (e.g. zoom in) when a shorter one will typically do, there're other disadvantages: easier image blur from camera shake, less flexibility in shooting angles, etc. This shortcoming appears to me quite limiting, especially A300 already has a 1-stop slower lens (f3.6 vs. f2.8) compared with other models, say, Canon A60, for similar price.<br />Due to the general limited optics quality on these cameras, I don't think the difference between 3.2M (A300) vs. 2.1M (A60) pixels is big deal anymore. This factor might well be overshadowed by many other ones that also bear impact on the final image quality. So I'll just pick up A60 for quick digital jobs, and leave more demanding ones to my old trusty Nikon and Leica.","I bought this camera for 200 bucks and can say that I am quite satisfied, and somewhat surprised at the quality. The pictures are great - the camera is 3.2 megapixels and it really does make a difference! The pictures come out so clear and bright! The camera has a good zoom on it, and is very easy to use. After a couple of hours of fidgeting around with it, I pretty much had all the basics and then some down. It was easy to set up the software in my computer - took about ten minutes. The only problems that I have with this camera are: 1. the battery life is short - but battery life is short on all digital cameras, so I guess compared to others this one isn't bad. 2.) If the lighting is not great, there will be a long delay before the picture takes. doesn't seem like that big of a deal but it can get annoying. 3.) I can only download the pics from my camera onto my computer once at a time. If I want to empty out som e more onto my computer later, I have to shut down the whole computer and start it back up again in order to download more pictures.<br />But, that's the only qualms I have. So, considering that I only paid 200 bucks, I am very, very happy with this camera.","It's great if you just need a point-and-shoot no fuss camera and optical zoom doesn't matter to you. It colors are gorgeous, especially outdoors during the day. Drains batteries like crazy, slightly over 20 photos and the battery was flat. Slightly bulkier that I'd like, but it's a Canon at a reasonable price. I use it primarily for email and web publishing so image quality is not very important to me.","This is a surprising camera.  I have no idea why it's so inexpensive.  The video alone is amazing!  Those who complain that it has no optical zoom have never used a digital camera before.  You don't need a zoom in the view finder.  I hear it uses batteries quickly, but it only takes 2.  I use the rechargable batteries and I can fill up a 256 mb card twice before I need to replace them.  This is my second digital camera, I got my first one 4 years ago and just moved up to this one.  It's not very user-friendly.  You will need to refer to the book often for a while.  The programs that it comes with are fantastic, too.  You can convert the .avi to .mpeg, you can put them on disk and play them on your dvd player and watch on your t.v. or that also makes the files small enough to email them to family and friends.  I love this camera!!!","Given that digital camera prices keep falling, and steeply for the higher end models, this camera is almost a steal. At under $200 for a 3.2 megapixels this camera is an excellent buy (at least in 2003!).<br />I have had this camera for less than a month and first impressions:<br />- Photo quality is excellent. Best results if you are shooting with lots of light, either daylight or indoors.<br />- ISO 50 mode gives you the best results.<br />- Consumes lots and lots of battery power. Trying to learn the camera controls used up a two AA pack in less than 90 mts. Go for the NiMH rechargeables. Will save $$$<br />- Most of the controls can be understood without reading the manual. The manual itself can be quite intimidating, so try to understand the controls by tinkering around with the camera itself.<br />- Best photo quality is to be had under the Superfine and Large settings. File sizes at this setting can be as large as 2MB.<br />- Get a 256 MB or larger flash card.<br />- File transfer with the usb connection seems a bit slow, especially when transfering a full 256 MB flash card worth of contents.<br />- Flash is quite difficult to use. At close distances it tends to whiten everything in its wake, and at moderate distances it seems too weak to do anything useful!<br />- Noise is considerable at ISO 400 setting. Therefore, shoot at 50 or 100.<br />- Videos are reasonably sharp. the 640x480 mode creates large files (approx 25MB) of ok sharpness.<br />- the images tend to be a bit on the softer side.<br />For the price this camera is an absolute steal. Of course you do not get an optical zoom, nor can you control the depth of field, or the shutter speed with this model, but this model is meant to be a starter model...","This camera works great! We bought it right before our vacation and we were so glad we did. It is easy to use and the pictures are so clear! Great zoom and the movie mode is just awesome! Very happy with it. Couldn't believe the low price!","A good solid camera at an excellent price.  My only complaint, and it's a big one, is that the zoom feature is practically useless. All pictures that I use the zoom on come out blurry.","The Canon A300 packs a lot of features for a low price. Its user friendly, has a good internal zoom lens and comes with great photo editing software. I strongly recommend getting recahrgeable batteries. The best thing is that I can shoot all the pictures I want and then edit them later. If you're wary of making the change from film to digital, don't be. This camera makes it painless for the digital novice and the pictures are very nice.","I love this camera. It is perfect for carrying along to catch those special moments, with either photo or movie clip. I do not enjoy carrying the larger movie cameras and this is just right for me.  I love the pictures, they are very clear and have excellent color. I too would like the batteries to last longer, however I noticed the change battery pack message shows up before the power is actually gone.  I just keep using it until it stops and then change the batteries. I plan to get rechargeables but for today, I am in love.","This is my first digital camera and while I was camera searching there are two very important things that you have to take into consideration. One is the type of media storage (CF or SD memory), and the other is the type of battery it uses. When I was deciding which one to buy it was between an Olympus and a Canon.<br />What I noticed about the Olympus camera that I didn't like was that it uses XD memory cards which is only made for Fuji, Olympus, and Toshiba cameras making it extremely expensive to purchase memory. The Canon uses CF memory which is the cheapest out there and can also be used in your PDA and MP3 player making it's versatility a plus.<br />Now with ALL digi cams that use AA batteries it will drain quickly if you use the LCD viewfinder and flash. If you use NiMH rechargable batteries then expect those batteries to drain a whole lot quicker. This is true for Nikon, Fugi, Kodak and ALL other cameras too.<br />Now even though the A300 doesn't have optical zoom it's digital zoom doesn't skimp on the quality. Made for XP users plug and play via USB cable. And the software that comes with it is okay but, if you use Windows XP then you might want to things simple and use the picture viewer to edit pics. And when your done with that head over to Snapfish to develope your edited pictures.","this camera is geared towards the casual photographer who is looking for good resolution (3MP) in a compact and lightweight package and doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a digicam.<br />pros:<br />- great resolution for the price - 3MP!<br />- uses the same DIGIC processor as Canon's high-end G3 and EOS 10D - great pictures!<br />- you can use this as a point and shoot but it still allows a degree of manual control when you want to be more creative with your shots<br />- focus assist light for low-light situations<br />- has exposure compensation<br />- two autofocus modes<br />- ISO 50-400 range<br />- the interface makes plenty of useful features quickly accessible - once you get the hang of it<br />- voice annotation available<br />- VGA movie mode with sound (limited to 30 seconds)<br />- uses non-proprietary AA batteries; i recommend buying rechargeables though<br />- reasonable shot to shot time for this class of camera<br />- USB connectivity<br />- and you can get all this for less than a couple of c-notes!<br />cons:<br />- no optical zoom; but if that's what you want, you should look at the next class up on cameras (there's a digital zoom, but it's better to take the picture un-zoomed and zoom in later in your computer)<br />- noticeable barrel distortion at the edges of the frame<br />- the camera is light but it's bulky, so it doesn't feel very solid<br />- no RAW or TIFF uncompressed format<br />- short flash range<br />- the included 16MB CF card is not enough; be prepared to shell out more $$ for more memory<br />- no composite video connection so you can't view on a TV<br />for the price and for its target audience, this is a very nice camera.  just don't expect the higher end features you would find in the canon s50 or g5.  enjoy!","An exceptional camera ..., takes excellent images and surprisingly clear and smooth video with sound!.<br />Uses the same DiGiC image processor as Canon's high-end EOS 10D. Color balance is excellent, skin tones look great. Easy to use with many features and options. The low light focus assist lamp is neat and photo-stitch feature for panoramic shots is really cool!<br />Does use batteries quickly but it is to be expected since it only uses 2AA's while most use 4 or proprietary. NiMh batteries perform much better. AA size batteries are a plus since they can be found virtually anywhere and probably even that nearby electronic gadget if needed.<br />Originally bought this camera to take photos of my two young children and discovered that the video works great to record those special moments, like my daughter's first bike ride without training wheels! The kids love to watch the clips over and over again. It will shoot up to 3min of video, the number of clips depends on the CF card size.<br />The only drawbacks I found are the fixed focal length, long recharge times after flash, and no TV hook up.<br />I definitely recommend this camera. After researching other digital cameras nothing else currently can compare to the Canon for the price.","I am a recent convert to digitial from an advantix camera.  Ive had this camera for a month now, and it is the best thing i have ever bought.  I knew that when I saw this in the flyer, we would be getting it.<br />Anyways, the batteries that it comes with are garbage.  they didnt even last long enough to change the settings.  I did buy 4 energizer rechargables though, and each pair has lasted me a good 2 or 3 days<br />I strongly recommend using the viewfinder to take shots and use the lcd to review shots to save on battery.<br />The digital zoom is not that good, but im surprised i can still catch the license plate of a car that almost hit me.<br />The movie mode is ok.  its much better outdoors than indoors<br />The memory card lasted a while, but i really wanted to get better shots, so I got the 128 mb card.  With the new space, I was able to catch a video of a flock of ducks crossing the road and holding up traffic for 10 minutes<br />i agree with many of the opinions here.  If your a person that just likes to take average shots without paying too much, then this camera is for you.  If you buy 2 pairs of rechargebles, you will be fine.  I guess in a few years, ill probably stick to canon when the 10mpxl cameras come out","Bought this camera after reading the reviews here at amazon.com. I was a bit worried about the battery life. After starting to use it, I did not have any problem with batt life. If works like other D.Cameras. I bought a rechargeable kit anyway. I used the batts that came with the camera and I was able to play with the LCD for setup and filled my 16 MB compact flash and even downloaded the pics. The camera sometimes says that the batts need to be changed but once you switch if off and turn it back ON, it works fine like before. I tried this 2 times and was able to fill another 16 MB card. Ths pics are great and the movie mode is really cool. The digital zoom is [weak]. Wish it had atleast a 2x optical zoom. Anyway I use the software to Zoom the pics so that 's not a big problem for me. This is a great camera for price you pay.","I'll admit there are better cameras than this, but only if you're willing to spend an arm and a leg for one. I've had this camera for around 3 or 4 months now, and it's been great. the photo quality is excellent unless you need to zoom, then it's only so-so. one thing that's overlooked on most cameras is the flash, which is hardly rated at all and hard to really find out about. this one works pretty well for short to medium range pictures, but doesnt fare so well at the long range. on the battery issue, i've actually had no problems with it and even though i use it more it tends to outlast my cd player. i use rayovak rechargeables in mine and take a lot of pictures (i filled up the 16mb card it comes with with the low rez pictures with no problem) if you dont use rechargeables, you should always carry some extras with you, you'll need them quite a bit. it's actually pretty easy to figure out once you get used to it, though at first it can be slightly annoying. the lcd screen is a rather nice feature on this one and works a lot better at aiming your shot than the viewfinder is. the videos you can take with it are alright, if you're wanting to make videos though this isnt the one for it, but a nice feature none-the-less. all in all, a great camera for me. not professional quality or anything, but still great, especially for the price. if you print out photos with it those look quite well too. my only complaint about this camera are the slow loading time (after you take a picture it takes it a moment until you can take another) other than that, i wouldnt change a thing about it.","I just bought my Canon A300 yesterday, having done as much background research and comparison shopping as I could.  Almost all of the reviews I read were positive, and I determined that nothing could touch it for the price.<br />I needed a digital camera with few \"bells and whistles\" but with excellent image quality, and I needed it cheap.  Turns out it does has a few \"bells and whistles\" thrown in anyway.<br />The picture quality is stunning, and more than surpassed my expectations.  Sure the operation of the camera is a little cryptic, but if you read the manual, it explains everything.<br />Nothing can touch it for the price at 3.2 mega pixels......I'm completely satisfied!!!  I actually feel like I got more than I paid for.","I bought this camera for about 2 weeks now and I'm the happiest person in the world.<br />Some other reviews said that the camera eats batteries, this is TRUE!!! But I also bought a package of 4 rechargeable batteries (NiMh of 1800mah) and they worth every penny! The batteries are perfect, they last for about a week or two!!!, the pictures are the best and the movie mode is the great!!!<br />This is the best camera at this price, so don't even look for more, buy it now....<br />If you're looking for a camera with zoom this is not the one because the digital zoom [is bad] but If you're a fist time digital camera user you wont regret it....Canon is the best!","I bought the Canon A300 knowing full well that it doesn't have optical zoom. To me, a typical 3X optical zoom simply doesn't do much. Further, the added moving lens of a zoom camera is prone to mechanical problems. It is simply NOT worth the [money amount]or more for this feature. What the Canon A300 offers is a compact camera that takes shockingly detailed pictures, especially in outdoor light. In macro mode, the fine detail that I see in the pics is astounding! They are better than my Nikon SLR film camera. Indoor shots with flash do not turn out as sharp as outdoor shots, but still very good nevertheless. Sure there are negatives. Do not use this camera for action shots or sports photography. The auto-focus and light-metering will be too slow for that. However, for general use, such as scenic shots, this camera is more than adequate. Don't let the complaints about excessive battery drainage scare you away! It is simply not true! The original alkaline batteries did NOT last very long, but the NiMH batteries I got seems to last longer each time I recharge them! I can get at least 60 shots using these batteries with the camera in full function. One negative is the very tiny icons. They are hard to see and they are not very intuitive. Navigating the menus is also confusing at first. But once you get it, it is quite easy. Suggestion: go through the very long owner's manual first to see WHAT the camera can do, then go through it again to see HOW to do it! The software that comes with the camera is also very nice and easy to use. I did not have to read the manual for the software before using it. But I did later because I did not want to miss anything. In summary, this is a very competent camera and a great value. At [money amount], there is simply nothing close to it in terms of features, quality, and value.","I read the available customer reviews about the Canon A300 digital camera and noted the complaint about the lack of battery power. (eats batteries). I ordered the A300 based on recommendations from others about the machine being a good place to start. Now that I have had a few days to play with the A300, I can say in my experience the machine lives up to the manufactures claims. It is still on the supplied AA batteries after initial set up, 25 Shots and download time to my computer. For the price I cannot see how a novice could go wrong for a still digital camera with sound and movie options. My recommendation? If your new to digital and want to get your feet wet, try the Canon A300. Downside... could use optical zoom. However, keep your resolution high, and go easy on digital zoom and you will still get a quality shot.","Dropped it from about 1 meter to concrete floor, battery lock, a small piece of plastic broke but camera worked like before.","Let me tell you, if you are looking for a camera with a good photo quality and video, this is it! The day I bought this camera i was so excited. My excitement really paid off with a good looking and good working digital camera. Sure, it may eat up the batteries at first, but if you have the right batteries for it, for example: Monster Rechargeable Batteries, it will work out. Amazing photo quality can be achieved easily with it's MENU OPTIONS. Great white-balance! I recommend Canon for any camera proffesional or just as a hobby. I myself prefer Canon more than any other brand for cameras. Hope you enjoy the A300.( I sure did!)<br />~Nice job Canon! You hit it big.~<br />  Sicerely,<br />  Canon Consumer","I love it...It is my first digital camera but for the price it really has more features than you would expect. I would like if it were a little smaller so it could fit in my pocket, but I guess thats why you pay hundreds more to get an elph. The photo quality is excellent however it declines when doing work to the photos on the computer. The movie function is AMAZING. The quality is excellent and it is like having a home movie camera! I sometimes have trouble taking the pictures when i have to hold the button down half way and wait for the camera to focus - it takes a few seconds and sometimes doesnt focus at all and wont let you take the picture. The only really bad part about the camera is that the batteries die VERY VERY VERY VERY quickly. Definitely invest in duracell stock when you purchase this camera or NEVER use the LCD screen! Overall the camera is GREAT and I love it. Hope this helped...","I did quite a bit of research looking for a great point and shoot for my significant other.<br />I really like this camera. Also, I found it ate batteries the first day...but I read somewhere to wipe off the terminals and the batteries will last longer. I get hours of use out of my batteries now. I also have rechargables....but have only needed 4. Two in camera...two for backup. So, ever since reading that about wiping off the terminals my battery life has increased 10 fold.<br />Pro: Great performance on the video<br />Con: Digital zoom stinks...but I knew that before I bought the camera and still really like it.<br />Also....got a great buy here at Amazon on the Viking 256MB CompactFlash Card........","The Powershot A300 was my first digital camera.  In that sense, it's like your first car.  You knew you weren't going to win any points for style or speed, but it got you from point A to point B and introduced you to what you knew you wanted in future cars.<br />The picture quality is, in a word, superb.  I took a picture of my daughter at the 2 megapixel equivalent setting (1600 x 1200), and I was stunned.  I had that photo blown up to 8 x 10 and you cannot tell it was taken with a digital camera (no pixellation).  The colors are rich, and the only down side to that shot was that it made me realize that my little girl is becoming a young woman.  My wife, who does not give out compliments easily, said that the picture rivaled what you'd pay for in a studio shoot.<br />I have not had the battery life problems others have mentioned.  In fact, AA usage is pretty good, all things considered.  This is the ideal point and shoot camera for travel, but as battery life erodes, writing the picture to the compact flash card becomes noticeably slower.<br />This camera now goes with me everywhere.  It is much more convenient to use than my EOS Rebel 2000, but I miss the creative zone controls on the Rebel.  These same controls are on such Canon Powershot models as the A60, A70, S45, S50, G3 and G5.<br />The manual is comprehensive, and from what I've seen, most of the complaints addressed in this board can be solved or addressed by reading the manual.<br />All in all, this camera yields dynamite pictures and you cannot beat the price.  If you're thinking about trying out digital, or you want a durable camera you can take with you on your travels and have a ready access to power (AA batteries are almost worldwide universal), get the A300.  You will not be disappointed.  It won't make you Ansel Adams, but if you've done even 30 seconds of homework before you make your purchase, you'll know this going in.","Great first digital camera. Have many photos and videos of my grandchildren thanks to this camera. There were one and three at the time.","Sure if you spend more you get more, but compared to other cameras in the price range you get a lot for the money (and I spent a fair amount of time looking). Just don't expect it to replace your SLR.  The quality of the pictures is quite good, and while an optical zoom would be nice at 3 megapixels you can just crop the big image and get a reasonable snapshot. I may have an entry level budget but I'm not a novice photographer, and I like the manual exposure compensation, and diffetent metering and focus modes.  It doesn't feel as rugged some more expensive cameras, but I don't think it's badly made either.  There is some barrel distortion of straight lines at the edges of the frame, but it isn't usually noticeable and if you aren't shooting in maximum resolution you can zoom in a bit with the digital zoom.  Just not too much or you lose resolution.  I like the movie mode with sound, and it's nice to be able to take 640x480 movies.  You can even edit them with the included software.<br />It eats alkaline batteries but I don't think that's a legitimate complaint. Digital cameras in general eat batteries and they all need NiMH rechargeables.  Be forewarned.  I like that it takes AAs, I already had some AA rechargeables for other things and it's easier/cheaper to get spares than it sometimes is to track down an obscure proprietary battery pack that doesn't fit anything else.","This is our first experience with a digital camera. It is a camera easy to use for the novice and has the bells and whistles the experienced or serious digital camera user demands. Super easy to connect to the computer with the USB cable supplied. We think this gives more bang for the buck than any we have looked at. Love it.","My first digital camera, so I'm learning all the basics.  I love it so far except for one MAJOR drawback.  I have gone through SIX AA batteries so far.  It goes through batteries in about 10 minutes of photography.  The ones that came with it lasted about five minutes.  I then bought a pack of Duracell M3 and it burned through them too.  I now bought a Monster AA rechargable pack...we'll see how those work.  Am I not supposed to use the LCD screen for shooting and viewing all the time?  Should I just use the viewfinder for pictures and then use the LCD screen for viewing/editing later?  Can anyone help me?  Should I return it for another one?  Is it defective?  I love Amazon, gadgets and computers...but I'm baffled here.","Picture quality is very good. Eats batteries, but you need to buy rechargeables anyway, for any digicam, so it's not a big problem in my opinion. My camera says sometimes that batteries are depleted when they are not, when I turn it off and again on it works again.","I purchased this camera for my mom for mother's day.  We played with if for about 5 minutes before the batteries that came with the camera were dead.  We changed batteries and have exchanged the camera the bateries still only last for a few shots.  I would either purchase a set of rechargable batteries or try another camera.<br />The pictures that we have taken do turn out very well.","I sold digital cameras for a living.  Take my word for it.  This is a great camera!  It is very simple to operate and it has some cool features.  The camera does not have optical zoom, but I was willing to give up the optical zoom to get the 3.2MP resolution.  Most 3.2MP cameras are in the $300 plus price range.  I will be taking most of  my photos of people and I do not need the optical zoom.  No camera in the $200-$250 comes close to this camera.  Even the Sony needs improvement to compete.","I won't spend a lot on a camera that I use for Ebay, Email,classroom, and web photos. The A300 is a lot better than what I need. The video mode is handy for power point presentations. Don't use the zoom and flash together if you can help it and you'll get great shots that you won't need to sharpen. For [this price range] there is no other choice. I love it!","If I had realized that this camera's zoom was digital-only, I might not have bought it. Other than that, it's great for the money.","If I had realized that this camera's zoom was digital-only, I might not have bought it. Other than that, it's great for the money.","The jury is still out on this one.  I purchased this with high expectations of Canon's experience and reputation for digital cameras.  I grew up in a family of professional photographers so I am fussy.<br />PROS:<br />1)  You can't beat the price considering this is 3.2 megapixel camera.<br />2)  Picture quality is excellent.<br />3)  This can take short movies, with sound.  Again, excellent quality.<br />CONS:<br />1)  No optical zoom.  The 5.1x digital zoom is fine if that's what you want.  However, there is a huge difference.  If zooming is not important to you, then this is fine.<br />2)  The button choosing between still pictures and the movie setting is a hair trigger and can be easily shifted by accident.  Both my father and I inadvertently took movies when we wanted to take stills.  We didn't know it until we downloaded the images.<br />3)  Buy stock in a battery company.  At least you'll get some of your money back in dividends when you become the company's best customer.  Digitals consume batteries like water, but this one devours batteries like Niagara Falls.  In fact, this is probably the single biggest limitation of this camera.  Getting a rechargeable package is the way to go, and you'll be using it a lot.  Also, be careful of battery consumption when connected to the computer -- it's a killer.<br />4)  The instructions in the manual, and the controls on the camera itself, are very complicated.  Plan to spend a lot of time reading the manual over and over again, and practicing with the camera to get the hang of things.  This is far from a \"take it out of the box and start taking pictures\" kind of camera.  The function and display controls on the camera are, in my opinion, very frustrating.  If you have patience and can spend some time concentrating and practicing, you can master it.<br />All in all, while you may never use half of the cameras capabilities (either because you don't need them, or will never understand how to use them), you can take great pictures.  The primary decision making factor here is price.  Why spend $500 when you can get this camera for less than half?","Good for the money. Need to use rechargeble batteries, so far with 40 pic taken with flash without changing batteries.Don't use alkaline, they'll be out with just a few shots.Print-outs are better in its original states than edited in photo deluxe.","The alkaline AA that came with the package lasted a few hours for me (several photos, a few videos). Then I bought some MAHA Powerex NiMH rechargable batteries and they last me 3 occasions spanning more than a week even after taking a lot of pictures and nearly an hour of video. I also use a Viking 256MB CF Card, and I don't have to worry about storage. It stores more than 150 photos at the higest resolution, and I could take a lot a lot of videos without having to worry about space. The video quality is superb. Pictures are a bit tricky; you have to hold it a bit longer to capture the image properly, plus you get blurs at the edges, but it's barely noticable at the highest resolution and almost undetectable for amateurs like me. ...","moro no brasil e comprei esta camera numa viajam aos EUA, e nao me arrependo... muito boa mesmo... nao deixando a desejar para as similares.","at first i was skeptical because i have read some of the reviews that were only mediocre. but when i purchased the camera and used it i was dumbfounded. the batteries last a lot longer than only 2 minutes LIKE THAT OTHER GUY SAID> maybe something was wrong with his. the batteries it came with lasted pretty long or at least longer than 2 minutES!! the pictures come out really great.....and for the price......its hard to beat........","After comparison shopping other digital cameras in a $100 to $300 range I decided to go with the Canon A300. I've had two different digital cameras since my first in 1996... this is simply amazing technology for the relatively small price. It's fairly easy to use and light and small enough to fit into a front pocket even. It takes wonderful pictures and I'm looking forward to using the mini movie with sound function to help sell art I create.<br />I don't recommend products lightly but if you're on a low budget and you want or need a great digital camera... this is one with wonderful \"bang for your buck\" plus with a name like Canon.. you know you're getting quality to boot.","this is a nice camera. But it is too energy-consuming. With the 2 AA batteries in the package, I shot only 2 pictures and played with some functions,say,replay,delete,setup.I don't know why it is like this.In other words, if you want to shoot 10 pictures,you gotta have at least 6 AA batteries!!! suggestion: buy an AC adapter,and batt charger.","Here it is in a nutshell. I bought this camera for photos of my students' activities at school, and trusted the Canon name to give me more than my money's worth in a [$...] camera.<br />The positives are:<br />  1. It's [relatively inexpensive], 3.2 megapixels, and it IS a Canon!<br />  2. It has a focus assist light, which helps in low light.<br />  3. It's simple to use, though with many advanced features such as white balance adjustments, manual exposure, sound effects, etc.<br />  4. It takes really good photos (excellent color saturation).<br />  5. It takes two AA batteries with pretty good battery life.<br />  6. It's small enough to slip in a pocket!<br />  7. It uses inexpensive compact flash memory.<br />  8. It's easy to transfer to your computer via USB cable and Canon software.<br />The negatives:<br />  1. Onlydigital zoom--very handy, but degrades quality.<br />  2. Flash is only average.<br />  3. If you do any cropping or enlarging, quality degrades quickly.<br />  4. Not attractive, but is sturdy (I've dropped it a few times!)<br />I like this camera--there's not much NOT to like. It does not have the enduring 'draw' of the Nikon 2500/3500 (see my review), but it has many more features, and the pedigree of the legendary G3, and S-50 Canon cameras.<br />If you want just a basic, compact, point & shoot digital camera that's  [relatively inexpensive] for a 3 megapixel unit, this one is THE one. As a bonus, you find it offers a whole lot more under that generic, unspectacular appearance!"]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P32","amazon_reviews":["They don't make them now like they to.","Purchased for myself in early days of digital technology, and love it.","camera works well.","How often can you say that a digital camera has lasted 7 years?

I expected it to be a basic point and shoot...But I was wrong. It took way better pictures then my HP Photosmart 435 also a 3.2MP and it took pictures like my Concord Eye-Q 4060 a 4MP camera. I love the on camera editing and the ease of use. It has some advanced photography settings that are defiently useful. Also I liked how it included a memory card and recharagable Stanima Batteries (takes 2 hours or less to charge unlike most that take 6) I have one thing against the zoom. It has to be at 2.8MP or under to use zoom. But that is fine..I don't use zoom vey often. I love this camera...And I am sure you will too.","I purchased this camera in July of 2003 and it has never really disappointed me.  I've had it for almost a year, and it still takes great pictures.  I bought a 128mb memory stick.  My only issues with it:<br />1.  Camera must use a Sony memorystick, so if you have all other Sony stuff, this is fine, but if you don't, you might have problems.<br />2.  The digital zoom sucks.  I'm not lying, all digital zooms probably suck, but as I got more experience with photography, I decided I'd like an optical zoom much, much more.  If you use the digital zoom, the picture becomes rather grainy.<br />3.  The movies in video mode are always really dark.  No way out of this.<br />I love the camera because I've had the same rechargeable batteries + they give you them and the charger.  In general the pictures are pretty good and I've been happy with it.","After tediously reviewing camera's similar to and comparably priced to this one we chose the Canon 3.2 mp. We have one regret that we didn't get the optical zoom option. This can make for very distant and sometimes incomprehensible figures when pictures are taken from afar.<br />On the plus side, the camera does take fantastic snap shot photos, is very user friendly and has a great movie option with sound that is sometimes hard to beat in a camcorder.","i dunno why so many people gripe about there not being an optical zoom on the camera. you can still take pictures from far away, and, even though you cant zoom in while you're taking them, after you take the picture you can zoom on in. its not that hard. i for one have never had to use an optical camera, and i never felt the need to. if you're gonna take pictures from that far away, get closer. anyway, this camera i bought a month ago and i love it. i take it with me everywhere and take candid shots. the recharcheable battery pack that comes with this is a major plus. usb connection is easy. only bad thing is that it comes with a measly 16mb card, i bought a 128mb for cheap, so its not that big a deal.","When our trusted Samsung 105mm Zoom died, I wanted to go digital. I looked at a lot of cameras, but leaned toward to Sony, because we use several Mavica's at work, and I've been very pleased with them.<br />We got the camera, and my wife immedietly began messing with it.  She has never used a digital camera before, but was easily able to quickly get the basics.  However, this bad-boy has some pretty neat tricks up it's sleeve, but you need to be able to wade through the instructions to figure it all out.<br />We used it on vacation, and really liked it.  You'll definetly want to buy a bigger memory stick.  We went with a 64mb card because the one that came with it only holds something like 10 to 20 pic's, depending on the resolution while the 64 will hold about 45 to 100.<br />My only complaint is sometimes the pic looks good on the LCD, but on my computer, it is too dark. That is partly my fault, because I have not set the flash to it's high setting.  However, I have been able to successfully adjust the color/contrast through photoshop and have the pic's turn out pretty good.  So, what I do now is always leave the flash on, and it's pretty well eleminated any of those problems.<br />We took the card to Wal-mart and printed pic's off it at the 1 hr photo station, and they were excellent--As good or better than a film camera.<br />In all, we really like this camera, and I would definetly buy it again.","Up until a few days ago I would have rated this camera 5 stars.  But then the buttons on the back of the camera ceased functioning.  Sony quoted me a flat rate of $185.11 to fix the camera.  Good thing I can buy a brand new one for $199.87.  The questions is should I?","The Sony DSCP32 Cybershot 3.2MP is a surrisingly good camera for it's cheap price. It takes high quality photos, is easy to handle and very hard to break (after accidentally dropping it a few times, I should know). It also comes with it's own battaries and charger.<br />If you're a beginner, looking for a good, reliable digital camera than this is the one for you. It's pretty easy to figure out, even without the instruction manual, and the computer software is straight forward too -especially for Windows XP users.<br />It has a video mode which is fun to play around with (the picture isnt terribly good, but the sound is)and it comes with a Video Out so that you can hook it straight up to your tv 9this drains the batteries quicker though). If you plan on taking lots of videos with this camera, you may want to consider buying a larger memory card, as this camera only comes with a 16MB one.<br />I think the only real problem I had with this camera was it's zoom. It's unable to zoom in on objects while in it's 3.2mp mode (which is the highest quality you can get on this camera), so I was unable to take detailed close up pictures.<br />Perhaps the LCD screen would be better a bit bigger and it could do with having a more accurate white balance, but for simple, around-the-house photos, you cant get much better than this (at least, not for this low price range).","I've been in the market for a new digital camera for a couple of months, and was trying to narrow down my choices. I've been using my trusty Fuji Finepix 2400 Zoom for the past 2 years, and have been very satisfied with the images it's made. But at 2 MP I've outgrown it a little. Now I've always been a fan of Sony products, but in their digital camera arena, their prices are a bit high. Then along came the Cybershot DSCP32. It had great reviews from all the major sites, ie pcphotoreview.com, steves-digicams.com, Amazon.com etc and everyone seemed to like it. However the dealbreaker is you can get it for under $200.<br />  I won't review all the specs, I think everyone here has already covered it, but lets just say that if your giving this as a gift to a first time digital user, they will love you, because everythng you need is included. No one else can say that. Camera, \"film\", batteries, and a charger!<br />  Being a lifelong sceptic, I try to see how good things are right out of the box. Judging such things as ease of use, features, and can I even just take a darn photo just by raising it up and snapping the shutter.  Yes you can.... I did just that, after setting the date and time, put the memorystick in my card reader and opening the image in Photoshop. My goodness..<br />the colors were rich, no obvious pixilation,  and I could even 'clearly' see what was on the television that the camera was partially aimed at.<br />  The only reason I rated it as 4 stars vice, 5 is to be honest I've only had it for 4 hours and something could go wrong. But so far trust me that this is another winner from Sony, and a great buy!","Me parece que la camara tiene buena resolucion , buen tamaño pero el zoom le hace falta, yo tengo una stick de 256mb y tomo fotos espectaculares , bueno se las recomiendo!","I actually brought a Kodak and decided to exchange it for this camera...and for $50 more it was worth it...i like the pictures qu..although it does not have an op..zoom it is still great...the thing i like the most is the way a picture appears after you take it in a pitch black dark room...now i know you thinking how do you know what you shooting...trust me try it and you will be very very surprised..it's actually looks like a reg. picture...to sum it all up...this is a GREAT camera for a GREAT price...","Purchased my CyberShot as the first Digital camera ever owned and I **LOVE** it!  Very good quality pictures, the ability to take up to a 1GIGABYTE memory stick, easy to use.<br />The Multi-Point focusing system means my pictures are always in focus which is a great feature.  I bought the camera as an \"Open Box\" special at Circuit City for only $149.95 with regular price of $189.95, I consider it an absoloute bargain and it even included rechargable batteries, and a charger!  I woudl have no hesitation in reccommending this camera to anyone!!","I've passed through other 2 digital cameras before I bought this one, and I have to say that I'm very pleased with it. Despite the lack of optical zoom (which I do not need), this cam takes very nice pictures even in the dark with low light conditions. It is very fast, feature that I appreciate, no matter if a 16 or 256MB memorystick is inserted in.<br />The price is fair.","I really love this digital camera for its ease of use, easy downloading, FAST flash recharge readiness (compare to Canon!).  But even on the highest 3.2 MP setting, 4x6 prints are obviously from a digital camera.  The digital photos on the computer screen are stunning, and for me that's 75% of what I do with them.  But when I take a gorgeous picture, I say to myself, \"Gee I wish I had used the 35mm for this one!\"  So I could have a nice print, even enlargement.<br />If you are interested in printing photos of your family, pets, vacations etc., you definitely want to upgrade to the 5 MP (megapixel).  SONY is the only way to go.  I've used Canon cybershot, Kodak etc. and Fuji Finepix is the only one that comes close to SONY, but it's a lot bigger bulkier camera.","I just recently got this camera on Christmas.  I decided on this one rather than a Vivitar one, and I feel it was a good choice.  I opened it and started to read the manual, and I put it down after about two minutes.  It makes no sense and if anything made the camera harder for me to understand.  Without the manual it was real easy to understand.  I figured it all out within two days.<br /><br />I use the 64mb sony memory stick.  It only gives you a 16 so you have to purchace a bigger one seperatly.  It works great and fits about 50 pictures, or about 3 minutes of video.  I use the kodak 6 in one memory reader.  I just pop the stick in that and something pops up and It only takes about 2 minutes to put my pictures on the computer.  It'd reccomend a memory stick reader for anyone getting any digital camera. I got the 6 in one, because down the line I might get a new camera, and that way I don't have to buy a new one.<br /><br />Another thing I really enjoyed was the video feature.  Most other cameras let you record like 60 seconds max of video or something.  This camera lets you film as much as you can until the memory stick is filled.  The lighting of it gets dark once you put it on a computer, but it's not a camcorder, it's a camera.  You can't really expect the best ;).<br /><br />The only real drawbacks of this camera is no zoom.  You have to be ok with getting real close to what you want to take a picture of.  It can get pretty frustrating.  I only use it for pictures of friends, animals, etc...So it's not that big of a deal most of the time.  If you need a zoom, do not get this camera.  Also, there is a little wait between taking pictures with the flash on.  It's not that long, but sometimes I go to take another picture and then, grr I have to wait.<br /><br />All in all, the camera is pretty good for 200 bucks (what I got it for).  The pictures are clear, plus it's small and easy to use.  I defiently got what I paid for, in my opinion.  If you want to see some of the pictures I have taken with it, you can visit my picture album at [...]","I have a 17mo old daughter, and a couple months ago, my wife bought one of those APX-film-only cameras.  The film is expensive and developing is worse.  We take a TON of pix of my daughter - we're lame like that - so it's ripping a hole in my wallet - especially since my wife will take several pix of the same outfit/situation, etc.<br />Fast forward to xmas - we got this camera.  I love it.  I haven't shown my wife how to use it yet, but I've picked up how to use it pretty quickly.  I occasionally refer back to the manual to review specifics, but overall, I like it.  We bought the Lexar 128mb memory stick because at 3.1mp, you can only take 10pix before you're spent.  With the 128MB you're up to 82 pix (or if you shoot at the 1.1mp quality - 202 pix).<br />The software to connect the camera to the laptop was super easy to install.  I still have to learn how to navigate it a bit more, but that will come with time.  The only pain is that you have to work to get to the pix later on.  What I mean is this: I click on \"my documents\" then on \"image transfer\" then you have to click open another 3 folders to finally get to your shots.  There might be a better way, but I haven't had the time to figure it out.<br />The zoom is nonexistent for the 3.1mp and the 2.8mp quality pix.  And then with the lower quality pix there is zoom, but it doesn't zoom very far in.  Regardless, after you take a picture you can zoom in VERY close and crop out the rest while the picture is still on the camera.  It'll save as a new picture, so you'll still have the original shot, and now this new edited version.<br />Anyway, I like it, it was a present from my father-in-law so I don't know how much he paid for it, but it does what I want it to do. []  I hope this helped a smidge.","I love this camera. It, to me, is worth all the money i paid for it (which wasn't too much!) It is actually pretty small, and has quite a lot of features, including mpeg movies with sound, many photo filters, and a nice lcd screen, which is quite leage enough. It has an amazing amount of features and virtually any aspect of your picture taking can be controlled. Some cons to take into considerance: It goes through batteries pretty quickly, so if you are planning to take a lot of pictures, especially with flash, then you might want to take some extras. The included rechargables last longer than normal ones, however. Also, if you want zoom, you might want to consider then DSC-P72 or DSC-P92, since the 3x digital zoom only only applies if you use the lowest resolution for the picture. The cover for the usb, video, and DC in slots is also kind of weird, but ok. Other than that, this camera is great!!!!","I rarely used regular cameras before I went digital--first with my camera phone and then with the Sony DSC-P32. My mother has one of the more expensive Canon digital cameras, whose interface I found a bit confusing, but within minutes I had figured out how to use all the features on the Sony without even looking at the manual. The picture quality is nicer than I had expected and I was very pleasantly surprised when I realized that the movie mode recorded with sound. I don't mind the no zoom part since I never really have the need for it, and I love the memory stick format--I bought the Lexar double sided 256mb which holds about 100 pictures in the highest quality format on each side.<br />My only real complaint would have to be the disappointing software that came packaged with the camera. It is rather annoying to use and doesn't give you very many options, although all I usually need is the \"quick fix\" option provided when I upload my photos on imagestation.com. Oh well..better imaging software would have been nice","Ok ... I went into the target today wanting to get a memory card for the camera I had bought at another store today .. So checked out this camera while i was there . I picked it up & very pleased with its performance .. The quality of the pictures coming from this camera is outstanding. If you decide to get it for a gift or for yourself to take pictures of family & friends over the holiday . Whom ever has this camera will be satisfied w/how easy it is to use . The 199 for it is well worth the cost","this is my first digital camera. i love almost everything about it. here are the exceptions. 1: you cannot zoom in at 3.2 mp. and 2: if using the flash, the screen will go blank for a few seconds after you take the picture. other than these couple minor things, it's a great camera! the best part is that it comes with rechargable batteries and the charger!","I am one more happy owner of Sony DSC P32. The camera has been with me for almost a month now and it's been used a lot. Let me update my review. My purpose for this camera is an all-around sort of thing: It must be pocketable so I can carry it to school, to work, to my family's garden, to my friends' outing, to the mall... well, you get the idea.<br />Henceforth, here are the features I found most useful:<br />  Amazing picture quality, clear and vibrant.<br />  Easy to use and small enough to fit in my pocket.<br />  Real time shutter and aperture info.<br />  Rechargeable AA NiMH batteries.<br />  Finger grip on body front.<br />  Instant detection and download with WinXP.<br />  Separate power ON button. Because it does, the lens cover remains closed when you only want to preview your pictures or change setup settings! Just turn dial to \"play\" or \"setup\" position before turning ON the camera.<br />  No optical zoom. The less moving parts, the better.<br />  And last but not least, it's beautiful.<br /><br />Wish list:<br />  LCD could be made larger.<br />  An ISO 50 would be a nice addition.<br />  More accurate white balance in auto mode.<br /><br />For me the Sony DSC-P32 is a good-looking, functional design. I have no hesitation recommending this to anyone who wants a highly portable and reliable digital camera that can be carried on your pocket ready to shoot at a moment's notice. I can only smile in reaction to contrary recommendations by professionals. As far as this actual user is concerned, the Sony DSC-P32 is beautiful to look at and a pleasure to use!<br />Good luck hunting for your own camera!","This is my second Sony camera.  I love it for 2 reasons:  ITs so SMALL and because the pictures are clear and crisp.  However, I miss having a zoom.  If I could I would buy the same camera but with the zoom.<br />I use this camera with Windows XP.  When I connect it pops up a Window and I can print directly to my HP printer.  The pics are unbelieveable nice.","This is the second DSCP32 I have ever bought.  (I lost the first one... don't ask).  And by the way, it's the second digital camera of any kind I've bought.  I hope that this indicates what I'm trying to convey: I was very happy with my first camera.  Had I known I was going to spend over $400 for (2) digital cameras in the course of 6 months, I would have bought a more feature-laden model, no doubt.  But this model was functional enough to get me to shell out another $200 for the same model.<br />It is compact (small...) and easy to carry around in a pocket if you are going to a party or some event where you don't want a big ol' thing dragging you down, this may be the camera for you.  The zoom is not excellent, but it is usually quite adequate.  My problems before were when I was trying to get pictures of friends across the street.  I used the digital zoom, and the pictures did not turn out that well, because I was using a less than \"high\" image size.  In a room, or fairly \"close up\", the zoom works great.<br />The price has fallen since my first purchase of one of these cameras.  My guess is that this model is close to being discontinued (see Consumer Reports, November 2003, p 15, \"Shop Smart\"--\"Cameras typically remian on the market about a year.  If you see the price on a particular model being to plummet, it's usually a sign tht the camera will soon be discontinued.\")  I paid $199 today, October 4, 2003, (at a local Best Buy) but I paid $239 about 5 months ago for the one I lost.  Discontinued shouldn't scare you; Sony's gonna be around, and there are deals to be had.<br />If you're looking for a feature-filled camera, there are better cameras than this.  If you're looking for an excellent, simple, well-thought-out camera, the DSCP32 is one you should at least consider.  The price is definitely right at $199.<br />It comes with rechargable AA batteries, the charger, a USB cable, and a cable you can hook up to your TV to watch a \"slide show\" of the pictures you've taken.  My one complaint, it *doesn't* come with a DC adapter, so you're relying on those rechargable batteries all the time.  The Sony Software is not that great, but it comes with the camera.  If you have one of the finer imaging software programs, you should do fine, and the Sony software is ok.  It may be the worst part of the package with this great little camera.<br />If you should buy this model, my advice:  DON'T LOSE IT!","If you're looking for a camera that's easy to use and has the ability to take high quality digital pictures.  This camera is it.  It doesn't require you to read a 1000 page manual to use this (I tossed the manual after 10 minutes and was able to figure out everything by playing with it).  It is a point-and-shoot idiot box, but one that takes awesome pics.<br />The only two minor complaints I have is Sony is so cheap and didn't include a memory stick with more memory than a measely 16mb.  The other comlaint I have is that it takes a while too recharge the flash after you use it.  If you're using a flash, you have to wait 3 secs. in between pics to allow the camera to charge the flash back up.","Estou feliz com a minha compra, a sony esta de parabéns com essa camera. Fotos de ótima qualidade, só não tem o zoom, mas é um pequeno sacrificio pelo tamanho compacto.","I have DSC-F717, which is an excellent \"heavy\" camera. I got a DSC-P32 for everyday use. It has excellent price/quality ratio.<br />However it lacks some important features that you can find in more expensive models like a zoom. The camera is very durable and an excellent choice for party pictures... It is also an excellent present ...","THREE YEARS LATER -- A REVIEW<br /><br />I have now taken 9,800 photos with this camera!<br /><br />DURABILITY: It has been bumped, dropped and exposed to hostile climates for extended periods of times (The camera has spend most of it's life in Arabia with severe temperatures, dust and high humidity.) but no real horror stories like falling down concrete stairs. Still, it works fine.<br /><br />SOFTWARE: I have totally given up with the bundled software. I tried to use it but it just was a pain. However, both the stills and video are perfectly computable with everything.<br /><br />FIRMWARE (aka feature): I never ever use the digital zoom feature.  There's not point to it, that I can see. It's better just to crop it with your home software.<br /><br />I really don't use ANY of the firmware features except review and -- rarely -- delete if I am running out of memory.<br /><br />MPEG MOVIE MODE -- very nice!  Of course the picture quality is limited but the sound is terrific, making it a rewarding viewing experience. It is a wonderful tool for putting short clips on the web for the grandparents. With my hosting service (Photobucket), I can just upload the native file.<br /><br />START UP TIME: This cameras is still faster in the start-up time than some newer cameras (especially when the batteries are fresh.) I love that.<br /><br />HARDWARE:<br /><br />THAT DANG RUBBER FLAP! That little rubber flap still annoys me. IT NEVER STAYS ON!  Sometimes I scotch tape it but mostly it just bothers me. I almost never use those connectors and have considered cutting it off and covering it with duct tape -- except that now-and-again I use the AV out.<br /><br />I really like the flash features -- I use nearly all the modes fairly often -- accept red eye reduction. I love how easy it is to switch between flash modes. No all cameras are that way.<br /><br />The auto-timer is also very easy to use.<br /><br />Auto focus almost never is wrong. It probably helps that there is no telephoto.<br /><br />3.2 PIXELS is almost always enough. It means you can't severely crop your pictures. I now routinely use professional digital printing and have even done 5x7s which look great. 4x6s and web photos are very nice.<br /><br />COLOR: When I compare professionally printed 4x6s with our old Olympus 35mm point-and-shoot camera, the film still wins (not by a lot) However, for the web, the Sony is much better than scanned prints from the Olympus.<br /><br />BATTERY life is OK -- but not great. You will probably want to travel with an extra set. However, the fact that these are AAs means you can easily buy a set anywhere in the world, as needed.  The supplied NiMH's seem to be getting weak but I still use them.<br /><br />THE SCREEN -- IT is OK but not nearly as good as modern screens. Mostly, I use the viewfinder for shooting.  Except on bright days, the screen is fairly useful but it can be hard to tell if someone's eyes are closed.<br /><br />WHAT I WANT FOR MY NEXT CAMERA:<br /><br />* I want a real (mechanical) telephoto. I miss that the most.<br />* I want an optical viewfinder (many of the new cameras don't have them) but also one of those large bright screen. It is great to have either option.<br />* I want video. I have learned to really like taking video clips for sharing on the web.<br />* I want a camera that uses standard AAs. This has come in so-handy for long trips since I can leave the charger home and just buy them along the way. But, at home, I use NiMH<br /><br />- - - - -<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />EASE OF USE<br />Fairly easy for basic functions - taking a picture, reviewing pictures, setting resolution, deleting etc.<br /><br />Some of the more advanced feature can be buried in menus. Many of the icons and other indicators on the screen are not obvious and one must refer to the manual. On at least one occasion, I found an item on the camera menu that wasn't in the index of the manual.<br /><br />Despite what I listed above, I'd say this camera qualifies as easy to use.<br /><br />PICTURE QUALITY look great on my home ink jet printer at 4X6. From a foot away, you can't tell that it isn't a traditional print. (just less vibrant)<br /><br />AUTOFOCUS seems to work fine. Flash is more than adequate.<br /><br />LOW LIGHT shooting is pretty good but could be better<br /><br />COLOR ACCURACY is good but not perfect. I'm not sure if it is my printer or the camera, but traditional photos are distinctly more vibrant.<br /><br />RESOLUTION. It is advertised as 3.3 megapixels but I saw somewhere in the literature that is \"effectively\" 3.3 megapixels. By my calculation it is 3.15 but so what? I which they'd say it like it is, anyway.<br /><br />ZOOM is almost useless since it doesn't work at the highest resolution which is the resolution I use and almost never change. You'll just have to crop after you get the picture on the computer.<br /><br />SHUTTER DELAY and RESET TIME are tolerable and much better than some of the cameras I played with in the store<br /><br />I've seen bigger SCREENS on other cameras but it does the job. It is a little dim in daylight forcing you to use the eyepiece. You can easily turn the screen off to save batteries -- a nice feature.<br /><br />The included BATTERY CHARGER is a nice touch and can be used for your other electronic items. However, it would have been classier for Sony to make the battery charger also work as AC adaptor like it does for video cameras. You can buy an adaptor for extra money, which isn't cool.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE if more than enough to fill up the chip. Probably, you'll want to buy an extra pair for backup. Since it uses standard AA, you could also just keep a pair of alkaline or NiMH batteries on hand to use in a pinch.<br /><br />MEMORY STICK. I wish they would adopt a more common standard like the SD or MMC but other than that, it works just fine. I wish they also would include a bigger chip.  You will probably have to go out and buy one. I bought 128MB which hold 91 pictures at full resolution but added...to the price of the camera.<br /><br />The camera SIZE is like a small 35mm camera and is a little lighter than my Olympus 35mm Stylus.<br /><br />No CAMERA CASE is included, which is a drag.  I found one that fits perfectly ..., so that was easily solved.<br /><br />The little RUBBER COVER that covers the plugs is not well designed. It falls off all the time and finally I put some scotch tape on it to keep it in place. This would not be a satisfactory solution if you use the USB cable but I use a card reader so I don't open the cover much.<br /><br />VIDEO feature is fun but the picture quality is terrible. Still, it is fun to play with. You videos will make you look like one of those imbedded Iraqi reporters!  The sound is quite good. You can also add voice attachment to still photos a feature that would be better if you could easily switch to it. Also, it frustratingly clips off that last couple second of your message.<br /><br />The VOICE RECORDER (same as what I mention above) is a feature that is cool but not too useful since it is limited to about 45 seconds. Too bad. The camera could also serve as a cool voice recorder. It will work OK for short notes.<br /><br />VIDEO OUT is pretty useful for reviewing your pictures if you are not near a computer (like on vacation.)<br /><br />Included SOFTWARE is barely adequate. I found the ImageMixer software very frustrating until I finally got the learning curve going up. The help screens are not helpful. Still, it's free and works (sort of!)  Probably, you'll want to buy another software package. Fortunately both the pictures and MPEG videos are open-formats and easily import into most programs.","I've been using this camera for about a month and have to say I am very happy with the picture quality and ease of use.  I debated on purchasing the model with the optical zoom, but for my type of camera usage (vacations, pictures of the kids, animals, flowers, etc.) the P32 digital zoom is more than satisfactory.<br />I also purchased two 128MB Lexar Memory Sticks and the Lexar Memory Stick Reader.  I would highly recommend the reader, it will save your camera batteries for taking pictures instead of powering the camera for uploads.  The Lexar sticks haven't given me a moment of trouble, either, and are extremely well priced compared to the Sony sticks.<br />I also purchased some Rayovac NiMH batteries (half the price of Sony's) which charged just fine in the battery charger included with the camera.<br />If you have ever used one of those \"mail the camera\" jobs then you're familiar with the wait time while the flash charges.  You will have a much shorter wait with this camera, but there is definitely a pause while the flash recharges.  I did not notice any wait time while taking pictures without the flash - the save to the memory stick is quick!<br />The LCD display is very easy to read once you become familiar with all the tiny icons.  I did have difficulty seeing the display in bright outdoor light until I discovered the settings to darken/lighten the display:)  In the meantime I used the normal \"nose to the camera\" image viewer.<br />The camera has an automatic lens cover that closes when the camera is powered off.  This might be true of all digicams, I'm just relieved to have one less item to track!<br />My only complaint is the manual.  There isn't any \"flow\" to it and sections I felt should be grouped together are scattered through the booklet.  The animated GIF, multi-burst, and MPEG settings are in the same location on the camera, but not in the manual!  I ended up creating and printing a cheat sheet to carry in my camera bag.<br />Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a first-time digital camera.  I absolutely love the instant gratification of taking a bunch of pictures and seeing them in all their glory on the computer immediately afterwards.  Waiting for film to be developed, only to discover I under/overexposed the picture, is now a thing of the past!","i just bought this camera today, and lemme tell u, its wonderful. the size is nicely shaped, because it feels really sturdy, compared to other cameras that are small, yet fragile. as for the picture quality, its pretty crisp. in order to get a better picture u should get a tripod, because the picture tend to be a little bit blurry when taken by hand. the functions on the camera are pretty self explanitory and are well in reach of ur fingers. the only complaints i would have would be that you cant optically zoom with it. you ahve to take the picture first, then u can look at it afterwords and zoom in. but the pictures dont get very blurry when u zoom in, which is a good thing. also, the lil cover for the plugs n stuff on the camera is made of rubber or sumthin. which seems a little awkward, becuase u would expect more from sony. and its kinda hard putting it back on the camera. another thing would be the position of ur left hand on the camera. theres not a whoel lot of space to put your left hand because the lens is built in that area. all in all i would say this is a great camera especially for its price, and the brand name, sony. if you are looking for the best camera ..., then i would recomend this.","Well what can I say... I have compared many cameras from Kodak and Konica to Cannon and Nikkon, and for my money this camera has got the best of both worlds - Fantastic quality, ease of use and funtionality at an affordable price. I feel sorry for people like \"Ej Passeos\" who wrote about his bad experience at the zoo and deemed the camera worthless because he couldn't get a close-up of the monkey's ass. Look buddy, don't say the camera is worthless becuase it doesn't have an optical zoom feature... why did you buy it then? Didn't you know that before you bought it? That is why it is so affordable, for people like myself who find the zoom feature a waste of money. I do a lot of close up shooting and action shots and found little or no use for the zoom feature... So I looked for a camera to fit my needs and this Sony camera does exactly what I need a camera to do. If you want zoom in a camera, then don't buy one without one and then complain that it doesn't have one... []","This camera is the whole she-bang!<br />High points:<br />The quality even on the lowest mode (VGA) was outstanding.<br />Easy to understand menus.<br />High resoultion shots.<br />Low points:<br />Full 3.2 digital zoom is only available using VGA mode.<br />Quality is drastically reduced when using digital zoom.<br />Quality on the A/V analog output was less than impressive.","man trust me u`ll luv de feel of this digi cam...and u`ll b swept off u r feet by itz performance...i bought this cam after reading de reviews in amazon.com....after seeing the performance...i tght i shld share my xperience also.. this cam is worth it....for the money u pay...the prints r jus 2 good...and enlargementz also came out wonderfully well...so ppl planning 2 go digital....this is the one for u...","Actually I already made a review of this product in another website. I bought this camera last June 2003 mainly to its low cost compared to other similar existing models. Also I want to throw away the very low-tech digital camera I have the old Yahoo! compact digital cam, what a waste!<br />Now, the main feature that I like in this product is the simple connectivity to PC using USB, but the Pixela software is mediocre. Another one is the simple power supply system it uses, a AA-size batteries, which is basically a very convenient one, unlike in other models where they have their own special battery type. So if suddenly you run out of charge in the field, you can just buy 2pcs of AA size Alkaline batteries, and use it!<br />The resolution or picture quality of the output of DSCP32 is exceptional, but the supplied memory stick is not enough so better buy a much higher capacity. Also, the MPEG Movie VX feature of this camera enables you to capture a video (with audio) to the full extent of the capacity of the memory stick which is another big plus unlike in other brands where some are limited to only 3mins maximum.<br />The only thing that I don't like with this camera is the size. Sony should have designed this camera in a more compact or smaller size because it doesn't have the optical zoom mechanism anyway.","I just love this digital camera, and i can't believe How much i Paid for it, It is a great camera with cool options, and great quality, this is the camera you are looking for, buy it NOW!!!","I am absolutely THRILLED with this camera!  I would have easily paid 5 times the price for all of the wonderful (and easy to use) features.  Don't believe me?  I already shelled out [money] for a Coolpix 990 2 years ago with the birth of our daughter, then [more money] for a digital camcorder 6 months later.  Why did I need another camera you ask?  While there is no denying that the coolpix takes incredible pictures, it's too bulky and complicated.  It has TOO many options and worst of all, you can only shoot 30 seconds of video WITHOUT SOUND! What's the point?!?  (My husband got me this camera!).  The digital camcorder obviously would do the trick but it's so bulky and it's never around when I want to capture those adorable moments of a 2 year old.  Being a parent of a toddler, I wanted a camera that I could carry with me EVERYWHERE and be able to take great pictures and VIDEO CLIPS with AUDIO!  I love the fact that you can take minutes, not mere seconds of video.  And best of all, it is the easiest camera to operate in the world!  I didn't even have to read the manual.  Just shoot, and plug it into your computer (I do have XP). Finally, a product that I have been looking for!  Do not hesitate in getting buying this camera.  It's worth its weight in gold!","This is a great quality camera.  It comes with all the accessories like rechargable batteries... etc. you need.  The only thing you need is an additional 128mb memory stick... the only thing that's not so good about the camera is that there's no optical zoom.  But since it has the smart digital zoom feature, it's not all that bad.  You just have to edit the picture later for a close up... all in all, it's very easy to use and an awesome camera for the price... and I actually like the look of it...unlike some other comments I read before buying it.  It looks better than the pictures in my opinion.","I went looking for my first digital camera and wanted to stay under [$$$].  I found the Sony, a 64MB memory card and a case within my budget.<br />I've taken about 30 pictures with it around the house and I can't believe the quality of the shots!  The functions are easily accessed through the menu and the battery charger that's included has got to be worth more than the savings.<br />I highly reccomend this camera for anyone looking to get into digital photography.  My only negative comment is that the camera doesn't have a dedicated zoom.  But, I'm really not that worried about it.<br />Try it out, you'll love it!","Would've given this camera 5 stars if it had any kind of optical zoom.  Other then that, its perfect!  I have been testing this baby out and the 8 1/2 by 11 pictures @ 3.1mp is perfect.  Some people may complain about the bulkiness but i don't mind cause it feels durable.  the video capture (w/ audio!) is handy also, and is only limited to the size of ur memory card.  For those who can fork out the extra benjamin, i'd get the p72 with the 3x, that i'd give 5 stars!","I just bought this camera for my husband and we both love it. We took over a hundred pictures this weekend at a family event and cannot believe the quality of the pictures. They are so crisp and clear, almost better than in person. We have been searching for a great camera at a good price and we found it with this one. We highly recommed this camera and know you will be happy with your purchase. We do recommend a larger memory stick maybe 64mb or 128mb. The one it comes with can only handle about 8-15 photos. :)","What a fantastic camera.....for this price I was expecting far less quality pictures, but I was wrong. These pictures are crystal clear and full of color. You can get practically 4 inches away from your subject and still get a clear image. It is lightweight and easy to use. A great camera for anyone wanting a simple design with superb pictures.","I've had several lower pixel count cameras from Kodak, HP, Sony and Agfa that ran about $... when new.  The picture quality for this camera blows away the other brands, with a price that was similar.  The price difference (only $.. more than some 2MP cameras) is insignificant compared to the quality improvement.  The addition of movie and burst modes make this the current bargain of the 3MP camera market.  While the Nikon 2100 mentioned in another review may compare in quality for screen viewing, larger prints (8.5\" x 11\", e.g.) will look better with the Sony DSCP32, at a lower price to boot.","Just check out the specs! and you won't believe your eyes!! The price for what you get with this camera is unbelievable! 3.2 MP under 250 bucks! Movie XV tech allows you to connect the camera to a TV!! - results are quite reasonable for a camera this small. With Multi Burst you can take simultaneous pictures! 16 MB Memory stick, batteries & charger included! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT!!?????? Get it NOW!","I have this camera and Nikon 2100. If I didn't have the Nikon 2100 then I would have to say this camera is good, in comparison with my old Olympus and Canon cameras. In case you are wondering why I have so many cameras, well I like electronics and trying out different ones, sort of like people who like to drive new cars once in a while. Anyways, this camera is not very well designed physically, and that is my biggest problem with it. While all the specs say the thickness is 32.6mm, when it came there was an errata sheet that said that was wrong, and it actually is 35.2mm.  This makes the camera bulky and heavy, which don't feels comfortable at all in the pocket. Now I have the Nikon 2100 also, and it contains a 3x optical zoom lens which the Sony does not have, yet it is smaller and feels much better in the hand during shooting as well as in my pocket. What is more is that the Nikon is around the same price as the Sony. As far as versatility goes, this camera has very good video capabilities, although the video at 640*480 is noticeably choppy. Picture quality is good compared to low end Canon and Olympus, but overall it is not as sharp, accurate, and bright as my Nikon. I still think Nikon lens are the best there is. Other than these gripes, this camera is a decent value, due to its high megapixel count and inclusion of a battery charger. However in my opinion 2 MP is good enough, and sometimes a good 2MP camera can have better picture quality than a not so good 3MP camera, which fits the comparison of the Nikon2100 with the Sony P32. Sony could have easily made this camera much smaller since it has no big zoom lens, but I guess they don't want to eat into their smaller P2-P10 series cameras. All in all, I would definitely consider the competition before buying this camera.","I'm pleased with my recent purchase of this camera, and am captivated by it's movie-capture ability! What fun! The only downside so far is the quality of the movie, but that is not this camera's main function so it seems excusable. It's an intuitive camera and already I feel very familiar with its menus and buttons. Thanks Sony for making such an affordable, high quality camera!","I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS CAMERA , AND IT HAS EVERYTHING FOR A GOOD PRICE AND QUALITY .<br />GOOD RESOLUTION, GOOD OPTIONS , AND  SONY WARRANTY.<br />YOU ALSO COULD RECORD 90 MIN OF VIDEO WITH THE 128 MB MEMORY STICK.<br />IN MY OPINION GOOD CHOISE FOR HOME PHOTOGRAPHERS.","I bought this camera about two weeks ago and it's a perfect little camera.  The size is just perfect, but, just because it's small does not mean it's a basic camera.  This camera falls under point-and-shoot category, but, it also offers you a lot of manual controls such as exposure control, white balance control, focus control, ISO control, etc.  It also has preset scene modes such has night, snow, beach, landscape, portrait night, etc.  For picture taking, you can have a combination of different megapixel (3.1, 2.8 @ 3:2, 2.0, 1.2, and VGA) and compression (Fine or Standard).  Picture quality is AWESOME.  Outdoor pictures are just perfect and indoor pictures are between best and good (if there is any such thing).  Buttons are very easy to operate.  Video mode is another thing to brag about.  You can take videos at 640*480 or 160*? resolution.  The 160*? is not good at all.  But 640*480 is just awesome.  Video size is only limited by the amount of memory you have.  I can record upto 5 minutes on my 128MB card.  The only thing I hate about this camera is the cover that hides the video-out, usb, and dc-in port.  Another thing that could would have made this a better camera is the wait between shots when using fill-flash or flash.  It takes about 3-4 seconds before the camera can take another shot.  However, when taking pictures without flash, it's as fast as any film-cameras."]},{"name":"Kyocera Finecam SL300R","amazon_reviews":["i lost my charger and would like to know where i can get another one for it.","I bought this camera because I found a great deal through Amazon and a good friend owns one and loves it. It had all the features I was looking for. Unfortunately, 2 months after I purchased it, the shutter (I think) froze up and the camera would no longer take any pictures. It came with a 1-year warrantee, so no worries. The battery life isn't that great, but as long as you keep up with charging it after every use, you'll be fine. It takes great pictures and it very easy to operate. I sort of miss the view finder, and I agree the lack of a lens cap is an annoying design flaw. If you're looking for a simple camera to drop in your pocket for quick point and click action, this is a good choice. If you're looking for a professional-grade wonder d-camera, look elsewhere (I like the Cannon Rebel Digital personally...)","I've been waiting around for a couple of years, trying to convince myself that I really needed a digital camera.  I'm glad I finally jumped in with this little gem.  This camera makes vacation photography fun again!  I was looking for a small camera, but one that would hold up and do some video.  I read all the reviews and will admit that I was hesitant, particularly about the memory and battery life.  But what I liked out-weighed the negatives, and I am thrilled with my decision.  The first thing I did was go out and purchase a larger memory card, which is really necessary.  The camera comes with 16 mgs, not nearly enough for photos, let alone video.  But with more memory, the thing is perfect for me!  I should add that if you really want to enjoy digital photography and don't really want to climb the learning curve, buy a Mac, sit back and have fun!","I bought this camera because I dont like carrying a bag, and other cameras are very clunky and over sized, this camera fits easily in a back pocket and is soooo easy to use.<br /><br />I took this camera with me to San Diego this summer and took over 200 pictures, from the surf to the nightlife the camera held up great. I've also taken video of friends and concerts and it produces great quality and sound. When ever i use it people are always saying \"what agreat camera, how neat or is that a camera?\"<br /><br />It is a great peice and has a great rechargable-in camera battery.  My Dad bought a more expensive Nikon digital camera and is constantly searching for batteries because his have run out or asking someone to carry it in their bag--those 2 problems are non issues with this camera. I would give it 10 stars by far the best item I have purchased on Amazon-- if your looking for something that produces good film quality pictures, is slim lightweight and has a good battery life--- LOOK NO FURTHER-- this is your camera (or look at the new verision which has 4 .0  mega pixels) Love it love it love!!! Hope you will too!","I bought this camera a few days ago and this was a great camera. I have been looking for a small, compact camera with a nice looking design, and still take great pictures. What I love about this camera the most is the very slim design and the swivel idea which separates the lens from the LCD viewfinder.<br />Pros: Very sleek design, very fast startup time, fast picture taking, burst mode, great pictures, video recording with sound, price is hard to resist for a 3.2 megapixel camera.<br />Cons: Poor battery life, very small buttons, LCD screen has no protection.<br />Overall, this camera is very good and has a great price tag. If you do buy this camera, you would want to look into buying a second battery and another case because the case that comes in the box is not very sturdy.","Great for point and shoot purposes- awesome size, plenty of pixels and good optics.  The lens is a little small, though, so it suffers in lower light conditions.  and the flash is kinda underpowered, so it's hard to get good groups shots in darkish conditions.  although when compared to competitors (nikon SQ, sony DSCU50, etc... similar size and features) the lens size and flash are no better or worse.<br />One of the features that made me buy this camera was the advertised \"speed.\"  While it is extremely fast to start up, the time between hitting the shutter button and the image being captured is no faster than competitors.  kind of a let down.<br />BIGGEST LET DOWN is the fragility of the camera.  There is a DESIGN FLAW in the case that makes it so that if the camera is inserted a certain way, the snap closure to the (cool looking) case puts pressure on the LCD screen.  This mistake is easy to make, so be careful.  Mine was broken by the second day.  Kyocera does not care that this is a design flaw and will make you pay to repair it!!! I'll bet the case gets changed next year.  The camera also gets REALLY HOT if left on for a while.<br />BEST FEATURE is the swivel design.  I got used to this feature with my old CoolPix 950 and this was a major selling point.  And the camera looks really damn cool.  I wish we could get the Japanese one with the designer colors....<br />Really great size, cool looking and takes decent pix.  Above average. Hard to find until now- I just saw it at RADIO SHACK ($349)","This is a great camera. It's actually 3.2 megapixels, but whatever. The one drawback about it is that it is easily scratched, and my friend actually dented it by dropping it from no more than 3 feet. I'm not sure whether it hit the floor or an object on the floor, but it's dented. And it is very easily scratched. I left the camera on my bed, and when I picked it up again, it had scratches! Seeing as how the case seems pretty sturdy, I was pretty surprised. However, that's about the only drawback, besides the short battery life(35 minutes left on), but just get another battery and voila, taken care of. Extremely small size, fits easily in my cramped pocket along with my cell phone and wallet. And it actually has NO lag! As for the flash, some people say it's weak, but everyone I've taken a picture of says it's really strong. Great camera, lovin it.","The size of this piece of technology is what really sold me, but then you get to use it, you appreciate the great list of features, ease of use, quality of display, zoom, rechargable, USB plug in, huge memory chips available.<br />The only downer is the strength of the flash, but you cannot have everything.<br />It stays in your pocket/purse and is there whenever you need it, just remember keep it charged and stay relatively close for flash pics..","Love this camera!  Wonderful size. Great pictures.  Movie mode was really impressive.  Awefully short on battery life when using the LCD Backlight so consider a second battery. I've been wanting to get a digital camera for some time but was completely unable to deal with the lag between pushing the shutter button and getting the picture.  I originally bought this camera because it was billed as having no material lag.  I can tell you it has lived up to its billing.<br />I took it with me on a business trip and it fit in my suit pocket with less bulk than my Palm.  When I took it out to use it everyone wanted to check it out (an added bonus).  In fact someone else on the trip liked it so much they bought one as soon as they got back.<br />I am a gadget lover, a shutter bug, and a mobile kind of guy who doesn't have a lot of pockets for carrying stuff.  This camera pushes all of my buttons.","SL300R is a cool camera. It has this mode selection so that you can choose the mode suitable for the environment where you take your pictures. The camera is easy to use, slim, and light-weight. Can't ask for a better camera.","i lost my charger and would like to know where i can get another one for it.","I bought this camera because I found a great deal through Amazon and a good friend owns one and loves it. It had all the features I was looking for. Unfortunately, 2 months after I purchased it, the shutter (I think) froze up and the camera would no longer take any pictures. It came with a 1-year warrantee, so no worries. The battery life isn't that great, but as long as you keep up with charging it after every use, you'll be fine. It takes great pictures and it very easy to operate. I sort of miss the view finder, and I agree the lack of a lens cap is an annoying design flaw. If you're looking for a simple camera to drop in your pocket for quick point and click action, this is a good choice. If you're looking for a professional-grade wonder d-camera, look elsewhere (I like the Cannon Rebel Digital personally...)","I've been waiting around for a couple of years, trying to convince myself that I really needed a digital camera.  I'm glad I finally jumped in with this little gem.  This camera makes vacation photography fun again!  I was looking for a small camera, but one that would hold up and do some video.  I read all the reviews and will admit that I was hesitant, particularly about the memory and battery life.  But what I liked out-weighed the negatives, and I am thrilled with my decision.  The first thing I did was go out and purchase a larger memory card, which is really necessary.  The camera comes with 16 mgs, not nearly enough for photos, let alone video.  But with more memory, the thing is perfect for me!  I should add that if you really want to enjoy digital photography and don't really want to climb the learning curve, buy a Mac, sit back and have fun!","I bought this camera because I dont like carrying a bag, and other cameras are very clunky and over sized, this camera fits easily in a back pocket and is soooo easy to use.<br /><br />I took this camera with me to San Diego this summer and took over 200 pictures, from the surf to the nightlife the camera held up great. I've also taken video of friends and concerts and it produces great quality and sound. When ever i use it people are always saying \"what agreat camera, how neat or is that a camera?\"<br /><br />It is a great peice and has a great rechargable-in camera battery.  My Dad bought a more expensive Nikon digital camera and is constantly searching for batteries because his have run out or asking someone to carry it in their bag--those 2 problems are non issues with this camera. I would give it 10 stars by far the best item I have purchased on Amazon-- if your looking for something that produces good film quality pictures, is slim lightweight and has a good battery life--- LOOK NO FURTHER-- this is your camera (or look at the new verision which has 4 .0  mega pixels) Love it love it love!!! Hope you will too!","I bought this camera a few days ago and this was a great camera. I have been looking for a small, compact camera with a nice looking design, and still take great pictures. What I love about this camera the most is the very slim design and the swivel idea which separates the lens from the LCD viewfinder.<br />Pros: Very sleek design, very fast startup time, fast picture taking, burst mode, great pictures, video recording with sound, price is hard to resist for a 3.2 megapixel camera.<br />Cons: Poor battery life, very small buttons, LCD screen has no protection.<br />Overall, this camera is very good and has a great price tag. If you do buy this camera, you would want to look into buying a second battery and another case because the case that comes in the box is not very sturdy.","Great for point and shoot purposes- awesome size, plenty of pixels and good optics.  The lens is a little small, though, so it suffers in lower light conditions.  and the flash is kinda underpowered, so it's hard to get good groups shots in darkish conditions.  although when compared to competitors (nikon SQ, sony DSCU50, etc... similar size and features) the lens size and flash are no better or worse.<br />One of the features that made me buy this camera was the advertised \"speed.\"  While it is extremely fast to start up, the time between hitting the shutter button and the image being captured is no faster than competitors.  kind of a let down.<br />BIGGEST LET DOWN is the fragility of the camera.  There is a DESIGN FLAW in the case that makes it so that if the camera is inserted a certain way, the snap closure to the (cool looking) case puts pressure on the LCD screen.  This mistake is easy to make, so be careful.  Mine was broken by the second day.  Kyocera does not care that this is a design flaw and will make you pay to repair it!!! I'll bet the case gets changed next year.  The camera also gets REALLY HOT if left on for a while.<br />BEST FEATURE is the swivel design.  I got used to this feature with my old CoolPix 950 and this was a major selling point.  And the camera looks really damn cool.  I wish we could get the Japanese one with the designer colors....<br />Really great size, cool looking and takes decent pix.  Above average. Hard to find until now- I just saw it at RADIO SHACK ($349)","This is a great camera. It's actually 3.2 megapixels, but whatever. The one drawback about it is that it is easily scratched, and my friend actually dented it by dropping it from no more than 3 feet. I'm not sure whether it hit the floor or an object on the floor, but it's dented. And it is very easily scratched. I left the camera on my bed, and when I picked it up again, it had scratches! Seeing as how the case seems pretty sturdy, I was pretty surprised. However, that's about the only drawback, besides the short battery life(35 minutes left on), but just get another battery and voila, taken care of. Extremely small size, fits easily in my cramped pocket along with my cell phone and wallet. And it actually has NO lag! As for the flash, some people say it's weak, but everyone I've taken a picture of says it's really strong. Great camera, lovin it.","The size of this piece of technology is what really sold me, but then you get to use it, you appreciate the great list of features, ease of use, quality of display, zoom, rechargable, USB plug in, huge memory chips available.<br />The only downer is the strength of the flash, but you cannot have everything.<br />It stays in your pocket/purse and is there whenever you need it, just remember keep it charged and stay relatively close for flash pics..","Love this camera!  Wonderful size. Great pictures.  Movie mode was really impressive.  Awefully short on battery life when using the LCD Backlight so consider a second battery. I've been wanting to get a digital camera for some time but was completely unable to deal with the lag between pushing the shutter button and getting the picture.  I originally bought this camera because it was billed as having no material lag.  I can tell you it has lived up to its billing.<br />I took it with me on a business trip and it fit in my suit pocket with less bulk than my Palm.  When I took it out to use it everyone wanted to check it out (an added bonus).  In fact someone else on the trip liked it so much they bought one as soon as they got back.<br />I am a gadget lover, a shutter bug, and a mobile kind of guy who doesn't have a lot of pockets for carrying stuff.  This camera pushes all of my buttons.","SL300R is a cool camera. It has this mode selection so that you can choose the mode suitable for the environment where you take your pictures. The camera is easy to use, slim, and light-weight. Can't ask for a better camera.","This is the 5th digital camera I have experience with...  2 Canon PowerShots, the Archos AVCam attachment for an AV3x0 and some piece of junk I borrowed.  The only significant fault I can find with this camera is that the glass lens cover is exposed and for the first few times I used it I kept getting my fingerprints on it - get over it...  Sure it comes with a small SD card and you need to get a bigger one (I got a 256MB one to replace the obviously inadequate 16MB one it comes with).  So what?  Look at other digital cameras - same thing.  Battery life seems GREAT to me.  Sure if you are a moron and just turn it on and leave it on allowing it to auto-focus on everything you will run the battery down quickly - duh.  The most fabulous feature of this camera is that it boots amazingly quickly.  Turn it off after you take a picture and turn it back on when you want to take another - common sense...  Perfect size, very intuitive controls, great picture and movie quality, ultra fast boot and the rapid shot feature is great.  I am a picky early adopter gadget freak and this device is awesome!  I have a Kyocera Palm phone device (my 3rd Palm/cell phone combo after a Samsung and a TREO) and both of these Kyocera devices are great!","They Kyocera SL300R is not trying to be all things to all photographers. Rather, it's a carry-anywhere snapshot-taker with good quality and some outstanding features. I own one, and after a busy Christmas I can attest to its excellent performance. Its brief \"warm-up\" time and ability to take shots in rapid succession are revolutionary for a small digital camera. Its form factor is superb, and its design is worthy of display at MOMA. To compensate for the dinky 16MB supplied card and short battery life, I've ordered a 256MB memory card ($80) and an additional battery. Problem solved!","It's fast, small and cool-looking.  My husband has a high end digital camera that I like but this one is much faster and also takes good pictures.  Digital cameras are improving!<br />Yeah, it does eat battery power, but only if you keep it turned on.  I've only had it for a few weeks but have taken it to four gatherings and on a ski trip with no problems except for one time when I let my nephew play with it for a half hour without turning it off.  I've already got in the habit of recharging it the evening after I use it so it's ready for next time.<br />I'm only so-so when it comes to understanding how to use high tech stuff, but I was able to figure out the features of this camera pretty easily.  Except for the red-eye reduction.  It took me a bit of manual study to figure out how to turn it on.  (Push the arrow up.)<br />I love the design, too, and so far I love the pictures.  And it's just incredibly nice to carry around and pull out and snap pictures with.  Makes me giddy.","Well, my wife rarely buys me gifts, but she could hardly contain her enthusiasm when she presented me with this gorgeous little camera for no reason.  I've had 3 digitals- an original Sony Mavica, a Toshiba, and currently a Fuji Finepix 6800Z.  I was really taken by the small size and function of this little beauty, but I was a little worried when there was no mention anywhere - on line, in the owners manual - of battery life.  Well, for good reason.  The lithium ion battery, fully charged, only gave me 35 minutes of life.  I used it as I would if I were on a trip - snapping away, about 30 pictures, a few rapid sequence pictures, and a short movie.  I kept the LCD display on dim, and didn't pre or post view the images, to keep battery use down.  I was incredibly disappointed when the battery dipped into the low range after 35 mintes - bear in mind, this isn't 35 minutes of constant use, but 35 minutes of being on.  it is on its way back to Amazon, and I'll stick with my Fuji.  What a stupid and idiotic product; what in God's name does someone like Kyocera think when they market this?  Don't they use it?  Don't they test it?  And the 16mb card it comes with - 9 pictures?  Plus, there's no lens cap, so about every 4th time you reach into your pocket to get it out your fingers hit the lens.  This ia huge marketing gaffe and is pretty amazing for a japanese company, so revered for their \"human\" engineering.<br />PIctures, functionality, size, etc. were all excellent, so this camera is a really sad indictment of how fundamental functions of a camera can completely destroy its value."]},{"name":"Canon EOS 300D (EOS Digital Rebel / EOS Kiss Digital)","amazon_reviews":["Received as describe in advertisement.

I will keep this one around for awhile as I am sure to miss it if I don't!","I do not know how other reviewers use this camera, but am inclined to  think that their problems are caused by  user error. I have had this camera for  4 years now along with the camera dock. I love this camera. I have had no problems at all. Even after it fell off the roof of the car it works like a champ.It is easy to use. compact,not overly complicated. I use the view finder alot as the lcd  on any digital camera will use up the battery really fast.I  use the lcd only when taking close up shots of items for online selling or outside to capture insects, flowers etc. It charges quickly, holds a charge a long time .I use the KODAK rechargable battery pack and I replace it annually  ( it cost me $12.00 a year  for  the battery ).  I have taken hundreds of  photos with this camera and it has never failed me.  I love the video feature too, you can  capture  alot of fun times withit.The online Easyshare software is great too and it is free. You can  crop, edit, enahnce,frame etc.  do  just about anything you want to  your  pics .A really nice camera for a very reasonable price.","unless I bought a camera at twice the price and this one was high when I bought it 2 1/2 years ago. I have taken over 3400 photos and have had absplutely NO mechanical problems. However, I am cheap and take care of my stuff. I think I have dropped it twice since I had it but no damage.<br /><br />I have heard many horrible reports about quality but who knows how it was treated. Overall, picture quality is amazing. The 10x zoom quality is not too good so I use the 3x optical mostly and it is excellent.<br /><br />I have taken it to Disney World and an Alaskan cruise and it performed great. I did buy a Duracell fast charger with 4 2400mAh rechargable batteries so  I would not have to lug the dock around to charge the batteries. Battery life is quite good for Duracell and the Kodak pack but I carried a spare with me in the Alaska  wilderness.<br /><br />My 10 year old grand-daughter uses the camera with ease and takes good photos. I am now looking for a good used one (cheap) for her as I want to keep mine. My 5 year old grandson can also take photos with it but some are blurry since he can't hold still.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about it is that the flash is not good at any distamce over about 10 feet. Like at a basketball game and I want to shoot my granddaughter. The flash actually makes the picture very dark and it is better to turn the flash off. Surprisingly, then it makes pretty good photos and of course they can be easily enhanced with the software.<br /><br />I wouldn't want to buy another one if it was not good.","So I got this camera like over two years ago and I feel like I can now make an accurate review of it. Don't let the negative reviews turn you away from this little gadget. Of course there are flaws to it and of course there are a few lemons in the batch... just like with any other electronic products.<br /><br />I have not had any real problems with it. The only semi-problem is that sometimes the lens would not come out all the way and result in a semi-blurred picture. The remedy to that is just switching it off and back on again. No biggie.. and it rarely happens.<br /><br />It's still working well and just a note... if you decide to get the printer dock that goes along with it, it can still print pictures from the computer so even if the camera dies on you, you can still use the printer dock so I also suggest getting the printer dock because it prints awesome pictures.","Well after nearly two years of use I just have to say this camera is my camera of choice for quick pick up shots.  If you're looking for a camera that has<br /><br />Easy to use features **********<br /><br />Quick to Review format **********<br /><br />User friendly Menu layout **********<br /><br />Fast Delete Button  (with double check features)**********<br /><br />Speedy Share *********<br /><br />Or Small but great viewing window **********<br /><br />Automatic lens **********<br /><br />Wide & Telephoto (zoom)**********<br /><br />Then the Kodak EasyShare CX6330 is for you.  I use it all the time because it<br /><br />Fits in my pocket *****<br /><br />Easy to carry along ***** You ask me where I carry it?  It would probably be better if you asked me when I don't carry.  Because I've got it almost all the time.  I like to carry this light weight camera on trips to Disney World, to speaking events and to major engagements where I will be mixing or mingling.<br /><br />It's very special for the visual layout.  This helps to strengthen my ease of use and inspires me to carry it almost everywhere.<br /><br />THE ONE THING THAT I FOUND CHALLENGING<br /><br />Even when you have a small little easy to use camera something can go wrong.  I've found that the camera begins to stick and sometimes makes it challenging when you want to start shooting pictures right away.  It appears that the internal functioning of the lens does not always spring out forward when you turn it on.  This can slow down your shooting time frame as you have to use the manual wide angle features to open it up.  This was the only area of challenge I had and you might have.  Thanks for your time and for reading.  Is there anything else I can do for you?<br /><br />Your Servant, Deremiah, *CPE (Customer Passion Evangelist)","We got our camera as a gift about two years ago.  We LOVED it, while it worked.  It's easy to use and takes great quality pictures.  Lately it drains batteries, in less then two minutes.  We're really bummed.  So I guess we are in the market for a new camera.  If you purchase this camera, get the extended warranty.","This camera I own for two years. The pictures of this camera were excellent. We took the pictures during night time at Niagra Waterfalls, pictures came so good.<br /><br />Nice features of camera:<br />Excellent resoultion and quality; good at night shots; date imprint feature, NTSC/PAL TV output; able to print 8X10 size without loosing quality;<br /><br />But after using two years it start giving the problems, it's not holding the battery for not even two photos. I given the camera for repair at CompUSA. They replaced couple of parts and working fine for few days. Later it totally stop working even though you load full charged batteries. The camera power light blink and it stops. Anyhow, it's not working now. I suggest to take extended warranty from store for this camera to overcome these kind of problems.","I've had this camera well over a year. The zoom button broke within my first year, but it was still under warranty and it was serviced without problem. Overall, I've been very pleased with this camera. The optional \"easyshare dock\" is not at all necessary, as I upload my pictures with a simple USB cable.<br /><br />I've been, for the most part, happy with the pictures I've taken (over 1000). It usually focuses well, but on the pictures I took at the zoo, I could not make it focus on the animals instead of the fences I was looking through.<br /><br />Low-light pictures frequently turn out badly. Also, the LCD review misrepresents the brightness of pictures. Pictures that look perfect on the review are often too dark on my computer. Sometimes I have to force the flash on, because it doesn't recognize that there isn't enough light.<br /><br />I didn't have this problem when I first bought the camera, but now, it will not focus in extremely bright light (such as on the beach, with bright sunlight and reflections from the ocean and sand).<br /><br />The quality of the pictures is perfect for 4x6 prints, but I've never tried anything bigger. Overall, I usually do edit the pictures I take, but I don't think the originals are that bad. Just too dark, often.<br /><br />If you are planning on using this camera for video, CHOOSE SOMETHING ELSE. Even on the highest quality setting, the videos are a tiny resolution. Also, the camera has a microphone for recording sound, but if you want to review your video, it has no speaker. Additionally, the zoom function is disabled during video.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good camera for the family photographer, but there are better out there for the same price.","I have had this camera for over 2 years and love it to death.  I take it everywhere and take lots of pictures and short video clips with it.  It is so easy to use and takes awesome pictures.  I didn't buy the printer dock to print the pictures.  I went with a picture quality printer and let me tell you...you can't tell if I had the pictures printed at the photo shop or on my computer.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this camera!","Long story short: This easy-to-use camera packs in great features for the price. It has yet to disappoint me in any way.<br /><br />I've taken this camera with me on a couple of trips, including one to Antarctica, and I've been delighted by the pictures I've brought home. The video-capture, with sound, is a nice touch. The level of resolution has not been a problem for me. If you're looking for more zoom (and that will cost you), this might not be the right camera for you.","This is my first digital camera and I love it.  The pictures are so clear and it is very easy to use. I also loved that Amazon had a guided tour so you can see how the menus work! The software is also easy to use and you can do some amazing editing. The memory card door is a bit chinzy so you do have to be careful when opening. I've taken this on 2 vacations and have not been disappointed. Rechargeable batteries are recommended!","I bought this digital camera as my first digital camera, and am blown away with it. Before I bought I studied all the different brands, read reviews and settled on this camera. The pictures are great and very easy to use. I use my camera juat about everywhere I go. I've taken day shots, night shots, moving shots and so on. Haven't had a single problem with it. Yes it does go through batteries quite quickly but its never been a problem with me.","I absolutely love this camera.  I received it as a birthday gift and have used it a lot with friends.  I'm 15 and brought it to camp this summer, my pictures were the best I'd taken in my 5 years of camp.  My only setback is the fact that my battery door had a little piece break off so it doesn't stay shut all the way but my dcut tape matches it pretty well so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />Using the LCD all the time drains the battery pretty quickly but if it's on quickview there's not a problem.<br /><br />I suggest buying a memory card because it only holds 16 pictures at the best setting within the internal memory.  My dad bought me a 512MB card and it will hold 570 some pictures.","I bought this camera back in March and I returned the original one I bought because after taking about 4 pictures it wouldn't turn on anymore and it ended up being defective in the long run.  Now I have one that works wonders.  The only thing is that when your batteries get low or die altogether it doesn't always give you a low battery warning.  It's wonderful for taking everyday pictures and the print quality is awesome.  The video feature is great for little videos that are like 2 minutes in length.  There is also a variety of picture taking modes that make digital photography with this camera idiot proof.<br /><br />The USB cable that comes with it is smaller on the end that plugs into the camera but standard on the other end.  The camera also comes with an AV cable that connects to your tv so you can view your pictures and your video's through your own tv.  The software that comes with this camera is a JOKE!  I would recommend buying a memory card reader and photo printing software so you can print your pictures.  It can be VERY confusing and very difficult to use.<br /><br />The camera itself is a wonderful deal and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a digital camera but doesn't want the high price tag.  Our friend has a 5.0 mp Kodak digital camera and the prints from mine turn out much better than hers.","I bought this to replace my older digital camera and my crappier no-brand digital camera. (See reviews of those below, just in case you run across them.)<br /><br />CX6330 is extremely easy to use. The photo quality is wonderful (yes, you are able to choose the photo quality from 1.1MP to 3.1), and there are many innovative features not present in any other cameras I have used or owned. It is also very small, compared with older cameras or to the HP or Fujifilm models. Another great feature is that you can buy rechargeable batteries to use with either a 3-volt AC Adapter (not included, unfortunately) or the optional camera dock or camera printer dock. Or, if you already have a recharger, the camera only takes two AA batteries.<br /><br />Another great feature is the video mode. Not only does it capture video with sound, the quality is also very good. I suggest getting a larger memory card (at least 256MB, but 1GB for the longest shots) if you want to use it frequently for video.<br /><br />I docked one star for reasons stated by other customers. One is the extremely flimsy USB/SD card door. I don't think it'll break unless you put some pressure on it, but I recommend you be careful when you open it to insert/remove the memory card or insert the USB (which is mini - it uses a smaller head than the standard USB cable) cable. Another problem is the Kodak software included. It tries to be \"too helpful\" which just gets in the way. Kodak should release a simpler program for those of us who just want to load pictures and video to our computers!<br /><br />If you can look over those two problems, I recommend this camera strongly. It isn't for the professional - it is for the family, the high school or college student. I think you will enjoy using it as much as I.<br /><br />Kodak CX6330 is my third digital camera to date. My first is a Fujifilm MX-1200, which I received when I graduated high school, nearly five years ago now. It is a good camera, and it still continues to take great pictures at 1.3MP, but I needed a camera with a video capturing option. It is a shame Fujifilm doesn't make thin camera's any more...most of their cameras are so thick now. If you are looking for a used digital camera for your younger children or for very casual pictures, I recommend looking for this one.<br /><br />My second digital camera is an Omisys 4.0MP 4-in-1 camera, which I bought for a measly $80. I was curious about this camera, because it came with so many options. It is a so-so camera - it takes still pictures, video with sound, records sound only, and also works as a webcam. The LCD quality is absolutely dreadful, the flash takes more than 15 seconds to load, and the white balance is practically non-existant. The flash is also too strong for any shot closer than six feet. I keep it to use as a webcam that I can take anywhere with ease. It takes great outdoor pictures and videos, however. But I don't recommend ANYONE purchasing this camera, unless you ONLY take outdoor pictures/videos that doesn't require flash.","While a little too expensive to be a \"throw away\" camera, this is a basic digital camera that provides good pictures for home use. Pictures are of good quality and can be enlarged up to 5x7 and barely 8X10. This also means you can crop your pictures and magnify your pictures up to a point. Photos are sharp and generally more than adequate for home use, although the results are typical for an autofocus: decent overall, but occasionally it focuses on the wrong subject and flash photos can tend to look washed out. I have not found the other settings: landscape, closeup, action to be of much use yet. The video feature is handy, it is a bit choppy but decent enough to be shown in a small window on a computer monitor. The software is helpful for the novice user who doesn't want to manually organize his or her photos via Windows. The software makes it easy to upload pictures from the camera, but the default setting is for it to be constantly running in the background whenever you turn the computer on - this will slow your system down. ALso, managing your pictures can be a pain especially if you have a lot of previously taken photos already stored on the harddrive. If you use Windows XP, you probably don't need their software. The card uses Secure digital flash media which I think is good: it is stable, has a good price point, and is widely used by many items (such as my notebook computer and Pocket PC ). There is a plastic cover which flaps over the lens when the camera is off, but you really need a case for this if you want to protect it adequately. It uses 2 AA batteries, and seems to consume them pretty rapidly. Overall, if you are looking for an uncomplicated, inexpensive but well performing digital camera, I think this is a good value, and I'm pleased with this purchase. However, if you can afford a little better, and are technically apt enough, I strongly recommend getting a camera with more megapixels and more control over your images.","I also at first thought I was locked into the Kodak software with my EasyShare 6330. But I discovered that when I transfer the photos onto my computer, they appear simultaneously on the Kodak program and in \"My Documents.\" Open My Documents and find your \"My Pictures\" folder; then you'll find one labed \"Kodak,\" and there they are, sorted by date into folders, lovely jpegs to do with as you wish.","It was my first camera it takes movies of me and my friends and takes pictures for those funny moments i say its great","This camera is not a bad little camera if you are looking to take simple candid shots.  I call it my \"glove compartment\" camera.  The one thing I do not like about it is that the flash does not do well from a distance inside.  I used it to take pics at my daughters school functions and they came out dark unless I was with in a certain distance.  Other than that it is very easy to use and the software is simple.","I received Kodak's cx6330 camera for Christmas 2003 and could not be more pleased with it. I have always been interested in photography as are many members of my family. Having this camera has turned my interest into a passion. The photos are sharp, clear, with wonderful color. The camera is easy to use but not so basic that you lose out on creativity. There are many innovative  features such as the burst or action mode and the color modes: sepia, black and white, and color. This has allowed me to move past basic photography and get creative.<br />The selftimer (10 seconds) is available for both photographs and videos. Video is available with audio, which is perfect for capturing moments that surpass a single shot. Cx6330 is a 3.1 MP camera, which is plenty for a novice photographer. Eventually, I would like a camera with 4-5 MP. The LCD is a nice size and makes it easy to include all necessary parts of a photograph. With 3X optical zoom and 3.3 advanced digital zoom, you can get even closer to your subject. That being said the more zoom, the poorer the resolution. However, for someone not taking professional photographs this is OK.<br />I received a battery charger rather than the dock for this camera. I am glad because I later purchased the compatible printer dock 6000 (great buy) and another dock would be a waste. I reccomend the dock as a battery charger and an easy way to share photographs. However, I do not advise purchasing it if you will buy the printer dock 6000.<br />I removed one star due to the flimsy door covering the memory card storage and USB port. Hasn't been too much of a problem but when one isn't gentle, it could be. Also, the Kodak EasyShare software could be imporved. Yes, it is easy to crop, reduce red eye, store, share, and explore other fun effects. However, it is very tempermental and slow on my computer. If I need to transfer more than 5 pictures, I pray it won't freeze.<br />All and all this is a wonderful camera. I will be able to look back fondly on this camera as it inspired me to be an amateur photographer. I hope this review helps anyone find a wonderful digital camera. Good luck and enjoy!","The Kodak EasyShare CX6330 3.1 MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom is a easy to use camera, with enough features to keep the novice interested, but not too many to make the camera overwhelming.","I purchased this camera for pictures and video.  After about 2 months of use, I've found it to be easy, simple and most importantly very intuitive to use.  I've only referenced the manual only a few times.  The picture quality is incredible, as well as lighting even on the darkest nights.  The flash is very strong.  I get tons of compliments on my pictures, and i'm by no means a professional photographer.<br />Kodak's EasyShare software is nice for a beginner, but for professional picture editing I'd suggest either Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro.  I have a SanDisk 256Meg card as well, and it works great, i can either take about 306 highest quality pictures or about 16min of video.  In fact, the card is about 3x as fast editing, taking and thumbing through video and pictures vs. using internal memory.  I'd recommend a small camera bag for this camera [doesn't come with any bag] and a 4-pack of rechargeable AA batteries.  I got SONY batteries and they work very nice, although the camera does eat power very quickly, so make sure to have a pair of batteries always handy.<br />Overall, this is an excellent camera for 4x6 pictures and video with sound, which looks very nice on a TV shown for friends/family with provided cable.","Just saw this in this week's Target ad for $169.97 on clearance.As my title says,if you believe Consumer Reports they gave it their Best Buy rating and combined with the price that's all I need to go get one. See the May,2004 issue for more because I don't want to violate the No Commercial Use policy.","Knowing absolutely nothing about digital cameras I read all the reviews I could and trusted the Kodak name and took the leap of faith.  I am so happy I did.  This camera is so easy to use and the software is fabulous.  I have taken quite a few 8 X 10 pictures and framed them and everyone cannot believe they were taken with this camera.  I have to agree on a couple of points however, the door to the batteries and access door to the ISB connection is somewhat flimsy so be careful when you use it but other than that I have no problems at all.  I highly recommend this camera to the \"non-professional\" like myself if you want an easy to use digital camera that takes great pictures.","This camera is simple to use and produces fantastic results. It picks up a fantastic amount of detail, i would recommend it to anyone.","I got this camera for Mother's Day and the reason I bought this brand and model was after reading all the reviews here.  I appreciate everyone's time that they spent giving their opinions on this camera.  I feel that I made an excellent choice on my purchase.  I did not want to spend tons of dollars, but I wanted a camera that would deliver good prints. I bought mine at a warehouse club and the camera came with the docking station, which is something I love.  It has made the camera so easy to use.  My daughter and I spent the afternoon taking pictures, uploading them from the docking station.  We sent some pictures email, and boy was that an easy thing to do.  I have the HP photosmart #2175 printer I put my picture quality ink in the printer and we printed pictures and they turned out so good!  We were impressed. So for having the camera for less than 24 hours I am up and running, taking pictures, printing and emailing, who could ask for more!  I spent $229.00 for mine at the warehouse club and I bought a 128 SDcard.  Thanks again for everyone helping others to choose a good camera for the dollar.","This is a great camera.  Photo quality is excellent.  Battery life is excellent.  And I loved the onscreen stuff - it is as good as any I've seen.<br />The optical zoom is not as great as it could be, but that is a minor issue. Some of the other reviews have complained about that, but that's not reasonable.  You don't buy a camera like this for it's zoom.  You buy it for photo quality, capacity, and battery life.  This camera has all three in good measure.<br />The price is a good one for this type of camera.  If you are looking for a great 3.1 MP camera, you could do a lot worse.","My son bought me this camera for my birthday, just before my wife and I took a 10 day cruise to Spain, Monte Carlo, Italy and Greece.  I didn't want to take my more expensive digital camera because I was afraid it would get stolen.  So I took this Kodak.<br />I was very pleasantly surprised that the pictures came out really good.  It was very easy to use, my rechargeable AA batteries lasted through a whole day of picture taking (hundreds of pics), and the different settings made it foolproof.  For a point and shoot camera, this one is great.<br />The menu is very intuitive. It feels good in your hands. The colors are perfect. Koday did a great job on this camera.","We gave this camera as a gift to our son and we ended up borrowing it from him whenever possible.  This is truly the easiest camera we have ever used.  It takes great pictures, and is easy to use, adjust, and print, and in my opinion that's what taking digital pictures is all about!  I would recommend this camera to anyone.  If you don't get the printer dock, I would suggest some other charger for it.  If you can afford it, the printer dock is a great accessory and small enough to pack if you are travelling and want instant photos, such as family pictures at the holidays.","I just purchased this digital camera and the easy share dock to recharge it and I love it.  The set up is very easy and the software is simple to install.  In just minutes i was taking pictures and transferring them to my computer.<br />  The Kodak Easy Share system makes sharing photos, printing, emailing and compiling an album simple.  Transferring photos to the computer is accomplished in a touch of a button.  Editing is also a breeze with the provided software.<br />  The quality of pictures is also first rate..i have taken indoor and outdoor pictures..even movies.  The Easy Share dock is a great place to keep your camera and make sure it is charged and ready to go.  I did not buy the easy share printer yet..but it probably will be my next purchase.<br />  All in all, this is a great camera for your money..even amateur photographers will find this easy to use, edit and share your pictures.","I got this baby for Christmas after some research and I've loved it.  It takes great photos without that downsides of a lot of digital cameras.  For instance there's almost no delay as with some digital cameras.<br />The variety of modes helps with taking photos and my particular favorite is the video mode.  The videos export to quicktime and are kind of grainy but for a digital camera they're some of the best I've seen and it's great to be able to take them (though if you're going to take videos or lots of photos I'd reccomend a 256 card for the camera, gives you a lot more play time).<br />One of the main things I like about this camera though is the fact that I've dropped it (on accident) and had it in my pocket and accidentally hit it against stuff as I walk on several occasions (not that I'd reccomend this) and it still works fine.  I hate banging it around but it's nice to know it can take it.","After shopping around for digital cameras for weeks, I finally decided on this Kodak camera. I just love it. The pictures are fabulous, and it's very user friendly. I started taking great pictures as soon as I took it out of the box. Some reviews I read said that an optical zoom isn't necassary, but I find it to be invaluable.<br />I would recommend this camera to everyone.","I am very happy with this camera, which I received as a gift.  I have own two digital cameras in the past and this is the best by far.<br />The only minus is that the zoom is difficult to use and you must hold the camera very steady.<br />Pluses...<br />Battery seems to last longer than most<br />Picture quality is fantastic.  I have blown many up and they look great<br />You get nice short video with audio<br />Love the sepia and black and white choice<br />Works well indoors and outdoors<br />Very easy to use<br />Easy to download pictures<br />Who ever designed this camera did an excellent job.  It is so easy to use and the pictures are of excellent quality.","Now, I don't understand all the technical capabilities this camera can do, but the pictures that my wife and I have taken have been superb! They look incredible. On the PC and when we print them. Although, I still love the \"old fashion\" camera that uses film, this is a wonderful addition to our new and expanding world into the multimedia. And not too expanesive, either.","Having purchased two digital cameras for myself - one a Sony 3.1MP and the other a Kodak 5MP; I returned them because I was unhappy with the picture quality.  I took a vacation to the country of my birth and my brother asked me to take a digital camera for him so I purchased this camera blindly on Staples website.  This is a very good camera at $199.  My brother printed the pictures instantly on his computer and the enlargements are great on photo quality paper.  He was very happy with the camera and it was very convenient to print hard copies of photo right away. The picture is unbelievably very good quality. I bought this camera for my brother and I think I can finally buy this camera for myself.","I decided to buy the Kodak camera after shopping around and because of the Kodak name says it best for pictures.  But when I got the camera I started taking pictures of my children and was amazed.  It is easy to work and it creates terrific pictures.  This is a great camera for someone without a lot of time to mess with pictures.  It takes me about 2 minutes max to tranfer pictures to my pc and edit(red eye, enhance, crop, etc.) and decide what size to print and how many and then Print!  The name of the camera says it all!  Easyshare, it is easy to share your pictures with family and friends!","Fantastic Quality pictures. The features are good for the type of camera. Software easy, and fun to use. Yes, it doesn't come with a recharge unit, but the camera kit doesn't come with rechargable batteries either; you would have to buy that seperate. It small, easy, and great fun to use. I love it, and will never regret it.","I love this cameras features for the price.  What I am not thrilled with is the Kodak Easy Share software.  The cd bruner for my 2 month old computer is not compatible with the Kodak software that came with the camera, or the latest software available to download on Kodak's web site.  I can still burn my pictures onto a cd but I can't do it using the Kodak software.  I contacted Kodak and verifyed my info.  Kodak has a good web site to find out if what cd burners are compatible with their software.  But, being a new digital camera user, that did not occur to me to dig that deep into researching this product.  This camera is simple to use, and the printer dock 6000 prints out great pictures.  The manual is easy to follow and did not have to be studied indepth to run the camera.","I recently puchased the Kodak Easyshare 3.1 megapixel camera and I'm very happy with in general as my first digital camera.  The camera is very simple to use and easy to understand.  All the controls are easily accessed and provide a good descripion of what each function does.  The picture quality is good for the price.  It does produce redeye, but with the redeye reducing feature and the easy to use photo editing software provided with the camera you should have no problems making great pictures.  For the price I would say this is an excellent camera, it's very user friendly.","Despues de ver en internet varios modelos de camaras de los cuales podia comprar uno, escogi la Kodak CX6330 por sus caracteristicas y por su precio de rango medio. Lo primero que tuve que descubrir es que es muy facil de usar, tanto que Kodak no incluye un manual impreso. Despues de mis primeras tomas estaba muy contento e impresionado por la calidad del color y por la resolución. Otro punto que descubri es que a los niños les divierte mucho que les tomen fotografías y verse inmediatamente en la pantalla LCD.<br />El punto malo a considerar es que Kodak no suministra accesorios en la compra de sus modelos. Tuve que comprar separadamente un cargador con dos pilas NiMH de 1700 mAH y otro par de pilas Sony para tener dos pilas listas y otras dos en la camara. Tambien tuve que comprar una tarjeta SD de 128 MB, con la cual puedo irme de viaje y regresar con muchas fotos (130-150 fotos de 2032 x 1524 pixeles) o una combinacion de fotos y tomas de video con audio. Tambien es necesario comprar un lector de tarjeta para poder descargar las fotos sin instalar el software de la camara en otras computadoras y un estuche donde cargar camara, cables, cargador, pilas, lector de tarjeta, un minitripié y un kit de limpieza de lentes.<br />Las impresiones en papel Kodak son magníficas, definitivamente al ver la calidad de estas impresiones puedo decir que he cambiado al formato digital y que ya no gastare dinero en rollos de pelicula ni en revelado, solo imprimire las fotos que quiero...","The Kodak EasyShare CX6330 is my first digital camera.  I bought this camera so I would not have to haul my SLR supplies with me everywhere.  What a great choice!  It is small enough to fit in a loose pocket or purse but big enough to hold easily.  It has enough features to please an experienced photographer but also makes a terrific 'point and shoot' model for beginners.  The pictures are clear and the colors are crisp.  Even 11 x 14 photos have great clarity without appearing grainy.  The only problem I foresee is the door to the memory card compartment is very cheap plastic and rather flimsy.  Other than that one small problem, I am tremendously pleased with this camera!  I may abandon my traditional SLR film camera after all.","The good:<br />Very happy with photo quality.<br />Menus, buttons well laid-out and easy to navigate.<br />16MB (17 pics at best quality) internal memory is handy when you fill your card.<br />SD storage is my favorite format.<br />AA battery - buy some 2000mah rechargables and you're set!<br />The bad:<br />Red eye is pretty bad unless using red-eye flash setting.<br />Size is just a little too big to fit in a pocket.<br />SD card port door is cheap plastic - feels fragile, but no problems yet.<br />Not fond of Kodak EasyShare software - I use Canon's Zoom Browser.<br />Overall:<br />Good camera, can't beat the price in the 3MP range (I got mine for $199 new with free 64mb card - Staples).","I have had the camera for three months...works great.<br />I dropped it twice on tile, now after a picture is taken, the screen goes blank and my go ahead green light never comes back on.  Maybe if I drop it again...it will fix itself.  Anyway, treat this dainty camera will TLC and don't let kids touch it!","I've grown from an old Kodak digital camera, to a Canon G1, and finally to a Digital SLR.  Along the way we still used compact 35mm and APS cameras for convenience while traveling and for quick snapshots.  Once we saw the Kodak C6330 we trashed those small film cameras and are now 100% digital.<br />First the camera.  It has an excellent 3x optical zoom and more than enough bytes for 4x6 and 5x7 photos.  It is very easy to use, and the program modes make it a simple process, no more complex than film point and shoots.<br />We went with a 128mb memory card, and sometimes we wish we purchased a 256mb one.  Its all a matter of how many photos you take before uploading them to your computer (remember, you can always delete photos while previewing them to create more room).<br />When you are ready to upload, Kodak's docking system is fantastic,  Just place the camera in the cradle and press the transfer button.  It does not get any easier than this.  Kodak's Easyshare software (included with the cradle) makes it simple to print, edit, mail, or send photos to an online printer service.<br />If you want a decnt zoom lens in a quality point and shoot camera, this one is a great choice.","this is the first digital camera my wife and i have owned. we looked at a lot, from all the major brands. we chose this one for two reasons. the controls on this camera were very similar to a lot of film cameras, even my nikon slr. i love the dial on top of the camera that lets you quickly and easily switch from one shooting mode to another. no need to access the menu, clicking your way through the choices. just turn the dial and you are ready. all the other controls are also very intuitive, which is important to me, being a first time user of this type of camera. the second reason, no matter what store i looked in, when i asked the sales people for input, the kodak was always on a short list of recommendations, mostly for reliability. the only possible downside is that it is a little bit bigger than some other cameras. for me, the controls are much better designed and easier to use, and it just feels more like a real camera than most. for the money, i don't think it can be beat. as for reliability, we bought it about three months ago to take quick easy pictures of our baby boy. i would guess we have taken around 150 pictures in those three months. not one problem with the camera or the software.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA, AND FOR THE PRICE $200.00, YOU SIMPLY CAN'T GO WRONG. I recently switched to digital camera after using the 35mm camera for a LONG time.  My first digital camera I ordered online from Walmart was the HP-733 for the same price.  The HP-733 was a crappy made camera. The pictures was always too dark when taken indoor, even with all the lights turned ON. Another bad thing about the HP-733 was it thru batteries almost every 10 picture takes...I couldn't believe it! It drains the battery so fast.  I hated and returned the camera to Walmart. Then I thought ALL digital cameras are the same until I researched and purchased the KODAK CX-6330...and WOW!! What a difference!! The CX-6330 has changed my perception about digital camera. Like this camera for these reasons: [1] picture qualities was beautiful and bright even warm light. [2] battery seems to last at least 3 times longer than the HP-733. [3] The Kodak Easy-share software...they NOT kidding when they called it EASY SHARE. It's really fun to use their software.  I was able to email directly from the camera or from the computer after loading the pictures. I can run the slide-shows continuously.  The pictues editing/enhancement features allow easy editing your pictures before save. Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera.  I have shot over 120 pictures so far and maybe replaced the batteries about the 4th times - which is not bad.  I hightly recommend this camera at 3.2MP, unless you are planning to buy a camera in a 5MP which cost a heck of a lot more.","This is my first taste of digital cameras so I did a lot of research. I didn't get too technical because I really just wanted to start taking pictures right away. So easy that without reading instructions I was able to take pictures. 16mb internal memory is plenty for email pics. Shutter lag was pretty fast. After briefly reading the instructions I was off to the races. While more expensive than the CX6230 it is a camera that will be around for a long while! Do yourself a favor get a Kodak easyto use digital camera! The only reason I rated this camera a 4 is that I believe while really hard to do, there might be an easier to use camera out there. I doubt it though.","This is a great, simple-to-use camera except for the flash.  The automatic flash seems unpredictable.","So far this camera is fantastic. I have only had it for about a month so I don't know how durable it is. As far as ease of use, I have to agree with everyone that this is SO simple to use. My camera came with the easyshare camera dock 6000 and all I have to do is push a button to take great pictures or videos and then set my camera on the dock and push a button and they're on my computer. I'm a beginner with digital cameras so this one is just amazing to me. I absolutely love it!<br /><br />~*Update*~<br />Have had the camera now for over 2 years and it's still in perfect shape! Very durable, highly recommended camera!!","I did a TON of research before buying this camera, and it is simply the best camera in the $200 range. The Kodak 6330 is a great overall digital camera for the price! It is really easy to use, and the EasyShare software is very simple. It creates great pics, and I've already used the print ordering function on the software to print photos to my local grocer. Great quality photos up to 11x14.<br />The size of the camera is average, but if I had another $100 to spend, I would probably go with the Elph or Minolta's slim body camera (XT?). I don't know if they are as simple to use, but they are less than half the thickness and the Minolta doesn't have an external zoom, which cuts down on noise and there is nothing to bump around. The only problem with the smaller cameras is the proprietary batteries (you can't just throw some AA's in them, as you can with the 6330).<br />All of that said, I'm VERY HAPPY with my 6330. I got a 128 MB card. I would recommend watching the papers for deals on this one. I found one with a free 64 MB card on sale for 199 at one retailer, and got another retailer to do a price match and throw in a 128 MB card instead of the 64 for only $10 extra. Not too shabby. :-) so, for under $300, I got the camera, rechargable batteries and charger, a case, & a 128mB card.<br />:-)","I purchased this for my husband as a holiday gift and he loves it.  It's so much easier than our HP digital camera, which is now shoved in a closet someplace.  It takes great pictures, I do have one recommendation though.  Purchased the printer dock with it, makes taking pictures much easier.","very good pics inside with low light.You cant go wrong with it.Im using a HP 7550 printer and the pics are perfect.","This camera has everthing! It comes with everything for family needs. It has 6 camera modes including movie mode. This mode can make a movie as big as the memory card can hold. It is very popular, and is very effecient. I had an old sony maciva, and the quality was terrible, but this camera will take cyrstal clear photos. You can use a rechargable battery or simple AA's. The zoom is 3x optical and 10x digital. This is a awesome camera at an awesome price! And it comes with great software. Easyshare is so simple and fast. 5 Stars! (I would rate it 10 stars though.)","I looked all around for a camera that cost $200 or less and this camera beat out the competion.  The 3.1 MegaPixels allow for higher resolution than the other $200 cameras.  The camera is very easy to use in that all you have to do is turn the dial, point, (zoom if you want to [it has 3x optical, digital zoom is pointless]) and shoot.  The multiple settings that are available make the camera that much better.  Then to upload the pictures to a computer, you just need to plug the cable into the camera and computer and they are automatically downloaded(Windows XP) or use the included software to move the pictures from camera to computer.  Printing the pictures is easy and they come out looking great.  Some pictures taken with the CX6330 can be seen at [...]<br />Oh yeah, the deals in the stores that advertise this camera in the Sunday newspapers are great!!!  Be sure to check those out.","I received this as gift. I've taken 50+ pics as well as two short videos with this camera so far, and have had astounding results. The camera is simple to use, and the software is very easy as well. This is a great camera for someone who just wants to take great pics and have fun. The pics are sharp, clear, and well focused. They print better than my regular film camera!<br />Extras I suggest:<br />The Kodak rechargeable battery pack, or a CR-V3 battery (although I've gotten surprisingly good results with the batteries that came with the camera)<br />A memory card (I purchased a 128 mb card which can hold over 115 pics at the best quality)","This is great. I had the Kodak CX 4230. It was terrible. The pictures were not very good. I have the Kodak Printer Dock 6000 and the Kodak 6330 they make an awesome duel. I love the video feature. It stinks if you don't have a good memory card. I have a 256 and you can take 16 minutes of video! I love all the modes it has. It has Video, Auto, Sport(Action Shots), Night, Landscape, and Close Up. They all rock. Trust me, if you are looking for a good digital camera this is the one to get. Also it's a Kodak. Ready to use out of the box. Put in the batteries and you are ready to go. It even says what to do first. It would make a great Christmas Gift.","Alright, to give this gift to a teenager and not worry about how well they would do with it would be an example of an abnormal parent, right? With this camera, though, there are no worries, because it is<br /> -easy to take pictures<br /> -easy to transfer pictures<br /> -and easy to print pictures<br /><br /> Sounds easy... It is! Pictures always turn out great, and the camera is within a reasonable price as far as quality goes... I give it FIVE STARS!","I love this camera.  It has almost every feature I could want.  The only feature it doesn't have is a built-in speaker, so you can't hear your movies until you download them onto a computer or tv.  This has not been a problem for me, though, since I rarely use that feature.  It takes FANTASTIC pictures.  I bought the Printer/Dock 6000 with it.  It is the best combination ever made!  I can take photos and \"develop\" them in seconds!  I use it all the time!  I am now known as the picture taker in our circle of friends, and they love that I can give them photos instantly.","I've taken indoor and outdoor shots with this camera and blown them up to 12x18 ($2.99 at the local Costco) with astounding results. The few artifacts there are (mostly in the shadows) aren't viewable unless you are within a few inches of the 12x18 print. Of course I only printed the very best shots at this large size, but I haven't seen any artifacts in any of the shots I've taken (~1000) that would be visible on an 8x10 print from a distance of more than 3 inches. Also, the artifacts themselves are quite interesting. They aren't the square blocks or jaggies you expect in JPEGs, but rather the kind of blobs that you get when you look at a grainy part of a 35mm print under magnification. Anyway they seem to blend in and enhance the picture instead of weaken it. For instance my cat has extremely fine fur that is gray with a very very small white tip in places, giving the cat a grizzled appearance. These tips show up in the pics making the image look razor sharp. A similar thing happens with the \"peach fuzz\" on my kids faces. These details don't show up in any of my 35mm point-and-shoot photos.<br />Battery life is very good. I've never ran the 2100mAh nimh batteries I bought (Walmart-- $16 for 4 batteries with a home and auto charger) completely dead but I've taken over 100 shots (many of them flash) between charges several times.<br />The thing I like most is about this camera is that I haven't had to edit any of the shots (except for cosmetic purposes) before printing: the sharpness, brightness/contrast and color of the shots seem to be optimal. The size of the picture files is small, most of my pics come out at 700k - 1.3mb.<br />The flash is strong. While experimenting, I took a picture of my (large) living room in the near dark with the flash. The picture came out perfectly sharp and exposed in such a way that it looks like the lights are on. Flash strength is adjusted appropriately most of the time and red-eye is not a problem (when I remember to turn on the red-eye setting).<br />I don't miss most of the adjustments available on \"higher end\" cameras. For instance the auto white balance seems to work nearly perfectly in all situations as do the auto aperture size and shutter speed. There are settings on the dial for low light, high shutter speed, and close-up focus. However these settings are only selectable and not adjustable.<br />This brings up the one thing I would add to the camera if I could and that is a setting that would allow me to get the raw data in either uncompressed or TIFF format. This hasn't been an issue really since the camera seems to do a better job of sharpening and color adjustment than I can with Photoshop (I'm not an expert). However, when I did edit some pizza sauce out of one the pics with Photoshop I found myself in a quandary. The original picture was about 900k in size (about 10:1 JPEG compression). How should I save the file? I was afraid that I would lose some picture quality if I saved it at such a high compression. In the end, I saved the picture to a 1mb JPEG took it to Costco and had them print a 11x14 print which turned out flawless.<br />Let me finish by saying that this camera is extremely easy to use. My six year-old picked up this camera and started taking shots (albeit using the view finder rather than the lcd display).","This is the best camera I have ever owned.  I use my Epson 820 Photo printer to print the pictures and they are spectacular!<br />They are sharper than my wedding pictures.<br />The camera is very small and very easy to use.  I recommend getting at least a 128 secure digital card after you get use to<br />taking picutes.<br />I have taken many short movies with sound and downloaded them to<br />my computer. They are surprisingly good.<br />I checked out all the competition for comparisons and this camera<br />for the price is the best.  Normally I would look at a Nikon,Canon or Olympus. I compared this camera with the Canon A70 and the Nikon 3100. It absolutely takes better pictures and is much easier to use.  It is also about 75 to 100 dollars cheaper.  Try the night setting in a dark room, you will be surprised.","i bought this camera for my moms birthday. after showing her how to use it, i wanted to keep it for myself. i bought a KODAK because its menu is easy to navigate, and even more easier to read. this camera has an automatic shut down mode if you leave the unit on by accident. swiching between modes is very quick. i was very supprised to see that the picture quality was better than i expected. i guess it really doesnt have to say NIKON on it to be good ?<br />i was alittle disapointed with the D pad. its alittle hard to hit the center OK button. and the memory door seems very flimsy. im always affraid im goin to break it. i was most upset to find there is NO CHARGEING CABLE WITH THE PACKAGE! thats an extra 25 dollars. but at least it does accept rechargables!!!<br />this unit has many other useful features. its light, compact, it takes SD cards, and every one who uses it that i know, always gives great commments about it. I STRONGLY SUGGEST AT LEAST GO TO THE LOCAL RETAIL OUTLET AND LOOK AT WHAT KODAK HAS BUILT.<br />thanks to cnet, amazon, consumer reports and pricewatch for helping me make my choice.","I purchaed the CX 4230 camera, it was S L O W! Push the shutter and you would have to wait 5 seconds for it to take the picture. This is wicked fast. GREAT Camer","This is my second digital camera and it is the best, the most fun, etc. that I've had with a camera.  I also have the printer dock and just love it!!  I couldn't be more satisfied!","I have the camera for 3 weeks and I am satisfied with the results. The price is good for a 3 megapixels camera and it was really simple to use (I learned to use it without the manual). Picture quality is good (similar to other 3 Mpixel camera), colors are saturated, maybe too much in the reds. The images are a bit overprocessed, not terrible but can be seen in the details of a 8x10 pictures.<br />I did not acquired the docking station and will not do it, it was very simple to transfer the pictures with the included USB cable. A must is a 1850 to 2200 mAh rechargeable battery set with a fast charger (as with other digicams).<br />This camera was designed as a point-and-shot, so it have  few manual controls (the most useful control is that exposure can be varied by +/- 2 EV). The white balance is automatic only (no manual options), but the camera can handle different light sources with very good results.<br />The autofocus system is very good, specially considering that the camera has no focus-assist lamp. You can lock the focus and the exposure, partially pressing the \"shutter\" release.<br />You can not select shutter speed or lens aperture (as with other point-and-shot cameras), but you can use the scene modes to vary it (I use speed mode more than the standard auto mode, and turn off the flash except when I really need it).<br />The LCD is ok (average), considering the price, my only complain is that it was difficult to see in very dim light and is better to use the optical viewfinder in these cases.<br />The startup time is slow if you compare it with a film camera, but equivalent to other digicams in this range. The same issue applies to the \"shutter\" delay after button pressure.<br />The camera was well constructed and I consider it beautiful designed. The size was small if not diminutive, almost the same as my Rollei 35 (the smallest 35mm camera in the 60's), I am using the Easyshare with a hand made Rollei 35 bag. You can find a more rugged or a smaller digicams but at higher price.","This is the first digital camera I have purchased.  So far I am quite satisfied.  I like that the controls are easy to use and understand and find the software very useful.  I also purchased the printer dock and have to say the prints are as good as anything you'd get with a 35mm.  My only dislikes are the slow time between photos (though all have this to my knowledge) and the general size of it.  It's definitely not the smallest on the market, but at the same token, the size makes for comfortable picture taking.<br />All in all, I am very pleased with this camera.","Bought this camera last month - and the whole family can't stop using it - even my 10yr old daughter.  Purchased the camera while on holiday - started to panic because after opening the box realised the instructions are only in PC format - no booklet provided - but it's so simple to use you didn't need it anyway.  Easy to link up to PC/TV - and the camera screen for re-viewing is a nice size.  Wish someone had told me that it practically eats batteries when you're playing about with it (invest in a recharger) - but they last well for just general useage.  Video mode is brilliant and the picture quality is very good on both TV/PC.<br />Recommend.","I just bought this camera and it's easy to use. For some of the tasks, I had to open the owners manual, but it wasn't that difficult to operate. The pictures are outstanding. I've used both Optical and Digital Zoom with excellent results. It's a nice camera for a beginner like me. It's fully automatic. Uploading the pictures to a computer requires the Kodak Software.","After having this camera for more than a month, I must say I am quite pleased with the image quality.  It is also cool to see the video mode, with sound, and the movie size depends on the size of the memory card.  With a 32 mb card, i can take a 2 minute long movie.  The camera is easy to use and figure out, granted I still find out new things every time I use it.  I really enjoy having this camera, it is good for a beginner like me.  My only complaint is the battery life, this thing drains batteries like mad.  Overally, I would give this 4.5 stars, but since I cant, gave it 4 due to the battery life."]},{"name":"Kodak DX6340","amazon_reviews":["I like this camera .

However, it will eat them quickly.  You need to buy the Energizer lithium AA batteries, sometimes referred to as \"digital camera batteries\" and the Kodak DX6340 will run off of them for a really long time.  This is actually an advantage over cameras with a rechargeable battery in them because you can carry a couple spare AA cells and be right back in business if you run the camera for days on end.  No need to stop your sight-seeing trip because the camera's battery is dead.<br /><br />The Kodak DX6340 has a rotary dial on the back to switch it on and change operating modes.  This is actually a great feature because the camera isn't a \"vampire appliance\".  When it's off, it's really off.  No trickle battery drain.<br /><br />They say the Kodak DX6340 is only 3.1 MP, and compared to all the new cameras touting 12 MP and more, you would think the Kodak DX6340 takes inferior pictures.  Not so!!!  The M550 (one of the crummy cameras I bought trying to replace the Kodak DX6340) takes pictures about half as nice as the Kodak DX6340.<br /><br />The size and feel of the Kodak DX6340 just screams quality.  And, indeed it is a quality product.  My old one had been dropped, wet, hot, cold, and exposed to very high RF fields and never complained.  My new one is operating in hot environments and very high RF fields without a problem.  The M550 crashes as soon as you turn it on!  The trusty old Kodak DX6340 just works.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of goofy \"features\" and garbage.  I just like stuff that works.  The Kodak DX6340 just works.  No \"drama\", no farting around.  Exactly what  wanted.","We bought our Kodak DX6340 in December 2003 after much research.  You never truly know the value until time has passed - and over 4 years have passed and I can tell you we still use it all the time and it is our only digital camera - we haven't purchased another camera since we bought it!  Reliable - solid - easy - all the things one wants in a point and shoot.  Never a problem with and doors or openings or anything.<br /><br />Be sure to get the rechargeable batteries and get an extra memory card and that's all you need!<br /><br />This is a great value camera!","I like this camera .

And, indeed it is a quality product.  My old one had been dropped, wet, hot, cold, and exposed to very high RF fields and never complained.  My new one is operating in hot environments and very high RF fields without a problem.  The M550 crashes as soon as you turn it on!  The trusty old Kodak DX6340 just works.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of goofy \"features\" and garbage.  I just like stuff that works.  The Kodak DX6340 just works.  No \"drama\", no farting around.  Exactly what  wanted.","We bought our Kodak DX6340 in December 2003 after much research.  You never truly know the value until time has passed - and over 4 years have passed and I can tell you we still use it all the time and it is our only digital camera - we haven't purchased another camera since we bought it!  Reliable - solid - easy - all the things one wants in a point and shoot.  Never a problem with and doors or openings or anything.<br /><br />Be sure to get the rechargeable batteries and get an extra memory card and that's all you need!<br /><br />This is a great value camera!","I had the same problem with the battery door for my DX6340. After looking around on the Internet it does appear that this is a design flaw. Kodak wants me to send my camera to Connecticut for repairs. But why would I want them to put on another door that will also eventually break? Instead I have Super glued the door back together and plan to reenforce it with a small piece of metal and some duct tape. It may not look good but I'm certain that it will hold the door together better than the original design.","This is my second Kodak Easy Share - my first one lasted about 3 years and had some kind of electronic meltdown.  Ah, it had served me well, and nothing electronic lasts forever.  I bought this one because I had liked the Kodak menuing, easy to use and intuitive.  This one was not a disappointment.  I've taken some absolutely gorgeous shots, especially in macro mode.<br /><br />Some people complained about the EasyShare software - I tried it out and thought it was just awful, so I deleted it and use another program for my photo management.  I'm reviewing the camera, not the free software the manufacturer includes in the box.","I've had this camera since 2002 and still love it. I found it to be extremely user friendly and it takes great pics. This is the fourth digital camera I have owned and the best so far. If you purchase the dock you can do a one touch transfer which saves the battery life. It also recharges the battery. If you purchase a lithium battery it lasts a really long time.<br /><br />The only problem I've had is the outdoor \"scenic\" night pictures could be a bit clearer. I was able to get decent ones by using the pas mode at 400 iso and stabilizing the camera with a large fixed object (I don't have a tripod). Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to take decent pics without a lot of fuss.","I've had this camera for 3 years and wouldn't trade it for anything. It takes excellent pictures, has every feature you could imagine, and the batteries last a very long time.  The best part is that this thing is virtually indestructable!  My camera has been dropped, thrown, banged around, submerged in water, and beaten up so bad over the years, yet it still performs like the day I bought it.","I've owned my camera for 3 years. Still works great. However, sometimes a few pictures can be blurry. Also one day I woke up and my screen was broken on the inside when it was stored and packed correctly. Though it did have a warranty and kodak fixed it for free. Now I have to buy a new battery door for it because the metal piece for electricity conduction fell off! That small piece is nearly $30! All in all, works great. Its been a member of the family. This camera doesn't have a double/triple flash like newer digital cameras that provide higher quality.","I dont know what ALL you people DO with your cameras! Battery Door falling off, doesnt take good night pics.... and so on. I have had this camera since 2004 (january) and have taken a TON of pics ever since. My battery door stays shut, has NEVER had a problem, I have NO problem loading the pics onto the computer either. its soooo easy! My lens shutter does stick once in a while, but VERY easy to fix. Doesnt do it very often. You want a good but Affordable camera, this is the one to get! This is my first one, and probably my last. If something ever DOES happen, I will spend the money to get another one. Kodak Easy Share Cameras Really ARE easy. I have take pics even in the dark of it snowing and they come out GREAT.","I've had this camera for two or three years now and its still working like new, except that the shutter sticks sometimes. I don't know how so many people say theirs has broken, I've dropped mine once or twice (it was my cats fault, actually) and its still fine. The battery door isn't a problem for me, I'm only on my second set of rechargeable batteries, and I take a lot of pictures. It does pretty good for close up stuff, flowers, bugs, that sort of thing, I don't use it too much for larger views but it does pretty good. I have a hard time capturing the exact colors that I'm seeing sometimes but mostly its good. I haven't been able to get any use out of it after the sun goes below the hill, even though it is still very light out it just doesn't do at all well. It also hasn't been too good with yellows for me, the white balance doesn't..balance. Overall, this is a great camera for beginners, or amateurs that aren't looking for something too complicated. I would recommend it, I've gotten a lot of great pictures from this camera.","I like the camera overall - you get good zoom, it is light enough (without either the fit-in-pocket feel or sticker shock of sub-compacts), its user interface is intuitive, its reviewing features are great, it offers the capability to take super short movies with sound if the muse strikes you. The controls are mostly automatic, which is good for a beginning digital camera enthusiast. There are several different modes of operation - I find the sports mode useful when taking pictures from a moving car.<br /><br />But here is the bad news - if you want to take night time pictures, this camera is terrible. I have missed out capturing some very camera-worthy moments at night when the photos have come out really bad. The trouble is the slightest shake ruins the night time picture.","I bought this camera May of 2003 and up until yesterday (Nov 7 2005) I have taken over 7,000 pictures with this camera!  What can I say, it's fantastic.  HOWEVER, last night somehow it went through a complete wash cycle at out local laundry mat and did not survive.  It turns on and everything works except the iris.<br /><br />Oh Well, SO - we just placed an order for another DX6340 instead of getting the newest model.<br /><br />To think if it wasn't distroyed from a washing machine it would STILL be taking pictures - Kodak cameras a great!","I've loved using this camera for about 1 1/2 years now.  It's so easy to use and I haven't experience any major set backs.  My two complaints:  1.  the battery compartment \"door\" isn't strong enough to hold the batteries and started cracking almost immediately.  It lasted for 1.5 years and has just completely broken in half.  I'm going to try to take it back to Target to see what they say.  2.  I find I have to edit just about every picture I take, mostly brightening and then adjusting the contrast.  I use another software program to do this since the Kodak software doesn't quite measure up in the editing department.  I use ofoto to share my prints with family and the software makes it easy to upload my photos to their site.  I've never had any problems with short battery life; I've changed the battery twice in 1.5 years of heavy use.  I only use the LCD display for quickly reviewing pictures.","I bought this particular camera, along with the printer dock, about  a month ago. It is my first digital camera purchase. We are on a tight budget and only allowed ourselves a small amount, considering the price of digital cameras with 3+ MP and any kind of optical zoom. I found this one, new, at a great deal that couldn't be passed up, and after reading some very positive reviews, I grabbed it! And I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />The camera is extremely user friendly. It's really hard to make a mistake or take bad pictures. The manual and software are very simple to use. The manual explains things in short steps so you can remember how to put each feature to use. No wondering if you're doing it right. And the software is pretty much self explainatory. I love that I only have to push one button to download my pictures. Pictures themselves are gorgeous and colors come through so clearly! I think the video quality is great considering it's coming from a little digital camera. And I'm very glad I went with a camera with audio. I have 2 very active subjects (my 2 young daughters) and I have loved sharing pictures and video with family (including 1 grandmother) out of state. We were actually suprised at how many pictures we could take with only the 16 MB of internal memory. We did buy a memory card, but it's nice to know we have a good bit of extra if needed. And we have yet to run low on battery life because we use the printer dock to recharge. We use the LCD screen often, and still, the battery life has been good.<br /><br />The printer dock itself makes impressive prints. I was really worried about poor quality, but I haven't been disappointed with it yet. It's small and doesn't take up a lot of space. Very portable if we needed it to be. And, again, a very user friendly machine.<br /><br />I am so very glad we found and purchased this camera. It's a great starter and I'm extremely pleased with it so far.","I bought this camera for my wife last Christmas.  She'd been wanting a digital camera but had no desire to get one if it meant ever touching the computer.  This camera combined with the printer dock was perfect for her.  She basically uses it like a fancy point-and-shoot, then prints out pictures as she goes.  I haven't even had to upgrade her memory card since she just deletes the pics when her card gets full.  Better quality pictures may be available with other cameras but nothing beats the ease of use for her.","I HAVE HAD THE DX6340 FOR ABOUT A YEAR.I LOVE IT. PICTURES ARE AS GOOD AS 35M. EASY TO USE.UNLIKE SOME OTHERS I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE CAMERA DOOR OR SOFT WEAR OR BATTERIES.SOME PEOPLE HAVE LEAD FINGERS. IT IS A CAMERA NOT A BOWLING BALL. I USE RECHARGEABL BATTERIES AND GET 200 PICTURES PER CHARGE. YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO USE THE SOFTWEAR AS WITH ANY PROGRAM.MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE AMAZED AT THE PICTURES. THE 4X OPTICAL ZOOM WORKS GREAT. ONLY CAMERAS COSTING A LOT MORE WILL HAVE THIS.I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO BUYING ANOTHER KODAK DIGITAL CAMERA.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK KODAK.","Great camera, merely OK software. Easy to use and pictures are fantastic (and that's what important after all) but a couple things make it less than perfect.<br /><br />I like the fact I can use standard AA batteries but am disappointed that the camera in cradle will not recharge standard NiMH cells, only the Kodak custom NiMH battery pack.<br /><br />I like the fact I could buy additional telephoto and wide angle lenses (on top of the built in 4x optical zoom) but am very displeased the wide angle lens blocks the flash, making the additional lenses compatible with natural light only. This is probably my biggest gripe, but hey - most other cameras do not even offer the additional lenses. Still, Kodak should warn you about this in their product information.<br /><br />The software lacks a panorama stitching capability, and it can't output my photo album to HTML pages and linked images to upload to my ISP's web site. It can send to Kodak's Ofoto service, however. Thumbnailer (shareware) fills the gap of generating HTML indexes and pages for me. The HP software that accompanies HP cameras and scanners is stronger (tho I did not like the HP camera as much).<br /><br />Here's what says it all - would I buy another Kodak? Yep.","I got one of these beauties for work recently and loved the picture quality. I initially also was frustrated that I couldn't seem to \"drag and drop\" the pictures anywhere outside the Kodak software album and I also could not copy and paste. It seemed I would have to e-mail the pictures to myself in order to capture them. (I don't have a CD burner) BUT...I soon found that the pictures do save on my computer simultaneously. I found them in my C drive in a folder (can you tell I'm not an IT person?) that all computers seem to have called \"my documents.\" Inside that was \"my pictures\" and inside that was a Kodak folder and all the pictures I had saved from my camera. At that point they were mine to do with whatever I wanted. As soon as I saw that I was not locked into Kodak until eternity, I unequivocally loved the camera. Now I am looking into buying one for home use.","The zoom button fell off after a couple of weeks - trying to find replacement or warranty (hoho! It's refurbished after all). Great pictures and easy to use - Love the onboard speaker for playback of mpg movies.","This is the first digital camera my husband and I have used and it's super easy and takes wonderful pictures.  I did quite a lot of research before we purchased it and agree with all of the good reviews it got - also agree that the battery door is flimsy - you have to be careful with that.<br />We were taking pictures and downloading them within 30 minutes of opening the box!","I've fought getting a digital for years...I'm a scrapbooker who loves her Cannon Rebel 35mm.  Anyway, the 35mm tends to be too bulky to put into your pocket on those little trips.  My husband who is a \"techie\" thought I was insane to by a 3.1 when there are affordable 4.0-5.0's on the market.  There'll always be cameras better and faster as long as technology progresses, but the prices will also reflect those progresses.  Anyway, I took the plunge in April '04 and haven't regretted it.  If you're looking for decent 4x6 pics, you won't be disappointed, especially for the price.  This camera is extremely easy to use.  I like the 4x zoom feature this camera offers.  I couldn't find it at this price-point on any others.  The only thing I see that they could improve on is the quality of the video when reviewing on my tv, therefore I deduct a star.  (I've not tried it on my computer yet; the quality may be okay on it.) As far as battery life goes, I don't use my LCD screen but to review or record video with, and I've gone through about 300 pics without having to change my battery.  If the other reviewers are having problems with batteries it sounds like they need to get the company they bought the camera from to give them a replacement, or they need to look through the viewfinder instead of the LCD screen . (There is an option on the camera to switch the LCD screen off.) I haven't purchased the docking station.  I take my card to Wal-mart and use their machine to download, pick the # of prints and sizes, and they print them in an hour, .01 cent cheaper than traditional prints, thank you very much. (I don't waste my ink and I'm not out any paper if my printer jams.) Also, a cord is included that I plug right into my tv to have a slide show.<br />Overall this is an easy to use nice little camera for around $200 bucks.","This camera was highly rated by Consumer Reports, and that rating is well deserved.  The camera is light weight and is easy to use. The quality of the pictures is terrific.  The software makes it easy to set up albums, email photos, etc.<br />I considered buying the dock to simplify downloading of pictures, but found that it's very easy to do that without the dock.  I just leave the cable attached to my USB port and connect it to the camera whenever I'm ready to download.<br />Since I live in Upstate NY, I'm also happy to support a local company working to rebuild its reputation and financial strength by selling such a well made product.","I have had the dx 6340 camera and the dock 6000 for about 6months now.<br />I have had a few problems already:<br />1. The plastic cap that covers the lens sometimes does not open completely sometimes.<br />2. Rechargeable battery does not last long (with the 6000 dock) when using liveview (live lcd preview of picture being taken). I think this could be a firmware bug as a low battery indicator comes up when I use liveview even on fully charged battery.<br />3. Pictures in sunny day outside are not that sharp even when I use flash to take out shadows.<br />4. Night shots are blurred and require tripod to stabilize images.<br />5. Orbs (oval lighted spots) show up in pictures sometimes when using flash though it has been suggested that it is due to dust floating around the camera.","Sleek design, cool colors, different photo capture modes, video/sound capture, date imprint etc. This just encompasses all the features I need.<br />One glitch is that battery compartment cover is little too delicate for the CRV battery that comes with the camera.<br />I would strongly recommend this camera over fuji or sony","Just got mine at a great price form Amazon. I'd read all the reviews, most of which were excellent, but be assured that this is a super camera with all the bells and whistles you'd ever want. There was some concern in other reviews about software but I have experienced no problems and the camera and dock are communicating fine with my PC (450Mz 98se). The photos are fab and the video clips are great fun. I use Irfanview to resize, etc., and all is well. Fantastic product.. if you're in 2 minds just buy it! The battery cover is a bit weak but that's the only gripe so far. Go get yours!","I went to a store in mount laurel nj and it was on sale for $178.98 , but you are selling it for $249.99 why if on line it is cheaper?","I haven't used this camera much yet but the image quality is quite good and I have yet to get a bad result. I've noticed the pictures come out fairly dark, but I need to mess with the settings a bit before I make any judgements on that.<br />As far as software problems and problems with XP that I've heard people talk about, I've never experienced them. For one I don't use the software that came with it and second I have no issues getting it set up in XP. just plug it in and it sets up fine with no external help. XP does it all in a few minutes. As for transfering files, I just go to My Computer and to the camera listing and I can copy and paste just like any other folder. Either that or plug the SD card into the port on my Epson R300. The software is totally unnecessary.","After a month of research and reading a lot of customer reviews, I narrowed my choices to Nikon Coolpix 3100, Fujifilm A210, Canon A70, and the Kodak DX6340.  I ruled out the fujifilm A210 because of it's limited features, and the fact that it requires Fuji xD memory cards...xD cards are expensive, and are not as common as compact flash or secure digital cards!  The Nikon 3100 had plenty of features, however it was too small for my hands and lightweight.  I felt I hard to curl my fingers to avoid covering the lens hence I could not get a comfortable grip on the camera.  The Nikon is made of 100% plastic and I wasn't about to spend $245 on a toy-like camera!<br />The choice was tough between this kodak camera and the Canon A70, but I finally decided on the kodak.  Both cameras have similar features, both take and process shots at similar speed.  The Canon has an AF assist lamp, the Kodak has a similar low-light AF mechanism.  Unlike the canon A70, the kodak DX6340 does not include a memory card, however, it's 16MB internal memory allows you to practice and familiarize yourself with the camera right out of the box.  Both cameras have a solid, heavy feel to them and are made of metal and plastic.<br />In comparing pictures taken with both the canon A70 and the kodak DX6340, the kodak produced sharper images, and the color in the kodak prints was right-on!  Indoor shots with the kodak are great!  The sport mode on the kodak Dx6340 does a good job in capturing objects in motion without any blurriness.  The kodak also has an image orientation sensor that's really cool!  The Easy Share software that comes with the DX6340 is easy to use, and the pictures transfer quickly with no problems to the computer.  By default, the software runs automatically when starting windows which can slow down start up, but you can turn this feature off through Windows.<br />I would recommend a larger capacity memory card, and rechargable batteries with this camera.<br />Some things to keep in mind when shopping for a digital camera:<br />1.) Size matters!  Those small, lightweight, mint box cameras are nice, but if you have shaky hands be prepared for blurry images!<br />2.) If you plan on printing pictures at home, make sure your printer supports a higher resolution...you can spend $1,000 on a camera, but it won't do you much good if you'll be printing low res images.<br />3.) Don't fall into the 'Mega Pixel Trap.'  I have enlarged my pictures up to 11\" x 14\" and still get high quality print outs with this camera!<br />You can't go wrong with the kodak DX6340!  Easy to use, great pictures both indoors and outdoors, and user-friendly software.","I previously had an Epson 850Z digital camera, but was constantly missing those key photo moments on our 2 yr old daugter.  I read the reviews and narrowed my selection to this Kodak and the Canon 300.  I tested them at Best Buy and found this camera to be quicker--quicker from the time you pressed the buttom till the photo snapped--key with a 2 yr old that won't sit still.  I have been 100% satisfied with this camera in all settings and environments.  The movie function is a nice addition, thought beware, the file size gets large quickly.  Highly recommend this camera for both beginners and intermediate users--can't beat the features for the price.  I've had the camera for 3 months now and don't regret my decision one bit.  Great camera.","What an incredible camera this is.  My first digicam was a 1.2mp Olympus, which i loved and still use sometimes.  Then last summer i \"upgraded\" to a nikon coolpix 3100.  I hated that camera.  Took great outdoor shots, but my indoor ones were dark and blue-tinted.  I just bought this Kodak yesterday as a replacement..and i am amazed.  I have a kodak film camera that takes the most incredible pictures, and so i was looking to kodak for the digital camera in the hopes that it would have the same vivid colors of my film camera, and it most certainly does.<br />What I love about this camera:<br />SOOOO easy to use! The menu items have descriptions so you immediately know what is what without looking it up.<br />The joystick is an incredible tool<br />The dial is tough to turn, but that's a plus because it won't be turning on accidentally in your bag, which was a problem with my previous cameras.<br />The EasyShare software is awesome, and so versatile and easy to use.<br />the picture quality!  true color, vivid, crisp. Plus, the write speed is really minimal so you can take pictures quickly one after the other.<br />I think the software is my favorite thing about this camera.  You can email pictures straight from the software, and send copies to yourself...you can edit the pictures quickly and easily, and the images are the size of the screen so you dont' have to zoom in to get a good look.<br />My indoor pictures were initially dark, but I've been playing around with the flash and some of the manual options, and it's been taking great pictures.  Quick fix; i set the flash to \"fill flash\" and even though the flash was still going off with the \"auto\" setting, the fill flash pictures were ten times brighter and more true color.<br />The shutter speed is great.  That was my second biggest gripe about the nikon; i have a baby and a toddler, and capturing the moment was impossible with the Nikon.  The best buy rep said it would be a little slower with the Kodak, but i have not found that to be the case at all; I've yet to lose a smile and i've taken more than fifty pictures in the last 24 hours.<br />Also, the zoom is very effective on this camera, whereas on others i've tried, you don't really see a difference and if you do it's usually sacrificing quality.<br />I only gave the camera four stars because i agree that you should always leave some room for improvement.  In the case of the DX6340, it's heavy!  Heavier than my Nikon, at least.  Also, you really need two hands to turn it on.  That was one nice thing about both my Olympus and my Nikon; onehanded turn-on.  But really it's a small thing, and at least this way it's not turning on accidentally and wasting battery power.<br />I would really recommend this camera to anyone, novice or not.  I thought i'd be \"offended\" by the ease of the software, but it's so great.  Most of the time, you pay for features that you'll probably never use.  This is such an efficient little package.  There are a few extras that you will definitely toy with, and the software is useful without being overwhelming.  Everything you need is very easy to find, and the picture quality and shutter speed are amazing.  Also, I like that it has internal memory so you don't even need a card if you're just going to take a few pictures at a time.","I really like the 4x optical zoom compared to my old 1.5 zoom camera which was a Kodak also.  It is one of the smaller sized camera with some weight, but I like the weight.  I like the fact that you do not have to worry about a lens cap and that it is built right into the lens.  The dail feature is a little annoying, but normally you just would click once clock wise or counter clock wise.<br />Pictures come out great and so do the movies.  I have no complaints yet.  I hope it last long.<br />Good Luck","This Kodak Digital Camera is Awesome !  The only problem with this camera is that it can't take a bad picture.  Do you remember Glamour Shots in the mall?  They could take a picture of a plain jane and make her look like a million dollar princess -- this camera does the same thing !  I swear I took a picture of a pile of trash and after Kodak adds it's little Color Science - it was the most prettiest trash pile I've seen in my life !<br />This camera just ads a little sunshine to every picture through it's Color Science technology - no other camera on the market has that.  I bought a 2nd Digital Camera .. a Pentax Optio S and returned it back to the store because the pictures didn't even compare to Kodak's.<br />I don't think I will ever find a Digital Camera that can take pictures like the Kodak. Oh and one more thing, this camera is smart enough to automatically adjust itself to achieve perfect lighting, balance, etc.<br />Why somebody would want to \"fiddle\" with settings is beyond me.  By the time you did all that wouldn't you miss your Kodak moment?  Good Luck with your purchase - but you won't go wrong if you pick this one.","The Kodak DX6340 is a winner! Here's the story.  Went out to find a replacement digital camera for an older Pentax SLR and Nikon point and shoot that the whole family could use.  Well after seraching high and low and just about every website, I came down to the fact that: 3.1MP is about enough for anyone to make good big pictures; 3x optical zoom is a bare minimum; video and audio are nice features; but most imporatantly if the family is going to use this camera, then it's got to be intuitive and stay under $300.  The choice basically boiled down to the Canon A70 and this Kodak.  Well the Kodak won! It's less expensive by $30 and it's a camera that even complete neophytes can use right out of the box. The Kodak uses real english language and not just miniscule, almost indescernable, icons to get to various functions.  The down side, although only as small as the Canon icons, is that the Kodak does not do VGA movies nor does it allow for attaching a voice file to a picture.  The Canon to it's credit does have a bit more manual controls (if you can remember what those tiny, indescernable icons actually mean). By the time you figure it out - you miss the shot.  The Kodak, to it's credit, is built well and has a nice convienent size.  It also has a nice size display, continuous movie mode with sound, intuitive controls, and EXCELLENT 4X optical zoom which just about blows away anything in the 3MP and less than $300 price group. So... if you want a digital camera that is really very and I mean VERY good, go for the Kodak.  BTW, the printer dock works well (a bit slow) and limited in terms of the size of the prints it makes but for prints that it can do, it's good. You certainly don't need it if you have a good computer/printer.  The printer dock is fun to use and watch just like Polaroid prints used to be fun to watch develop.  Also, the software used by Kodak is very easy to use.  Bottom line - this Kodak camera is a winner!","I received this camera as a graduation present and have been completely pleased with it! It has a multitude of features and setting options, and yet it is incredibly easy to use. I was able to figure most of the camera operation out on my own, but also found the instruction manual very explicit and easy to understand on the few occasions where I needed to reference it. Special picture settings allow you to take motion, portrait, nighttime, landscape, and closeup shots.<br />The picture quality is WONDERFUL! One of the first places I used this camera was at the zoo, and I came away with some of the best animal pictures I have ever taken - you could literally count the hairs and feather fibers, the images were so clear! It even takes great pictures through glass. I have also been extremely pleased with the closeup setting. One of my hobbies is re-painting tiny horse figurines, approximately three inches in height, and this camera allows me to take very nice, clear closeups of my work. There are also several flash settings, that allow you to turn the flash on and off, use red-eye correction, etc. One feature that came as a pleasant surprise to me was the video function. This camera allows you to take short video clips, WITH sound!<br />I would highly suggest that anyone purchasing this camera also buy an additional memory card with 128 MB (or higher) storage capacity. This will allow you to store well over 100 pictures at a time.<br />The only disappointment I found with this camera was that the software would not install properly on my computer. However, that may be a problem with the computer itself, as mine is more than a little temperamental. I was easily able to circumvent this problem, as Windows XP has a built in function for downloading data from digital cameras, so I just use this method instead. I would HIGHLY recommend this model to anyone looking for a quality digital camera!","We have had very good luck using Energizer AA Lithium and Energizer rechargeables in our camera.  Friends also found these batteries to work very well.","This camera exceeded my expectations in relation to ease of use. The joystick is a great idea and works well. The display looks great and the interface easy to move around in. Zooming is a breeze with this camera and it is the smallest available with a 4x zoom. It has no problems reading/writing my SD cards from Sandisk, a 32 MB and a 256 MB. My NiMH AA rechargables work great with it. Just be sure to turn off the LCD to save your batteries.<br />One thing I disliked was the software. On my WindowsXP and Windows2k computers it would not recognize the camera. So I just used my memory card reader which I would prefer anyway.<br />I only gave this a 4 because it doesn't quite match the detail that a 35 mm would give you. Digital has come far but still needs to become cheaper in relation to a 35 mm camera. At the time I ordered, Amazon shipped it for free :-)  Arrived on time and in perfect shape.<br />I definitely recommend this camera. I hope they make a smaller version as a previous reviewer suggested.","Here are my observations with this camera after using it for over 4 months now.<br />1)  It is easy to use. Almost anyone could use this camera instinctively.<br />2)  The pictures it takes are sharp enough but don't expect to get Hasselblad clarity and depth with this camera. Like most digital cameras, you will enjoy the point and shoot convenience that filmless photography offers. Remember, if you don't like a photo just delete it and take another shot if you want to.<br />3)  The DX6340 will suck the life out of ordinary Duracells or Energizers after about 6 shots (with flash). Maybe Kodak can design an high capacity external battery pack which can be slung on one's shoulder and wired to the camera with a simple cable. This battery pack would then make this a good choice to carry for weddings or parties (or other photo-demanding occasions) where one can take 60 to 80 pictures without losing battery juice.<br />4)  If Kodak decides to redesign this camera as a smaller unit, that would be good, too!<br />Overall, you can't go wrong buying this digital tool. Good work, Kodak!","I got this camera as a gift. It takes pictures with very rich colors and sharpness if you do the focus right. I am not happy with the night time shots but some have said they will come out good if a tripod is used or the camera remains steady for sometime after taking pictures. Also the well known issue is the battery case cover which is flimsy.<br />I purchased a 256 mb card to store the pictures. Also am pleased with the video mode which comes out fine.<br />All in all a good camera for a first time digital camera buyer.","This was my very first purchase of a digital camera. After weeks of driving to store after store, checking out several digital cameras, Kodak was my first and last choice. The software is easy to load and with the docking station and printer dock I was in business quickly. Our older daughter came home for Thanksgiving which gave the camera its first test. Easy, easy, easy (share) is the only words that come to mind. We then took off to Savannah, GA for a week visiting her and took over 150 pictures storing them onto the 256 MB card I bought. We also used the video option numerous times. The pictures, videos and memories will last a lifetime. Amazon is the best place to buy this camera as I bought it on-line on Saturday and it arrived on Wednesday using the \"free shipping\" option. (I did buy another desktop printer for the 5 x 7 and 8 x 10 pictures).<br />I highly recommend this camera and love Amazon. com.","I have owned this camera for 6 months now and am quite pleased with it. It is extremely easy to use and you can purchase a 17X close up lens, 2x telephoto, and a wide angle lens. I do a lot of close-up work so the close up lens works great. You can find links to the lenses at Kodak.com.","I did a lot of research on cameras and spent a large amount of time at Best Buy and Circuit City looking at this model up close and personal.<br />I have to say that this camera is fantastic!  It works well in a variety of light settings and is easy to switch from one setting to another by a simple turn of a knob.  I've uploaded all my photos to ofoto.com and have loved the resulsts so much that I've ordered well over 75 pritns including some blown up to 11 x 17, WITH NO PIXELATION!  My wife can't believe the framed work was taken with a digital camera.<br />They also print out great on my printer and I only have an hp 880c to work with on a day to day basis.  You don't even need to go through the camera manual to be up and running with this little jewel.  I started right out of the box and have been working with it ever since for all types of shots.<br />I have no problem with the software and the pictures can be downloaded with ofoto.com free software as well.  In fact I use that more so than the Kodak software included.<br />So far, the battery life of the camera is excellent! I use flash and no flash with the screen on quite a bit, and I did ivest in some newere NiMh batteries from kodak.  They hold a large charge and work well with this camera.  I invested in a 128MB memory card for this camera for only $40.00 bucks from Circuit City.  It's well worth it and much better than the any of the smaller cards.<br />I did not buy the Dock due to the ease of downloading with the card reader that came with the 128 mg card.<br />To sum things up, I realy like its ease, and clarity of detail in my pictures.  Also, it bounced off the concrete from three feet when I tried to catch my 13 month old son, completely forgeting about my camera.  It is still working fine with only a few minor scratches.<br />Enjoy!","My daughter wanted a digital camera for Christmas.  She has been using inexpensive film cameras for years.  A senior in high school, she is still prone to breaking the camera's battery compartment door after about six months of use a camera and I have to buy her another film camera.  The Kodak DX series cameras all have the same type of flimsy battery compartment door.  The USB cable to hook the camera to the computer is very tiny and delicate.  If you are not gentle with the connector, you could cause damage, rendering the Kodak camera useless.  I bought the $280.00 Kodak DX-6340 digital camera for her to use.  Since the digital camera is so expensive, I don't want to replace it in six months due to a broken USB connector or a battery compartment door.  The Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock 6000 solves both of these problems.  There are already a lot of good comments regarding the DX6340 in this forum.  I won't repeat what everyone already said.  I would say that the best thing about the Kodak DX6340 is its ease of use, but the Kodak Camera Dock 6000 makes the Kodak DX6340 a great camera.  It is true you have to buy special rechargeable NIMH batteries to use the Camera Dock 6000.  Generic AA sized rechargeable NIMH batteries with a generic battery charger costs less than the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock 6000, but AA sized rechargeable NIMH batteries cannot be charge inside the DX6340 camera, therefore you would lose the ease of use with that option.  There is a brand of NIMH rechargeable battery pack made for the Kodak camera made by DigiPower available for $15.00 (quite reasonable, when you compare that to the cost of proprietary batteries for cell phones and other digital cameras) from Circuit City and other fine photo retailers.  Since the Camera Dock 6000 conveniently recharges the battery pack in 3 to 4 hours every time the camera sits in the dock, you never have to open the battery compartment; it would be like charging a cell phone battery.  The battery pack should last one or two years before you need to replace the battery.  If you want to transfer your picture to the computer, you never have to open another compartment door and connect up a flimsy USB cable to the camera.  You connect the same USB cable to the Camera Dock 6000 permanently and forget it.  If you want your camera to last a few years, this camera dock goes a long way to extending the life and reliability of any DX series camera.  I bought the Kodak Printer Dock 6000 with the DX6340 initially and returned it un-opened after I found the cost of printing at the local Sam's Club a lot cheaper.  The Printer Dock 6000 provides the same convenience and provides printing capability at a very steep price.  The paper/ink cartridge refill kit costs $25.00 each time and comes with only 40 sheets of single size 4x6 photo paper with exactly enough ink to print 40 photos.  That works out to be a costly 63 cents per print.  I could get Sam's Club 1 Hour Photo department to print the digital prints for 17 cents a print.  Even the local drug store can provide digital prints for half that cost of the Kodak refill kit.  So I decided that the Kodak printer supplies are too expensive.  The Kodak Camera Dock 6000 on the other hand allows me the same convenience at home to print through a generic photo printer made by Epson, Canon, HP and others at a lower cost using my home computer.  However, I'm very lazy when it comes to photo printing and at 17 cents a print from Sam's Club 1 Hour Photo, I don't have to even do the work.  Just spend five minutes to put the pictures on a CD and take it over to Sam's Club 1 Hour Photo department.  If I want any size other than the single 4x6 size, Sam's Club 1 Hour Photo can do it.  Not possible with the Kodak Printer Dock 6000.  So, I say the Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock 6000 is definitely a must have option.  $80.00 is not a lot to pay for the Camera Dock 6000 to get this level of convenience for the DX series cameras, especially when it makes using the DX6340 similar in ease to using a cell phone.  Isn't convenience, the reason for all the cell phones in use today?","This camera is so easy to use. Takes great pictures. I didnt give it 5 stars because I believe there is always room for improvment on everything. Kodak provides great customer service for those who can't properly read instructions (like me) and they dont make you feel like a dummy. We compared the pictures from the DX6340 to the Sony mavica(pictures had alot of yellow) and although close Kodak won (true in colors). Kodak DX6340 has so many great features and the software is easy to use. I highly recommend the Kodak Dx6340.","I got this camera for Christmas, and I am very pleased!  At first I didn't think 3.1 MP would be enough, but I printed a few pictures and was amazed at the film-like quality.  The different modes, such as portrait, landscape, and close-up, allow for versitility.  This camera is extremely easy to use, and I still haven't had to read the manual.  Another feature I like is that you can turn the LCD screen on by pushing a button, so it's not on all the time to kill the battery (though that is an option).  The video is also impressive; not video-camera quality, but then again it's incredible for a camera!  I used it for 4 hours and the battery is still going strong, but I plan on buying a rechargable battery since only a regular one is included.  I would definitely encourage you to purchase this digital camera!","I have to say that I love this camera. It has the easiest and most intuitive controls of any digital I've used. The image quality is very good in all modes and with all quality settings (there are four of them), with the auto mode usually doing a great job for normal point-and-shoot stuff. The PAS mode gives you more or less manual controls -- nothing like what you'll find on a real SLR, but very handy nonetheless. If there's one problem with the picture quality, it's that the auto mode tends to darken the foreground or subject ground of a picture based on small amounts of backlight -- the flash against a white wall alone is enough to skew the brightness. Overall, though, it's a rather minor complaint for a camera that works so well -- two seconds in Photoshop or any other editing program will correct any problems.<br />As I said before, the controls are extremely easy. Anyone can use this camera within minutes of picking it up, even the uninitiated or technologically disinclined. It's too bad that this ease and simplicity of use didn't extend to the software, however. Don't get me wrong -- it's certainly easy to use. The problem is that it turns your computer into a Kodak digicam station. I had to remove three Kodak entries from my startup menu, and the next time I rebooted my computer, I still got a Flash tutorial for the software. It would have been very useful if I had been expecting it. Needless to say, the software isn't exactly my sort of thing, though it does make it very quick and easy to transfer and share pictures from your camera.<br />Overall, the DX6340 is a great piece of work. Its high point is its ease of use -- it really cannot be overstated how smooth this camera is to use. Once I get my 256 MB memory card, I'll be in heaven -- imagine, 263 \"Best\" quality photos or 23 minutes of video, with sound. Oh, I didn't mention it had a full video mode? Great stuff.","I had researched digital cameras for a year now through the internet,stores,and friends. I finally read about this Kodak camera on the Target website. Christmas was nearing and I wanted to get one for the holidays. I finally bought this camera and was very surprised when I also received a free DVD player. Even if the free gift offer isn't still in effect this camera is worth every penny. Very easy to use out of the box. I am very pleased with the picture quality and the software makes emailing the pictures to loved ones very simple. I plan on checking out the printer dock for this camera. If you are a beginner and want a easy fun camera this is the one for you!","Having to click past SIX modes to FINALLY reach the manual (PAS) mode really sucks.<br />Why don't they use USB 2 instead of the extremely slow USB 1 mode to upload the pictures??<br />Almost every time we go to use the camera in the automatic mode the flash activates!! I wish there was a way to shut the flash off and have it stay off (even when you turn the camera off and back on) until you want to use it.<br />The digital zoom mode is really pathetic as far as photo quality goes. Our Sony Mavica FD-85 (1.2 MP)(2 years old and outdated) takes much cleaner and clearer pictures using the digital zoom.<br />Battery life sucks - We like to keep \"Live view\" and \"Quick View\" turned \"on\" but this will empty the batteries in less than 50 pictures. Sure we could buy the \"optional\" L Ion re-chargable batteries but the above mentioned Sony came with them at no extra cost.<br />We plan on returning ours to the Mart of Walls for a refund and purchase a Minolta Dimage Z1 instead.","My BF had this camera on a trip and it worked awesome, so awesome i had to buy it for myself!!!! This is an awesome camera!!!!!!!!!!! :)","I think this camera is great. I had never used a digital camera before and found this camera exactly what I needed to get started. It is very easy to use and takes great pictures. I just ordered the printer dock 6000 and can't wait to start using that. I've previously uploaded and had pictures developed from Target, but wanted the convience of developing pictures of my newborn baby instantly. This is a great camera and I highly recommend it for even the new user like myself.","Excellent camera that takes amazing photos. It's easy to use. I also purchased the printer dock which is great if you want to print 4 x 6 pictures without having to use your printer. Be careful with the memory card. I originally bought the Viking memory card and it didn't work. Stick with Kodak brand. I'm not sure about the Simple Tech memory cards.","I never thought I would ever part with my SLR camera outfit, but I am hooked on digital photography already.<br />I enjoy the crisp and bright digital images on my computer the same day I take them.  Having family in another state, this camera allows me to e-mail pictures and share the moments.<br />I use a 256 MB scan disk, so I can take pictures without abandon and just delete what I don't like.  Love to be able to view what I've taken immediately on the screen.  The scan disk is also compatible with my MP3 player and my palm pilot, which makes this convenient to share between all my toys.<br />Shutter is not as fast as I had hoped and I would probably revert back to my SLR for more control on fast action photos.<br />Alkaline batteries don't cut it!  The camera shows a low battery almost immediately upon putting in new ones.  I now have the printer dock with the built in charger, which works well for me.<br />My family enjoys the TV plug-in feature that allows me to show the pictures right on the TV like a slide show.<br />The EasyShare printer dock allows you to print 4X6's at home.  I purchased this accessory very quickly after getting the camera.  This is a fun accessory for the standard \"snap shots.\"  I took the dock to my parents house and printed pictures that I had just taken.  It reminded them of the old polaroid convenience and the pictures are waterproof, so sticky kids' hands are no problem.  See my review on the print dock.<br />I wasn't interested in capturing movies initially, but have now tried a few short film shots.  It too is fun for quick captures when just a photo won't do.  It captures sound well!  Movies will have to be just a minute or two and you would definitely need an extra scandisk for more room.  These \"movies\" can also be e-mailed in a quicktime format.<br />I only give 4 stars as sometimes I feel I am waiting for the camera to catch up with me, but this is a minimal trade off for the fun I am having.","When I first started using this camera, it was wonderful, however, after about two weeks of use, the lens failed to retract, renduring the camera nonfunctional. I called Kodak Customer Service, was treated horribly, and they told me that the problem was the battery, that I needed to recharge it, which I had just got finished doing. Needless to say, I must return the camera now, losing with it, the pictures that I had stored on the internal memory. This is a great camera if you don't happen to get a defective one.","This camera has some really nice features.  Takes great pictures and is relatively easy to use.  Have had some serious problems, though.. I recorded a clip using the internal memory.  Instead of stopping it while it was recording, I let it go until it ran out of memory.  When I tried to transfer the video clip, the camera read \"No images to transfer\" and would not acknowledge the video I had recorded.  Before customer service figured out the problem, they insisted the problem was with the Easyshare software that comes with the camera that was not allowing me to download the video clip so... they had me configure and reconfigure my computer, install and uninstall programs.  Finally, they determined that the problem was not with the software or the computer.  Turns out that not stopping the camera before it ran out of memory \"corrupted the file\", (as per customer service) and ultimately I had to erase the recording without transferring it to my computer.<br />Then, I bought a SD memory card.  After about 25 pictures, the camera began to freeze up.  I couldn't even turn it off, I had to take the battery out.  According to customer service, when my battery runs low, the pictures I take become \"corrupted.\"  They are sending me a reconditioned rechargeable battery to try.  I'm considering returning this to the store and getting another one.  Maybe its just that the one I got is defective.","I compared this camera to a Canon A70, and though I liked the physical design of the Canon more, the Kodak had the better image quality.  I think this is due to the 4x optical zoom Schneider lens.  Supposedly, Schneider is one of the best lens makers in the world.  The features are pretty nice too, and the camera is easy to use.  I didn't give it the full five stars because it is still only 3MP (but it's a very good 3MP camera), and because it does not feel as good in your hands as some other cameras.  It's also not that small, which may or may not be important to you.  But if you are looking for good images for under $300, this is probably one of your best choices.","My husband and I have been heckled by our respective families for not supplying nearly enough photos of our 2-year-old daughter.  We're actually pretty good about taking pictures of her.  It's taking the film to the store to get it developed that we have a problem with.  For example, we still have somewhere around the house a roll of film from our honeymoon 5-1/2 years ago that still hasn't been developed.  So for us the convenience of a digital camera was a must.  We put off purchasing a digital camera for a long time, waiting for the price to come down and the features to improve.  When we discovered this little beauty and its companion, the printer dock, we knew we had our latest purchase in sight.  The quality of the photos that this camera takes is more than sufficient for our purposes, and the convenience of being able to use the supplementary printer dock and instantly print photos from the camera is wonderful.<br />The first main event we used this camera for was our daughter's second birthday a few months back.  We took pictures of the celebrations at the restaurant, and of the cake and the present opening at our house.  Then, after we put our daughter to bed for the night, we hooked the camera and printer dock to the TV with the included wires, and did a high-tech slide show for my parents.  As they chose the photos they wanted, we selected them, and then printed them right off.<br />Even without the printer dock this is an excellent camera.  I have a Mac, so my computer instructions may be different than those for PC users, but I just hook the camera up to the computer with the included USB cable, and iPhoto automatically loads up.  For PC users, as well as for Mac users without iPhoto, the 6340 comes with a CD with EasyShare software.  Hook the camera up to the computer, and the EasyShare software automatically loads.  Then import the photos, view and/or edit them, and then save them, email them, or print them on a computer printer using either standard or photo paper.<br />Also, in this price range, the 3.1 megapixels that the EasyShare is capable of is  great as well.  Most of the other cameras I looked at in this price range either did not have such a high megapixel capability, or did not have as many features.  And at the time that we bought this camera there were no other cameras on the market that had such a well-integrated printing system like the EasyShare printer dock.  Perhaps that situation has changed in the past few months, but I haven't shopped around lately.<br />Another feature that I like about the EasyShare is the fact that you can choose different resolutions, affecting how many photos can be stored on the memory card at one time.  On the highest resolution, a 256MB card (not included) would store around 256 photos; on the lowest, it will store upwards of 700 photos.  This is great for day-to-day photos, or vacation photos where you don't want to cart around (and risk losing because they're so dang tiny) several memory cards.<br />Also, this camera has a video mode.  Although many other still digital cameras include a video mode, this is the only one in this price range that includes a microphone, so you can record sound as well as motion.  This is especially helpful during those moments (as we often have with our two-year-old) when there is a fleeting moment to capture and a regular digital camera is far easier to operate than a DV camcorder.  Then simply plug in the camera to the computer, and (on a Mac) iMovie loads up and imports the film.  Emailing the video as an mpeg file is as simple as emailing a still photo.<br />About the only gripe I have with this camera is the high price of the memory cards.  Of course, once the photos have been stored in our computer, we can erase the contents of the memory card, but I'd like to be able to export the photos from iPhoto back to the camera and I haven't quite figured out how to do that.  Since our computer's printer doesn't seem to have photo-printing capabilities, I don't want to delete the memory cards' contents until I have either figured out this issue or printed off the photos I really wanted to print.<br />But all in all, this is a wonderful camera for the price, and would still be a value at an even higher price.  Kudos to Kodak for offering such a well-loaded camera at a fair price.","I have been eyeing digital cameras for at least one year.  Two things drew me to the Kodak DX6340:  1.) The 4X OPTICAL zoom, which for some reason breaks the 3X optical zoom standand, 2.) The review by Consumer Reports.<br />Regardless of the Consumer Reports rating I am extremely happy with the camera, but a few things CR pointed out confirmed my decision:<br />1.) Longest battery life.  CR claims 900 photos, but that is without using the LCD.  With heavy use of the LCD I get about 200 photos.  Either way it is about 2-4 times comparable cameras.<br />2.) Shortest delay between shots at 2 sec.  Next best was 3 sec according to CR which is a 50% increase in delay.<br />3.) LCD size.  This camera has 1.8\" and many comparables have 1.5\".  Translated, this camera has 20% more viewing area.<br />4.) Price.  Of the top 4-5 comparible cameras reviewed in CR, this was the cheapest.<br />Also, software was very easy to install, and is better than all the software that came with either my printer or scanner.","This is my second Kodak digital camera. I loved the first so much I recommended it to everyone.  This one I have to give mixed reviews for. First off, the photo quality and features are excellent. It takes great pics, the videos are a great feature, and I love the dial. Night-time pics never seem to turn out, eve with the Night option though. Just on photo issues I would give it a 4.5 stars.<br />But, a small drop on carpet when it was still brand-new resulted in it no longer working.  I sent it to Kodak, they couldnt fix it and it wasnt covered under warranty (of course) so I had to pay $150 for a refurbished one.  What was wrong with it? The thin plastic lenscap was jarred.  I've had the replacement camera a few months now and have babied it, it's never seen a drop or jar and the lenscap has started to not retract completely.  Either its a standard problem or they fixed my original and sent it back. (the refurbished has the same serial number, they said they switched it but now I'm starting to wonder).<br />So, in summary, this camera is great but if you aren't going to baby it completely, get something else.  The camera can't seem to handle real-life use.","I love this camera to death, and I have only had it for a week! I purchased a 256mb memory card, a must-have. I can take about 270 pictures at 3.1 Megapixels!  I only have one problem. I had to exchange the camera for a new one when the battery door broke. The INCLUDED CRV3 battery pack seems to be too big for the battery compartment. It is much harder to close than it is when using Ni-MH batteries. Thankfully Target exchanged it for me.  So just be aware of using the included CRV3 battery pack. I suggest going to Radioshack and getting a Ni-MH rechargeable battery kit. It comes with 4 Ni-MH batteries and a fast charging unit.  Otherwise, I love the camera. Definitely a great buy for the features and simplicity.","I personally have had several digital cameras over the years and my perents wanted to start to go digital.  So I decided that in order to make my life easier (a.k.a. less phone calls), I would buy the most simple camera without a bunch of bells and whistles.  Well it was reading and playing around with different cameras and found this little gem.<br />This camera is EASY TO USE.<br />It has a small wheel on the back to select special photo modes.<br />It has the sound of a shudder so you don't take pictures of feet (there is a delay from pushing the button and picture with all digital cameras).<br />It docks on the optional Printer Dock (I bought as well) which prints incredible dye sublimated photos (Translation.. Won't run in the rain).  The optional dock comes with a rechargable battery.<br />It can connect right up to a laptop or desktop with ease throught the USB port.<br />It compresses prictures well so you can take as many as you want at highest resolution (but pruchase a 128 MB or 256 MB SD Memory chip for lots and lots of photos).<br />The photo quality challanges some of the real film cameras in the marketplace.<br />It has a real photo lense not cheap plastic.<br />It feels good in a large or small hand.  It feels like a camera (not a plastic lightweight toy).<br />It has movie capabilities.<br />I am actually looking at the next step up from this camera DX6440 with is 4 megapixel.  But This camera is awesome.<br />Oh yeah.  Did I say it was EASY TO USE.<br />Enjoy","I have been following the DX6340 on the Kodak web site since March 2003 with great expectation. In the store we compared 3 comparable models Canon, Nikon and Kodak and found the Kodak held it's own ground in features. I purchased it in September 2003 as my first digital still camera. I must say that I am very impressed with the user friendlyness of the whole Kodak system. The instructions that come on a disc are very easy to follow and I was able to use the camera immediately. I am happy to see that I was not disappointed in purchasing the 3.1 Mega Pixel as it exceeds my requirements. The auto focus and flash in the 6340 works extreemly well and I have no problem getting well over 100 flashes and pictures out of my (2) AA Nickel Metal Hydride 2100ma batteries which I felt were a must to purchase seperately. The only change I would like to see to the camera is that presently the auto focus is accomplished by holding down the shutter button half way. If you release the button before you fully depress it to take the picture, you loose the focus. That quirk is obviously my own personnal issue but I would definitely buy it again and I would not hesitate recommending this Kodak Pleasure Device to my own mother.<br />Edmonton, Alberta Canada","This camera is my first digital, but the feature set is all you need and the 4x zoom lets you take some fanastic shots with less sacrifice on quality then using an digital zoom. The various settings including a setting where exposure and f-stop can be set make this camera as versitile as you will ever need.<br />With the 256 MB chip, you can take high quality pictures all day and still have storage to burn.<br />The software is easy to use. The picture quality is fantastic.<br />Overall, the only thing that would make this camera better would be to make it waterproof so you could take it anywhere anytime.","I bought this camera after much deliberation and searching through endless catalogues and department stores. It was between this Kodak and the previous model (the DX6330). We decided to go with this camera though and we certainly haven't been disappointed. The picture quality is amazing. There are so many different modes of actually taking the picture (i.e. close up, landscape, night shot) that no matter what your conditions are, there is an option for taking a brilliant picture.<br />The menus are easy to navigate through and downloading the pictures couldn't be easier. Some people have said that the battery life doesn't last long but i've been using my camera for weeks now, taking maybe 200 pictures and I haven't changed the batteries once.<br />The camera also does movies up to the limit of the memory - not any set time as other cameras do, meaning as long as you have free memory you can film, which is a nice feature.<br />The only think I would recommend is additional memory, but I think thats the same with every camera. Finally, we chose the 6340 above the 6330 as it was an additional $50 for a slightly better zoom and two more options to choose when taking a picture (moving and landscape or something like that).<br />I'm no digital camera expert, i only wanted to take some pictures when I went out and about and this is the perfect camera for capturing those perfect moments!","The 6340 is one great camera!  I've had it for one month now use it frequently and have been very pleased with picture quality and functions.  The 4X optical zoom is by far better for this price than any other camera out there.  Battery life is excellent I'm still on the original CRV3 that came with the camera, unheard of for other brand cameras.  LCD is bright and viewable in all lighting conditions.  Kodak Easy Share software is user friendly and works.  Kodak web sites provide you with all the info you need to get the most out of this camera.  After several months of internet research and reading reviews like this one I believe I made the right decision.","I did my homework and researched this camera before I bought it, and I am so glad I did! What I found is that this camera can work wonders! I took about 50 pictures today in varying light of the Atlanta scene.  I printed one out on my printer just to see what it looks like, and I was just amazed at the quality of the pictures! There is absolutely no need to get anything higher than a 3.1 MP.  I took a picture of my grandmother close up on the Portrait mode and I can see every little pore and hair! (Perhaps it's a bit too good?)<br />This camera is for my 63yo grandmother who has trouble operating a mouse.  She already, after only one day, knows how to use this camera.  It's extremely easy to use.  Neither my grandmother nor I needed to touch the manual to work it.<br />The sole reason I remove a star from its rating is due to the software.  Mine was corrupt, so I had to Download it from Kodak.com  The software is also a very poor tool for editing your pictures.  If you plan on editing them much, I suggest getting a program like Adobe photoshop or Microsoft Photo Editor.  The software does make it slightly easier to Download pictures from the camera, but if you have a program like Adobe or Ulead Photo Explorer, the software is not necessary at all.<br />Ofoto, the website Kodak recommends to upload your pictures to, is great!  I like the way they show the pictures online in not only clickable thumbs but also slide shows.<br />So far, the battery life of the camera is fine! I used it all day today, on and off constantly and there is still no flashing battery light.<br />Just a word of advise: I would definately invest in at least a 128MB memory card for this camera.  16 is simply not enough, especially once you realize how much you love this camera, and trust me, you will! I'd also recommend rechargeable batteries as Kodak gives you a pair that are not rechargeable.<br />Oh, and the Dock is a waste of money and a collector of dust.  Don't bother with it. First of all it's useless, unless you got the one with the printer attatched, but even if you did get the dock with its own printer, you'd still be spending more on the dock than professional photo developing.<br />I hope this helps.  Enjoy your camera, whichever one you choose.","I have to laugh at comments that I hear about this camera not having enough controls and bells and whistles. To delete, press the delete button. For flash, press the flash button. Every function is clearly marked on the buttons, and the more complicated functions are clearly written on the menu. You don't even need the manual for most of the cameras functions. I find it hard to understand people who complain at the ease of this camera. I believe it to be a virtue. I believe that I will take pictures with this camera that I would have missed with more expensive digitals. As a matter of fact, I gave my 'better' sony to my son. I kept the Kodak. Did I mention that it takes great pictures? Best wishes, Jon","i just got the dx6340 and i love it. it is my fisrt digital cmaera. i only got it to weeks ago and i already have over 100 pictures on the computer. It is awesome. it has so many different modes. sport for moving stuff. landsape. within 24 inches. normal and some others. you can even make videos like a camcorder.it has auto focus and the 4 times optical zoom is awesome but the digital zoom distorts the picture.worthless. after you tkae the picture zoomed in though you can zoom in 4 more times by cliching th joystick thing. some people don't like the delay from whan you push the button and when it takes the picture but i don't think they know that you have to push the button half way down and then pressthe button down all the way for instant pictures.there is different modes of flash too.there is a ten second timer and a burst mode. you will want a better memorycard though. a 128 mb or 256. at least a 64MB. all together a great little camera and it is easy to use.<br />don't likes:<br />  I don't like how the flash is always atomaticaly on till you turn it off.<br />  the battery life is pretty short","I bought this camera a month ago and I _love_ it.  It is very easy to use, with well-designed buttons and menu.  Its 4x Schneider len is impressive considering the price of the camera.  Its 1.8 inch LCD not only is larger than many other cameras, but also has higher resolution.  The camera does not have an option to change image compression level.  But Kodak probably has chosen the optimal level for general use and you probably will choose the same level if you are given the option.  The EasyShare software is easy to use.  And the trasfer of photos/videos from camera to PC is extremely easy.  But without care, the software can make duplicate entries.  The camera came with a scratch on the body, which is the reason I remove a star.","I have the similar dx6440 camera (it has a 4 megapixel sensor) and also had a previous fuji.<br />This camera is excellent in all aspects, but my thoughts here relate to another reviewer's comments on the annoyances.<br />1. Yes, reviewing photos will necessitate turning the camera on which makes the lens come out. On my old Fuji, (finexpix 2600), the review mode could be used without exposing the lens.<br />2. Yes, the 'auto' mode and the 'manual' mode are 6 or 7 clicks removed on the rotary dial. In between those 2 are modes like 'sport', 'landscape', 'portrait' 'night' etc. To me, it's not a major deal, as the dial can be rotated quickly, and having the manual mode with your individualized options at the very end saves trying to figure out which stop you are at (you just rotate the dial to the end).<br />3. No. Getting the intended picture frame in the LCD screen simply requires pushing in on the joystick button that's at the center of the dial. The LCD then lights up and you can frame the picture using that and not the 'peep-hole'. Another push, and it's off. (You CAN set the LCD screen to be permanently on in the menu, but for an individual picture, you only have to just push in the joystick button as I described.)<br />4. No. Pictures can be reviewed without accessing the menu by pushing in the 'review' button. This brings up all your pictures, and you can move through them by using the joystick.<br />Overall, I think the user interface with this model is very much simpler than my Fuji's was. The rotary dial selects the modes, there is a review button to show pictures, a delete button for the obvious, a flash button to cycle through the flash modes, and a menu button to pick other settings (white balance etc.)The joystick in the center of the rotary dial makes it very easy to click through any of the options.  If I hadn't used my Fuji in a while, I'd have to check the manual for how to change settings. On the Kodak, the controls are much more intuitive.","This camera is packed with features and goodies. No other camera in its class has used Schneider Lens with 4X zoom. Easiest canera to use, but it also includes manual mode for amateur photographer to go beyond any point-shot mode. The pixel on the other hand, is not as good as those found in Canon or Sony, however it is still good enough for the money. The internal memory comes handy in case you forget to take the SD meory with you. Ohh...the burst mode is also featured for those trying to take moving pictures....4 pics per shot!! Very useful for snowboarding capture or any other sports mode....","I've only had my camera a short time but it seems reliable and easy to use.  The 4x zoom is awesome and so much better than you get on most 3mp cameras BUT you should know the camera is very big... I bought it online and it's much bigger and bulkier than I expected.  It's like the size of a normal 35mm camera.  It's not one you'll throw in your pocket or purse and forget about.  Just something to consider.  I was deciding between this and the Canon SD100 and had I seen them side by side, I probably would have chosen the Canon just based on size and portability.","My Fuji Finepix4700 took a dirtnap right before we went on a weekend vacation.  I loved that camera.  Had it for 3 years and abused it.  We stopped at a retailer at 9 PM Friday night to grab something for the trip.  When I found a 4x optical w/ 3megapixels for $300 I grabbed it.  Overall it seems like a good value.  The screen is large, and I like the look and feel of the interactive menu.  I like that it detects when you hold the camera sideways and rotates the thumbnail in review mode.  Not sure on battery life yet, but I like that you can use AA-NiMH rechargables (which I am stocked with due to the Fuji) as well as disposable lithiums.  NOTE: SEVERAL MAJOR IRRITATIONS coming from what I am used to with the Fuji.  1.  If you want to review your pictures stored in memory, you first have to turn the camera on into one of the photography modes - which opens and extends the lens (exposing it unnecessarily, potentially into the palm of the viewers hand, and wasting battery life running the motor.)  2.  The \"OFF\" function is one of the positions on the photo mode dial.  So if you want to take a picture in a mode way down the dial, turn it off, and take a another picture in a mode way down the dial - say if you like manual (PAS) mode which is last on the dial - you have to click the dial through 7 or so clicks each time.  This can delay response to a quick photo opportunity and put unnecessary wear on the mode/on/off dial.  3.  If you want to shoot a picture using the 1.8\" display instead of the peep-hole, you have to go two-levels deep into the menu to turn it on, and then two-levels deep again to turn it off.  I typically shoot using the peep hole to save battery life, but sometimes I need to use the display to frame my picture (say if I have to hold the camera in an awkward position).  Similarly the option for a quick preview is two levels deep on the menu. --- The Fuji had separate controls for on/off, mode selection, review/photograph mode, and display on/off all within easy reach.  So my complaints may be somewhat biased based on my familiarity with my old camera.  I haven't decided whether the specs of this Kodak for the price outweigh some if it's functional design deficiencies yet.","When my wife's camera was stolen in Rome in July, I started looking for another film camera; she was specific about that.<br />But when I saw the Kodak 6340 with a 4x optical lens, automatic rotation of images, and a 3MP CCD, I looked at it more closely.  Buying it and setting it up for her was easy; getting her to consider it took more skill.  She has used it and loves it.<br />It works like her stolen Olympus 140, but more so.  After taking the photo, she can look at it immediately and take another if needed.  Later she can crop or brighten the photo, as needed.<br />The icons on the rotary dial are explained on the LCD display in an understandable way.  She is anxious to try the settings way beyond those available on her former film camera.<br />It's a winner.  I recommend it for clarity of picture and ease of use, especially for casual photo taking.","With every feature the amateur photographer would ever want & more.<br />What this camera can do is mind boggeling.<br />Supurb shots in any light, fantastic movies & very user friendly.<br />You can't go wrong with this one !!","I bought this camera after extensive searching online for the right one for me.  This camera is extremely easy to use.  More memory is a must for it, 128 is plenty, and also rechargeable batteries because it goes through alkalines in about 10 pictures.  Overall this is a great camera for the money and I recommend it to anyone.","I simply plugged the cable into a USB port in the back of the comptuer and the firewire into the camera and XP automatically installed the driver and I was downloading the pictures inside of 5 seconds.  I'm not sure what problem the other reviewer had, but I think it was not Kodak problem!","I love the picture quality, the options and the size!  I also use a SLR camera and missed the ability to choose my own setting when using my old digial camera.  I am so excited that I am able to do this on the DX6340.  Also, I have a year old daughter who always smiles AFTER she sees the flash.  Having the ability to take a cluster of pictures (4 in a row) is great for capturing her best smiles!  I also trust Kodak.  My old digital was a DC290 (also a Kodak) and lasted several years.","I don't have anything to compare this to, but I love it. I did a great deal of research before making this purchase and I know it paid off. It is light weight, easy to use and so far the battery life is great.<br />Highly recommend this camera.","I don't understand how anyone could say this doesn't work when trying to connect to a pc, especially XP.  It connects with 1 cable, and your pc sees it as a hard drive.  What could be easier than that.  So, for the people that are blaming the camera for their problems, please recheck to see that you don't have anything running that is conflicting with your USB port.  The camera works fine, and connects to a pc with ease. It would be a shame for someone to pass on this camera because of an inaccurate review.","I am a complete novice to digital cameras, so cosider that when reading this review.<br />  I decided on digital because I could print the pictures at home and the images would last forever in my pc or on a disk. Plus the added bonus of never having to buy film again.<br />  When the camera arrived I just simple put the battery in and the 128 meg SD card I had ordered seperately (camera comes with internal 16 megs rated at 17 pictures in best picture quality)and started taking pictures. After I installed the software. I transfered the pictures to my PC and they looked amazing. When I printed some pictures they looked quit good as well but the colors did seem to change a little but I attribute that to my printer.<br /><br />  The camera has seven picture modes, one mode you can use to manually set shutter speed and other factors ( Stuff I don't know anything about ) and a video mode. The video mode can store almost twelve minutes of video with my 128 meg sd card. According to the user manual. I haven't tried it yet.<br /><br />  The camera uses CRV3 lithium, AA lithium or rechargeable AA Ni-MH batteries. Approximately 450, 320, or 180(per charge) pictures respectively. According to the user manual.<br /><br />  I am very pleased with this camera and as long as it keeps working I doubt I'll ever get another.<br />  I hope this has been helpful for you.","My first digital camera and it suits my needs for family photos, vacations, etc. I purchased both the Kodak LS440 with 4mp and DX6340 and instantly knew I liked the DX6340 better. But I was concerned about the quality of prints of the 4mp over the newer features of the 6340. While I was at Best Buy I was able to talk to a Kodak rep. For features the DX6340 has much more and the flash is good to 19ft compared to 10ft. for the LS440. A major selling point for me. Overall quality of print was minor, he showed me 8 x 10's from the DX and LS. Battery life for the LS is better but I haven't had any issues with the DX. You could wait until the fall when kodak releases the upgrade to the 6340 with 4mp then you'd really have a good camera.","We bought this camera on Saturday 6/21/03, the day before my daughter and I left to go to Washington DC on a Safety Patrol field trip for a week.  My husband gave me the book and said read it on your way there.  I did and took over 250 (kept 200) shots.  My daughter also took photos of me and her friends.  We looked at them, laughed and deleted the ones that weren't any good.  Came home and download in a few minutes.  We picked our favorites, edited and created some new shots; put them onto a CD one evening, took them to Sams and got them developed in a couple of hours.  This weekend I have been sharing the photos on the internet with family and friends all around the country.  It has been alot of fun playing with it.  My husband and I ARE NOT computer whizzes! It sounds to me like a personal problem for the person from Chicago who had problems.","Let's face it, I couldn't find a camera that didn't take decent pictures.  I looked at the Olympus, the Sony, and briefly at several other models.  The thing that sold me on the Kodak was the user interface and menu system.  It is ten times easier to use than the Olympus that I was somewhat used to.  If you want to take a close-up or you want to go into movie mode, you don't have to pull up the menu system, drill down through several options and switch into another mode, you just turn the camera on dial to a different setting.<br />As far as downloading into your PC, I don't know how you could make it any easier?  USB cable goes into USB ports and camera appears as a hard drive.  With EasyDock system you can even eliminate the cable and recharge the batteries as well.<br />Kodak named it well, this is by far the EASYiest camera to use.","For the price, this camera is a great investment.  The camera focuses well and provides as clear an image as possible with 3.1 resolution.  The only blurry pictures I encountered were the results of incorrect camera handling.  This camera does require some reading.  The camera has a number of scene modes and features that affect its performance.  For example, if you use the night mode, you must remember to hold the camera still longer than normal, as the aperture remains open longer.  If you do so, the pictures you will take will be top notch.  What impressed me most about this camera was the sport mode.  My friend asked me to take a picture of her legs while she was running.  I did so, and the picture came out PERFECT, as if she were standing completely still in a very awkward position.  I don't really know what other people are complaining about with reference to the software.  I have Windows XP Home on my laptop, and the camera setup was easy and quick.  Personally, you may not even need the camera dock.  I was handling fine with just a USB cord.  Only one problem; rechargeable batteries are a MUST.  This camera eats alkaline batteries like nothing else, and low batteries often lead to poor performance on the part of the camera.  Buy a pair of good rechargeable NIMH batteries, and you should be fine.","I just bought this camera on June 28th and had no problem using it right out of the box.  I installed the software prior to  connecting the camera to the computer via the USB cable (included).  The pictures downloaded with no problem.  Based on reviews of this product I have read on other sites, XP users seem to have better success by installing the Easy Share software prior to connecting the camera to the PC.  Hope this helpful and happy picture taking! :-)","One of the DX6340's best assets is its ease of use. The dial on the left changes the shooting modes, described by well-understood symbols.  The joystick in the center of the dial is kind of small, easy to mix up. Not for the big-handed. Shooting is very easy, and storage time is fast. Internal 16MB is too small, so get a 128 or 256 Secure Digital card. The LCD is nice, good size for monitor shots. Works well in both indoor and outdoor situations, even in direct sunlight.<br />Very well designed, fits very well in medium sized hands, controls are at your finger tips, except for timed-delay and flash options. Pretty stylish two-tone silver has nice accents. Lens retracts, there is no lens cap. Share button is a nice touch, a jeweled amber. Combined with dock, has very Apple-like designs, jeweled buttons, etc<br />Has a video feature, no time limit, except for storage capacities. Can also do timed videos, 5sec, 15sec, etc. Microphone is fairy sensitive, but is no substitute for a digital camcorder, or even higher-end cameras with the same feature. Frame rate is good, video is a nice extra.<br />Shutter sound can be disabled, Menus are a little cumbersome, more important features are buried under such options as \"storage selection,\" \"shutter sound\" etc.<br />OVERALL: Good design, very stylish, not for the manual-minded, despite manual mode. Good point-and-shoot for amateurs. (Dont forget the charging-transfer Dock)","I'm very new to digital photography and was, in all honesty, a bit skeptical about the Kodak brand.<br />However, the price and features were attractive - especially the 4x optical zoom.<br />I'd definitely recommend purchasing a memory card and a set of rechargable batteries (the lithium battery included with mine was not rechargable).  The internal memory and the provided lithium batteries are just enough to get you started - but that's about it.<br />If you can see your way clear, get the Easyshare Dock, too.  Makes uploading to your computer a breeze.<br />My only real complaint at this point is the included software.  It's a bit flakey and tends to take over things like trying to play audio CD's and/or DVD's.<br />All-in-all this is a very good first choice.","I say phooey to all those 4 and 5MP cameras that are coming out - what, are you going to make a wall-sized poster of your picnic at the park?<br />This camera takes such nice pictures! The colors are never muted, indoors or out, the resolution seems perfect to the layman's eye, the controls are easy, the parts sturdy, and the battery lasts for ages! I've taken at least 150 pictures with the 2 regular AA batteries that came with the camera.<br />The quality of this camera seems 1000 times better than my 2.2MP. Even the preview screen is better than the rest - it a special screen that can be seen from more angles than the usual digital camera screens which can only be viewed straight on.<br />For the more technically advanced, if you're searching for an alternative to a 35mm, this has so many easy to use (and effective) settings that mimic the effects of a 35mm you can play with it for ages. Read the specs, and I will testify for it's quality.<br />If you are really bent on photo print outs, you can buy the easy share printer - you can just stick the camera on it, press a button, and it will print your pictures. The prints are quite convincing versions of actual 35mm prints. The camera dock can also be purchased seperately , which recharges batteries and sends the photos to your computer when you press the button. Otherwise, you will have to settle for a media card reader or a USB cable, which works fine for me.<br />For the price (even if it were more!) this is an excellent camera."]},{"name":"Casio QV-R40","amazon_reviews":["I bought this camera just before a family vacation in March 2004.  I wanted to do more research before I went digital, but the pressure was on to act before the trip.  I found the manual to be useful and the camera to be VERY easy to use.<br /><br />It takes great pictures and the small size is a plus.<br /><br />I'll look to Casio when I buy my next camera.","I purchased the Casi QV-R40 digital camera two years ago, and I have not encountered any problems with it thus far. It has very nice picture quality, and ease of use. It comes with two rechargeable batteries and a battery charger, which are both very nice bonuses. The charged batteries will last a long time, but, I did buy a spare pair, in case one pair is charging, or one pair runs out of juice, simply put in the other pair. I would definitly reccomend, along with buying an extra set of batteries, to also buy a memory card that stores more pictures. I always use the highest quality of resolution, and normally take pictures one right after another. So, for me, the higher amount of pictures was a must. This is an excellent camera, and I would recomend the Casio QV-R40 to anyone looking for a digital camera.","I have been through a number of the under $250 digital cameras and this is the one I am most happy with.  To see a comparison of all of them, see the bottom of the review.<br /><br />Pros of the qv-r40:<br /><br />-short lag time (1/2 a second-very good in cheaper digitals!)<br /><br />-great exposure in all lighting situations-great in low light<br /><br />-lots of neat features and settings (sepia, b and w, night time, etc.)<br /><br />-easy to maneuver through menus<br /><br />-small compact size<br /><br />-overall good photo quality (see cons)<br /><br />-durable and long lasting<br /><br />-great battery life (I keep it in the diaper bag and use it a few times a day.  I charge every 2 or 3 weeks)<br /><br />-Good price (I got mine for $99 on ebay)<br /><br />Cons of the qv-r40:<br /><br />-the only con I have with this camera is that the photos are sometimes a bit (though not horribly) grainy and pixelated at 8x10 or larger.  I have gotten better quality in this area (though not in exposure) with Canon cameras (see camera comparison at end of review)<br /><br />-the lack of sound on the video should be noted, but doesn't bother me...that's why I have a camcorder<br /><br />I have no other qualms with this camera.  i really enjoy using it and am happy with it. At 4x6 and 5x7 the pictures are amazing!  Bigger and they are still good, but not quite up to par for a 4 mp, but then again, neither is the price.<br /><br />CAMERA COMPARISONS (and what I paid)<br /><br />I have had the Casio qv-4000 ($116), the canon a300 ($85), and have used the canon s30 (sell for around $120) a lot because of a family member.  The canon a300 had too long of a shutter lag which just got really annoying with my kids (3 seconds lag and they are gone).  The s30 is faster on the lag (1/2 second), but has a lower battery life than the 1300 and the qv-r40 and is renowned (like many point and shoot canons) for getting errors where the lens doesn't pop out anymore.  My QV-4000 had a very weak flash (though you could buy an extra flash attachment) and was bulky for a point and shoot but had great picture quality because it uses a canon lens.  It was a great little camera.  Picture quality was higher on the qv-4000 than on this one, but for indoor photography, you would definitely need the flash that can be purchased for it.  It also took 4 batteries and still had a shorter battery life.","i've had over 10 different digicams up to an 8 mp nikon for $1m. i was looking for an upgrade for my wife, and i was drawn to casio because my son has one of the real thin, large lcd exilim models that is very impressive. the r40 is discontinued, but readily available on the used/refurb market. other than the thicker body (still less than 1\") and smaller lcd (good enough) this model is a real quality peice. metal, not plastic, 4mp, 3x zoom, lots of good features. takes sd cards, and has some built-in memory. takes real clear, good color pics which can easily be printed well to 8.5x11 and even to 11x14. you can get them used or refurbed in the $125-$150 range. my wife loves it, so i got another for my daughter, and another for myself when i don't want to lug around my primary nikon.","I really like this camera, it is small enough to be discrete in your pocket yet packs a powerful punch. If you look at price to performance ratio, this camera excels. It doesn't cost that much yet for the price you get a fully functionally quality digital camera. At 4 megapixels I can't complain. I took this camera around during my day to take random pictures and to see how the camera performed. I took pictures in a restaurant and outside, both pictures looked good. I had it on highest setting and it does not differ too much from other 4 megapixel cameras. The LCD screen is average size, not too big but good enough to see without strain.<br />I used AA alkaline batteries just to see how long they would last. Since it was recommended not to use them as they drain quickly I wanted to see for my self. The batteries lasted the whole day (I took around 70 pics) and I never had to change batteries even with using the flash for half those pictures. The charger also can charge other name brand AA and AAA batteries and those worked great for me.<br />Again, I don't know why casio does this but the videos that you record do not have sound. Why? I do not know. Nonetheless it is a camera and not a camcorder but if you're not going to have sound, might as well not even bother with video at all and use those resources towards something else on the camera. The camera does take a couple of seconds in-between shots but not long enough to lower my rating. The newer version of this camera, the QV-R51 takes much longer (probably because it is processing an extra megapixel of info per shot)than this one.<br />Overall all, even though there is a newer version of this camera, it is significantly more expensive than this and the performance of that camera is not worth the price (all you get is a bigger LCD screen that drains the batteries quicker and 1 more megapixel of resolution). This camera on the other hand is a spectacular deal in price for the performance you receive and the portability. I definitely recommend this camera, it sure hit the sweet spot for me.","I already had a Sharp 4 MP camera, but the only reason that I got this camera is because of its small size. Here's some reason why I choose this camer, It uses AA batteries which NIMH batteries cost about 4 for $10, secondly, it uses SD memory card which is what my Sharp camera uses, and thirdly its very compact for a camera that uses AA battery. Further plus includes its start up time which is only about 1 second, and it includes many useful features such as cropping your photos in your camera after you have taken the photo to free up spaces on the memory card. It also have many color filters such as blue, red, green, etc... useful for enhancing the sky, ocean, etc... There is also 21 pre-settings for different situations. As for the con, there are some noise in the photo, and it doesn't focus well in dark areas. It also doesn't let you manually adjust the shutter speed and the only way to take bright and shadowless photo at night or under a weak tungsten light is to choose from the 21-preshot options which really annoys me. Other than that, this camera is terrific and i love it, because it comes in handy because of its small size and its low cost accessories (batteries, memory card, etc..) The only reason i gave it a 4 instead of 5 because of the noise that is in the photo and sometime the sky came out unaturally bluish-green. Unless you're on a tight budget or doesn't mind the amount of noise in it, I would recommend the QV-R51 because it has much less noise in the image and you can always scale the size down to 4MP to reduce image size. (See [...] for sample image) For me, I got it at walmart for just $200 during clearance so it's definitly a great buy!","This is my second digital camera and I'm glad with my choice. This camera has so many pros and few cons that it is worth for you to try.<br />Some of the pros are: Robust aluminum-alloy body, excellent image quality, 4.0 mega pixels, 3x digital zoom, small shutter lag (2/10 seconds), lens retracting completely into the body, flash with red eye reduction, handful preset shooting modes, video mode, two AA-size NiMH 2100mAh batteries and charger included, and many other etceteras.<br />The only cons I found were: 15 fps video clips with no audio up to 30 seconds each (audio recording would have been great), lack of exposure controls other than program AE, lack of a video output port.<br />This camera gives an impressive performance and quality for a great price, and definitively you won't regret on buying it.","I'm not a camera expert but I know what I like, and after spending three years with a Digital Elph where the indoor photos looked yellow and 2/3 of the pictures were shaky, I finally bucked up, shopped obsessively to find a new one, and picked this up.<br />I'm very happy so far:<br />-Indoor photos are great - skin tones and colors are normal;<br />-The colors in outdoor photos are wonderful;<br />-The flash ends up working really well (I've been using it to take pictures in very dark rooms and it's doing great);<br />-Almost no shakiness;<br />-The video capability - which is an every-once-in-a-while for me - is just fine.<br />-Battery life is excellent - though the camera sometimes thinks the battery is low and shuts off.<br />I wish the flash refreshed a bit faster, mostly because I'm impatient - and I don't know how any of the complex settings work, because they don't ship a manual and I'm too lazy to read it online, so I'm missing out on something good - but so far I highly recommend it.","I bought this camera a few days ago.  I love it.  I have been shopping extensively for a camera and finally settled.  It takes great pictures, has a fast startup time, very easy to use.  One major selling point for me was the size.  It fits right into my pocket no problem.  The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because it is a little heavy for its size, plus it doesn't have a video mode.  Other than that not a single complaint.","I bought this camera just before a family vacation in March 2004.

The charged batteries will last a long time, but, I did buy a spare pair, in case one pair is charging, or one pair runs out of juice, simply put in the other pair. I would definitly reccomend, along with buying an extra set of batteries, to also buy a memory card that stores more pictures. I always use the highest quality of resolution, and normally take pictures one right after another. So, for me, the higher amount of pictures was a must. This is an excellent camera, and I would recomend the Casio QV-R40 to anyone looking for a digital camera.","I have been through a number of the under $250 digital cameras and this is the one I am most happy with.  To see a comparison of all of them, see the bottom of the review.<br /><br />Pros of the qv-r40:<br /><br />-short lag time (1/2 a second-very good in cheaper digitals!)<br /><br />-great exposure in all lighting situations-great in low light<br /><br />-lots of neat features and settings (sepia, b and w, night time, etc.)<br /><br />-easy to maneuver through menus<br /><br />-small compact size<br /><br />-overall good photo quality (see cons)<br /><br />-durable and long lasting<br /><br />-great battery life (I keep it in the diaper bag and use it a few times a day.  I charge every 2 or 3 weeks)<br /><br />-Good price (I got mine for $99 on ebay)<br /><br />Cons of the qv-r40:<br /><br />-the only con I have with this camera is that the photos are sometimes a bit (though not horribly) grainy and pixelated at 8x10 or larger.  I have gotten better quality in this area (though not in exposure) with Canon cameras (see camera comparison at end of review)<br /><br />-the lack of sound on the video should be noted, but doesn't bother me...that's why I have a camcorder<br /><br />I have no other qualms with this camera.  i really enjoy using it and am happy with it. At 4x6 and 5x7 the pictures are amazing!  Bigger and they are still good, but not quite up to par for a 4 mp, but then again, neither is the price.<br /><br />CAMERA COMPARISONS (and what I paid)<br /><br />I have had the Casio qv-4000 ($116), the canon a300 ($85), and have used the canon s30 (sell for around $120) a lot because of a family member.  The canon a300 had too long of a shutter lag which just got really annoying with my kids (3 seconds lag and they are gone).  The s30 is faster on the lag (1/2 second), but has a lower battery life than the 1300 and the qv-r40 and is renowned (like many point and shoot canons) for getting errors where the lens doesn't pop out anymore.  My QV-4000 had a very weak flash (though you could buy an extra flash attachment) and was bulky for a point and shoot but had great picture quality because it uses a canon lens.  It was a great little camera.  Picture quality was higher on the qv-4000 than on this one, but for indoor photography, you would definitely need the flash that can be purchased for it.  It also took 4 batteries and still had a shorter battery life.","i've had over 10 different digicams up to an 8 mp nikon for $1m. i was looking for an upgrade for my wife, and i was drawn to casio because my son has one of the real thin, large lcd exilim models that is very impressive. the r40 is discontinued, but readily available on the used/refurb market. other than the thicker body (still less than 1\") and smaller lcd (good enough) this model is a real quality peice. metal, not plastic, 4mp, 3x zoom, lots of good features. takes sd cards, and has some built-in memory. takes real clear, good color pics which can easily be printed well to 8.5x11 and even to 11x14. you can get them used or refurbed in the $125-$150 range. my wife loves it, so i got another for my daughter, and another for myself when i don't want to lug around my primary nikon.","I really like this camera, it is small enough to be discrete in your pocket yet packs a powerful punch. If you look at price to performance ratio, this camera excels. It doesn't cost that much yet for the price you get a fully functionally quality digital camera. At 4 megapixels I can't complain. I took this camera around during my day to take random pictures and to see how the camera performed. I took pictures in a restaurant and outside, both pictures looked good. I had it on highest setting and it does not differ too much from other 4 megapixel cameras. The LCD screen is average size, not too big but good enough to see without strain.<br />I used AA alkaline batteries just to see how long they would last. Since it was recommended not to use them as they drain quickly I wanted to see for my self. The batteries lasted the whole day (I took around 70 pics) and I never had to change batteries even with using the flash for half those pictures. The charger also can charge other name brand AA and AAA batteries and those worked great for me.<br />Again, I don't know why casio does this but the videos that you record do not have sound. Why? I do not know. Nonetheless it is a camera and not a camcorder but if you're not going to have sound, might as well not even bother with video at all and use those resources towards something else on the camera. The camera does take a couple of seconds in-between shots but not long enough to lower my rating. The newer version of this camera, the QV-R51 takes much longer (probably because it is processing an extra megapixel of info per shot)than this one.<br />Overall all, even though there is a newer version of this camera, it is significantly more expensive than this and the performance of that camera is not worth the price (all you get is a bigger LCD screen that drains the batteries quicker and 1 more megapixel of resolution). This camera on the other hand is a spectacular deal in price for the performance you receive and the portability. I definitely recommend this camera, it sure hit the sweet spot for me.","I already had a Sharp 4 MP camera, but the only reason that I got this camera is because of its small size. Here's some reason why I choose this camer, It uses AA batteries which NIMH batteries cost about 4 for $10, secondly, it uses SD memory card which is what my Sharp camera uses, and thirdly its very compact for a camera that uses AA battery. Further plus includes its start up time which is only about 1 second, and it includes many useful features such as cropping your photos in your camera after you have taken the photo to free up spaces on the memory card. It also have many color filters such as blue, red, green, etc... useful for enhancing the sky, ocean, etc... There is also 21 pre-settings for different situations. As for the con, there are some noise in the photo, and it doesn't focus well in dark areas. It also doesn't let you manually adjust the shutter speed and the only way to take bright and shadowless photo at night or under a weak tungsten light is to choose from the 21-preshot options which really annoys me. Other than that, this camera is terrific and i love it, because it comes in handy because of its small size and its low cost accessories (batteries, memory card, etc..) The only reason i gave it a 4 instead of 5 because of the noise that is in the photo and sometime the sky came out unaturally bluish-green. Unless you're on a tight budget or doesn't mind the amount of noise in it, I would recommend the QV-R51 because it has much less noise in the image and you can always scale the size down to 4MP to reduce image size. (See [...] for sample image) For me, I got it at walmart for just $200 during clearance so it's definitly a great buy!","This is my second digital camera and I'm glad with my choice. This camera has so many pros and few cons that it is worth for you to try.<br />Some of the pros are: Robust aluminum-alloy body, excellent image quality, 4.0 mega pixels, 3x digital zoom, small shutter lag (2/10 seconds), lens retracting completely into the body, flash with red eye reduction, handful preset shooting modes, video mode, two AA-size NiMH 2100mAh batteries and charger included, and many other etceteras.<br />The only cons I found were: 15 fps video clips with no audio up to 30 seconds each (audio recording would have been great), lack of exposure controls other than program AE, lack of a video output port.<br />This camera gives an impressive performance and quality for a great price, and definitively you won't regret on buying it.","I'm not a camera expert but I know what I like, and after spending three years with a Digital Elph where the indoor photos looked yellow and 2/3 of the pictures were shaky, I finally bucked up, shopped obsessively to find a new one, and picked this up.<br />I'm very happy so far:<br />-Indoor photos are great - skin tones and colors are normal;<br />-The colors in outdoor photos are wonderful;<br />-The flash ends up working really well (I've been using it to take pictures in very dark rooms and it's doing great);<br />-Almost no shakiness;<br />-The video capability - which is an every-once-in-a-while for me - is just fine.<br />-Battery life is excellent - though the camera sometimes thinks the battery is low and shuts off.<br />I wish the flash refreshed a bit faster, mostly because I'm impatient - and I don't know how any of the complex settings work, because they don't ship a manual and I'm too lazy to read it online, so I'm missing out on something good - but so far I highly recommend it.","I bought this camera a few days ago.  I love it.  I have been shopping extensively for a camera and finally settled.  It takes great pictures, has a fast startup time, very easy to use.  One major selling point for me was the size.  It fits right into my pocket no problem.  The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because it is a little heavy for its size, plus it doesn't have a video mode.  Other than that not a single complaint.","After researching and shopping for quite awhile, this turned out to be the best for the money.","I purchased this camera 2 months ago and have had mixed opinions on it.  Build quality and design are great.  Unlike other electronic gadgets that have many features that you need to read an encyclopedia to figure out how to use them, the casio's features are numerous and easy to use.  Good life out of supplied rechargeable batteries(reccommend buying second set to have on hand). Great size and price. Almost no shutter lag under ideal conditions. Thats all of the good.<br />Now for the bad.  Flash, even under low setting overexposes almost half the time.  No manual shutter setting to compensate for this problem.  Takes way too long to recharge flash(5 to 8 seconds). No video out, sound and slide show.  Picture quality great outdoors in normal light.  Rest of the time average to poor, especially in low light.<br />End result.  Returned Casio and bought Canon A70 for the same price(see Amazons price of $218.00).  Canon is a little large and heavier but offers numerous manual settings, better grip,almost no shutter lag, quick flash recharge, video with sound, slideshow and better picture quality.","I think it takes great pictures in optimal conditions. Outside on sunny days produce excellent color and resolution. I have found that pictures at night or of fast moving things don't turn out well. The shutter lag time is also noticable. It is hard to take pictures of pets unless they sit still which is often unlikely.","This camera is simply perfect.<br />It is tiny, cheap, and most importantly takes amazing pictures.<br />I use an HP 8550 Color Laserjet and these pictures print out crystal clear on full bleed 8.5 * 11 prints.  The clarity is superb.<br />The only thing that I would improve is being able to manually adjust the shutter speed.<br />ITS A GREAT BUY!!!","I've finally found a very reasonably priced 4MP digital camera that I like and my wife will use!  We both like the 20 best shot modes that include a on screen detail description of each so that you understand how to utilize each mode. The menus are self explanatory and very easy to move through. It also gives me some manual override features that I like.<br />My only con so far is that pictures using the digital zoom appear pixelated on a 4x6 print from a photo lab.  I would not expect it so noticeable on print this small with a 4 MP resolution.  The only other surprise is that there is no sound with the video.<br />One option I did like was being able to resize a picture to a smaller resolution.  This is great when your memory card is full and you don't won't to delete any of the pictures to be able to take another picture.<br />Remember this is a $200 camera.  Personally, I think the QV-R40 is easily the best value for the dollar.","Pros:<br />1)Takes great pictures outside and in situations with alot of light.<br />2)Pictures taken with flash look good, although more \"white\" than realistic.<br />3)Looks really cool.<br />4)Compact.<br />5)Very sturdy.<br />6)Easy to use.<br />Cons:<br />1)Any pictures not using the flash or in high light situations (sunlight, etc) turn out blurry and are pretty poor.<br />2)The flash takes FOREVER to recharge.  Approximately 7 (SEVEN!!!) seconds for the flash to recharge.  This is what really kills it for me.  I have a 1 year old and want to take pictures quickly, 3 seconds or less charge time like my old Kodak CX4300, a $129 camera!","This is a very good camera for the price. It comes with handful of features which we may not find in this category of cameras especially in this price range. It takes very good pictures too.<br />Things I like:<br />1. Very fast response in power on and autofocus<br />2. Amazingly, it supports AA sized batteries (which we cannot find in compact size cameras)<br />3. Sleek and Compact metal body<br />4. 20 programmed best shot modes. Especially, I like the coupling shot(combining shots of two people in to a single image) and pre-shot(recording a shot on to an existing background). It also supports user-setup best shots (up to 999).<br />5. Album creation from the camera itself.<br />6. Calendar, World time and Alarm<br />Things I don't like:<br />1. Pictures look noisy on flat surfaces such as wall or sky(though the prints came out well even on 8x10)<br />2. No voice for video recording.<br />3. No video out for viewing pictures on TV.","I will not reiterate what other reviewers have said, however, I would like to add or clarify that the manual says avoid using regular \"AA\" batteries as they only last 10 minutes.  They are right.  What it needs are the rechargeable NMH (2 come with it) and they last a very long time.  Another point (that another reviewer complained about) is that the default mode of movie is easily changed to picture mode.  I purchased mine from Sam's Club for $197 and they are including a 32meg. SD card.  Greatest Value Ever.  Soon to be available though is a QV-R41 with 2\" LCD instead of 1.6\".","This is an absolutely AMAZING little camera!!!!  I have owned several 35 mm cameras in my day, from SLR to point-and-shoot, from high-end price to disposable.  This Casio camera outperforms them all.  You can just take it out of the box and start taking pictures, or you can take pictures with features in this camera that otherwise only a professional could attain.  The clarity on the photos is great - better than any 35 mm I've ever seen.  The camera is the perfect size...small enough to take everywhere, and big enough that you don't lose it.  I am so thrilled!  The only downside is that you have to download the complete operation manual from a computer, and it's MANY pages long.  But really, I was able to play with it pretty quickly without the instructions, and when I did download the manual, it only confirmed what I'd already figured out on my own.  The screen is small but really shows the true colors of the final print.  I can't say enough good things about this little camera.","I received this camera as a Christmas gift and I have been very pleased with its performance and features.  First, it is a very small camera that is easy to use and carry around. I was slightly disappointed with its boxy thickness but the camera's great looks made up for it. Secondly, the 3x optical zoom on a camera of this size is very impressive. (However, don't take my word on it, technology changes so fast these days.) Finally, the camera's sophisticated in-built software and electronic sound effects is almost reminiscent of some special 'Bond' gadget. That alone should be enough for some people to get it!","This is a stylish, compact, well made camera at an excellent price point. Its simple to use and provides enough creative control for the great majority of people. For those of you dipping your toes into digital photogrpahy for the first time and who generally use a compact camera this is the ideal choice. Operating it is very intiutive and you will pick it up within just a couple of hours of play. Use it; abuse it it; learn fronm it over the next 12-18 months and if at the end of it your interest in photography/digicams grows then go for something with a few more bells and whistles. And in 18 months time the digicam market will have made great strides in both functionality and price.<br />The camera feels solid and produces excellent quality prints. It uses 2 AA batteries and SD cards and is therefore the ideal choice for travellers and those on a tight budget. (incidentally, I've found the battery life very good). It comes with its own internal memory but I recommend you get a couple of 128Mb SD cards as soon as you are able. Typically at the highest resolution about 65 shots can be stored on a 128Mb card. I find that this is plenty for say a weekend away or for a special occasion.<br />It doesn't come with a case, but i recommend you buy the Tamrac 5690, which will carry 4 extra rechargable batteries and 2 additional SD cards<br />I don't own a computer and so have not used the software that comes with it, although I have heard it is just average and doesn't match the quality of the camera. I simply go to my local photography store and download the images onto a CD or print the ones I want at a very reasonable price.<br />In summary: a great camera that won't become out of date in the near future.","I bought this camera as a Christmas present for my wife.  We've taken hundreds of pictures with the camera and had few problems (no problem that wasn't the result of an unsteady hand).  The pictures are clear and sharp.  The owner's manual is... extensive (175 pages), but once you learn a few basic things, operation is no problem.  The navigation keys (on the back) have a up/down/right/left/set arrangement, with some of the key features (i.e. selecting between \"best shot\", \"manual\" and \"movie\") on the left and right keys.  I'm guessing the previous reviewer was having problems with this \"feature\".  Best shot works great and allows you to pick from a list of about 15 caned settings.  Battery life is excellent (unless your using regular alkaline).  The manual states explicitly to avoid doing such, and is only a fall back option (in case you can't charge your regular batteries and really don't want to miss a picture).  The camera uses secure digital media.  I get about 140 max resolution picture on a 256MB card (on one charge) with battery life to spare.  I would recommend buying a \"JumpDrive Trio\" from lexar to transfer your pictures to the PC.  This will save camera battery power AND allow you to use your secure digital media as a USB thumbdrive.","This is my sixth digital camera over the past five years. Although I use a professional digital camera for special events, I wanted a pocket size camera for convenience.<br />It' fast!  Let me tell you - the autofocus speed is faster than most other point and shoot cameras.  It also displays photos without delay.  Turn it on - the lens is ready in less than a second!<br />It's solid.  The body is all metal.  The LCD and the optics are recessed (protected).  It's easy to hold.<br />It's easy.  The controls are minimal and smartly laid out.  No fancy bells and whistles.<br />The image quality is surprising.  Exposure and color are accurate. Pictures are sharp and clear.<br />Is it the ultimate digital camera? No.  Is it the best pocket sized digital camera?  For under $350, I think it is.","The feature that I like the most is the fast startup time (about 1-2 second from pressing the ON switch to taking the first picture w/o flash.)  The shutter lag (the time from pressing the shutter till the time the camera actually records the picture) is very small also. Casio advertises the lag time as 0.01 second and I couldn't feel any lag time so I tend to believe them.<br />I bought this camera mainly to photograph my 4 month-old son, so the short startup time and small lag time is very important to me.  So far, I'm very happy with this camera.<br />The package contains two NiMH batteries and charger.  No SD card is included but the camera has 10 MB built-in memory.  The camera can use AA alkaline batteries (in emergency situations) but the batteries would not last long.  At the default 4 mega-pixel resolution, each image takes about 1.3 MB, so you should definitely buy SD card to store your pictures.<br />The size of the camera is also very compact and light. Very suitable for spontaneous shooting.","this camera is my third digital camera.  it is very small compared to my others but has many more features.  it is very capable of producing excellent 8x10 prints.  it is easy to use has a menu system that is very easy to use and is self explanatory.  just scroll down the screen and you can find just about anything you need.  it has a histogram that more or less will tell you in advance if the lighting situation is right for a good pic or if you need to recompose and how.  very light but sturdy.  i can find nothing wrong with it except it does not have sound in the movie mode and movies cannot be shown on tv, they have to be shown on the computer.  this was not a problem with me because i find all digital still camera movies to be terrible anyway.  you can't go wrong with this one!!!","I bought this camera in early September when it first came out, and I love it!! This little camera does everything and it is so compact that I carry it in my purse. I have 2 little kids and this camera is wonderful for catching all the milestones that they reach.<br />Some other reviewers have mentioned the batteries, well I have only had to charge mine 3 times the entire time I have owned it and I take alot of pictures with the LCD screen and the flash. I also just use the batteries when I am downloading the pictures and so far I haven't had any problems.<br />My only concern with this camera is the red eye. I have a baby and it seems as though every picture I have to edit to get that out. I never had this problem with my Kodak digital, but it is easily fixed with decent picture software.<br />All in all this is a wonderful camera and I have enjoyed it.","I spent hours researching digital cameras at ZDnet, epinions, and Popular Photography and I finally decided on this one.  I have NOT been disappointed in my choice in the slightest.  I normally use this to take pictures of my two young sons, but I have taken some scenery shots as well.  The pictures always come out beautifully.<br />Unlike the previous reviewer - I use batteries to download my pictures and have never had a problem.  My understanding from the manual was that it is recommended, not required.  Batteries are quick to run down when I use the LED readout to take pics, but the charger is quick and I'm up and running again in about 3 hours.<br />I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for good value for the money.","(...)P>Well, for starters I'm not an expert on digital cameras (I've owned them for awhile, but I'm a casual pic taker); however, I did a great deal of online reasearch before purchasing this one.  I felt this model gave me what I needed in the price range I could afford.  I was a little nervous though - as I couldn't find user reviews anywhere (just the pro reviews - which were very helpful).<br />First off - Bad News.... there is virtually no paper user's manual.  The GOOD NEWS though is they include a digital users manual on CD ROM with the camera (it's very in depth).  The REALLY GOOD NEWS is you can download the user's manual before you even buy the camera from [...] (I did this, and by the time my camera arrived - I felt like a pro using it).<br />The camera is not \"chinzy\" feeling (like some others - Fuji for example) - it's solid built and just feels like quality.  It's small, but not to tiny that it's difficult to use.  The LCD screen is a good size (and you can zoom to view pics magnified from the LCD.<br />The camera does everything it promises.  I adore it.<br />The bells and whistles are fun (though many of them not necessary for someone like me).  I love the 10 second delay shot.  This way I can get in the pic myself.<br />Regarding battery life:  Keep in mind - I always use the LCD screen and flash (so my batteries wear down faster than other people's might).  I'm getting about 50 or so pics per charge from the Sanyo Batteries that come with the camera.  I'm getting about 24 pics per charge from the Kodak 1700 batteries I purchased.  I'm happy with this.  The batteries charge rather quickly - and with 3 sets - I'm never stuck. These NimH AA's are pretty inexpensive - so it's really no big deal. I do wonder if my lack of pictures per charge wouldn't be improved with a \"better\" charger (the one that came with the camera is fine....but I bet it isn't top of the line).<br />Here is something someone might want to know (particularly someone unfamiliar with digital cameras).  They say you MUST (MUST MUST) use an AC adapter power whenever connecting the camera to the computer to transfer pics etc.  This is NOT included with the camera.  So - add about $30 to the price of this camera pretty much since you must buy this \"accessory\" :) (The camera is STILL WORTH IT).<br />I used my camera to take a full week of pictures in an extremely dim lit setting (halloween theme week).  (...))<br />Yes - another tip:  In really really dim lit settings (almost dark) your camera might give the \"red\" sign (meaning it's not focused) - take the pic anyway (all mine came out in focus when this happened to me)<br />The camera is great - I'm very glad I purchased it!!"]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE S414","amazon_reviews":["Camera works perfect.","This is a great little camera if you can tolerate regular battery changing.

I purchased it because it has a very nice lens for a camera in this price range (I paid $159 last year).  It also has a metal body (most in this range are plastic).<br /><br />BUT, (and this is the reason I'm writing this review at all)- the tripod mount makes it utterly useless!  I had seen comments about the poorly placed tripod mount- and must say that's something of an understatement.  The mount is way off to the side, so if you try to  use a small tripod, it falls over!!!  The focal distance on macro is also pretty unsatisfactory.  Now, if this was a compact camera (hence something I'd use for travel, or just to have an on-hand camera) these shortcomings could be overlooked...but why bother with the bulk if it doesn't give you a large zoom, or compatable lenses, or the ability to use a tripod?<br /><br />All that said, I'm not sure what the audience is for this camera.  The features which would recommend it are in my review title: sold build, nice lens, low price point.<br /><br />the engineering leaves something to be desired.","GOOD CAMERA COMPARED TO OTHERS ON THE MARKET AT THE TIME I BOUGHT IT.

Battery life, even with rechargables, is dismal. I often turn off the viewer to save energy. Always carry spares.<br /><br />2. The camera is bulky and heavy compared to the many lighter cameras you can buy. The 4 batteries add a lot of weight.<br /><br />3. The software it comes with is pretty useless.<br /><br />4. I've gotten a \"card error\" on the camera several times.  The instructions don't tell you what it is or how to fix it. I bought another memory card thinking I had somehow ruined the one I had.

The lack of help from the manual was frustrating.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />If you don't mind the size and weight (including carrying extra batteries - you'll need 'em!), it's worth it for the picture quality.","Camera works perfect.","This is a great little camera if you can tolerate regular battery changing.

Can't beat the price, and appears to withstand punishment; no bumps or bruises.","I bought this camera about a year ago (and am now looking to replace it).  I purchased it because it has a very nice lens for a camera in this price range (I paid $159 last year).  It also has a metal body (most in this range are plastic).<br /><br />BUT, (and this is the reason I'm writing this review at all)- the tripod mount makes it utterly useless!  I had seen comments about the poorly placed tripod mount- and must say that's something of an understatement.  The mount is way off to the side, so if you try to  use a small tripod, it falls over!!!  The focal distance on macro is also pretty unsatisfactory.  Now, if this was a compact camera (hence something I'd use for travel, or just to have an on-hand camera) these shortcomings could be overlooked...but why bother with the bulk if it doesn't give you a large zoom, or compatable lenses, or the ability to use a tripod?<br /><br />All that said, I'm not sure what the audience is for this camera.  The features which would recommend it are in my review title: sold build, nice lens, low price point.<br /><br />the engineering leaves something to be desired.","GOOD CAMERA COMPARED TO OTHERS ON THE MARKET AT THE TIME I BOUGHT IT. TAKES GREAT PIC'S, MY SISTER BOUGHT THE HP AND MINE TAKES BETTER QUALITY PICTURES. ALTHOUGH MY NEXT CAMERA WILL BE ALOT SMALLER. I LOVE THIS ONE!","This was my 1st digital camera, purchased in 2004. I've been happy with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The picture quality I've gotten is astounding. Very clear and colorful. Easy to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Battery life, even with rechargables, is dismal. I often turn off the viewer to save energy. Always carry spares.<br /><br />2. The camera is bulky and heavy compared to the many lighter cameras you can buy. The 4 batteries add a lot of weight.<br /><br />3. The software it comes with is pretty useless.<br /><br />4. I've gotten a \"card error\" on the camera several times.  The instructions don't tell you what it is or how to fix it. I bought another memory card thinking I had somehow ruined the one I had. After a lot of time trying to figure it out, and wasted money on a second card, it turned out to be a memory issue that needed to be rectified by using the camera hooked up to the computer.  The lack of help from the manual was frustrating.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />If you don't mind the size and weight (including carrying extra batteries - you'll need 'em!), it's worth it for the picture quality.","I received a  Minolta digital camera for Christmas, 2004, I mailed in my warranty card,<br /><br />Five months later, I go to use the camera and it says that it cannot read my card, I then remove the card, and see that the pin inside the camera has broken off into the memory card. It is useless.  I am relieved to know I have a one year warranty.  Much to my dismay, after paying $10 to ship my camera to Konica/Minolta, I am told that they will not cover the warranty due to 'mishandling'.  There is but one way to insert the card, and I have handled it with great care.  I spoke with a 'senior technician, who tells me everything he can to try and make me at fault.<br /><br />First he says that my Viking brand memory card is generic, then he says that the model camera I have is no longer made, then he says that I must have bought it refurbished.  None of this is accurate.  I INCLUDED THE ORIGINAL RECEIPT WITH THE RETURN OF THE CAMERA.<br /><br />It was purchased new, and Viking is a common well known brand.<br /><br />I feel Konica/Minolta is doing everything they can to NOT stand behind their warranty!  They want to charge me as much to fix a five month old camera as it took to purchase it. I did love the pictures this camera took, I am so disappointed they would not stand behind their warranty.","I won't repeat what dozens of other reviewers have said. I'm a professional photographer of fifteen years, and I look at things as they are..not as what people thought they should be.<br /><br />1. This is a point and shoot. You will not get professional results from a point and shoot, whether it's 1 megapixel or 10 megapixels. The CCD sensor does not make the photo, the LENS makes the photo.<br /><br />2. Autofucus on a point and shoot digital will always be substandard to an SLR. Smaller lens, less light, more \"hunt and peck\" for focusing. You can always cheat and use \"landscape\" mode.<br /><br />3. Battery life is great; just get a set of 2500mAh rechargeables, and you are good for days!<br /><br />4. 8x10's from this camera are decent; good enough to please your grandma, anyway. If you want fabulous 8x10's, you need to either stick with film, or get a digital SLR.<br /><br />5. Of course there are deviations in color cast and noise at higher resolutions. If you want to see even MORE of this, get a 6  or 8 megapixel point and shoot camera!<br /><br />6. Finally, if you are a consumer who wants a great little digital camera to take family photos on vacations, picnics, and visits to relatives, you can't go wrong with this camera. If you want professional results, why are you looking at a point and shoot, anyway?<br /><br />Think about it. ;)","I had this camera for about a year before I decided to sell it. It's fairly simple to use but even after figuring it out there just seems to be too many submenus to go through just to change one setting. So if you need to change the setting to capture the picture you want at the right moment, you better have fast hands/fingers. Battery life is pretty typical.. not very good. For me, the camera is pretty large for being considered a point-and-shoot (I believe it is, but not sure) and not an SLR, but it really depends on what you consider small/large. It comes with a neck strap that connects to both ends of the camera, so that may say something about the size. It's not very portable and it can feel quite heavy after it's been hanging from your neck for awhile. Also, having a pop-off/-on lens cover can cause you to become a bit clumsy when you're in a rush to take a picture or to re-cover it. Again, it depends on what you plan to use the camera for. In my case, it wasn't quite what I wanted in the end. However, I can't say that I had any complaints about the quality of the pictures.","This camera is extremely well-built and takes excellent photos. People who post otherwise aren't using the camera with optimal settings.  The only flaw in the camera is that it very occasionally has an out of focus shot.  Here are tips to use this camera correctly.<br /><br />1) Turn off all sounds on the custom1 menu of the setup mode and while your at it set the LCDbrightness setting to 3 under the basic menu.  A set of 2300mAh rechargable batteries will last approx. 200 shots (say 100 with flash) if all sounds (shutter, warning etc.) are turned off.  Otherwise you'll only get 50 or so.<br /><br />2)  Only use manual mode.  Automatic mode tries to guess what object you are focusing on and sometimes guesses wrong.  I use spot metering.  In manual mode you set the focus to be the object in the center of the frame, lock the focus by holding the button down half-way, move the camera to frame the shot as you wish and then press the button down the remaining bit to take a shot --- just like every other camera I've used in the last 20 years.  It's unlikely that you would ever want auto mode anyway.  Manual mode uses reasonable default settings and you can change them if you wish, unlike auto mode.<br /><br />3) If lighting is a bit strange, use the manual white-balance feature.  It works even if you are using flash.<br /><br />I have taken several thousand pictures with this camera over the past year and am very impressed with the quality of the lens and the sensor.  If you go to steves-digicams.com and imaging-resource.com and compare the photos taken by this camera with other 4mp cameras you'll see what I mean.  It beats up on some 5mp and 6mp cameras as well.","I have had this camera since the begining of this year.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) This camera is loaded with features; especially for the price.<br /><br />2) The picture quality is excellent<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) Agree it can eat regular AA batteries<br /><br />2) Can be slow to focus<br /><br />3) Can be slow to write to card; but can be helped with a faster<br /><br />card;  I use the Sandisk Ultra II<br /><br />4) The mode dial on top; if not careful can turn on the camera.<br /><br />This camera is heavier than the newer cameras.<br /><br />The number of great pictures taken with this camera far out way the small number of bad.  I will not give up this camera.<br /><br />Yes, you have to be patient with this one but it will give you back great pictures.","I am using it for photos and for some video capturing instead of my camcorder. Great pictures.<br /><br />I had a problem with ordinary batteries life. But I read the recommendation to use rechargeable batteries and since then I am using rechargeable batteries which last very long time.","I just bought this camera (Sept 04), and was I surprised to see a pack of 1400 NiMh batteries and a charger included in the same package.  Yeah, they might not be as good as better ones, but at least they were included to get you started in the right direction...<br /><br />So if you were like me and ordered the camera and then also bought a charger and batteries, you might wait to see if you get the goodies in the same package, first!<br /><br />I haven't had much time to play with the camera yet, but so far so good.","I have had this camera for 8 months, and I am very pleased with it's performance.  The photos are sharp and the colors are vivid. When using the TIFF format the pictures appear sharper. It will take 28 sec. for the photo to load after the shutter closes. Pictures taken in this format can range from 10 - 12mbs' in size. You will find yourself waiting almost a half of a minute. So be patient, it's not the cameras fault. Since I've had the S414, my 35mm SLR sits in a box. Before you criticize this camera, take time to get familiar with it, especially if this is your first digital camera. Otherwise you really will be disappointed! You will not be able to see all the good features of this camera. Take some time to take a few practice shots (trying different settings), if they're bad you can always delete them and start over. That's the beauty of digital cameras. Don't depend on the AA alkaline batteries supplied with the S414, they won't last for more than 1-2 shots. You may want to buy a Compact Flash  reader for loading your pictures to your computer. Loading them direct from the camera will eat your batteries! Buy a good quality set of Nickel Metal Hydrides' (2000 or 2100 mAh are good) This will help your battery problem. Do your homework by reading the manual first. You can't expect miracles the first time with any camera. All in all, with a feel of solidness and the S414s' features, this camera is a great buy for the money!","I have 3 digital cameras and this is the last one I purchased.<br /><br />I really like this camera. It does use alot of batteries but<br /><br />all of them do. Just buy a charger. It takes excellent<br /><br />pictures.","I bought this camera from amazon for $210 after 1 week drops it's price to $199, I have e-mailed to amazon.com,woww!! they have refunded $10 to my account,Amazon.com is the best customer service,GREAT AMAZON.<br /><br />Regarding camera, woww!!! this is the wonderfull camera for this price I won a 3.2 Fugi digital camera, the picture quality of this far superior, defintely i would recommend for any one.In my opinion all digital camera's are battery eaters,so get a energizer NIMH battery(8 batteries) with charger from sam's and it works great and will save $$$.<br /><br />The manual features are great and flash is very decent for night photo's, you must use VIVID color feature of this camera in sunlight for uniform color saturation.<br /><br />The lens and zoom of this camera is top class for this price and picture quality is awesome.<br /><br />pros<br /><br />1.Picture Quality<br /><br />2.Great price<br /><br />3.CF storage<br /><br />4.Regid body(bit bulky but solid)<br /><br />cons<br /><br />1.slow shutter release<br /><br />2.plastic battery and CF door, carefull while handling<br /><br />3.awkeward tripoid position<br /><br />4.lens cap not a part of camera","I bought this camera because it saved in TIFF format, had 4x optical zoom and uses Compact Flash and the price was reasonable at $200. It came with NiMH batteries and charger which was a surprise. Overall I am very satisfied with this camera and recommend it to all but the very discerning. You get a lot for the buck. There are some drawbacks that are livable to me.<br />Pros:<br />1.Saves in TIFF format (I keep the size down, so I get 1 picture per 4MB of card)<br />2.4x optical zoom (I disabled the digital zoom)<br />3.Uses inexpensive compact flash<br />4.Takes quality images in AF and Macro mode.<br />5.OK batteries useage(I bought 2200mAh which take 80 pictures per charge, more at lower resolution).<br />Cons:<br />1.Heavy and bulky.<br />2.Tripod mount off center.<br />3.Focus OK indoors, diificult outdoors, resulting in some blurry images in the sun. Shade is not a problemNeeds a focus shade.<br />4.Overall color OK. could be better.<br />I use Photoshop to crop and color correct almost every image. I usually don't have to color correct images taken with this camera, like I did with my Kodak 280 so I am very please with that. The Outdoor shots in full sun can be a problem. I bought my daughter a SONY Cyber-shot, 2MP and no zoom. It is a basic camera that is wonderful. Light weight & easy to use, fits in shirt pocket and takes excellent images. It makes a great companion to the Minolta S414.","Pay 199, new. cheapest 4MB and 4x optical I found, so what you get.<br />I own a Olympus D-380 too (for 2 years). Focus free and 2 MB. Sometimes I prefer the 380, it doesn't eat so fast the batteries.<br />(but 380 gets sometimes wear little white rounds spots with pictures taken with flash at night, sometime too many).<br />The Minolta is clean in that way. Heavy camera, good features at menus.<br />Pictures with flash are fine at night. Pictures at day too blue, not good auto white. Sometimes better do it manual.<br />CONS:<br />- eats a  lot of baterry<br />- color quality is not I aspect. much better is Olympus. Color quality is similar to HP products (2002-03) kind of dark.<br />- most of cons of previews reviewers are true.<br />PROS<br />-Price and 4x optical","I got this camera for an amazing deal in the first place, only $200 dollars, and it came with a nice pacakge from Ritz Camera, a nice software and digi prints and camera classes (18 of them!).  The camera came with some alkalines, but I was suprised to find a little box that contained a charger and 4 NiMH batteries!  I think that Minolta got the idea that the battery problem was a big one, so they threw in some batteries.  I love the camera, its big enough to hold without me feeling like its gonna slip out of my hands.  Only thing I really reccomend is get a nice camera bag and definitely a bigger CF card, as the 16MB one that comes with the camera is way too small.","have used it frequently for about 10 months. here are some pros and cons:<br />PROs:<br />- price/value (mostly the manual functions)<br />- nice lens (sometimes very little chromatic aberration)<br />- some pictures are really nice<br />- not very slow operation (i really have no comparison)<br />- uses CF - cheap, good and popular<br />CONs:<br />- baterry eater<br />- terrible noise at higher ISOs. 400 is almost useless<br />- poor and wrongly-located microphone<br />- needs very good light for movie mode<br />- no zoom/focus/white balance control in movie mode<br />- poor auto white balance (not good for flash) - it's not really \"auto\"-it's fixed<br />- poor image processing - \"auto levels\" in photoshop is a must with most shots<br />- pictures often a bit greenish or yellowish - \"auto color\" in PS solves it quickly<br />- hangs up sometimes (but my girlfriend's doesn't) - have to take out the batteries and loses last shot<br />- not very good flash<br />- fixed zoom at macro<br />- macro min. distance is too big<br />- often indicates good focus in macro mode, although object is too close<br />- poor low-light focus, no low-light AF assist lamp<br />- optical viewfinder's view differs much from the lcd<br />- tripod mount is on the left side, while heavy batteries are on the right<br />- AC adapter too expencive. it's better to buy 2 sets of good rechargables and a CF card reader (USB 1.1 on the reader is much MUCH faster than on the camera!)<br />well, in the PROs I could write every useful function, so it would be really 50-50, but you find it in the specs :)<br />If your not too ambitious, this cam is not bad. I liked it first, than (through it's possibilities) became an ambitious amateur and need to change it for a higher-shelf one...","I love this camera, I bought it about 9 months ago and have taken it all around Europe traveling and snapping photos.  It takes great pics, day or night and I'm only using it as point and click (my daughter gets the same results and she's 10).  The movies come out nice too and it's very easy to use.  The only drawback it has is the dial button for the camera option, since that also turns on the camera I have had it turn on when I carry with just the shoulder strap.  The camera will bump my side and accidentally get 'dialed' on.  Best bet is to keep it in a camera case.  I would easily buy this camera again and would recommend it to my friends (with the caution about the ease of the dial button coming on, which is the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars).","alot of these people are complaining about the batteries they use most likely becuase they buy cheap batteries. i bought a 4 pack of monster 2000 batteries with a charger. with these batteries mine will last for a week taking around 20 pictures a day, thats witht the lcd on and flash and reviewing. the batteries w/ charger cost me 40, which is alot less than most people spent on a memory card upgrade. which i get by fine on the 16MB card, fine res gets you 32 pictures. the battery door is a little fragile WHEN ITS OPEN, closed its solid as a rock. i take my s414 to rock/punk shows with mosh pits, lets just say ive beaten the living daylights out of this camera and its done nothing but give great high quality pics. having a metal case definatly makes it more sturdy. the 4x zoom was great at the flogging molly show last night and the quality is so good i can almost smell the sweat dripping off the guitarists hands, the digital zoom is also very good *as long as you set it for high quality* but i rarely use it. the difficulty most people have with back lit/dark/bright situations is due to unfamiliarity with the camera, read the manual. ive never had the memory card door pop open either. the only thing i dont like about the camera is that it wont fit in my pants *i wear 4$$ graber pants so nothing ever fits in my pockets* and it didnt come with a case, i got a really nice case at circuit city for 10 bucks. finally, i bought this brand new, with box, warrenty card etc.. from a friend of mine for extremly cheap. ive had this camera for a while - im only writing this review because of all the negative reviews it got on amazon.","This is a great camera for a good price.  It does just about anything I could ask of it.  If I had 2 point out flaws they would only be the odd lense thread side and the microphone mounted on top of the camera where you tend to put your finger over it.  I have no problem with battery life when using high Ma rechargables and I let an photographer friend of mine loose with it and the picture were great.  I didn't see any issues with color or exposure.","We wanted a simple digital camera which it sort of is but images not of the sharpest quality. Camera is easy to navigate and layout of controls comfortable. You need to invest in rechargable batteries because the camera eats them up. And camera is easily accidentally turned on. Pictures too often come out blurry. Without flash pictures a little too dark but with flash they were washed out.","I bought this camera a few months back. I am big on 35mm (Nikon) and had an old Sony. Never convinced to go digital, I settled for this camera because of the average definition and price. Also, one of the few with 4x optical zoom.<br />I used my camera mostly for work but on a recent trip to Europe I brought it with me. The results are stunning. I am now a complete believer on digital photography.<br />I think the color and saturation of the pics are perfect and the camera is easy to use. I can correct exposure very easily (for night shots). Posted the results, but in lower definition, at the following link:<br />[...]<br />Definetively worth the money, this camera will give you plenty of satisfaction.","Now I have this camera for about 6 month. It was a gift for my wife since I preferred camcorders. But lately my camcorder stays at home while I'm looking around with this camera for the perfect motive. After about 5.000 shots I rate this product as follows:<br />Pro<br />* uses AA: You get `em everywhere and the rechargeable NiMH are inexpensive. ( No hidden cost in sometimes very spendy special batteries other manufactures use).<br />* the same about the Compact Flash Card. Here you get the best bang (MB)for the buck among all Flash Memory. (Go and compare XD or Sony Memory stick...).<br />* 4x optical is no standard in this price class<br />* solid metal body<br />* fast internal memory enables this camera to take 5-7 consecutive shots - very fast. After that it takes about 20 sec. until the camera is ready to shoot again.<br />* has Aperture priority, Shutter prior., and Manual. Manual conrols Shutter, Aperture, ISO, and you can focus if you want. Maybe I should mention this under Cons, but I mainly use the Manual mode since I feel that the Automatic mode often doesn't get the right setting.<br />* good Macro, gets you up to about 6inches from the object. I came to realize that getting close the autofocus is often inaccurate and so I swithc to manual focusing.<br />* with 4 Mb you can magnify and still keep impressiv detail.<br />* I love the LCD not only for \"what you see is what you get\" but also for it very helpfull impression how the exposure of the picture will look like.<br />* I used to have a SLR and couldn't shoot slower than 1/60 in my hand. With this one I was able to get very nice 1/15 out of my hand.<br />* produces clear and lively colors - I prefer the Vivid color mode.<br />Cons:<br />* The camera turns itself on when you push it into the bag. I learned to avoid this problem by pushing it into the bag with the wider side of the camera (battery compartment) first. That way the mode wheel will be turned towards the OFF position, and ON when you pull it out of the bag which isn't really a problem.<br />Unless you don't use this trick you will turn the camera accidently ON while it is in the bag. The camera tries to extract the lenses and it hangs up. To get it running again you have to open the battery compartment which will reset the camera.<br />* when I download the pictures on my PC (XP) I'm using the standard picture watching tool in the explorer. This tool gives you the option to turn pictures vertically. This will erase the information about how the picture was taken in the software that came with this camera, the DimageViewer. Very often the Dimage Viewer hangs up when I try to open a folder, with pictures turned vertically. This problem occured on all 3 of my PCs. Migth as well be a problem of XP, but just that you know what might affect your Dimager Viewer.<br />* The focusing in dim light condition is horrible. The LCD doesn't let you know that the picture is blurry, until you find out later on the PC monitor. Manual focusing helps it.<br />* battery drains in about 1 h, with LCD and permanent autofocus on.<br />* a little bit more clumsy compared to other models.<br />* no possibility to adjust flash / no chance to use flash in closeups, beyond 8 feet it becomes useless. I`m using my fingers in front of the flash light to adjust intensity.<br />* the door from the battery compartment looks somewhat shaky to me but the overall impression is that you have a piece of quality in your hand.<br />A nice Point and Shoot camera. Exceptional value for the money. You will be glad you made this decision.","I really enjoy this camera.  It is easy to use and the downloading of images is easy.  I highly recommend rechargeable batteries.  This camera will suck the life out of regular batteries in minutes.  This camera is great for one who wants quailty and performance, it will last forever.  Be sure to order this camera before the free memory card offer expires.","Positives:<br />1.  It is 4MP and only $350- So a great price for a 4MP digital camera!<br />2.  Great quailty pictures<br />Negatives:<br />1.  The on/off dial easily turns to 'on' when you put it in a camera bag, which means that when you need it most you take it out to find out the batteries are dead!<br />2.  You need to buy good quality rechargable batteries like the monster powerpack because this drains normal batteries only after several photos.<br />3.  The place on the camera where you put the batteries is often difficult to shut properly.<br />Overall it is a good digital camera for the price but because the drawbacks really got to me I returned it.","I know nothing about digital cameras, but bought this one after reading nearly every comment or review written about it from actual users in several forums.  I can see how you might easily pay more for less and more for more, so you really need to determine what you're going to use it for, how often, and what your skill level is.  I think this one is a less for more value.  For the price, the 4MP is excellent.  Unles you are going to be making professional large prints, I don't really think you need anything bigger.  For average printing, this is fine; better than fine for strictly electronic viewing.<br />The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is two-fold:  Manual focus is difficult and I haven't been able to figure it out yet.  And, I can usually figure out anything.  Also, I read a review that said the camera \"loses\" pictures in downloading directly from the camera, but the pictures aren't \"lost\" if you use a card reader.  Darned if that isn't right.  I didn't lose any pictures, but pictures I know I deleted from the camera I found on the card when I used a reader.  I don't find this at all bothersome because I was going to use a reader anyway to both reduce wear on the camera and to occasionally use the card as a jump drive for my PC.<br />I really like the fact that it uses regular AA batteries instead of some odd proprietary battery, so in a pinch you can operate the camera with a quick trip to 7-11, but I can tell you they last for fewer than 20 flashes.  I bought with my camera, and recommend, the Kodak charger with 1850 rechargeable batteries.  I researched that as well, and found most people prefer the Kodak batteries and the charger ramps them up in three hours, and they last a LONG time.  I haven't found it necessary to get a second set of batteries, but it's probably a good idea.  To complete my camera outfit I bought a 256MB card, which will hold over 300 images in standard mode, and 1000 on economy.  You can get by with the included 16MB, but on a vacation, you may never have to download images until you get home with a larger card.<br />I bought a Case Logic leather bag at Sears to stash it all in, and I couldn't be happier.","Its an excellent camera for the price in its range. Lots of positives, however let me list out some few negatives that I can think of :<br />* Battery compartment is little difficult to close (with batteries inside it) and looks a little fragile.<br />* It gets hot around battery region after around 6-7 shots.<br />* In automode outputs noisy image for night landscape (probably because it switches automatically to ISO 400)..However changing to ISO 100 rectifies this.<br />* Drains away the battery quite quickly.<br />* A little on heavier side.<br />* Once in a while it just hangs and needs to be resetted.","Definitely buy a larger memory card.","A solid camera, fairly easy to use (you really need to read the manual for some features), and pretty flexible when you learn how to use the features.  I'm an amatuer photographer, so I'm limited in my price range, but from what I've seen it's a good deal.<br />I did however notice some complaints from other reviews that aren't valid:<br />1 - No shutter priority mode: there actually is, in manual mode.  Necessary for shooting things such as sunsets.<br />2 - Poor functionality in low light: I have taken some great low light/non-flash shots by adjusting the ASA. The quality degrades a little, but that parallels film usage.<br />3 - Short battery life: This can easily be avoided by not using the LCD.  I've shot 120 frames of hi-res at my daughters soccer games on one set of rechargeables.  The LCD is useless in bright sun anyway.<br />Things I like:<br />* Compact size, good feel in the hand<br />* Solid built, the memory card door and battery door on mine are rock solid.<br />* Flexibility - BW, Sepia, Enchanced color, Custom white balance, adjustable ASA, different metering modes, adjustable auto shut off, adjustable playback<br />* Picture quality - I've printed out some great 8 x 10's.<br />* Continuous shooting - very handy at sporting events for capturing action sequences<br />Things I don't like:<br />* Lag time in AutoFocus - takes a while before you hear the little *ding*.  It's easy to push the shutter halfway, watch the lens focus and take the picture before the *ding*, which usually results in an out of focus picture.  I use manual mode for anything that requires a faster response time.<br />* On/off switch is too easily switched on accidently.<br />* Will ocassionally (not too often) lock-up and you need to re-boot by removing the batteries.<br />* Lack of gradual digital zoom<br />* What you see in the viewfinder is slightly zoomed in from what is actually framed in the picture.  Easy to fix in editing, but still...<br />* Video clip functionality - it works OK, but I never use it.  Would rather have a gradual digital zoom.<br />One negative observation - my camera is 6 months old, and the main control button (zoom/select) is getting harder to push in to select something.  Frustrating when I'm flipping through menu settings in a hurry.<br />This has been a good intro to digital photography, but my next camera will have to go up a step to switchable lenses (for a larger zoom) and higher pixel resolution.","Nice camera for those of us who like the 35mm feel. Made of good quality Aluminum. Excellent lens system! Lots of modes for the novice and advanced user. No \"special\" batteries - just AA. If the camera was just a bit faster focusing, it would have been perfect! RC3 remote works well.<br />The old RC3 part number 8782-100 works with this camera as well and costs about half of the current RC-3 remote. It even looks exactly like it.","I received this Minolta camera as a graduation present and it's absolutely WONDERFUL!! I was always skeptical about digital cameras, but this one sure is great! I use it for ALL occasions : parties, casual photos, and even concerts and it works great! The pictures are clear and crisp, not overly grainy or distorted like other digitals. It's a good buy for your money! You won't be dissatisfied! My only recommendation is to buy a bigger memory card as well. The one provided (16MB) will only hold about 10 high-quality pictures. I bought a 256MB card and it can hold HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of pictures and videos, so I recommended getting a better memory card in addition to the camera.","It is a powerful maquina very easy to use, excellent clear photos and shining I had cameras Olympus canon, fuji but dimage s414 is the best one by its quality and price is a very fast maquina and needs suitable for any type of photos .Insufficient memory CF for a camera of 4 Mpixels","I love my new camera the installation was so simple and taking pictures is a snap. Already I have taking some pictures of my daughter the picture came out beautifully.  One word of consion if you are planning to download into a floppy space is too small.  You have 2 options 1 you can burn the pictures onto a dvd-rw/cd-rom/rw.  For those who do not have that option you can purchase a zip drive which is external and it hold more info that a reg 2 hd floppy.","This camera taught me so much about digital photography! I researched features, prices, accessories and customer satisfaction for just about every camera this size (4 MP) and without ever physically holding the camera, purchased the Minolta DiMAGE S414 from Amazon.  The first hard lesson I learned was that this camera barely functions without Monster's Ultra-High Capacity batteries (2000 mAh).  Invest the extra fifty bucks for a set of four rechargeable Monsters and the rapid charger and you will be so glad you did.  I upgraded to a 256MB CF card for seventy bucks and will never fill the thing to its capacity, even on a week-long vacation.  My husband is a novice to digital photography, but took to the DiMAGE like a fish to water and is so pleased with the ease-of-use and quality of it.  The photos are spectacular.  We have logged such events as our daughter's first ballet recital, our annual beach vacation, and even 4th of July fireworks with most pleasing results.  We will be taking a trip to the Caribbean in October and while I am hesitant to travel with my new toy, I would be foolish not to take it along.  The colors are crisp, the details *amazing*, and if you take the time to read the short manual and research the features before using the camera, you will be in love with the DiMAGE.  The camera itself is chunky and professional looking, easy to hold and even take one-handed photos if necessary.  The \"movie with sound\" feature is cute, although the files are typically too large for email to the grandparents. I use my DiMAGE in combination with HP's Photosmart 7350, which I found at Staples (refurbished) for under a hundred bucks, and found that HP's printer software compliments the package nicely with automatic photo reduction for email, super easy red-eye removal and very professional quality photos on any type of photo paper (the 4x6's are amazing.)  I have read every review posted about this model camera and with enough detailed research, you can resolve most problems.  Probably not a good camera for the electronically challenged.  I recommend this camera without hesitation.","I bought 3 sets of panasonic rechargeable batteries (1950 mA) from the local warehouse store and they lasted most of a day.  They are an affordable alternative to the monster rechargeable batteries mentioned in other reviews and it seems that 2 sets would have been enough.  I bought a 256mb compact flash card and a sandisk usb card reader.  For all of you new to digital photography (like I am), the camera is pretty much useless until you have purchased all of these.<br />I can say that the camera compares well to my Canon Z135 35mm.  For a digital camera, it is a bit on the large and heavy side, but I'm ok with that.<br />I've found the 60 seconds of movie quite useful (in daytime outdoors and bright light only) especially when I saw dolphins in the ocean.  I couldn't get a still shot because I never knew when the dolphins would go above water, so at least I was able to get a clip.<br />Also, I was unable to get a shot in medium light (indoor pool) conditions, (using the flash, the subject was fine, but the background wasn't, without the flash, the background was good, but the subject wasn't, using the fill flash was slightly better) but I'm not sure my Canon would have got the picture any better.<br />I've found the camera to do very well, for indoor portraits and outdoor (bright sun) landscapes.<br />I'm not happy with the date stamp feature, because it removes part of the picture (maybe there is a setting to change the way it puts the date stamp?)<br />I also don't like the way it does red eye reduction.  It does 3 flashes, and the third is when the picture is actually taken, but after the first (no matter how many times you tell them) the subject believes that the shot was taken and stops posing.<br />Digital photography is great for beginners because you can immediately see what you are doing wrong and correct it.","After reading all the wonderful reviews from various websites and here, I bought the S414 and how disappointing...<br />1. Terrible focusing.  In autofocus mode, about 30% of the photos come out to be somewhat fuzzy.  I did everything according to the manual, even using the focus rectangles but the pictures still come out unfocused.  This happens both indoor and outdoor.  Maual focusing is even worse.  You need to view the image on the LCD screen for manual focusing.  Since the screen is small, it is very difficult to determine if the image is focused.  Under the sun, you can hardly see images on the LCD screen, so manual focusing is nearly impossible.<br />2. Picture quality is not acceptable.  The pictures are often flat and unlively.  Colors are not as vivid as I would hope.  The date stamp makes the picture looks very unprofessional, since it looks like a large white label instead of having just numeric values.  The numbers show up as blocks instead of having smooth edges.<br />3. Bulky and heavy.  The size and weight of this camera makes it really difficult to carry around.  In order to carry this, I have the wrap it around my neck, making it really difficult to do anything else without it pounding against my chest.<br />4. Boot up time is long.  I had missed a few good pictures simply because it takes longer for this camera to boot up than it takes others.<br />5. Definitely not a point-and-shoot.  This camera is not meant to used as a point-and-shoot camera.  It takes way to long to boot and focus.  By the time you're ready to take a picture, you would've missed the shot.  Not really suitable for people who want to capture spontaneous shots.<br />6. Overdone flash.  The flash cannot seem to readjust for different objects.  It's too bright even for subjects that are upto 2 feet from the lens.  Many of my pictues end up being too bright and unfixable even using the bundled software.  At times, the flash doesn't even come on when there is backlight.  I guess most cameras have flash that don't, but my Canon S230 and Kodak DX4900 does adjust to accomodate so I get great pictures even when there is backlight.<br />7. Odd size lens.  The len's diameter is at an odd 35.5mm.  It is very difficult to find anyone carrying filters of this size cheap.  You may want to consider this if you intend to use any filters for this camera.<br />In my opinion, this camera is over-rated.  Although the price is quite affordable for a 4MP and 4X zoom camera, I would rather pay a bit extra to own a 3.2MP/2X zoom Canon.  The picture quality of the Canon S230 I own, which has 3.2MP, is way better than this camera.  The fact that I can focus 90% of the time with my S230 makes it much better than the S414, not to mention the size difference.  If you're not looking to print pictures greater than 11\"x14\", a 3.2MP is more than sufficient.  One important factor is that my S230 is Made in Japan.  The S414 is Made in China.  From my previous experiences with numerous electronic, gadgets that are Made in Japan are far far better in quality than those made in China.  Hope this will help you make a more informed decision.","I've had this camera for less than a week, and I wish I'd bought it sooner. I can't complain about the image quality or ease of use, but I do have three nitpicky items that keep me from giving it five stars.<br /><br /> The control wheel, which lets you turn the camera on, change from auto to manual mode, and so on, is too easily moved from the 'off' position by accident. This is something I read in another online review while researching cameras, so it wasn't entirely unexpected, but still a little bit irksome. That being said, there is a 'power save' setting you can adjust which will turn the camera off after a period of inactivity.<br /><br /> The lens cap, which I've been careful to snap into place each time i finish shooting, seems to be either difficult to secure completely, or snaps off easily. This could be a case of operator error, but it's something to be aware of.<br /><br /> My last gripe is the difficulty I've had in finding an AC adapter for the camera. In the manual, the liste","This is my first digital camera ever.  I had been putting off the purchase for a long time because I knew nothing about digital cameras and I was afraid of the learning curve.  This camera is really easy to operate and retrieve pictures from.  However it chews through batteries at an alarming rate and the Minolta accessories are {spendy}.","This is a perfect camara with perfect image quality and rockbottom price around three hundred dollars with deals. How ever the batteries that came with the camara drained off in 2 min. Also, I dont like the sound it makes while the camara zooms in and out, sounds as if the motor inside is grinding some thing. I would also have liked a webcam functionality, which it lacks. Also, the digital zoom is pathetic, don't expect to use it. The screen goes blank for a second and the zoomed picture comes up. Continuous digital zoom whould have been nice.<br />Now that functionality that I like, microphone with movie capture, connect to tv and play pics and movies, picture quality which is the most important thing, easy interface and manual settings for picture capture.","This camera's sweet!  The menu display is easy to figure out, although I wish it was illuminated.  It's both a manual and automatic camera, so those folks who are into photography will be happy with its versatlility.  The only real downside is that it's very hard to open and close the battery compartment, and it eats traditional AA batteries for lunch.  Go with NIHI batteries instead.  It's small enough to fit in a purse or bag, but large enough that it's easy to handle.  I feel some of the digital cameras out there are way too small for comfort.","At Amazon's price this camera can't be matched.<br />I read the other reviews, one of them complained about low light use. This has not been a problem for me.<br />It does have plastic doors on a metallic body; but this too is a good design: it prevents electrical shorts.<br />The software is very good too with a strong editing and pic info panel. It loads fast, just like the camera.<br />I was a little puzzled why the camera isn't widely marketed.<br />That is a Minolta problem.<br />Thanks Amazon!<br />S.E","This is my first digital camera and we love it.  After months of research, I finally decided on the S414.  It has been great.  The pics are super clear, and we love the easy to use movie feature (which doesn't take up much space on the flash card).  The outdoor pictures are definately the best.<br />The only problem I have noticed is some red eye with indoor shots, especially if it's dark in the room. That can be fixed in Adobe though, so it's a minor prob for us.<br />I would definately recommend.","I remain very happy with the S414. In fact, I have sold or given away almost all my other digicams. The one problem area with this Minolta had been its heavy battery use, but since I switched to 2,000 mAmp Monster batteries, this has become much less of an issue. I append my original review below:<br />**************************************************************** This is about my 12th digital camera, and in general each one gets better in several ways as the technology expands. This one takes the place of a Sony P72 which I bought for about the same amount of money 8 months ago. However, the Minolta brings several higher end features to the table, including a 4 megapixel resolution (great clarity in poster-sized enlargements possible) and a true, 4X optical zoom, which was my main reason for upgrading. However, the icing on the cake, it turns out, is the 414's faster CPU, allowing it to wake up quickly and to write and recover faster btwn shots. In fact, it is so quick that it allows for continuous shooting of digital stills at 0.8 second intervals until either the battery is exhausted or the memory card is full. Likewise, it takes fairly good quality video *with* sound, as well as allowing for voice over of still images. The controls are logical, intuitive and clearly marked, the thru-the-lens framing is bright and easy to use, and playback on the 1.8\" LCD is clear even in bright haze. Even the synthesized camera-like sound effects are good; they are a pleasing means of non-visual feedback to the user. Of course, it's a camera, so the quality of the photographs is what really counts, and here I can say the Minolta optics are superb, easily trouncing the Sony & Olympus cams I've been using of late. Battery life has not been an issue for me, weight and balance are okay, and even the non-integral (but tethered) lens cap hasn't bothered me. It does, of course, need a much larger memory card right away; with a 256MB CF card I'm getting about 120 shots at the highest resolution.<br />In short, this is an amazing camera at a very good price.","In general, this camera is good at feature and value. But one caveat is very bothersome. The viewfinder and LCD were not sealed well by the manufacture and the dust was accumulated underneath after 10 days use. I got a replacement for this problem. But new one seems to have the same problem.","In general, this camera is good at feature and value. But one caveat is very bothersome. The viewfinder and LCD were not sealed well by the manufacture and the dust was accumulated underneath after 10 days use and blur the view. I got a replacement for this problem. But the new one seems to have the same problem.","Love this camera, and the pictures come out great on our Canon S-820 with glossy 4x6 paper.<br />Two complaints:<br />1. Delay between pressing the button all the way down (after pushing half-way for AF) and the actual snapshot can be slow at times, and makes quick snaps harder.  Maybe I'll try more manual mode shooting to solve this...<br />2. Battery muncher.  I keep two sets of 4 AA 1800+ mA batteries handy since it chews through them quickly. I'm not sure if using the LCD less would make a big improvement, but that's my next test.<br />Overall, easy to use, lots of manual features for the more serious photo jock, and a great bargain for a quality DC.","I purchased the Minolta s414 while on route to England, to augment my Olympus D450 since digital is less costly than film. We took 700 pictures between the two digital cameras and the Minolta was a dream to use. I also purchased a 128 Meg card to enhance the storage. When I first used the camera I was instantly impressed with the photos, clarity and color. I was a bit dismayed with the battery life (Duracell & Kodak Alkaline)  but soon RTFM and figured out how to make them last longer. Now with some 1800 mAh Ni-MH rechargeable batteries we are cooking with gas. The camera is light compared to my SLR’s and takes comparable pictures. I would purchase another.","I like the rating 4.5 stars, instead of whole numbers (I chose 4). I've had it now for about 2 months. When you consider the price, its performance capabilities and 4 megapixels, it is clearly the best buy.<br />What do I think of it?  I'm going to buy another one for a member of the family.  One caveat is that you do need 2 sets of metal halide AA batteries.","I researched digital cameras for several months to find THE one for me, a digicamaphobe.  THE camera is - the does it all AND at a reasonbable price - Minolta s414.<br />I considered Canons, the G2, the Elph s230, various Olympus cams, and the easy,cheesy Sony.  The elph was easy to use, but small, awkward, and distance shots were blurry and pixilated. I tried a friend's Olympus, but it was kind of complicated for me, downloading seemed a pain...My sis emailed me Sony pics she took, but the quality wasn't there...In April, while shopping, a friend pointed out the Minolta s414, 4 megapixels and 4 times zoom with movie and sound. So, I researched it...From reviews and info about the s414 I learned it was truly awesome with options galore.  Additionally it was considered \"user friendly\"... I showed my boyfriend the info I'd found...An amateur photographer, he'd had never thought digicams could produce the quality of his NIKON, but he was impressed with the research I showed him; so he bought one.  He was immediately blown away with the quality from the moment he started using it.  His first macro shot of flowers with the s414 convinced him to set aside his Nikon.  Then he had me try he camera...and had trouble wresting it away from me, because the Minolta s414 REALLY IS USER FRIENDLY.<br />I had to have the s414, and we went to buy mine...In addition to \"user friendly\",  we found \"sold out\" at three stores... At the fourth stop, we bought the demo... along with rechargeable batteries, a 256 picture card and card reader...<br />Sunday, June 8, armed with our s414s, my boyfriend and I went to a dance recital and took some stupendous pictures in sepia and black and white as well as color ...EASY. ..After downloading the pics, we were amazed as we zoomed in on an eye to see the outline of my daughter taking the picture  was reflected in the pupil!!! I took 100 pictures and made three quick films, plus reviewed and downloaded the pics before needing to recharge the batteries...Now how awesome is that?  This camera RULES...","This camera feels, operates and shoots like an expensive camera for a very low price.  I never imagined it would have this many manual adjustments and still be able to point and shoot for the non-pro.  For my multi settings mode I keep it on black and white and then can switch on the fly.  The macro is good, yet doesn't zoom.  The settings and options menus are easily learned and to navigate.  The CPU flies.  The flash is strong and far-reaching.  The LCD is a little small but the camera is a little bulky so who knows what it could have been with a giant LCD.  It would not accept my 128MB flash card so that was a disappointment.  The manual just tells that if the error message appears that you can't use the card.  I can't say as of yet why.  But I would warn against buying older CF.  I really think this product is great overall and I bought one for my friends and they are leaping with joy.  Do yourself a favor and go to where it is being sold and get it in your hand and see if you can handle its size and feel.  If so, you have in your hand a really full-featured camera for the price.","I bought the S414 a week ago.  Overall, I am happy with the camera.  I like the \"no shutter lag\" the best.  I also have a F-100 and I find the two hard to compare.  While the F-100 takes crisper and more life like pictures, the shutter lag (about 2 secs) is a damper.<br />I am quite disappointed with the S414's picture quality.  The \"auto\" white balance feature in S414 is severely lacking.  Under indoor lighting, the camera takes pics that have a slight, but discernable yellowish tinge.  I have to tweek the white balance (manual mode) to the right light conditions to get comparable quality pics with the F100 (doesn't work all the time).<br />The video quality in S414 definitely gets more points than the F100.  Overall, I think it's a decent value for the money.  But if you do have a choice between buying either the F100 or the S414, close thy eyes and grab the F100.","This is the first Digital Camera we have bought. We did extensive research before purchasing the DImage S414. It is a super camera. The pictures have been super and the ease of use of the camera is most welcome. We just took it on a trip to California and captured some of the best pictures ever.  You do need to upgrade the CF card, 16 mb is too small. I would suggest the Monster 2000 rechargeable batteries and you will definitely benefit by purchasing a Compact Card reader. No complaints about this camera at all.","The camera eats alkaline batteries, so buy a charger and batteries like the Monster Power Cells (I have two sets of batteries).  These batteries will keep the camera going a long time after you would use up a few sets of alkaline batteries (or regular Duracell batteries).<br />The camera only comes with a 16 meg memory card.  I bought a Viking 256 meg card that can store from 20 to 800+ images depending on the image size and quality. I also purchased a memory reader which makes managing photos easy.  I am using Windows 98, and the camera, card reader and memory cards are all working flawlessly.  The connection is via the usb port, and I had to install the driver (a couple minutes) for the card reader.  I did not install the Minolta cd, I already have some freeware to manage image files. I also bought a small camera case.  The Tamrac 5694 works well.  It is about 1.5 inches too deep, but otherwise snug.  It accomodates the camera, Monster Power Cell charger and an extra card.  It will attach to a belt, or over the shoulder with a detachable shoulder strap.<br />My \"package\" was as follows:<br />Minolta Dimage S414  $349.00<br />Viking Intelliflash 6 in 1 USB flash Memory Reader  $26.99<br />Viking 256 MB CompactFlash Card  $56.99<br />Monster Cable Ultra High Capacity Power pack<br />(charger with 4 NiMH batteries)  $39.84<br />Set of extra Monster NiMH batteries  $19.95<br />Camera case  $20.00<br />Total  $512.77<br />With other 4-5 MB, 4x zoom Digital cameras selling for $400 - $500+, this seems like a decent deal.  The other cameras will also require an outlay of a few $$ more to make them really \"usable\".<br />The camera takes a good quality image.  It has plenty of useful features for both a snapshot enthusiast, or serious hobbyist.  I fall into the serious hobbyist catagory.  I like the manual mode and macro options among other things.","I have owned two other digital cameras, this was to be a replacement for a dead 3.2MP Casio QV300EX. I am a point-and-shooter primarily, but like to have the controls when I feel creative. If all you want is an auto setting camera, you can do much worse. However, if you are at all interested in manual control, look elsewhere!<br />The bad:<br />1. Only two aperature settings<br />2. Lens does NOT zoom when in Macro mode<br />3. In manual mode, the LCD does NOT display the focus. The user is expected to view the focus as a number displayed on the LCD, i.e. 0.6m, etc. This makes it impossible to get the correct focus in manual mode.<br />4. Has problems in low light getting a good focus. My test photos were blury in evening light, the kind of light that makes for some of the best photos. This is probably due to the relatively slow lens.<br />5. Lacks shutter priority mode. Come on!<br />6. Battery door seems fragile and is hard to close. The tabs that lock it into place seem to be stuck when sliding the door, I'm afraid over time they would break.<br />7. Too easily turned-on while in the pocket/bag.<br />The good:<br />1. Solid metal case<br />2. Turns on quickly<br />3. Good battery life<br />4. Good feel in the hands","This is my second digital camera and it represents a significant improvement over the first (HP 215).  I've had the camera about a month now and haven't begun to test the limits f the camera.  My criteria included 3-4 mega pixel, 3-4X optical zoom, reputable manufacturer, a menu system the was easy to navigate and a unit that felt good in the hands.<br />The camera I looked at included the Canon A70, Fuji FinePix 3800 and the Olympus C-4000 all met my basic criteria.  All had the mega pixels and optical zoom I was looking for.  I also wanted a camera that used the more popular media formats (compactflash or smartmedia) for price and availability reasons.  The Canon caused me brief pause because it uses a proprietary battery and I wanted to be able to use AA alkaline batteries if a got caught short on power.<br />These are all camera manufacturers that numerous reviews speak highly of.  I've owned or used a couple of Minolta products (SLRs) in the past and thought they were very good for my purposes.<br />The menu system on the Minolta took a little while to understand but it wasn't bad particularly once I spent a little time working with the camera and the manual in hand.<br />The camera feels good in your hands, which was one of the criteria I had for a camera.  Part of this criteria included the ability to handle the camera in one hand and if need be snap a shot that way.<br />I upgraded the flashcard immediately which I'd recommend to anyone really wanting to use this camera at its limits (the 16MB is only good for 7 shots).  A 256MB card gave me some room to play even a 4MB per shot.<br />The only items that caused me some concern were the stated battery life (from other reviews of other Minolta models) and the software bundle.  On the first item, I really haven't had much to complain about.  I purchased rechargeable NiMH (1800mA) batteries with the camera and they've provided 30-50 shots depending on use (flash, previewing shots etc.).  On the second count I was disappointed but I must admit I didn't go in with high expectation.  Most cameras are sold with limited or LE (light) versions of software.  This Minolta was no exception.  I'm in the process of looking for a good software package (leaning towards Adobe<br />Net, net I think that for the going price ... it was and is one of the best consumer cameras out there with some excellent specifications!","Bought this camera because of features and money. Do you think that it's worth spending over $ for a digital camera in this age of 4 and 5 megapixels? If you are mostly a point and shoot kind of guy with a little bit of manual fun, this is the camera for you. The digital video (small but effective) is an extra that is nice to have but not necessary. The best part about this camera are the beautiful pictures and I mean sharp, sweet, vivid, and that is the kind of thing you cannot compromise in any camera. Perhaps a tad larger than others but you are getting far more than what you pay for in terms of features versus price. Remember who you are and this camera will be your favorite.","It's an Excellent camera for Me and some my friends who bought it with my opinion. This DC has solid built, quick response, excellent zoom (esp. 4x GT optical zoom) and LCD, quick AF.<br />Easy to use, with the option of using advanced features for creativity. Fine and very very sharp images w/better colours.<br />And, of course,  It's a great camera for the money !<br />Very very cheap for high-quality device.","This is one of the best deal that you can ever find as of today, [...] I owned the earlier version S304, and when I came to upgrade it, nothing else came to my mind but the S414. After shopping around, I am convince this is the best 4MP camera you can get for less than [$$$]! The image quality is superb, the metallic casing is solid and looks professional. Very suitable for many scenarios!","The S414 is an excellent choice if you are looking for an all-around awesome camera. A very good fried of mine has the S404 and loves it. I consider myself an advanced photographer that has been fighting off the digital craze. Until now 35mm is had been dear to me but the instant gratification of digital is amazing. I am very happy with the manual settings that let me be creative. The auto setting also takes very good pictures. My 10 year old daughter has no problems in taking nice shots. I would recommend NiMh batteries and at least a 128 meg CF card. I purchased a 256 meg card and at medium setting the card will hold over 400 images. At this price with all the features...well I am very happy!!!","excellent pictures but uses up batteries like crazy.<br /> Nimh batteries a must.<br />Odd size difficult to find suitable case.  Otherwise I love it!","I cannot begin to tell you how impressed everyone was with the pictures I took with this camera. Many have seen digital... but this is something else. And for under [money]? 4MP images, 4X OPTICAL Zoom -- you won't find that in a Canon for under [money]. Even better -- standard AA batteries so you'll never have to worry about your battery pack being depleted with no options or having your batteries become irreplaceable after a few years. IT takes video too and the 320 x 240 videos are usable, cute, and a nice additional feature. The ease of use is excellent. And best of all the vivid quality of the images combined with the sharpness left me impressed. I didn't need to refer to the manual during first use to get started. Very simple. Need to read to understand all the features.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Most of the few bad reviews that drag down the rating of this camera are due to the common misperception that using regular AA batteries is the norm. READ THE MANUAL PEOPLE! ALL cameras are the same in this regard and everyone will tell you to BUY RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES. Yes, they make a HUGE difference. I have a set of 1850mAh which will easily last me 125+ shots with the LCD on, reviewing the photos, etc. What is great is that this camera CAN use standard AAs if you are in a jam, one of its greatest assets. The picture quality is superb for the most part. Like all other cameras, autofocus is not perfect but it is very good and many of the pictures have just overwhelmed people who see my work. There are numerous other features that this camera offers and for 4 megapixels, the options and the price, this camera is a total steal. It feels good to grip in the hand. For some this camera might be a tad large and slightly heavier but you get quality photos which is the bottom line. Get a tiny camera you'll get much lower battery life and picture quality. Make your decision regarding the trade off. Having seen the pictures from this camera I would easily have paid more.","I have this camera for 2 weeks now and really enjoyed using it.  Although it seems no different than s404 at first, you can later notice that it considerably uses less battery.  However I would still recommend to buy Monster Cable 2000mAh rechargeables with this baby.  I have 256MB Lexar 12x and its reader, I feel like owning a photo studio.

Picture quality is very good! For the money, you cant beat it!","I purchased this camera at least 3 years ago, so I have quite a bit of experience with it.  I use it mainly now for eBay pics.  When I do use it recreationally I find it aggreviating.  When you take a pic you have to wait for the camera, at least 5 seconds to come back and sometimes mine actually goes to sleep!  When you press the shutter button, the camera takes at least 2 seconds before the flash flashes and the pic is taken.  I spent a lot, when I purchased this camera, a lot more than it is priced today.  I bought it respecting the Nikon name.  I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone.","I've been able to get some awesome closeup pictures of flowers, insects, and other things in my gardens with this camera (visit my website and you'll see what I mean).  The color quality is excellent--the pictures are clear and sharp--and I've literally taken thousands of pictures with it in the last couple of years. I also use it on a daily basis in my classroom, photographing student artwork, and it's been great for that, too.  I use rechargeable NiMH batteries and don't have any complaints about battery life.<br /><br />Its low-light capabilities leave something to desired, however, and the 3x zoom is now inadequate for my personal and professional photographic needs.  Still, it's a camera I'd definitely recommend to someone who wants to enter the world of digital photography and doesn't have a lot of money to spend.  It's a good, affordable, entry-level, take everywhere camera.","I have had my Nikon 3100 for almost two years now, and I take it wherever I go. I am a real photo and video enthusiast and I have owned cameras since my father gave me my first Kodak Brownie (I wish I still had it) when I was a kid. Although I own quite a collection of SLR cameras and camcorders, this is by far the camera I use the most because of it's versatility and superb picture quality. It's size is definitely a plus and it is really cute. Anywhere I have ever showed it off people compliment it's good looks and small size, even if there are other cameras around, such as sonys, minoltas or canons.<br /><br />I agree with most of the pros that other users state in their reviews, but I have to be honest and say that there are a few of the flaws that most of the reviewers mention that I agree with also, such as poor picture quality in low light or indoors. A lot of the pictures taken when the flash goes off are definitely over-lighted. But I have gotten used to that and I still recommend the little camera overall. More expensive cameras with advanced features do not have this problems.<br /><br />There is however one more con which I want to mention which is a major one for me and I am very surprised that I have never seen anybody say it before in any of the hundreds of reviews I've read: the LCD display on this camera scratches easily, no matter how much you take care of it. And I know what I am talking about! I take care of my cameras how you would'nt believe. Both my son and daughter own different digital cameras, a Fuji and a Canon, and their LCD screens are'nt a bit scratched no matter how much they throw them around. I carry my Nikon in a case and I have been really careful about the LCD screen since I noticed the first little scratch appear, but it is more scratched every day. This, I know, is a cosmetic detail, but it does affect the looks of the camera, and everyone notices it.<br /><br />I would like to know if anybody else has noticed this. I've been thinking about buying another Nikon, maybe a Coolpix 4600 or 5600 just to upgrade to 4MP or 5MP, but I want to know if this happens to all of this little Nikons.<br /><br />Nikon please take note.","This camera is a great choice for a first digital camera.  The picture quality is great, and with the museum mode, will allow great indoor pictures using existing light.  You can take great shots, day and night, as long as you utilize the proper scene modes that are built into the camera.<br /><br />The problems others seem to have are likely due to wrong battery choice.  Make sure you purchase the correct nimh rechargeables as recommended by the manufacturer.  With mine, I can take 150+ pictures on a single charge; turning the camera off when not in use.<br /><br />The low price makes this camera a great deal; it's a good first camera or makes a great gift.  I've had mine for over a year and have taken roughly 1800 pictures.  Definitely recommended!","arrrgh!!! i'm so jealous of you people who get to buy this great little camera for this price. i bought this for about $100 more when it 1st came out (maybe 2 or 2 1/2 years ago). but i think it's still worth it. i only know how to work 2 of the knob settings, yet i still love it.<br /><br />the life of a \"stored recharged battery is short and unpredictable, but after reading \"mermaid 2663's\" reveiw, i'll take her advise and charge them the day before use.<br /><br />the pictures come out great. i've taken pictures of pictures and the outcome is pretty good.<br /><br />i got the perfect little nikon case on e-bay for $7.<br /><br />sometimes i wonder if it's now obsolete, but<br /><br />i still get compliments on my camera and pictures.","Great camera, great pictures, eats up batteries.. buts its worth the money!","I love this camera! The smallest case I could find for it was too big!<br />Here are the highlights and lowlights:<br />Hits:<br />  Size--it's smaller than it looks; you just want to hold it!!!<br />  Quality--Nikon. That should tell you it's quality.<br />  Macros--Nikon is legendary for awesome close-ups!<br />  Format--uses AA's and CF media. SO cheap and easy!<br />  BSS--best shot selector. Handy!<br />  Lots of features!<br />Missses:<br />  Some shutter lag, but there always is in this price range.<br />  Not the fastest focus--same as above, though.<br />  Harder to find now. 3200 model not nearly as format-friendly!<br />  3 megapixels can only be enlarged so far. Enough for most.<br />For the price, this one is impossible to beat. 'Adorable' is the most heard description. The fact that it takes good photos is a bonus!","I'm an 18 year-old kid, and I wanted a camera I could take with me wherever I went to take pictures of my friends and such, but obviously, I'm shopping on a budget, so I didn't want to spend a lot... I was thinking along the idea of like a cell phone camera, only a) I find those to be rude and obnoxious, b) I wanted something that would take good quality photos, and c) I waned to be able to load them onto my computer. So my big issues were:<br />1) Portability; had to be a small camera<br />2) Image quality; had to take good pictures<br />3) Cost; Wanted to get the most camera for my money (NOTE: This included other aspects of camera buying, such as batteries, memory, etc, not just the cost of the camera itself)<br />I did a lot of shopping, both in stores and online, talked to a lot of people, and read a lot of reviews. In the end, it came down to this camera, and the Sony Cybershot DSC-P32. I was torn, an after carefully weighing the pros and cons of both cameras, I decided to go with this one; my moms old Nikon point-and-shoot never did her wrong, so I held my breath and bought this one.<br />I must say, I was glad I did my homework. This camera is one of the best investments I've ever made. I've had it for about a month, and still don't have any -real- complaints. I understood how to use it right out of the box, and when I did have to use the documentation, it was very well written. It's small enough that I can carry it in my pocket whenever I go out with my friends, (note: I wear baggy-ish cargo pants) but still take very high quality pictures. The camera can be a little unstable with being used without the flash, but I've found that the BSS feature usually takes care of the cameras tendency to produce blurry pictures when used without a flash.<br />The three big issues I have/had with this camera, and the ones everyone else seems to have are:<br />1) Battery Life<br />2) Memory<br />3) Flash/Movie mode/other performance issues<br />1) Battery Life: The battery life of the camera seemed to be a gripe everyone had. The Lithium battery that the camera came with lasted me through my 'play period,' when I was getting familiar with how the camera worked, as well as through my friends birthday party before it finally kicked the bucket. Obviously, this camera goes through regular alkaline dry cells like a fat kid through cake, but I bought some Panasonic Nickel Metal Hydride batteries w/ a charger for like 15 bucks, and those have been fine; I keep 2 in my camera, and 2 in my pocket in case they go dead. I would recommend taking as many pictures as you can WITHOUT the flash though, because the flash does put a lot of strain on the battetries...<br />Memory: The camera comes with a 16MB card. This obviously isnt enough. One of the main reasons I bought ths camera was because it takes CompactFlash memory, not Sony's (more expensive) MemoryStick memory. Just splurge on the extra card; its well worth it, trust me. Or, be like me and wait for your birthday to roll around, and ask for it then :)<br />Performance Issues: The flash can be very taxing on the battery, and you WILL get redeye if you dont use the redeye flash. But, the camera performs pretty well in most lights without flash, just make sure to use the BSS option, becaue your first pictures will come out blurry. It does, however, perform rather poorly in low light; restaurants have been of particular bother to me; because the flash is too bright and black out the background, but if I don't use it my pictures will come out yellow. In manual mode, it has a lot of things you can play with to rectify the situation though, just play with it to find out what works best for you. I find shutter conpensation to be the best remedy for this situation.<br />As far as movie mode goes, it's not a camcorder, it's a camera. If you want to make movies, go buy a camcorder.<br />All in all, this is a great camera to take with you for those 'had to be there' shots, which is why I bought it. It's customizable, portable, efficient, and takes great pictures. Good for someone who doesn't know a lot about photography, but know what looks good and what doesn't. The camera isn't perfect, but I wasn't looking for perfection. It's a very well-rounded camera thats good for what it costs, and I personally don't regret buying it.","I have had this camera for 4 months now and I can not find any thing remotely bad that all the naysayers have writen about. Battery life? I took over 400 pics. with the first battery, this is with 60% flash assisted. To slow? All I can say is read the book. Grandkids are never still and I have had no problems. My experieance has been great. Buy one you will be happy.","I love my camera, it is perfect for taking pictures at parties and other social gatherings.  One thing about this camera that I don't like a whole lot is that it takes a pretty long time for it to focus up and get ready to take a picture, but from my experience this is the case with almost all digital cameras.  I like the \"continuous\" setting, which lets you take lots of pictures right after one another, but the pictures come out with a blue tint and are not fun to look at.<br />I also wish it had more zoom, which I should have thought of earlier, because I use this little fella to take pictures of airplanes which you usually can't get really close to.  3x is enough zoom for the average joe taking pictures of his friends, but if you are going to be taking pics of nature etc where more zoom is needed, there are a few cameras out there with 12x zoom that you should look into.  This camera does have digital zoom, but the quality becomes very poor when used to it's max.<br />Scene modes are pretty neat, in my experience they take about the same quality picture as the automatic mode.  The landscape feature has proved useful for ground shots because it gives you reference lines across the screen so you can level your picture right there.<br />Great camera, high quality pictures, easy to use, buy the rechargeable batteries and you will be all set.","Writing an update to my review of last November. My main concerns then were battery life, shutter lag.  I've now switched from rechargable 2300mah AA batteries to the CRV3 Lithium batteries and find a BIG improvement in battery life.  First the rechargeable batteries don't have much of an in-camera shelf life, they'll static discharge in a week.  Second for some reason the CRV3 batteries will take many more exposures.  Am now looking for rechargeble CRV3 batteries.<br />Second, shutter lag shouldn't be much of a problem if you use the \"sport\" mode on the dial on top.  Used this camera at the Macau Gran Prix, and had no problem capturing the action of F3 cars.  Will take several exposures in rapid succession, about 1.5 frames a second on 1024x780 resolution.<br />Do wish the flash was stronger, pics at holiday party came out a bit on the dark side, and I seem to have a problem getting white balance adjusted<br />All and all, a great little camera for the purpose it's made for.","My first digital camera.  The ONLY downside is the delay between the time you press the shutter release (w/flash) and the actual opening of the shutter, but even that can be handled as you get used to it.<br />The picture quality is magnificent.  Using cropping, I've made some 8x10 blow-ups of some pretty small croppings, with great results - very fine detail, NOT grainy, great color, etc.<br />The camera body shape allows you to hang on to the camera easily, while still offering the advantages of a very small camera - even pocket-sized (with moderate to large pockets).<br />With a 256Mb flash card, I get 315 highest pixel pictures.  You just keep on clicking.  It's great.","The camera is very easy to use, everything is done automaticaly for you. Because all is automatic, the camera doesn't have manual setting you can play with. The only manual setting you can do are only white balance and exposure compensation, but I don't call it manual setting, but \"helper\" to trick the environtmental condition.<br />Hence, this camera is:<br />- Recommended for people who wants to take high quality picture instantly, without being troubled with any setting.<br />- Not recommended for those who wants to do creative process, as they cannot play with exposure, ISO or shutter speed.<br />The picture quality is averagely very good in day-outdoor, but not really good in the night or indoor because camera automaticaly set to high ISO in low light condition that makes picture grainy.<br />The flash distance range is not far or strong, lower than average digicams in the class. Thus the flash is not really a complete help for low light condition (depend on severity). The Night Portrait assist mode is the solution for low light or night shot, but you need a tripod, otherwise the picture will be blured because the camera will capture light for 2-4 secs, shaking hands will drag the light.<br />Pros:<br />- Everything can be operated by only one hand, very compact and fit to hand grip perfectly.<br />- Good quality picture in day outdoor<br />- It's automatic function works well in supportive condition<br />Cons:<br />- Pictures are grainy in low light condition<br />- No sound for movie<br />- No manual setting<br />- Poor flash<br />- Batteries come in the box from Nikon are bad. Please use recognized rechargeable batteries brand instead.","I bought this camera in a hurry not really knowing what the full features or reviews were.  I found it to be a great little compact camera that was very easy to use.  Definitely not meant for action shots because of the delay.  For awhile I was having problems with the batteries wearing out after 3 or 4 photos & was ready to return it.  I invested in Panasonic rechargeable batteries & have not had any problems since.  The Nikon View software that is included is also a big plus - it's kind of like your own photo shop complete with effects, text, retouch, crop, etc...I even learned how to fix \"dog eye\".  Fun to play around with.","This is an amazing little camera. I bought it from Best Buy online at 10% discount(at $269). I have waited a long for this camera. I was not willing to buy it from a unknown online store at cheap rate. I waited for the price to come down and wanted to buy it from a reliable store. Right after receiving I checked that the Firmware is v1.2, that means recently manufactured. I heard that battery problem is with v1.1. So far taken around 25 picture in night with flash and LCD ON, no sign of battery down yet.<br />  My first picture was taken at night at 3M (Below Highest Quality). The picture was not very good. It was a little blurry and very low detail. I then used 3M* (The highest quality). And the picture came up crystal clear. Unbelievable detail and balance. I just could not believe that a picture with such quality and detail could be taken with a below 300 dollar camera. I have seen pictures from my friend's Canon A60 and was amazed by the quality of picture it took. But this Nikon is uncomparable.<br />  Anyway, I tried with the 2M (3rd Highest) in the daylight, the detail and the quality is super. I guess, in the night a lot of detail is automatically lost because of low light. So, I have to use the Highest Quality to retain the detail that is coming in. In day light, since a lot more detail is coming in, I can opt to loose some of them by choosing a lower quality and still get an amazing shot. I may be wrong, but this is what I understand.<br />  This is the best electronics I have ever bought.","I recently received this camera as a birthday present from my grandmother and I absolutly love it. I've had the camera about a month, and I use it ALL the time. I went to Boston on vacation and used the camera everyday for 3 weeks and the battery never died. The quality of the pictures is absolutly excellent. The night mode is a little bit hard to get used to as the shutter has to stay open longer, but once you get the hang of it the pictures come out looking fantastic.<br />I would definitly recommend buying a larger memory card, I bought a 256mb one, and I never have to change it.<br />Even with extreme close-ups, the quality of the pictures is excellent. Never grainy or pixelized.<br />I havnt quite figured out how to use the photo software it came with, I use Olympus Camedia Master for photo editing ( i used to own an Olympus Camedia.)<br />Overall this is a great camera. Its compact, affordable, and produces great pictures.","Small, easy to use, excellent quality to 5 x 7 prints, good quality at 8 x 10. I own a Nikon 5700 digital camera and love it, but it's complex overkill for others in my house. They LOVE this camera for its size, its picture quality, its scene modes, its flexibility and its \"go anywhere\" size. On jaunts it's always around someone's neck or just in their hands.<br />Foolproof and REALLY simple to use; scene modes are wonderful. Flash is anemic, but we've found Nimh batteries are good for 50-60 pix easy, and a set or two of good ones plus a charger is all that's really needed. Add a 256 high-speed CF card and one is ready for anything. A GREAT camera for a novice.<br />Incredibly easy to use; hooked it up to our TV right out of the box and used the TV to focus, crop, and then shoot portraits. A truly fun camera within its limitations as a versatile point and shoot. A real winner from Nikon.","This was my first digital camera.  After doing research and looking at the competition I decided on this one.  I'm so glad I did.  It takes fantastic pictures.  I've not had problems with the batteries as some others seem to have had.  I take close to 100 pictures on one battery.  I highly recommend the Nikon Coolpix to anyone looking for a digital camera.  It's easy and great fun to use.","This camera is great looking, compact, and easy to use.  The daytime pictures that I have taken with it have turned out excellent.  They are sharp and the colors look great.  However, the nightime pictures I have taken with it have turned out blurry.<br />The battery life isn't the best either.  I recommend using rechargeable batteries with it, because it will eat up regular batteries quickly.<br />All in all, it's a nice camera for daytime photos.  I think it's also a good camera for the first time digital photographer.","This is my first digital camera, and I think after doing a little research I made a great choice. I definately wanted a camera that was compact, feature rich, simple to use, asthetically pleasing, as well as affordable. I was originally sold on the Cannon A70, is identically priced, but problems with error messages, reports of poor customer service, and the need for 4 AAA rechargebles instead of the Coolpix's 2, scared me away from Cannon. Don't get me wrong, Cannon's are great,as well as Pentax Optios, and Casios. I was impressed by some of the pictures takken with these models, especially the Elph Series. Cannon may have poor customer service, but there is always a Cannon sales Rep. at the Best Buy, peddling his wares and showing u samples,but I put a lot of stock in Amozon customer reviews! This camera takes great photos at it's mid and highest Res. The only cons I can see are the fallowing: 1)The carrying case for this baby is very expensive because it must be purchased with a AAA battery charger and two rechargeble batteries..... you say you don't want one but when u see how nice this camera looks you'll change your mind. Most guys already have a battery charger and Nic Cd or NMH batteries, so this was not economical, although the pouch is nice looking. 2)Unlike the Canon A70, there is no sound in movie mode which gives a kind of Groucho Marks effect, but the 3100's superb picture Quality more than makes up for this!! 3)I would strongly recommend u purchase at least a 128mb cf mem. card with 12x or higher processing speed to cut lag time,which seems to be a gripe with other users. The 12x may seem small,but spend the extra money on a faster speed, when u get the camera with it's slow, low Mem.(16Mb)CFlash card and then upgrade; the differance is night and day! Believe me the 12x helps. If I were you I would trust Sandisk or Leexar. I chose the latter, a 256mb 12x Lexar CF card, purchased from amozon for under $50.  Got to my doorstepp 5 days early, with free shipment. No matter what brand camera u purchase u will have to upgrade the memory, it's an inevitabillity!! At the camera's highest Reso. you simply wont have enough memmory. Shop around for sure, but before you buy, you owe it to yourself to see the clear, vibrant pictures this next-generation Nikon Coolpix is able to deliver! They also have web sights that compare photos of cameras in same price range and pixles, just type in the name of the camera on your browser.  I hope this review was as helpful as others have been for me.","It is an awesome camera for its size, and 14 modes. It's one of the best, if the pictures are taken at day time.<br />But I found the night mode extremely disappointing. When I take pictures in the night mode, they turn out to be very shaky and unclear. Almost all photographs I have taken so far at night turned out to be bad.","Picked the 3100 up after my coolpix 4300 decided it wasn't going to show anything in the LCD screen.  So, this isn't my first digital camera, and I'm fairly experienced in photography. I use the camera mostly for documenting product failures, and maybe quick snaps when I don't feel like hauling around my Nikon N90 and assorted lenses. Picked this camera because of size and what looked like good results at the stores.  Great little camera to keep handy for those moments when you \"wish I had a camera handy\"<br />First to say, I was impressed by the photo results.  At least as good if not better exposed than my 4300.  Flash as others have said is pretty weak, and no attachment for external flash.  Camera is small, so fits easily in shirt or jacket pocket, however the small size makes it very difficult to not get camera shake.  My wife finds it impossible to take clear pictures with it, all her photos show camera shake.<br />A lot of my pics are taken under flourescent light, so the custom set white balance where you aim at a grey card and the camera adjusts the white balance is great.  Phots that would otherwise come out very blue come out almost perfect balance. Macro scene mode works well, it is a pain to have to turn off the flash every time I switch the camera on in macro though.<br />I purchased the camera at Fortess in Hong Kong, came with case, 64mg card, charger and 2 nimh batteries.  Now we get to the battery life bit.  Not good.  The \"Nikon\" batteries supplied don't seem to work well.  Bought a set of Sony 2100mah batteries that will keep the camera powered for a day or two, an additional 2 sets of 2300mah batteries I'm in the process of conditioning.  Ive got the firmware upgrade and the low battery signal comes on after 2 shots, but then I can still take quite a few photos afterward. Without shooting, camera will stay powered up for the advertised 90 minutes.<br />Apparently this may be a manufacturing issue over a design issue. Some cameras have great battery life, some have terrible battery life. I've heard it may have to do with the machining of the negative terminal on the battery case, poor machining and polishing on some have left a rough surface on the terminal, causing poor contact with the battery. If you're having problems, check the cover, if the contact is rough, try polishing it with very fine grit polishing cloth (like the auto body shops use) and see if it helps.<br />Shutter lag isn't any worse than any other compact digital I've tried, slightly better even than the 4300.  Write to card times seem a little slow, even using a 48X Lexar high speed CF card.<br />Battery problems aside, remembering that this camera is aimed at the consumer market, those who just want a good compact camera for vacation \"snaps\" parties etc, this is a good choice.","I've taken 1000's of shots with this tiny little camera and love them. I've bought the 2100 as gifts for everyone in my wedding party. The camera is awesome.<br />(...) Nikon issued a firmware update that fixes the battery life issue. I called Nikon and they recommended using the Nikon NIMH batteries or a disposable CRV3 battery, not the ones he was having trouble with.<br />This camera is so easy and so much fun. The scene assist is a blast.<br />I wouldn't trade it for any other camera out there. I've been a Nikon person before, I looked at all the print samples and this one is better than many of the 5 Megapixel cameras out there...","I received this camera as a gift. Right off the bat, I was mad that it does not come with anything but the camera. I have an inexpensive Polaroid digital camera that I have used for years. When I bought it, it came with a case, power supply, cables and memory. THIS CAMERA DOES NOT. You have to buy all that separately. So my gift camera cost me several dollars before I could use it. The picture quality is awesome. It has special settings for indoor and outdoor and sunsets etc. The menus are easy to use also. Power usage is a big problem with this camera. The design was very poorly planned to save on size and weight this camera sacrifices battery power. It has space for two AA size batteries. Regular Alkaline AA batteries are worthless. Disposable Lithium AA batteries work a little better. The accessory rechargeable batteries that Nikon recommends work pretty well. You can take about 15-20 pictures with continuous use. Or if you take a picture here and there they will last about two weeks. I have found the special C-something disposable lithium batteries (look like two AA batteries molded together) work the best but they are the most expensive battery option for this camera.","I was just ready to place my order at $349 and was suprised this past weekend to see it fifty dollars less at $299.99.  This is my second camera and I was up and running in less than 2 minutes.  The auto mode works very well, but some of the special settings take some getting used to...but thats the fun part this week.  The manual settings once you get them down even allow for better pictures that the auto mode.<br />As others have said get some NiMh rechareable batteries and a largere memory card.  Yes the camera is small, but thats a benefit to me as I carry it in my coat jacket pocket....get a Nikon case for it to keep the dirt out of the great Nikkor zoom lens.","I absolutely love this camera.  After a few years of using a cheaper (different brand name) model, it's such a relief to have a high-quality digital camera!  Image quality is great, I use it mostly for Website images and I couldn't ask for more.<br />I am an extreme beginner in photography, so I don't know all the terminology and such, but the only complaint I have is that it's a little difficult to get action shots because the camera has a delay when you hold down the button.  I haven't run into a digital camera in my price range yet though that doesn't have this issue.  I know there is a name for all that (shutter speed?) but like I said I'm a beginner.  Perhaps there is even something I can do to alleviate the problem, I'm not sure.  But if you're a beginner, this camera will take great pics for you (I imagine even if you're not a beginner you'll be satisfied), and the price is right.  It's a snap to use too, and the software included is pretty cool even though I usually use Photoshop and bypass it.<br />Highly recommended!","We own a SLR and a camcorder that takes digital pictures so we never thought that we would need a digital camera.  But after lugging the other 2 around, we realized that it would be so nice to have something compact to take on vacations.  So when we decided to shop for one, we had decided on a couple of things.  First it had to be compact and easy to hold.  It had to have over 3x zoom and at least 3 mega pixels.  We wanted it to be worth the money as well.<br />Remember to buy at least a 256 memory card so that you can take a couple hundred good resolution pictures that you can print out in great quality.  Placement of your hand is comfortable and not straining.  It's so small it can fit in your pocket!  We got great shots and our printed pictures came out almost like our SLR quality.<br />We separately bought the recharger since this camera takes 2AA batteries.  Loved the option of either buying the batteries if it ran out in the middle of vacation or just recharging it at ngiht if we remembered.  Other digital cameras come with recharging dock stations.  However, our friend ran out of power in the middle of the day and couldn't use his camera for the rest of the time we were out.  Something to consider...<br />I would highly recommend this camera.","I got this camera two months ago, and after 2500 pictures taken I can safely say that this is a very good camera, especially for this price.<br />I was actually looking for a smaller camera, as I want to take it with me everywhere I go, but despite it being bigger than the smallest cameras on the market, it fits perfectly in the pocket of my jeans. Also, you get a really good grip when you hold it in your hand, which is also important.<br />The image quality is great; for examples, see peterlindberg.se/photolog<br />If you buy this camera, you should be aware that the batteries take a few, say 4 or 5 charges to function properly. After that, they last two days.","Auto photos usually come out requiring no editing at all.<br />In manual mode, white balance settings are available, as is BBS (camera takes 10 shots and selects best).  Flash is quite good for such a small camera.  Action shots are great - dial in type of photo you want to take.  Easy to carry with you all the time.","I bought this Nikon 3100 about a month ago.  I LOVE it because it's so small and still has 3x optical zoom!  The design is just amazing, and i don't think there is any cuter digital camera out there than this one.  One problem is that the shutter speed is very slow as other cameras.  If you don't use flash, the pictures are too blurry. One way to get away with this is to use the Sports mode, and it works great.  It has many different modes such as close up, landscape, portrait, etc, and some of them are really useful.  The butteries last for a long time if flash is not being used; however, they only last for a couple of hours if you keep using flash.  But, overall, i love it and i'm glad i bought this.","I decided to buy my first digital camera this summer, and I had narrowed it down to the canon s400 and the nikon 3100. Ultimately, I chose the Nikon because of the price difference, but I've been very satisfied with my choice.<br />The most common complaint I've heard is the battery life. I've used the camera on 6 or 8 separate occasions, and have filled my 128 mb memory card, and the original battery is still going strong. Just don't leave the camera on when you're not actively taking pictures and you'll be fine (though I'd still recommend keeping some spare NiMH batteries with you).<br />The scene modes can be useful--I took some great fireworks pictures over the 4th of July with that scene mode, and the backlight mode works well too. However, sometimes you need to take a picture quickly, and then they just get in the way.<br />The other complaint I've heard is the flash (i.e. the multiple flashes that are annoying and make the camera take too long to take a picture). That problem is easily solved...just turn from red-eye reduction mode to standard flash mode. Then, if you get red-eye, just fix it on your computer.<br />Which leads me to my one complaint about the camera. The imaging software that came with it was a pain to use, and didn't give great results when you try to edit the photos. I upgraded to Photoshop Elements, and haven't had any problems since.<br />The size of the camera is perfect...small enough to carry around easily, but big enough to still hold steadily. The grip feels good, and the zoom/shutter buttons are well placed so you can use them with just one finger.<br />The picture quality is great...everything I'd expect from a Nikon (esp. with the Nikkor lens). I've been using some of my pics as desktop backgrounds (at 1600x1200), and they still look great. I can't wait to get my first set of prints back!<br />Overall this is a great little camera...no regrets, and I've got more cash in my pocket than if I'd bought the Canon","I had previously purchased the coolpix 2000 and wasn't thrilled with it.  The biggest drawback is that it didn't have a viewfinder... you had to look at the mini-monitor.<br />The coolpix 3100 improves greatly on that camera.  It does have a viewfinder... it seems about half the size (and thats saying something since the 2000 was acceptably small and light.  And, throw in an extra mega-pixel and I think its well worth the money ...<br />Biggest drawbacks:  In low light it gets very grainy looking.  Also the \"auto redeye reduction\" in the sofware is not great.  The manual redeye included in the software works better (and thats good enough for me).","I bought the Nikon coolpix as my first digital camera, and I'm very much satisfied by the results of the camera, but then I have a few quirks to it as well. First, the camera is small. It doesn't fit my pocket, yes, but when it comes to similarly sized cameras, this one wins in the price category. The LCD is wonderfully lit, an comparing to most of my friend's, Coolpix 3100's is clearer even when viewed at odd angles (and with bright light). I also have that small dot that many users complain about, but I don't really mind it, as it's not immediately noticeable anyway.<br />Picture-wise, this camera produces very satisfying results. The 14 scene / assist modes are a wonderful addition to help you get the most impressive pictures for almost any situation. I, however, have found myself turning the flash off more often, as the results are softer and more pleasing, in both cases, it performed well. Speaking of the flash, I always wonder why it has to turn off and recharge every so often, which makes taking another picture seem like forever,but once you get used to it, then it's all fine.<br />It's power usage is probably its worst aspect, don't even bother using Alkaline batteries coz it would die even before you take a single picture. Even with rechargeable NI-MH's, it still goes through it pretty fast. Ready a spare every time because you don't know when it would go off.<br />All in all, this is wonderful camera especially for its price and simple to use features, perfect for the beginning photographer.","I've used this camera for several months now. It is easy to use, it has easy to read the menus, and takes great photos like all my other Nikon cameras.<br />It has an easy point and shoot capability, but Nikon has Scene Modes to make sure you get the best out of every shot.<br />I just got back from a wedding in the moutains of California. I was able to capture all the views with the Landscape Scene Mode that is in this camera as well as the faces of the bride and groom with the Back Light Mode when the sun was behind them. This camera rocks.","I bought a Nikon coolpix 3100 after a lot of search through the stores, but I got diasppointed with the performance.  First the LCD screen has many dots which is lit all the time.  (In the users guide it written that this is normal!!).<br />Second and most disappointing is the optical view finder, if you switch the LCD screen off and try to take some pics, it takes many sec (5-6 sec in my peice) to take the picture, or this function is completely useless.  I called the Nikon Tech support and they also checked and agreed this problem.  I think it is a basic bug in this new product.  So be aware what you are going to have.<br />Good things are it is very compact, quality of the pictures are good.","This is a really small camera a bit thick but it looks really cute...but the problem with this is that the night shots are not very clear..my guess would be that the flash is not strong...oh about the flash...well its a multi-screen flash..ie..it goes off like 2-3 time before the final take..it may be a good idea when u think of it from a technology point of view but what really happens is that it causes the subject to become cautious or close their eyes..I personally found the photos from my Canon A60 (2MP camera) to be better than this camera","I've had this camera for about a day now and I love it.  I read a lot of reviews and saw that the main flaw was battery life, and that the included cr-v3 battery would die after 10 minutes.  This has absolutely not been true so far.  With the original battery I have taken over 200 pictures at the highest quality setting, and the battery is still going strong.<br />The camera will easily fit into a pocket, and thanks to the built in lens cap you don't have to worry about it getting scratched.  The menu is easy so easy to follow I was up taking pictures in less then 10 minutes from opening the box.  The biggest problem, I think, is the scene modes.  The seem to just make your life difficult.  But the autofocus/flash is so effective that these other features almost never have a chance to get in your way.  The manual exposure compensation is the easiest way to manage the light getting into the camera, and ensures that every photo looks great.  The only things you need that are not included in the box are a) rechargeable batteries, cause the included cr-v3 will not last forever, and b) a 128 mb min memory card.  The included card takes 10 pics at highest resolution, while a 128 takes 80 at the highest quality, and over 150 at the next highest quality.  This is a great camera and is so easy to use and it does not cost a lot of money.  The pictures look great and are more than enough resolution for prints up to 8x10.","I am amazed at the clarity of the photos. This is not the first digital camera I have had, but it is the best!<br />I love the short movies that I can film, I love the scene assistant.. It is cool all around.<br />Took it camping this past weekend, got some excellant shots of the Mtns, made them look pretty close and clear even though they were far away...  Sure I might be able to get a better camera.. but not at this price!","The Nikon Coolpix 3100 is very user friendly.<br />It have 16 scene for us to choose, this is a easy way to set it in difference situation (e.g. daylight, nighttime, sunset...)<br />This is important for us, because we are not familiar with the professional camera that need to set alot of setting by ourself.<br />This will take alot of time for us to learn....!<br />But one thing i not sactisfied is no voice recording for Nikon Coolpix 2100/3100.<br />If you want good picture, I recommended to buy 3 Mega Pixel and above.","Ok, here is the truth.  I bought this camara because I had a business trip to Japan.  Wanted something small.  Wanted something light.  This camara delivers this.  Before I bought it I read all the reviews...Now here is the truth.  The pictures are great but a couple of points.  1) this is a small camara.  That means you need a steadier hand than with a larger camara.  2) it has a dozen different picture settings, and they do make a difference especially in low light so you have to be fairly active with your settings  3) software is outdated, you must update from the Nikon website and it isn't the easiest process for the novice  4) No rechargable battery or case included 5) stupid 16 meg card included, you must upgrade 6)It does take up to six seconds to write the picture to the card, that is slow by digital standards<br />While this may sound like a lot of drawbacks here are the strengths 1) picture quality better than others 2)size, only the elph is smaller but this is much more comfortable3) nikon software is so simple both for picture modifications and red eye one touch 4) uploading to your computer or the nikon website is one touch and you get 50 megs online.<br />In my mind the pros outweigh the cons but you have to make the decision for yourself.  I for one am happy with my choice.","I ordered this camera from Amazon and received it last week. What a great piece of equipment. At the same time I ordered a 256meg Viking CF card.  I can take over 300 pictures using that card with this camera, and the quality is fantastic. The Nikon software loaded perfectly (WindowsXP) and is easy to use.  I couldn't be more pleased. Oh, and the optical zoom is great. That is one of the big reasons I bought this camera over some of the competitors. I zoom in alot with this one before having to go into the digital zoom and the loss of quality that inevitably brings.","Pro's<br />1. Has many desirable features like 3MP, video out, only 2 AA batteries etc.<br />2. Nice looking and very small in size with good grip. Light weight too.<br />3. Uses [inexpensive] CF cards.<br />4. Easy menus and scene modes to use. Modes give you some control over what camera does.<br />5. Great macro pictures.<br />6. Night shots are very nice if used with tripod or some supporting surface.<br />7. Good manual, explains differences between the modes.<br />8. Has a very affordable accessory kit with case, batteries and fast charger here on Amazon.<br />Con's<br />1. Reliability is doubtful. Battery compartment door is very flimsy.<br />2. Movie mode is junk, no sound and movie sizes very small.<br />3. A bit thick, making it tougher to pocket.<br />4. No rechargeable batteries or charger in the box. And still costs more than it competition.<br />5. No AF assist light or manual mode.<br />6. One of the most expensive 3MP cameras. Esp since it has poor features and nothing bundled with it.<br />7. Slow to read/write to CF cards, manual recommends only Lexar/Sandisk cards. Aren't CF cards made to a standard?<br />8. Lens comes out even while downloading pics or reviewing them and never retracts while the camera's on. (Only way to keep it folded is to start in setup mode and then go to review pics.)<br />9. Low battery indicator not good, need to do a firmware update to fix it. to make it worse lens was stuck out even when it ran out of battery!<br />Canon A70 or Sony P72 are much better for less cost, although this has the smallest size/weight and good lens.<br />Update: the flash on the camera is also very weak, the worst I have seen in compact digicams so far.","I actually bought my Niko in Japan and it came with the NiMH batteries, which I'll get too later.  I had intended on buying one of the newer Sony camera's, but after shopping around a little I found that Nikon had all the same features as the Sony equivelant and took better pictures.  Sony pics look a little grainy, especially at large sizes.  This is my first digital camera although I've had a digital video camera for almst 4 years.<br />Picture quality: first and foremost, the picture quality is very good and is easily of the best camras in the 3.2 meg range.  I've worked to blow the pictures up, use them as screensavers, etc and they look immaculate on my 19\" screen.<br />Scenes: I haven't had much call to use the scene function, but I have worked on the indoor/ outdoor settings, portrait and even took some pictures with the \"snow\" setting in a room that looked way too white.  The scenes also utilize flash contol. Overall these are easy to use, although as Amazon notes, you probably won't have use for many of them.<br />Performance:  Autofocus could be a little quicker and a little more responsive in my book.  I've had problems with the camera not focusing during portraits and coming out all blurry.  With the time it takes to autofocus, the time it takes to record and the time it takes to setup for the next pic, the shutter speed is moot.  Usually though, the camera works very well, indoors and outdoors.  Outdoor pics look amazing on a nice sunny day.  The Flash is a pain and requires some tooling.  Get too close and everything comes out white, portrait takes a little too long.  Everything else is fine.<br />Batteries: My biggest complaint.  Anyone out there expecting to get any kind of use out of regular batteries can dream on.  Even the NiMH batteries die way too fast and require constant recharging.  When the batteries get low, which is usually after 10 or so pics, the camera will auto shut down while the flash recharges.  Very irritating when combined with the autofocus and the time it takes to record pics to the memory.  Takes forever to get another shot off.  I'm tempted to bring the review down to three stars over this one feature, but I haven't experimented with other batteries yet so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt.<br />Conveience: The size, features and computer to camera setup is top notch.  I have windows XP and I didn't need to install any software to copy the pics to my hard drive.  It was plug and play.  I like that the camera uses compact flash cards while other companies are going to more expensive formats.  I have an Epson printer that can copy pics of the CF cards and they lok amazing.<br />Value: about average for a camera in this class, and I think the pros outweight the cons.  Lets face it, this is just above entry level and not the best camera on the market, but easily one of the best in it's price range.  Having owned this one for a little over a month, I may decide not to skimp when I upgrade.  Most of my complaints could be easily resolved if I were willing to shell out the extra dough.  Great camera for vacations, parties and portability.","Pros:<br />1.) Ease of operation. The camera is very user friendly. Just by messing around with it for 20 to 30 minutes I figured out how to operate most of the functions.<br />2.) Great price. I was looking at sony p7 and canon. Both of these cameras were nice and had a few more options than the Nikon but I like the Nikon's style and functionability better.<br />3.) LCD screen. I liked Nikon's screen better than Sony's just because it was recessed. With Sony's if you set it down on a flat surface then the screen would have come into contact with the surface<br />Cons:<br />1.) My friends have reported little white spots of light on their pictures. I have noticed a few little spots on pictures that I've taken but they aren't bad. I have also noticed that these spots will occur on other cameras, even disposable.<br />2.) Battery life is about average. My batteries usually last 45 minutes to an hour. I have rechargable nickle batteries.<br />3.) The 16mb memory disc is standard but I got a 128mb one as well so that I would be able to hold plenty of pictures.<br />This is my first digital camera.. It takes great pictures but like everything it is not perfect?It is easy to figure out how to use and the controls are well placed for its small size. But it really is small and sometimes it is awkward to handle but the small size is great for travel and is small enough to fit in a loose pocket comfortably. I would have liked a bigger memory card. I bought a 128mb card when I bought the camera. I took about 150 pics on vacation and had room for about 150 more. 64mb would be plenty. You really should buy rechargeable batteries. This camera goes through batteries rather quickly. I bought regular alkaline batteries ? they lasted about 5 minutes I then bought Lithium batteries :). The rechargeable batteries die after taking about 50-60 pictures. The movie quality was pretty good and you can edit the movies on the camera. Shutter response time is slow. In low light without the flash pictures become very blurry. I would guess the shutter automatically stays open longer to compensate for low light. I have not found a way to prevent this. On high quality the write time to the card seems long, about 7-8 seconds. I would like more features that you would find on a higher priced bigger camera but I wanted this to travel with and it worked great for that. It gave me good prints and it was pretty easy to use. Overall it is a great camera that anyone could use.","I just bought the Nikon Coolpix 3100 a week ago, and I can't say enough about it.  ...  The pictures it takes are phenomenal.  I thought about going for a 4-megapixel model, but decided against it due to the expense.  I can now see from the fantastic quality of the pictures I've been taking that 4 MPs would have been overkill for a first digital camera.<br />The 3100 has an insane number of scene modes and settings to play with, although I haven't done so yet.  I've just been using it on the \"Auto\" setting and it's worked great.  Well worth the money.  The Nikonview software for viewing, editing, compressing and emailing your pictures is really easy to use.  I like the fact that the camera uses 2 AA-size batteries rather than a proprietary battery module.  Much more convenient and versatile.  Just make sure you get a set of at least 4 rechargeable NiMH AA-size batteries and a battery charger.  Regular alkaline batteries didn't last more than 10 minutes, but the rechargeable NiMHs last much longer (about an hour and a half).  You will also want to buy a larger Compactflash card than the 16-meg card that comes with the camera. ...","I got this very quickly from Amazon.com, even with saver shipping.  It's my first digital camera, and so far, I'm impressed.  I've used plenty of Nikon 35mm and SLR cameras, but I needed a portable, high quality, yet affordable, digital camera.  This is it.  It is the smallest 3+ megapixel digital camera I've seen, even smaller than its big brother the Coolpix 4300.  I would have bought the 4300 but then this camera came out and is pretty close in quality and quite a bit cheaper than the 4300.  As for quality, this camera impresses me greatly...especially because of its small, yet very comfortable size.  Sure, there are smaller cameras, but they fall out of your hands, whereas this one does not (I always use the wrist strap anyway).  The scene modes are a bit of overkill, but the full auto mode works well, and I have yet to really get into the \"manual\" mode, but it seems to be quite useful for taking several pictures at the same time/selecting the best shot (using the camera's automatic best shot selector feature).  Overall, the camera is great.  The tried and true 3x optical zoom nikkor lense, combined with an excellent CCD and extremely small, yet grippable body make this the perfect camera for someone who wants portability, quality, and a great price too.","I purchased this camera to use for work while traveling.  The size of the camera is perfect for traveling because it is very small.  It is also very user friendly and I think anyone will be able to use the camera efficiently with no problems.  However, the picture quality was quite poor in my opinion.  I probably took over 80 pictures the evening I bought it just testing it out.  Out of those 80 pictures I only got maybe 8 that I considered 'good' quality (not great by any means).  The other pictures were very grainy looking once you get them onto your computer.  I need to be able to email and place pictures in powerpoint presentations and these photos were way below any standard that I could use for work or leisure.  The camera would occationally take decent pictures but you had to take SO many bad ones to get one good one, it was not worth it to me.  I currently have an older Casio that takes GREAT pictures, but is larger than I would like to travel with.  The Nikon 3100 is the perfect size and easy to use.. but the quality of the pictures is just not there.  I returned the Nikon the next day.","You get a lot of bang for the buck with this one. Firstly, the camera is *tiny*, but still has that wonderful Nikkor lens. Being a fan of the swivel lens design, I do miss that, but the picture quality so far has been superlative.<br />As with small cameras, the flash can be problematic in that it's just not all that powerful. However, you can compensate some by monkeying around with the settings manually or use one of the scene settings. I took a nice picture of a sunrise to experiment with the scenes, and I have a nice mixture of deep indigo with red on the horizon. It'll go absolutely anywhere you need it to go, and unlike the reported problem with the coolpix 3500, shutter speed is much improved.<br />My only criticisms right now are the weak flash (but what do you want from something so small) and the load time between pictures. The second problem may be fixed with a better CF card, but this camera is nice for snapshots, though some people will complain about the startup time. I'm enjoying this camera immensely right now!"]},{"name":"Olympus D-560 Zoom (C-350 Zoom)","amazon_reviews":["This is a great camera, it works really well and we all love it at home !!!. Totally recommended by us :)","Great camera.<br />I still don't understand how this seems to take clearer photos than a 5.0 MP camera.<br />We compared photos from the Olympus and other 5.0 MP cameras and always select the 3.2 MP from this camera over the others.<br />Maybe someone can explain the how and why?<br />Is the Olympus MP mislabeled?<br />This is our second Olympus, with same results.<br />I have had other 3.2 MP cameras which did not take photos as clear as this model of Olympus.","MY FAVORATE CAMERA  ......IT STILL WORKING FINE  ....LIKE IT  ....THNAKS","I've owned this product for 3 years.  The title of this review is my first complaint.  Date stamps are very important when capturing an event and when on vacation.  And I forget easily.  My second complaint is no customizable default resolution setting.  It reverts to the factory default resolution setting every time you close the cover.  Irritating.  Otherwise, I have had no problem in light or dark environments.  Good clarity.  Works well with iPhoto on my Mac.  Definitely not a \"pocket cam\".","After four or more years old reliable is gone.  I must replace her.  Olympus FE-250 I think will be my new camera.  That old 3.2 MP took great pictures for emails and stuff. Yes you can expect two AA batteries per 20-30 pictures, but if you use it on the go, and infrequently it's perfect.  5 stars for reliability, ready when I am and ease of finding batteries.  But for $59 she's too cheap to replace and I can afford better.<br /><br />10-10-11 I ended up buy same camera off ebay and love it.  You just cant beat common AA batteries.  My wife bought a camera with rechargable batteries and she cant find the charger anymore.","I have had this camera for 2 years now. It has its pros and cons.<br /><br />Like everyone else, the battery life is terrible. Others say that you need a lithium battery which I have not tried. Regular AA batterys only lets me take about 25 pictures.<br /><br />Also, it is slow and has long delay when shooting picture. You definatly miss the moment you are trying to capture.<br /><br />Pros: It is pretty user friendly. I love how it hooks up to my computer and downloads VERY easy. Anyone can do it. You dont need to be a rocket scientist on this one.","I've had my camera for a bit over 4 years now, and it still works great. I know the problem that the previous person has had, but I figured out how to fix it somehow (probably something with the batteries). This camera takes 2 double A batteries and I use the rechargable ones. However, the batteries don't have much life in them after a year and run out of juice pretty fast so I always have to bring lots of spares (think like 3 replacement sets for an event where you take lots of pics).<br /><br />It does take video, but the quality isn't worth it for the 60 seconds you get. There is no sound recorded for the video.<br /><br />The best thing I can say about this camera is that if you know how to use it well, it takes really good quality pictures. Get familiar with the different settings and learn how to control what the camera does, and with that I'd argue it is almost as good as my friend's $300 camera for sheer beauty of pictures. The only glitch is I hate the flash. I just don't tend to like pictures with flash anyways, I like the more yellowy natural light look. I also tend to have a problem with red-eye with regular flash so I always have to use the red-eye reduction setting to take pics of people. This camera also comes with a panorama setting which works well with the program that comes with it (with some practice).<br /><br />I really like how you don't need a card reader to download your pics onto your computer - the USB cable (which is a pretty common cable among electronics) plugs right into the camera port.<br /><br />Overall a great camera for its current price, great camera overall in my opinion, and a wonderful camera for learning how to take and edit digital photographs!","This is a great camera, it works really well and we all love it at home !!!. Totally recommended by us :)","Great camera.<br />I still don't understand how this seems to take clearer photos than a 5.0 MP camera.<br />We compared photos from the Olympus and other 5.0 MP cameras and always select the 3.2 MP from this camera over the others.<br />Maybe someone can explain the how and why?<br />Is the Olympus MP mislabeled?<br />This is our second Olympus, with same results.<br />I have had other 3.2 MP cameras which did not take photos as clear as this model of Olympus.","MY FAVORATE CAMERA  ......IT STILL WORKING FINE  ....LIKE IT  ....THNAKS","I've owned this product for 3 years.  The title of this review is my first complaint.  Date stamps are very important when capturing an event and when on vacation.  And I forget easily.  My second complaint is no customizable default resolution setting.  It reverts to the factory default resolution setting every time you close the cover.  Irritating.  Otherwise, I have had no problem in light or dark environments.  Good clarity.  Works well with iPhoto on my Mac.  Definitely not a \"pocket cam\".","After four or more years old reliable is gone.  I must replace her.  Olympus FE-250 I think will be my new camera.  That old 3.2 MP took great pictures for emails and stuff. Yes you can expect two AA batteries per 20-30 pictures, but if you use it on the go, and infrequently it's perfect.  5 stars for reliability, ready when I am and ease of finding batteries.  But for $59 she's too cheap to replace and I can afford better.<br /><br />10-10-11 I ended up buy same camera off ebay and love it.  You just cant beat common AA batteries.  My wife bought a camera with rechargable batteries and she cant find the charger anymore.","I have had this camera for 2 years now. It has its pros and cons.<br /><br />Like everyone else, the battery life is terrible. Others say that you need a lithium battery which I have not tried. Regular AA batterys only lets me take about 25 pictures.<br /><br />Also, it is slow and has long delay when shooting picture. You definatly miss the moment you are trying to capture.<br /><br />Pros: It is pretty user friendly. I love how it hooks up to my computer and downloads VERY easy. Anyone can do it. You dont need to be a rocket scientist on this one.","I've had my camera for a bit over 4 years now, and it still works great. I know the problem that the previous person has had, but I figured out how to fix it somehow (probably something with the batteries). This camera takes 2 double A batteries and I use the rechargable ones. However, the batteries don't have much life in them after a year and run out of juice pretty fast so I always have to bring lots of spares (think like 3 replacement sets for an event where you take lots of pics).<br /><br />It does take video, but the quality isn't worth it for the 60 seconds you get.

From the start, I was amazed at the incredible detail and picture quality available from a 3.2MP camera.  I'm not a professional photographer, but I've had some education, and I do know perhaps a little more about photography, lighting and composition than most novices.<br /><br />I've owned a Nikon SLR and shot on little else but Kodachrome 64 since the mid 80's.  I'd figured that this digital camera would serve as a backup to my Nikon, and get very little actual use.  In fact, just the opposite has occured.  The Nikon sits in its bag with its array of lenses, flashes and filters, and I reach for the Olympus when I go on vacation or attend a family function.  It's just so easy to use, and while the white balance and exposure may not be perfect all the time, they're very, very close.  I have shot some really incredible photos with this little camera, including some of my younger daughter's wedding which actually turned out better than the hired photog's pictures.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this camera is its tendency to cause red-eye, which is due to the fact that the flash is so close on axis to the lens.  This is just the way it is in a camera of this size and price, and is not a fault unique to Olympus.<br /><br />I also had some problems getting the camera to power up so that I could download photos from it to my computer when it was new.  Since then, I've discovered that this was a bug related to the firmware in the camera when used with a computer that runs an AMD based chipset, like my Compaq 6430NX Presario.  I solved the problem by buying an externally powered USB hub, and plugging the camera into that.  No more troubles.  I've since learned that Olympus has a firmware upgrade for the camera, but it requires that the camera be returned to them.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, one needs to understand the workings and limitations of alkaline batteries, and why they're not a good choice for this or any other digital camera.  They're fine for penlights and garage door openers, but not cameras.  I used the set that came with mine only to power up the camera long enough to become familiar with the menus, then I threw them out and bought some NiMH.  In the end, I think the problems that most people have experienced with this camera are due to a lack of understanding of how the camera works, and what its limitations are.<br /><br />Since I've had the camera for almost 3 years, I was thinking of upgrading to a Canon A620, but I still like the picture quality of the D560 so much, that I can't as yet really justify spending $350 or more on a new one that will likely just duplicate what I've already got.","I have had the pleasure of owning this camera since Sept. 03 when I purchased it on my way to a military deployment in Kosovo. It worked great in all situations that is found in the moist cold environment of the Balkins in my 9 months there. I was thinking of replcing it with a new higher MP camera for my recent deployment to Iraq however I have been putting it off for some time because the darn camera is still kicking. It barely has any silver paint left on the plastic body. I have taken literally thousands of pictures gigabytes of space on my hard drive are filled with pictures from everywhere I have traveled. The LCD still works fine, the flash still works, perfectly, it functions flawlessly even after a 120+ degree Iraqi summer. After my stay in the sand box for the next year it will probably become a hand me down to one of my friends who doesn't have a digital camera. Although this model is kind of old it would still make a great bargain priced camera for anyone who wants to get a lot of bang for their buck. Keep in mind this camera is not designed to use AA batteries, they work in a pinch but not for very long.","I bought this for my mother's lst digital camera.  I have had several Olympus cameras and this one is just right for her.  She is very pleased with it - relatively easy to use, great photos and small enough to carry in her purse.  I got a very good price and for the money this is a very good value.<br /><br />Because of the reviews regarding battery problems, I got her the NiMH rechargeable batteries, with charger, and she has had no problems at all.","I really enjoy having this camera. As a music student, I'm busy, I don't have time to fuss with a camera, and this one has continued to hold up to my mild abuse. It's sturdy, compact, durable, and lives in my backpack all the time, unharmed.<br /><br />For a point-and-shoot camera, it produces many high-quality pictures (all of the example photos are ones I took), and the camera is really easy to learn to use. I have been really pleased with it, and from what I've seen, this camera stands up to entry level professional SLR's. I purchased a 128 card, and can get ~190 top resolution pictures out of it. The camera easily adjusts to the situation, regardless of light levels or lighting fixtures, especially if the flash is turned off. One drawback in my mind is that the camera is always on auto flash, and as I use the camera at night, I don't like to have to turn the flash off every time I turn the camera on.<br /><br />About the batteries: I generally use alkaline. I generally use the viewfinder and not the lcd screen, as one can always check the picture right after it's taken (each picture displays on the screen regardless...). It's also very easy to access the view-only mode, which can be on for extended periods of time even when the camera itself doesn't have enough juice. In continuous use, a set of alkaline batteries generally last 2-2.5 hours. Also...if it dies, you can turn the camera off, wait about 30 seconds, and it'll be fine for another 5-10 pictures. (This method can be repeated about 40 times before it really dies.)<br /><br />The movie mode is nice, quick, and doesn't take up too much space. Depending on battery life, you can record up to 30 secs, but my camera generally averages about 15. Also, the digital zoom function is nice, but I've found that it takes time to get to, and I don't really use it anyway.<br /><br />When I first got the camera, I dropped it and had to send it in to be fixed. The service was very prompt, free, and the Olympus people have been VERY helpful and easy to work with. The software that comes with the camera \"Camedia Master\" is easy to install and very easy to use. It has all of the editing tools that the average person needs (\"instant fix\", crop, contrast, colour balance, brightness, lightness, saturation levels, resizing tools, a couple fun effects, etc.), and a very thorough help section.<br /><br />Overall, I have been very impressed with this little camera, and it suits my purposes exactly. The only major drawback is that it makes me dream of $1,500 SLR's.","This camera is great, and also horrible.  I've had it for about a year now.<br /><br />Great<br /><br />-----<br /><br />o Lightweight<br /><br />o Very small and portable<br /><br />o Cheap<br /><br />o Cool \"macro\" mode for close-ups<br /><br />o Nice 3x optical zoom<br /><br />o Takes great outdoor pictures in full sun<br /><br />o Takes great indoor close shots<br /><br />o Hold a LOT of pictures in a 256MB xD card.<br /><br />Horrible<br /><br />--------<br /><br />o Eats batteries - of all types - forget Alkalines - takes maybe 20 photos, with Lithium, takes maybe 50.  With NiMH, it will do about 100, but like another reviewer said, it quits long before the battery is discharged.  And when it quits, it usually \"hangs\", making you remove the batteries and put in fresh ones just to close the door (and losing the last shot you took).<br /><br />o The flash is a real joke.  If you use the zoom at all, then the photos are very dark and unusable.<br /><br />o Once you take a photo (especially with the flash), there is a considerable time before you can take the next one - not as bad as on my FIRST digital camera (also an Olympus), but bad enough so that you miss half of the wedding party when they are walking SLOWLY down the isle.  Also when you want to take that second shot of a group, they get impatient with you as you stand there and keep pushing the button and nothing happens.<br /><br />o The \"macro\" mode still gives blurry pictures sometimes.<br /><br />o The (optional) underwater housing is cute, albet bulky, but the photos you take with it are not clear (because of the bad flash).","On the down side, Battery life is not long and the camera is slow to respond.  One the good side it does take good pictures.","Takes very good quality photos, but the batteries run out after a day of use. It also freezes up quite a bit-i.e. you can't close the front bc the lense will not retract.","Small, cute and easy to use. I love the MACRO. Have taken more than 20,000 photos with it and it's great. Only drawback is battery consumption - eats up AAs and spits them out.","I bought this one after much research when my Fuji A210 was lost.  As other previous reviewers have said, it takes great outdoor pictures as long as I choose the right white balance for the lighting. Pictures are sharp and color is saturated. As for the indoor pictures, the objects need to be within the flash range. If they are within 10 ft, the camera takes great pictures. But as soon as the objects are beyond 10 ft or so, the pictures become bad (very blurry and dark).<br />As for the batteries, I experienced no problem as long as I used 2000 MAh NiMH batteries. One thing I did notice was that when I took many shots in short time frame, the low batter warning showed up even though the batteries were relatively fully charged. But instead of replacing the batteries, I let them \"recuperate\" for about 10 seconds. After that, the full battery meter returned and I could take many more pics.<br />It does have a long shutter lag. But if you focus first (let the green light come on) and shoot, you can compensate for it.<br />This camera does not have many features like Canon A70 (such as aperture priority, shutter priority, and video with sound) does.  But it does have 4 scene modes and 4 white balances. It's a good entry-level 3MP digital camera for people who just want clear pictures.","First of all, please note that the clam-shell design for this camera (D560) is NOT weatherproof - it has no rubberised seals & liners like the Olympus Stylus series (models 300/400/410).  So, if protection against the elements is a must, buy one from the Stylus range instead.<br />This camera is indeed a real battery hog as reported by other users, because last year I was testing my colleague's newly purchased D560 unit (known in Europe/Asia as C-350) when it drained 2 new alkaline batteries empty in less than 40 minutes.  On a trip to cold Korea last year, he had also reported on the need to remove and reinsert his 1800 mAH NiMH rechargeable batteries every now and then in order to continue using them with this camera.<br />Nevertheless, I have seen several hundred photos taken with his Olympus D560 and they were so sharp, colorful and contrasty that I decided to buy this camera as a secondary 'pocketable' unit to my existing Canon Powershot A80, which was too heavy for the purpose.  I had also figured on using higher capacity rechargeable NiMH batteries of 2100 mAH to tame this power-hungry beast.<br />Then the new Olympus D540 model (known in Europe/Asia as Olympus C-310) arrived, together with a multitude of improved features such as:<br />1) 2 macro modes for close-up shots: 20cm 'Macro Mode' and the new 2cm *'Super Macro Mode'.  The latter enables you to take fantastic close-up photos from as near as 0.8 inch (2cm) away & above.  In contrast, the D560 only has the 20cm 'Macro Mode' and at a best close-up distance of 8 inches away, is way inferior to competing Canons and Nikons that can go as near as 2 inches (4-5cm);<br />2) extended shutter speed range of 1 second to 1/2000 seconds, compared to the D560's 2 seconds to 1/1000 seconds;<br />3) faster lens aperture range of f2.9 to f5.0, compared to f3.1 to f5.2 for the D560;<br />4) option to save pictures in 2.0 Megapixels aside from 3.2 Megapixels and VGA size; the D560 has the less popular option of 1.0 Megapixels in between 3.2 Megapixels and VGA size;<br />5) flash located further away from the lens to reduce red-eye effects compared to that on the D560;<br />6) lighter camera body at 150 grams, compared to 170 grams for the D560, and finally,<br />7) cheaper than the D560! (although this is actually a price savings, and not a real camera feature)<br />*'Super Macro Mode' is really a hidden Ace, as it is hidden away in the menu option & was not much advertised by Olympus (if at all).  You can check it out under Page 61 of the downloadable user manual for D540 at Amazon.com.  As far as I know, no other cameras in this price range (and significantly above) can get you this close: 0.8 inch (2cm).<br />In case you are wondering, I wish to emphasize that the Olympus D540 (3.2 Megapixels) is actually the NEWER camera, and this D560 model is the older one - Olympus seems to have a confusing habit of naming its newer, budget models with decreasing model numbers instead of progressive model numbers like its own higher range.<br />To be fair, the new D540 lacks the following when compared to the D560:<br />1) clam-shell design of the D560; the D540 now uses a sliding power switch (with lock button) at the rear to activate the camera.<br />2) video-out port (for direct playback to TV); it is unlikely that you will miss this, as the built-in 1.8 inch LCD screen is adequate for playback review.  However, if you absolutely require this video-out port, then you must choose the D560 over the D540.<br />3) spot-metering mode; personally I don't miss this at all, since I don't even use it with my Canon A80.  I find the 'digital ESP metering' mode provided good enough for practical use.<br />With the overall improved features built-in and lower price, I bought the D540 of course, and am glad to say that rechargeable battery life (NiMH, 2100mAH) on my D540 is actually ok - no incidents ever of taking 20-40 pictures only as was previously reported for the D560.  Admittedly, the D540 does suffer from a premature low-battery warning indicator - see my Olympus D540 review at Amazon.com dated May 27, 2004 if you are interested.<br /><br />MY ADVICE: Consider the newer Olympus D540 model first, although either one will definitely help you take excellent pictures.","This camera is perfect for the average amateur photgrapher. The resoultion at the higher pixel range is incredibly clear and the camera has a useful function of reducing the resolution of pictures (whilst keeping the higher resolution one stored) and allowing you to e-mail them (I am not sure if this is standard in most digi-cams). I am satisfied with it. Of course, you must get rechargeable batteries; 1800 mAH ones are quite good.","Batteries: 1)Yes, the D560 can go through batteries, but as others have said, buy some NIMHs, always carry a spare charged set, and you won't have a problem.  Lithiums are a nice idea, but they're expensive. 2)Use the viewfinder, not the LCD.  ALL digitals will drain batteries much more quickly with the LCD on.  Besides, when you're outside in bright light, it's hard to see the LCD screen at all.<br />Quality:  I was astounded at the quality of pictures I get with this camera.  Color is wonderful and clarity is great.  I've never had a fuzzy picture - indoors or out, low light or bright.  Not so with my SLR.  I love the immediate feedback - if you don't like it, retake it.  Of course, that doesn't work well with spontaneous photos of people, but I don't think I have any less success with my digital than I did with my SLR.  At least with the digital I know what I got right away, and can try again.<br />Ease of use:  Accustomed to a bulky SLR, I didn't think I'd like using such a small camera, but once I got used to it, I love it.  The 560 is lightweight and fits easily in a pocket.  I carry it with me everywhere I go.  I couldn't do that with my SLR.  As a result, I take way more pictures than I used to.  I just wish Olympus provided a slipcase with it to protect the LCD screen.  I ended up buying a sunglass case to protect it from things like pens and nail clippers in my purse.<br />I bought the D560 a year ago to replace our broken 35mm point and shoot back up camera.  My main camera was a Minolta SLR.  Since I loved my SLR, I leaned toward buying a Minolta digital, but after some reasearch and a lot of reviews, I decided on the Olympus D-550.  When I went to buy it, I found that I could get it's replacement, the 560 for the same price, so I decided to go for it.  The only time I've been disappointed with the D-560 is when I dropped it and broke the lens... and that was my fault.  As to my SLR, I finished out the roll of film that was on it, and it's been in my closet ever since.  I've been thinking about giving it away because I don't see myself ever using it enough to make it worth keeping.<br />As for my broken D560, Olympus said that the standard charge for repair and servicing is $135.  They will let me know if it is more than that and I can decide whether to have them repair it or not.  I fear it will turn out to be \"not economical to repair\" but I think that if I have to replace it, I'll buy another D560.  I'm so happy with it, I don't want to risk disappointment with something that turns out not to perform as well.","I have had a digital camera for several years now.  I bought one of those Sony Mavica and though it's an excellent camera it's heavy and somewhat unhandy with constantly changing disks.  When I got into ghost hunting it proved to be even more unhandy and bulky so I started looking for a light weight easy to use camera.  After looking at several types and makers I decided on this camera though with further  reading after I purchased it I was disappointed with the write up regarding the battery situation.  I'm still using the basic AA batteries but plan to look into the recommended batteries in the near future.  Though being able to use standard batteries was one of the reasons I had purchased it only to find out otherwise.  I found having the viewfinder a plus especially with bifocals and I only use the LCD screen when viewing.  The zoom feature on play back is also a plus when viewing photos closer.  It's light weight and so easy to grab and shoot I'm finding I'm taking more photos than I ever did.  Another plus was the ease in downloading onto the computer using the USB cable and the program which was provided with the camera.  It has the capability of printing a thumbnail sheet with the basic size thumbnail photos to one larger photo.  I'm still experimenting with the many features and each time I use it I'm amazed with what it is capable of.  Other than the battery issue this is an exceptional camera and I highly recommend it.","I really like my D-560.I bought NiMH Batteries for it and the 128mp card. It shoots great macros for my eBay auctions and fabulous scenic pics. Fits in my pocket, needs little light, and lasts a long time with NiMH batteries. Easy to use point and shoot camera. Rich true color quality photos. I am rough on cameras and this takes my abuse. I am very happy I chose the D-560 as a low cost upgrade.","This camera is very easy to use, and the color pictures look great! It came with everything I needed to get started right out of the box.<br />I also got larger a xD memory card (128MB or higher would be about right), a charger, 2 sets re-chargeable batteries, and now I'm set! It's a keeper! There's also an waterproof/underwater housing for it as well.","I just bought this Olympus D-560 camera.It is great!Being from the old school of 35 MM cameras I was hesitant at first but this camera is so easy to set up and use.All you have to do is read the directions!I bought it to basically keep in the glove box of my car.I intend to purchase another Olympus soon,Possibly the C-750.I reccommend getting an ac adapter and a 256 MB card.","I was in the market for a point and shoot camera I could put in my pocket. My requirements were compact, 3.2MP, easy to use, and of course, take great pictures. This camera hits on all of these. I already have a C-3020 from Olympus that is great for more serious work, but was just too bulky for things like taking party pictures, tailgates, and the like. Now I have 2 very good cameras for all occasions.","I admit I am a strong devote of Olympus cameras, going all the way back to my OM2 and tiny XA 35mm cameras. Oly has always figured out how to do good things in small spaces, and this camera is no exception. This is my fourth Oly digicam over the years (D-340L, 460, 2020z), purchased for situations where pocketability is important.<br />First, the much discussed battery issue. NEVER use alkalines. They do all kinds of things to a camera that just isn't built for them in terms of voltage. Use NiMH's, standard CR-V3's or the new rechargeable CR-V3's. With NiMH's and occasional use of the flash, LCD in rec mode, I was able to get 200+ photos easily. With a rechargeable CR-V3 (the DigiPower, sold through Amazon), I got over 180 super high res shots before stopping with LCD always on and flash with every shot. Judging by recharge time I think I had at least another 50-60 shots minimum.  Had I gone easier on the flash and LCD I'm guessing that 450 photos would have been a breeze with them. That's a lot of photography.<br />Color rendition and sharpness are excellent, with colors just a little bit 'harder' than on my other Oly's. I noticed that in very high contrast or backlit situations at infinity the camera tended to opt for a smaller aperture (to gain depth of field?), which in a very few situations caused some blurring of high speed objects. That's fixed very easily by using the spot meter or manually opening the lens a bit.<br />Otherwise, this camera's features are easy to access, the clamshell design is sturdier than it looks and at current prices it's a steal. I'm tempted sorely to leave my heavier 2020z and aux lenses home on my next foreign trip.<br />Here's an update from my original Feb. 20 posting:<br />Just returned from a 12 day trip to the UK. Brought the 560 rather than my larger 2020z and its aux lenses because I was traveling very light -- on and off many trains, hikes to hotels, lots of hoofing around big cities. Took over 600 photos, virtually all in basic point and shoot mode at a mix of resolutions using both spot and standard metering. The good news is that virtually every one of them came out just as I would have wanted, the exceptions being a couple of very high speed trains that would have taxed almost any camera given the angles at which they were shot and light conditions. But most exposures almost perfect, with great sharpness and resolution. My only problem was that when I tested my rechargeable CR-V3s after they sat in my bag for about a week (I had been relying on NiMH's because I brought a charger to charge them for camera, radio, MPs player) both seemed to run down pretty quickly, and, I must say in terms of previous experience, mysteriously. Using NiMH's with lcd on for composition and review over extensive periods I was able to get in 50-60 shots easily.<br />Oddly, since coming home I have used the R-CR-V3s constantly and, oddly, I've had one in the camera working perfectly for over a week -- 70-80 photos with lcd, several downloads to computer.<br />This camera has passed my 'usability' and 'quality' tests with flying colors. I'll continue testing it with the CR-V3s and repost if I learn anything new.","My first advice to anyone looking for a camera of any kind is to buy one from a company that specializes in cameras. Not in televisions and discmans.<br />The second advice is that a company that has a reputation for professional equipment does not necessarily make equally good consumer level products. I make this comment after my experience with Nikon.<br />Now for the D-560 -<br />Firstly - this talk about low battery life on this camera is nonsense. You HAVE to use NiMh batteries - Olympus should have made this amply clear. So ignore these ill informed comments about battery life. One can easily take 50 - 60 pics with plenty of flash and LCD use on one pair of rechargeable batteries. Since the camera uses only one pair of batteries, it is easy to carry a spare that is fully charged.<br />Now for the Pros and Cons -<br />Pros -<br />Takes beautiful and sharp pics. Print them 8X10 and you will be left staring at them. Believe me!<br />Its shirt pocket size - depending on the pocket, even two might fit. Very handy and compact. You will carry it with you everywhere and take more pictures that way.<br />Large 1.8 inch LCD display - bright and nice. Almost occupies half the back.<br />Very quiet mechanism. The sliding plastic cover - that also serves as an on off switch - is a very simple and highly effective solution.<br />Lens and CCD combination takes very sharp pictures with very little noise.<br />Color fidelity and balance is top notch.<br />Powerful flash.<br />Contains the basic controls one might want in a P&S. Including, night mode, macro, potrait, backlight etc..<br />It is possible to use landscape/potrait mode to switch between max aperture and min shutterspeed exposure options. Very handy - can make up for the lack of exposure controls if you want to become creative.<br />Exposure control is accurate.<br />Uses standard batteries - so it is possible to use regular AA ones in an emergency. They work reasonably if you don't use the LCD.<br />Reasonably fast startup and quick shot to shot times because it seem that the XD card has fast write times..<br />Now for the cons -<br /> uses XD cards - and these cost almost twice as much. Add its cost to the price of the camera.<br />Add the cost of a charger and set of batteries as well. (I recommend the panasonic charger+batteries). However, your charger/batteries have other uses as well - like use them in your discman. In many cases you might already have them with you.<br />Movie mode does not capture audio.","This is a great little digital camera for the money and I haven't had any problems since putting in the Ni-MH rechargeable batteries, though I didn't like that the original batteries died within like a month.<br />Everything else about this digital camera is up to par for me, including easy set-up and use.  Basically, you should have a nice set of good rechargeable batteries for something like this ANYWAYS, as you're going to always want batteries that work in a camera, so why not splurge a bit initially so you don't have to pay a fortune down the line?","I've been using this camera to send digital photos to my freinds and relatives since April of 2003.  I love it and would not use anything else.  In my opinion a good digital camera is all about three things: image quality, ease of use, and size.  The Olympus D-560 scores big in all three areas.<br />The image quality is great.  This particular camera seems to do an exceptional job of adjusting to whatever lighting conditions I'm shooting in.  I often compare photos I've taken with those taken by freinds or relatives using other digital cameras during vacations or special events and mine come out better.<br />The camera is insanely easy to use.  Just point and shoot, no need to select modes or make any adjustments, it makes most of the adjustments for you.  However, if you want more control the camera does allow you to fiddle around with various specialized modes.  So far I have found such modes unnecessary.<br />The physical size of the camera unit itself is just about perfect for me.  Slightly larger than the palm of my hand, it's small enough to tuck into a pocket or bag with ease, but it's not so small as to make it awkward to hold and aim.<br />After using this camera for 8 months I have discovered some drawbacks.  First, my camera did NOT operate well on standard AA alkaline batteries.  It was constantly locking up, beeping, and generally malfunctioning.  I thought I would have to replace the camera.  Then, on a tip from a freind, I switched to the higher powered CRV-3 Lithium battery, (available on Amazon) and my camera woes were solved.  It's worked like a dream ever since.<br />Second, turning off the camera is kind of clunky and time consuming.  You turn the camera on and off by sliding the front lense cover open or shut.  This is nice and simple, but closing the camera takes some time, as you have to start to close the cover, then wait for the lense to retract back into the case before you can finish sliding the cover shut.  This adds an extra 5 seconds to the end of any photo session before you can stick it in your pocket and move on.  To some this may be annoying, but I've gotten used to it.<br />And lastly, of course, the 16mb memory card that comes with it is too small to be very useful.  (I remember only getting around 17 high quality pictures on a card.)  Invest some money into a high capacity memory card (128 or 256 MB) and you can take hundreds of shots without having to download them or switch cards.<br />So, in summary, great camera.  For better results use a CRV-3 Lithium battery instead of alkaline, and get a big memory card.","I bought this camera for $229, and i think its a really good deal.  i really like this camera because its small, easy to carry around, takes great pictures, and is handy wherever its needed.<br />People give this camera bad reviews for its battery life.  well, this is a digital camera, like most other digital cameras, this of course will eat normal alkaline batteries like pop corn, thats why you spend a little money to buy the lithium crv3 or the Ni-MH batteries.  As for me, i prefer the Ni-MH batteries because not only are they powerful, but also rechargable.  i got 4 batteries, and a charger at radio shack for about 26$ (including tax).<br />so giving this camera bad reviews for batteries is just dumb.  anyway, again, i like this camera a lot, and it takes great high quality pictures, just not always, but even the best of cameras wont always take the best photos in the world all the time.<br />hope you enjoy this camera more than i do.","The Olympus D-560 is a great Digital Camera bargain.  You will get awesome quality pictures, enough megapixels to satisfy the average consumer and a decent OPTICAL zoom.  Don't be misled by the many cheap alternatives that only have digital zooms.  As far as batteries, get yourself a decent set of rechargeables NiMH batteries and you will be fine.<br />At this price, you will not find a better option.  Also, the camera is very compact, but not too small.  Some digital cameras are too small and become cumbersome when trying to handle them.  This one is just right.  Additionally, you can pretty much take it out of the box, insert the memory chip, load the batteries and start taking pictures in a matter of minutes.  It is that simple to use.<br />If you are looking for professional-level pictures, look elsewhere.  If you need a good, solid performer for everyday use, this is the one.","This is a great camera, it takes beautiful pictures. As with any camera you have to know its limitations. For this one of course if you use the alkaline bateries, you will be very disapointed; I always use the CRV3. It cost a little more but for over 200 pictures at the SHQ mode and LCD on most off the times ( I found those bateries on Ebay for about $5.00 a piece) for 2 weeks in Europe taken about 2000 photos I used 8 CRV3. I sugest using the auto mode for all around shooting with flash turn off and take the photo in the shade. avoid bright back ground. Use the AE locked when shooting people ( point the camera 4\" at the face of the person the press AE lock move back compose then shoot). For downloading to the computer, I just use the flash card reader. And for photo editing camedia sofware is great. Fix them up then burn to CD then print them at Sams club for 15 cents each. Finally, for every new camera if you want the have the best photos, you will have to spend alot of times playing with it. For me, it took me 5 month and shoot about over 4000 pictures to get know all its strong point and limitations. I am highly recomended this camera.(I also own the C4000 great camera, a step up from the D560)","I was ecstatic when I purchased this camera a couple of months ago. But was quickly dissapointed when my battery went dead before I took 8 pictures?!!! I waited to install the software because I was unsure if I wanted to keep a camera that would eat batteries everytime I wanted to use it. But I finally did, and what GREAT QUALITY PICTURES! Now the tricky part is to find a battery / chargable system thats compatible and actually works. So when I go on vacation to Disneyland with my kids, I am not worried about the life of my batteries.Instead I can have the time of my life and get great photos!","This is a great Camera.  Easy to use, lightweight and offers the newer XD picture storage technology.  The only problem with the camera is the way it goes through batteries!  newegg.com offers the same camera for MUCH less $ besides the fact that they ship their orders in 1/3 of the time it takes Amazon!","Nice little camera!  Great compact size.  Easy to use features, but menu can be a little complicated.  The XD memory card holds more pictures than the Smart Media card but is more difficult to locate in stores.  Used it for a close-up pictures, with the \"flower\" setting, but the close-up picture were still blurry. However for the price and size a great little camera!  Easy and fast to download pictures to PC!","i bought this camera to replace (at least temporarily) my nikon 990, which i thought an excellent camera.  my big problem with the nikon, besides it having very weird behavior (it now turns on and off at around .5hz) was the shutter lag.  this camera which cost about .3 of the nikon (which, granted was right when it came out) has very little lag compared to the nikon and has almost the same resolution.  i miss the full tiff image of the nikon, though.  however, for regular family type photos, i never used the tiff (uncompressed) option.  i am very impressed with the picture quality and the size.  the zoom toggle is a little stiff, i think.  as far as the battery life...i think that most of the people are doing something very strange.  i filled the card which came with the camera, looked at all the images, deleted about 8 or 9 and took those again.  i looked at those and then downloaded them, cleared the card, and took 6 more images (looking at each after i shot them) and then, the batteries, which came with it were considered expired.  (i read online somewhere that someone actually measured the current draw and found that the camera really only used .667 of the batteries electrical energy.  so, i think i'll use them for something else like my toothbrush.)  anyway, the camera's a bargain and works wonderfully.  i fully recommend it to anyone who wants a family camera.","It's a lovely gadget till the batteries run down. I can get superbly detailed photos with it. I have a 16-MB memory card in my camera. The camera will exhaust two sets of batteries filling the 16-MB card.","First of all, yes it is a glutton for batteries.  I habitually use rechargables anyway and recomend others do the same.  You might also want to get an adapter to run it off house current so you don't run down the batteries while it's hooked up to your PC.<br />As for image clarity, remember that this is a digital camera.  It takes a moment after the button is pushed for the camera to take the picture and it must be held steady until it's finished (the higher the resolution the longer it takes).  This can be difficult especially when trying to use the panorama funtion.  I recomend buying a folding mini tripod to keep it steady.  Also there many presets on the camera that will effect the quality of the picture.  Everthing from flash to exposure time to day or night pictures.  It's a good idea to take a test picture or two to make sure conditions are right.<br />In short, this is not the kind of camera you can whip out at a moments notice and take a quick snapshot with.  If that's what you're looking for them stick to a 35mm.<br />Oh, and it was mentioned in an earlier review that this camera does not save it's settings and funtions such as flash, resolution, and various picture modes must be reset manually each time the camera is turned on.  Not true.  There is a selection in the setup menu which lets you choose wether or not settings will be saved when the camera is off.  Though if it looses power for too long it will return to factory presets.<br />In conclusion, it's a good camera as long as you bear it's limitations in mind while using it.  I've printed out some pictures on glossy photo paper that are indistinguishable from regular photographs.","Maybe it's because I design small electronic devices that I seem to have a better understanding of this issue of the D-560/C-350 and battery life than others. Digital cameras including this one with LCD monitor screens put savage power demands on their batteries. The basic chemistry and construction of alkaline batteries means that they are not able to efficiently deliver power at this very high rate. They just get hot and their voltage drops very quickly, making the camera shut down in a matter of minutes.<br />Olympus have been amazingly short-sighted in supplying a pair of alkaline batteries with the D-560. It's giving users the very mistaken idea that it's designed to use this battery type, when it *isn't*. The manual on the CD-ROM more or less spells it out that alkaline batteries are only to be used as a last resort. OK?<br />Rechargeable Ni-MH and non-rechargeable lithium batteries (CR-V3) have a completely different chemistry. They *are* capable of efficiently delivering the kind of power this camera (and other digital ones) demand, to give a very useful operating time.<br />I've been using 2,000mAH PowerBase Ni-MH batteries in mine, and getting more than 150 photos before one set is discharged. I think that this is perfectly reasonable. The supplied 16MB XD card can only hold about 80 1024x768 pictures after all.<br />The bottom line is this: if you are going to buy this or a similar digital camera, be prepared to buy some Ni-MH batteries and a charger or pay a lot for CR-V3 lithium batteries for as long as you own it. Olympus should make this fact crystal clear in their owner's manual, but they don't.<br />Yes, the D-560 obviously does have a design fault. It will often give the Low Battery warning even on batteries which have just been charged. However mine doesn't stop working, and the flashing red symbol disappears after a while. If you can live with this glitch and are prepared to buy Ni-MH batteries and a charger (or CR-V3 batteries), this is one incredibly good digital camera I fully recommend.","This is a neat little camera. You can zoom, take different resolution pictures, take pics of yourself, and even make short movies. The LCD screen is not bad, but it contributes to the main fault of this camera which is the battery life. Regular alkaline batteries last for 10 - 20 pictures tops...less if you use the flash or use the LCD for a long time.","This is a neat little camera.

For a first-time digital camera buyer, it has been pretty easy to use.  Many have griped about the battery life, but I never have a problem unless I use the viewscreen a lot or if I'm downloading pics to the computer.  You can resolve this problem easily by purchasing a memory card reader for twenty bucks.  It is a little bulky, but it has performed solidly.","Pros:<br /> Camera is great value and has good quality pictures. The video capability is also really quite good although gimmicky..<br /><br /> Pictures print our really well on my Printer (HP 895cxi) which is an in-expensive good value device.<br /><br /> Cons:<br /> The software works well once you get it going.<br /> I'm using and old Windows 98 version and while the software installed it would not run correctly for a couple of reasons:<br /> 1/ The pixel requirements for the software cannot handle the Screen settings being at a low resolution. Without this the system can lock up , the drop down Menu parts of the software also locks up .<br /> This is easily fixed if you guess that the software cannot handle this correctly(aka, this needs fixing by Olympus) .<br /> Change your setup on windows 98<br /> Goto Settings<br /> control-panel<br /> Display<br /> The settings option for pixels needs to be 1280x1024 .<br /><br /> 2/ Must have device(camera) up and powered on initially on the USB port. This may seem obvious , but when you plug the thing on the end of the USB it sits there and the Software just tells you it cannot find the device<br /> suggestion to Olympus-<br /> Tell folks the obvious, make it user friendly software...<br /><br /> Battery Life !!!! is very short , I almost went back to Manufacturer . Maybe there are some helpful tips to save on this while using the camera.","This camera takes GREAT pictures, but like others have said it drains the batteries VERY quickly. If you buy this camera it's worth buying a battery recharger. This is a really good camera!","I was a little weary to get this camera because of what people said about nature scenes being murky on Olympus cameras and because I wanted to totally discontinue photo stores & print all my own photos. Well, this camera fits the bill! I've had it for over a month now & LOVE it! The photos turn out great with excellent detail and very true to life textures & colors! I print with a HP 6110 multifunction printer & the photos turn out excellent!  LOVE IT!","if the OLYMPUS 550 is so good,why did the discontinue the 550 and come out with the 560 model?how can i get an upgrade???????","This is my first digital camera.  I love the large LCD and the ability to delete any pix I don't want.  I took some pix inside and the camera illuminated the pix nicely even with the flash disabled.  To those who say it took poor quality pix: Didja actually read the manual and use the camera the way the manusl said?<br />Outside the camera captures sharp images with good color saturation.  If you take a picture of a moving object it will be blurry, but that's true of any non-SLR camera.<br />The only thing I don't like and which keeps me from giving the camera 5 stars is the short battery life.  I only bought this camera last Thursday and yesterday the battery indicator went red while I was taking pix (yes I was using the LCD to look at them).  It's advisable to carry extra batteries with you.  But overall I think it's a great camera and I'm willing to put up with the battery consumption.","I've been reading some appalling reviews for the D-560, and I can't sit by without asking if we're talking about the same camera? I've had one for two months, and it's the most incredible photo taking device I've ever seen....<br />  If people would take the time to actually read the book instead of putting a pair of alkaline cells into it, pointing it at something, stabbing the shutter button then complaining about the result, they might take decent pictures with it.<br />  This camera is designed for NiMH or CR-V3 batteries (but which are not supplied with it), the book says so. It has auto-focus which takes a moment to lock onto the subject or it will produce blurred pictures. The book explains this. If you move the camera while taking a low-light photo, it will be blurred, as with every camera. Geez!<br />  Very few of the photos I've taken with the D-560 have disappointed me. Many have amazed me and others with their sharpness and rich colour.<br />  I love this camera so much that I've given it a web page to show off what it can do. I'm not allowed to give the URL, but a Google search for 'Olympus C-350/D-560 photo gallery' should find it. ;-)","My first digital camera. Overall I'm very pleased. I've used it for outside and inside shots and am happy with the quality of the pictures. Definately recommend getting the NIHM rechargeable batteries. Regular ones just don't last. Camera is pretty intuitive I thought. Still learning all the bells and whistles. Software program is not as user-friendly as I'd like you have...I haven't used any other dig camera to compare but so far I'm happy with this one I think its great for general use and overall friendly to get comfortable with quickly.","Everytime I use this camera I'm amazed at the quality - for the price. Just so you know, the camera always defaults to the WIDE ANGLE lens - which distorts the picture. If you want a true flat image, you have to remember to zoom in a little less than half-way to the TELEPHOTO lens. BATTERY LIFE SUCKS, pulls, drains, (however you want to say it) the juice from the AA batteries in about 2 - 2 1/2 hours. I've tried using this with and without the viewer. I'm afraid to but the $... nicad for fear that it will only last 4 hours.","My husband and I absolutely love this camera.  We purchased it for many reasons - but one of them is because we have a baby on the way and wanted digital pictures because it is easier to share via the internet with family members.  We are CONSTANTLY commenting on what a great buy this way.... We love our camera!  The photos are wonderful quality, and the 3.2MP is perfect for our needs.  With a 64MB card, you can take 81 of the largest size pictures, and we haven't needed more than that at one time.  It is SO VERY user friendly, and useful in all indoor and outdoor situations.  I highly recommend this camera to everyone looking for a great buy!!!","First thing is I want to say was this was supposed to be my first digital camera.  I'm a college guy and I bought this for a cancun trip after seeing great reviews for its predecessor D-550.  But after a week, I got rid of it.  Don't get me wrong, this was a great camera.....but only outdoors in FULL and I mean FULL sunlight.  When it came indoors I was very disappointed.  Yeah I did my research and I know this camera is only 4 second shutter for night mode.  The thing is I took pictures indoors with real bright lights, and 7 out of 10 came out blurry.  Moreover, when I mean blurry, I mean unrecognizable like everything was moving, not noisy where if you zoom in the picture it becomes less sharp.  I tried different modes but almost all came out blurred.  It might be my camera, but why would it take outstanding outdoor pictures yet take blurred out indoor images of still objects with flash???  I thought it was maybe because it needed to be steady, and it got a little better when I placed it on a tripod.  But who would carry a tripod in cancun in the clubs and beach at less than full light?  Maybe someone who wasn't there to have fun, that's who.<br />My opinion is get a Canon A70 for around the same price.  I did, and even though the picture quality wasn't as sharp outdoors as the D-560, the indoor shots far outweigh the outdoor images.","Pro: I just love the camera!  It takes beautiful, clear pictures, especially outdoors.  I tried taking some shots indoors too and they turned out very clear also.  It is perfect for taking still objects. The functional buttons are, to me, a little bit confusing to use, but if you read the manual, then it should be easy.  The camera looks elegant and it is comfortable to handle.<br />Con: Battery life is too short, 2 AA Alkaline batteries are only good for about 6 pix (if you review them everytime).","Pros: Great software, panaromia mode, nice clear lcd, and quick download of pics to pc.<br />Cons: Some blurryness if you take pictures in motion, Battery life, and the way the lens expands.<br />This camera was easy to use. Tested this camera side by side with other cameras in the same price range and this one took better pictures. The included software is really easy to use. The camera has two issues. The first downfall with this camera is the batteries. BE SURE TO CARRY AN EXTRA SET OF BATTERIES AT ALL TIMES. We were changing batteries about every 40 pictures or so....which is very easy to do in a short amount of time with the \"rapid fire' mode. The other downfall of this product is the media card. The media card is not compatable with our printer's (HP 2210) smart card reader ports. Even with these little issues it still is a great camera to own.","This camera is very easy to use. I haven't even read the manual yet. It also takes great pictures. I originally went for a Fuji camera but after looking it over at a retailer, I decided that it was a little flimsy. The D-560 is built well. The only problem I have found so far is that it eats batteries very quickly. This may be normal for digital cameras but since I've never had any experience with them it was a surprise to me. The camera comes with two AA batteries and has a spot to plug-in an external power source (which doesn't come with the camera). I am trying out rechargable batteries but my friends tell me that lithium batteries are the way to go.<br />I have taken some nice super high quality photos and printed them on photo glossy paper with excellent results.<br />A great camera. I definitely recommend it."]},{"name":"Kodak DX6490","amazon_reviews":["1 of the best buys I found.","The DX6490  good camera for my needs.

Now I am very happy to once again have a dx6490.","When I bought this camera I did not knew anything about cameras. I has all the right ingredients for you to learn how to take great pictures. It helped me learn how to use the aperture, how to manage the light, get away from that awful auto-picture taking. I still have it after 6 years and it just won't die. I thought about selling it but am attached to it.","I've had a DX6490/dentist specs for over 5 yrs. It has been used (and abused) and about a month ago turned out to have a problem that technicians weren't able to  fix.  Turned out to be better for my practice to try and find a refurbished or used one, since it is perfect for our purposes (easy to use and gets the job done with great detail).  A little sorry that since it is not modern (and being outdated) is kind of a sin these days', so I think I will purchase a couple more just to have the spare parts.  I LOVE THIS CAMERA.","I purchased the DX6490 because it is one of but a few budget-priced cameras that supports a lense adapter. My cousin has made every excuse not to reproduce a family portrait under glass and it became obvious that at least a polarizing filter was needed. The DX6490, with the rare lense adapter and requisite filter kit, has proven to be an excellent machine to photograph the difficult subject of portraits under glass. Glare is virtually eliminated and the quality is quite acceptable. The unit is used, but still the batteries hold a respectable charge. The only drawback is Kodak's diabolical multifunction power, etc. rotary switch that demands a fair amount of dexterity to operate.","I've had many cameras, both film and digital, and this one by far blows the others out of the water! A friend of mine bought a 6490 new a few years ago and raved about it - her photos were so amazing. So last year when I was in the market to buy a camera, I looked it up on Amazon. I was so glad to see that not only did they include the camera specs, tons of user reviews, and even a couple for sale used through the Marketplace, but also over 100 photos taken by other owners that I got to appreciate! That convinced me to find and buy one used on eBay, which I did.  I was lucky, the camera was in excellent condition and have had no trouble with it.<br /><br />It may be an older model, but the operation of this camera is so simple compared with the new ones out on the market today! I had use of a 10MP Canon camera for a while thinking I might want to upgrade this one, but it took way too long to figure out the controls which were tiny, and after reading the manual and taking many, many photos over the course of several days using various settings, the photos were often blurry, even with image stabilization built in! I found I didn't need the extra pixels after all, and I think they actually slowed down the camera's operation.<br /><br />I do love how the 6490 feels in my hands, too - not too big, not too small (like the Canon). Most of all I appreciate the fact that I don't feel the need to \"upgrade\" as long as I keep getting this kind of stellar quality in my photos!! Sure wish it used AA batteries, though - that's the only drawback to this camera that I can see!","I haven't had this camera very long, but am very impressed with it. As a retired professional photographer, my standards are pretty high, and this puppy with its Schneider lens takes fantastic detail. Shot a picture of my dog's face at full optical telephoto, and every hair is sharp. Commenting on some of the criticisms of this camera. Telephoto is 380mm equiv. If you don 't have it on a tripod it won't be sharp. True of all long teles on all cameras, including those with OIS. Dark pictures inside. Haven't had a problem. Since this is one of the very few prosumer cameras that will take an add-on flash, if I need light, I'll put my big Vivitar 283 on it and can light up a gym. Dinky built in flash on any camera is strictly for close (under 4 meters) shooting. Delay in shooting after pressing shutter button - true of every digital camera. To get sharp pictures turn off the digital zoom. It's a gimmick on all cameras. Comparing this camera with Nikons and other digital prosumer cameras I have owned, the Kodak DZ6490 wins hands down. At under a $100 used its an incredible buy.","Great Camera. You won't be disappointed!  I bought this camera new years ago. I still have it and I am thinking about buying a second as a spare. The video is kinda small but the pictures are incredible. I have sent some pictures in and had them blown up. They looked so good I could not believe it was a digital camera. This camera once sold for $600.00. The dock works great also. Kodak keeps its software updated. I just downloaded the newest update yesterday.","I used this great camera for about 5 years before upgrading to a Nikon D90.  It did extremely well","I was given this camera as a graduation present in 2005 and I still have it and it still works, it is fantastic.  I have taken many pictures with it, never yet had to buy a new battery for it, and as for the software not the best out there but it really istn't that difficult to use as many reviews say.  There are other tools out there where you don't have to even hook up your computer and camera together.  This tool converts your memory card into a USB port and downloads all the pics. I would recomend this camera to anyone it is really a great camera to use.","I picked this camera over 3 years ago and am still using it, and selling some of the pictures I take.  The depth and clarity of this camera is almost as good as my Rebel xti but whereas one is a serious camera, the kodak is my hiking, kayaking, biking, camping and everyday camera. It's taken quite a few bumps and knocks and bounced back.<br />Not to heavy or cumbersome, a fantastic camera.  As a matter of fact I'm actually looking to buy another one for my son.","this digital camera is easy to use.  of course, you must read the owner's manual to use it properly.  it is a bit bulky, but it takes good pictures and , yes, you can share your pixs with friends and family.","I have had this camera for a little over 2 years, and it still takes better pictures than most other point and shoot digital cameras out there.  I'm not a professional photographer or even a very serious amateur, but with this camera I have been able to get great shots of families, little kids, animals, sports, flowers, close-ups, landscapes, and fireworks . . . it even outshoots the cameras my other family members own, and they spent extra money to get higher resolution cameras with even more zoom power. It doesn't compare to an SLR, but it wasn't designed to.<br /><br />I recently bought an ultra-compact point-and-shoot camera at a \"day after Thanksgiving\" sale, thinking it would be an easier-to-transport alternative to the Kodak.  Even though it has higher resolution, I still rarely use it and wind up taking the Kodak with me anyway.  The picture quality is so much better that I don't care how much the camera weighs or how big it is.  I bought this camera because of the big lens, not in spite of it.  If you read the manual and learn to operate the PASM functions, you can get good shots in almost any light.<br /><br />This camera is pretty durable - like any other well-used camera, it's been (accidentally) dropped, subjected to high and low temperatures, gotten water on it, and been handled by several kids, and it still works just as well as the day I bought it.  It's survived 2 years of day camps, fairs, cooking lessons, and even family Christmas dinners.  Everybody wants to borrow this camera, even though most of them own newer, more expensive cameras. The battery lasts an amazingly long time - you will find if you do buy a small camera that runs on disposable alkaline batteries, the extra weight and space you thought you saved will be taken up by spare batteries.<br /><br />A brief warning: to get great photos out of this or any other camera, digital or film, takes PRACTICE.  You should always try using the camera yourself before you buy it, even if it's just in the camera department at a store.  I must warn you that if you don't know much about photography, it won't matter what kind of camera you buy - knowing how to compose a shot, how a camera works, and how to edit photos are vital to getting outstanding pictures.<br /><br />One thing I would suggest is this:  don't waste your time installing the software - buy a cheap USB card reader to transfer your pictures to the computer.  Better yet, make sure your next computer has a built-in card reader.  It saves a lot of time, and if you want to do a lot of editing the included software has only very limited options.  I have found that it's also difficult to find photos that have been stored using the Kodak software if you want to open them in other applications.  That is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.<br /><br />I recently thought about upgrading my camera, but other than the newer SLRs I haven't found anything better that is reasonably priced.","I bought this camera new, and it is worth every penny. I've used it for photos for many websites, personal pix of family, friends and pets, and every picture turns out great. The multiple autofocus options, various settings for daytime, flash, night, sport and portrait photography make picture taking almost fool-proof. Plus, the video cam is great for those times when I just want to pick up a quick short video without hauling out the full-size video camera. The rechargeable battery lasts a long time between charges, so I can take tons of pictures without worrying about losing power. This workhorse lives up to the Kodak reputation.","I've had this camera for 2 years this Christmas.  Overall, for the price it is pretty descent.  The biggest problem I have with it is that indoor pictures are always grayish, unless in a super bright area, with like flouresent lights!<br /><br />Outdoor pictures are great.  To sum it up, great for beginners, and very well lit outdoor settings.","This camera is a very good camera for what it is.  I have taken some great shots that have made excellent 8 x 10'S.  The fact that it has the capability to use an external flash really helped with night time action shots.  I shoot football and racing and it has worked for both.  The only complaint with the racing photography was there is some shutter delay but if you pan with the subject it does a decent job.  If you learn to use the manual modes on the camera you can adapted to most photography situations.  I pushed this camera to its limits for over 7,000 shots and videos combine.  The video mode is nice and does a decent job.  As far as durability it is great I have droped it,  subjected it to intense amounts of dust and dirt, and temperature changes and it has held up great.  Although the battery does tend to drian faster in colder temperatures.  Overall for a point and shoot it is very adaptable and can shoot in various conditions.","I have had mine for 2 years, and never a problem. I've taken it out with me camping and hiking dozens of times, and while I take great care never to drop it it has bounced around in backpacks and is quite scuffed from use.<br /><br />It's easy, takes amazing pictures, and it's never malfunctioned on me. I've taken (and kept, at least) almost 5 GB worth of photos. It also takes newer large-capacity memory cards.<br /><br />ONE complaint I have is the way it turns on. It's on a wheel, which I find a touch annoying, and is fixed in newer versions.<br /><br />When I bought this camera it was $400, and worth it. THe fact that I see it for $175 here is a total steal - you won't regret it!!","I decided to buy this camera close to a year ago because a friend had one, and I love it. (I replaced a lower MP camera I had)  We use it all the time for family pictures as well as my son's football games.  This is where the zoom and action/sports mode come in handy (no more pictures of the whole field, and using a magnifying glass to find the \"star\" of the picture).<br /><br />With my older camera I always had problems with the AA batteries draining very fast.  This camera has a rechargeable battery, that I have probably only had to charge about four times in the last 10 months, and I have taken hundreds of pictures.  The preview screen is also large enough to actually be able to see the pictures.<br /><br />I always have people asking me about the camera and where I found it.  I have been very pleased with this camera, and am not looking for a replacement any time soon!","I own a DX 6490 for two years, I have use it in different circunstances and scenarios, I think is a very reliable camera with some outstandings features (for the camera price) like the 10x zoom and the photos shapeness, the 10X optical zoom is something difficult to find in a low-price camera, I know that it is not perfect but I think is good enough for the price payed for it (back in 2003 were about 400$). The photos quality is pretty good enough I have published some of my pictures on magazines and they look \"professional\" also I have printed some of them and the result is very good, more than what I expected, ofcourse before sending the pictures to printing I did some corrections with Photoshop or ACDSee but thats was just to find the perfection and to correct photografer mistakes not camera flaws.<br /><br />If I have to point some flaws of the camara I have to say that the main problem is the: fast secuence shooting to fast moving objects, because after the first picture is taken the LCD goes black until the camera process that picture (4-5 seconds) I can shoot more pictures but without looking through the LCD so I have to \"guess\" were to aim (remember that the object I'm shooting is moving) and that could generate some empty photos or \"cut\" objects. Also if I shoot five or six pictures in fast secuence the camera would need some 20 seconds to processing all the pics and be ready for the next pictures, in some ocassions that time is just too much (in my case that is a problem, specially when I shoot airplanes flying).<br /><br />About the camera I have to say that the battery is also excellent for me, I have tested it several times to the limit, the battery fully loaded can be good enough for taking between 350 and 400 pictures within some 6 hours with the camera on (obviously using the flash would reduce the number of pictures), thats is equal at the 16MB internal memory and an 256MBs SD memory card almost fulled (so over 260MBs in total),  for me that is just enough for a long day of taking pictures free of thinking in the battery life or in the memory space, if you buy a 512MBs you would have to know that it wont be possible to full it whithin a battery load, so the appropiated SD card is the 256MBs, but if you are planing to use your camera in several days trips(without taking a laptop to download the pictures) a 512MBs SD memory card would give you more space (so if a 256MB gives up to 350pics a 512MBs would provide some 700 pics).<br /><br />I also recommend to buy the Kodak leather small bag, it is just great for carring the camera on the belt or with the shoulder strap.","After a month of research I have found a dream camera.  The picture quality is  perfect for me (an average user)I feel as if I can do so much more than before. The powerful zoom takes some getting used to but reading the manual helped out, and when it works it amazes me just how much I can zoom in. The video quality is great too.  The easyshare software that came with the camera is hard to use, but  that takes nothing away from this camera.  I just don't use the software and find that works best.  Thanks for all the reviews on this camera they came in very handy and you (most) were right.","I'm amazed at the pictures I've taken.  The printer dock photo quality is the best as well.","This camera is a fantastic entry level camera for someone beginning to explore digital photography.  The controls are standard and very user friendly, and the photo quality is very good.  The manual controls seem tricky at first, but after reading the page in the manual about them they're very easy to use and understand.  Yet another A+ product from Kodak!","This was my first digital camera so I didn't really know what to expect. I suppose my greatest hope was that it would take great quality pictures with little or no input from me.<br /><br />And it does a pretty good job of that, for what I have discovered is a really good price.<br /><br />The reasons it doesn't quite earn that fifth star are;<br /><br />1) The dial is pretty stiff<br /><br />2) Exposure and processing time is slow (don't have your one-year-old son do something cute or funny shortly after taking a photo. Make him wait five seconds.)<br /><br />3) Indoor shots without sufficient light are either blurred (if you don't use the flash) or have a very dark background (if you do).","So easy to use I can't beleive it.  I am not good with gadgets at all.  The more basic the better.  With this camera I have the option to be basic or detailed with my photos.  That's a great choice that Kodak has given me!  I did a lot of research before buying a camera with Consumer Reports and other resources before I bought.  It took me over two months to compile my information and purchase this camera.  I'm glad I waited.  My daughter has just returned her second camera (not a Kodak) due to problems she was having with them. Too bad I didn't use the same process when picking my ex-husband!  :)","I bought this camera a couple of weeks back. I took more than a couple of hundreds of photos by now and they really cameout wonderful. The image sharpness is stunning. 10X zoom is more than enough for my level of photographer.<br /><br />I read some reviews about transferring image to computer. I have absolutely no issues transferring images to my computer. It happened within a minute. I like the software that came along with the camera. I am using 512MB SD Card to store pictures. Lot of room for photos.<br /><br />I try to upload some snaps here. Overall, its a wonderful camera with stunning image qualities. So, 5*s :)","This is my second Kodak EasyShare digital camera.  I purchased this model primarily for its 10x optical zoom. It took me a bit to get used to the EVF though.  I shot over 200 photos while on vacation in Maine and the battery held up fine.  I did purchase an extra battery to have on hand when I need it.  I am learning how to use all the other options and have taken some incredible photos.","This is a great camera at a great price and free shipping you can't beat it not even at Wal Mart LOL. I have two of these cameras, I just purchesed some filters and extra lens for it and it's better than my SLR most of the time","We love this camera.  It is so easy to use and takes beautiful photographs.  My husband had a professional photographer tell him that he was impressed with the photos he took with this camera!  You really don't have to know much about cameras to use this one and the screen is large so you can see your pictures better after you take them.  The best camera we have ever had.  Thanks.","I have found this to be a very high-quality camera. The 10X zoom makes for exceptional pictures. It is of the same quality and versatility as an SLR.","This was the first proper digital camera I've bought. I fell in love with it at first, but as I learned more about cameras and wanted to do more things, I noticed its shortcomings.<br /><br />It's a very nice camera for the price, but there a couple cons that really got me:<br /><br />- The autofocus gets confused. While trying to focus, it sometimes gets in focus but then changes and locks in blurry (especially when trying to take close-ups).<br /><br />- While it has a couple things you can set manually, it really doesn't have enough. (Especially with the dodgy AF.) I'd recommend going to a store and trying all the settings before buying it.","very good camera, nice amount of features, the night mode could have been better,pictures show a high amount of detail even when using the optical zoom. The ability to choose color settings and the large display were greatly appreciated. Most ppl rated the camera lower than it deserves cause of the software it comes with but what they should realise is that use of the software is optional you can always use other programs to obtain your pics from the camera.","I bought my first DX6490 about two years ago.  It has produced some great results and some not-so-great. Biggest problem - lag, esp. indoors.  Recycle and \"boot-up\") time isn't great either.  Some fuzzy pics indoors w/o flash.  The little wheel to turn it on / select mode is stiff.<br /><br />For all that - I just bought another for my daughter.  For price and quality I couldn't find anything close.  The 10X zoom was a big factor.  Lens quality.  Sound on the video (some in the price range had no sound).<br /><br />So - I like it; very often the biggest problem is behind the camera.  Some pics (more later) at [...]  My daughter's a better photographer; wait till I get hers up.<br /><br />KMC","This is my 2nd Digital camera (3rd if you count my digital Camcorder, a Canon Optura 200mc which also takes pretty nice still photos) but I wanted a new digital camera just for better quality still photos. I got that and more with this camera! I came on here to read customer reviews after seeing the camera on sale at Circuit City. For the price I can't beleive all of the features, my favorite being the option to take pictures in black and white or sephia, or the timer button and the ability to take pictures in quick succession for sports, or my daughter on her swing! the picture quality is incredible. to round out the whole package I just finished creating my first album through the Kodak website (the software is included) and e-mailed an invitation to friends and family to look at it. I had figured i would probably join shutterfly or similar to do what the kodak website offers for free! I know some reviewers complained about the software but I experienced no problems whatsoever. I don't know how much space the pictures took up, i'm just not that computer savvy to really care. I do know i've got plenty of space available but I suppose if it was a problem the software offers an option to burn your albums to Dvd. if you are looking for an easy to use camera with alot of incredible features at a great price look no further!","I just came back from vacation & took 250 pictures.  They came out great!  Everybody that saw my camera loved it.  I'm very happy with it!","For a long time I've had a little baby normal camera. Finally, I bought myself a digital camera to see what all the fuss was. And now I know.This is a great camera.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />> Amazing memory. I took over 400 pictures and still had room for more.<br /><br />> Has an LCD screen, which really helps out night to see what you're taking pictures of.<br /><br />> An incredible (almost overwhelming) selection of styles to take pictures. You have night pics, normal, manual, portait, camera...I could go on for ever.<br /><br />> Disturbingly good zoom. You can zoom as far as to see the color of someone's eyes at at least 100yds. away. The zoom on this camera is scary good.<br /><br />> For camera mode, the videos created are surprisingly clear with good sound. This is a great camera to double as a camcorder.<br /><br />> Normally this camera takes excellent pictures, but, there are...<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />> A wee bit bulky. Easy to hold in one's hand, but difficult to shove in a camera bag.<br /><br />> The time lapse from the moment you press down on the picture button and the time the camera takes the shot is a little bit too long for my liking.<br /><br />> Sometimes, the camera has a really difficult time to focus on stuff.<br /><br />> While on camcorder mode, you cannot zoom in or out of a shot.<br /><br />> If you're taking a picture into the sun, the picture comes out a little bit funky looking.<br /><br />I'm being a little bit negative. I should stay on the positive. This is an amazing, stunning camera, worth every penny. I love it, and won't be buying a new digital anytime soon because I am really happy with this one. A must-have for any tourist on a trip or photography loving dork like me.","The Kodak DX6490 camera is a quite respectable camera. It's most noticable fault is it's poor low light focus problem which they have changed in the newest model. The software problems are very simple to solve. Don't use the software. Windows XP can handle all the transfer of photos from the camera easily and Adobe photoshop has an entry level free program that does quite nicely. As for the complaints about the video shortcomings, Isn't this a still camera that will take videos as an added attraction?  If you want good video buy a video camera.","Great camera, nice large screen, great resolution and color.<br />Worst Software. I would not recommend this camera based solely on the software. But hardware of the camera is good quality and long lasting. awesome zoom lens.","I've had this camera for 7 months. I like it, but I'm not completely pleased with it. There are some things I don't like about it: 1) It has some trouble focusing, most times in low light, you might get a blurry picture sometimes; 2) It takes too long to focus; 3) In low light, black doesn't always look completely black; 4) Its flash isn't so good. It also has good features: 1) Great zoom; 2) Resolution; 3) PASM mode is good; 4) Very easy to use; 5) Can use accesories (slave flash, filters, etc.); 6) Monster LCD screen.<br /><br />This camera is good, but in my opinion it is best for daylight photography rather than night (indor/outdor).","I Love this camera and the picture quality. The 10x optical zoom blows any 3x away and is worth any extra money. this camera has many extra features to enhance many ways you may want to take pictures. My only disapponitment is that either the zoom doesn't work in video mode or the manual doesn't explain how to use it. I believe the zoom is only for pictures. But it is still a great camera, just not perfect.","Very impressed with this awsome digital. I have a Gateway T150 which is a waste of good money. This camera is far superior. The zoom is right on, and the color saturation really comes through. My partner took his on our recent trip and got awsome great nature shots of eagles and ospreys. Good enuff that he can sell them. My gateway was left in the dust, so I went out and bought this camera and found it is worth every penny. Anyone want to buy a gateway 5 megapix???","I recieved this camera several months ago as a gift. I had never considered using a Kodak camera before as we were very happy with our Canon and had planned on purchasing a better model Canon Powershot. Well much to my surprise this camera is better than I could have imagined!<br /><br />The macros I can get with this camera blow me away. The SLR like grip and style are VERY nice. The 10x optical zoom is amazing. I cannot be more thrilled with this camera.<br /><br />My only complaint is, it does have some difficulty in low light indoor situations. This can be corrected for the most part through image manipulation software however. Outside shots are utterly amazing however.<br /><br />This camera is a keeper. It is super afforable too. I highly recommend it for anyone, beginner to enthusiast!","ALERT: My favorite feature by far is the 6 shot burst. It lets you hold the trigger and take 6 pictures in 2 seconds. If you are trying to capture good action shots or get the perfect smile you need this. When the kids are playing or the parents are visiting I just hold the trigger. Take 20 or 30 shots and discard most of them. However, with this method you will capture photos that will make you the super-hero photographer of the family. The newer 5 megapixel camera cannot do 6 shots (only 5) because is doesn't have enough processing power to capture 6 shots at 5mp. Jumping to 5mp is only necessary if you are going to be printing poster sized pictures or if you don't like to aim. Then you can just blow up your pictures to see if you got anything good and crop out the rest.<br /><br />This camera is awesome. It has terrific accessories. It is simple to use with automatic settings for your spouse who hates your tech toys.<br /><br />Everybody raves over my photos. The camera gets most of the credit. It's also much cheaper than the newer kodak model.<br /><br />Everybody I know who bought a camera with 3x optical is mad at themselves when they see what this 10x model can do.","In short, all the reviews that I read about this camera really solidified my decision to purchase this camera and since I did I have not been disappointed in the ease of use and being that it's a digital camera if you don't like the shot just delete it and take another one.  I also purchased a 512MB memory card and this has increase my memory to over 130 shots in Better quality (3-star), but that can be boosted up to over 600 shots is you go down to the lowest quality possible (1-star). I take shots using the viewfinder rather than the LCD screen because using my face as a prop for my camera gives it a more steady platform instead of trying to hold the camera steady with just my hands as I look into the LCD screen.<br /><br />I have used most of the features on the camera.  The most used feature is the Sport setting because I take a lot of close up shots and this allows for the involuntary shaking that most of us have, especially me.  I have also used the Burst mode, which takes up to six shots in quick order.  I used this when my kids were riding their bikes in the day time.  Using the Video feature is just too easy.  Again, like the other reviewers had mentioned, don't expect video quality from this camera because it's a Camera.  Buy yourself a Video Cam if you want the features, but this camera did very well in both daylight and lowlight for me.<br /><br />All in all this has to be one of the best cameras I have ever had the privaledge to own and operate. My father also loved how much this camera can zoom in and get right \"in your face\" shots without having to get in anybody elses way.<br /><br />Don't try to use the Sport setting in lowlight events and you're zooming in.  I tried to and the shots came out very dark, probably due to the fast shutter speed.  You'd probably be better off using the Manual Modes to get the settings just right.  That's the next feature I'll try.  Good camera.  Can't get disappointed even if I tried.","I bought this camera because of the Schneider lens.  Schneider usually makes lenses for view cameras and medium format cameras.  My other camera is a Hasellblad.  The lens is as good as I had hoped.  It provides all of the crispness that can be had in a 4MP image.<br /><br />When using this camera, keep in mind that the full zoom (optical + digital) is equivalent to a 1320mm lens on a 35mm camera.  This setting is not suitable for hand held photography.  If you don't use a tripod or other support you shuld expect blurred images.  Even the optical only max. of 380mm is not considered a good bet for hand held pictures.<br /><br />The most important missing feature is a cable (or wireless remote) release.  When you do use a tripod with such a light camera you don't want your hand causing it to wiggle.","I have this camera for about a year.  I am happy with the quality of the pictures and the controls I have, and I like the large LCD display.  I would have given the DX6490 5 stars if it is easier to turn ON and OFF.  The ON/OFF function is on a small dial with the rest of the controls.  The tiny handle used to turn the dial is not too easy to control, especially when I am in a hurry.","I just had to write a review for this camera.  Even though I have only had it for about 2 months and haven't been able to really practice with the camera as yet and I'm strictly an amateur trying to learn.  I really like this camera.  It takes great pictures especially on the manual settings but the Kodak product support is TRULY incredible.  I read a review on Amazon.com that really influenced my purchase.  The review really gave a rave for the Kodak support getting his camera back before the Christmas holidays.  He was not kidding.  I purchased the camera from Ebay and it still had about 2 mos left on the warranty.  Well the Easyshare camera dock stopped working so I called the support line.  I was advised to ship the camera and dock together even though I only had a problem with the dock and the camera worked fine.  Well, not only was the camera and dock back in my hands in approx. 4 business days but they replaced the dock AND checked out and cleaned the camera. Also, I called the support line for a problem with the camera making a noise while shooting videos.  It turned out to be the autofocus.  The tech support told me to turn it off when shooting video and it fixed the problem immediately.  How's that for great technical support.  I'm telling you, you can't go wrong with a Kodak product, the service alone is worth the price, especially today with most service centers being really poorly trained and I didn't wait on hold for twenty minutes either it took approximately 5 minutes.  I could make a commercial for KODAK.  I love it.","If you want to be serious in photographing, but you don't have too much professional knowledge about it, this camera is a good start for you.  At least it can provide you with some basic functions of manual photography.<br /><br />The functions of this unit are very user-friendly, even though it took me some time to master all the functions in the beginning.  It's a bit hard to control the right amount of light entering the lens in the beginning, but after you get acquainted with all its light functions, you should not have a problem.<br /><br />The price of the unit is very reasonable and the quality of the picture is no doubt.  I especially like the 10x optical zoom.  With such a reasonable price, you can hardly get something so elaboraed.","Ok, before I got this camera I put alot of thought in it. I had previously owned an Olympus c-720 which was dropped and broken at a club one night. This weekend was my second weekend in a row using the camera. It was great. You can view my pictures at [...] and [...] and view the pics from weekend 1/14/05 and above.<br /><br />Naturally when buying this camera I was looking for great zoom (10X is great for optical zoom) and good in low light conditions. I have seen a couple reviews where people have said it doesnt do well, but take a look at my pics, I beg to differ. I am in no way a professional photographer, so also keep that in mind. The battery life has been exceptional, I shot over 200 pics on Saturday night and did not even have a low battery warning, yet I used the LCD and flash all night.<br /><br />The only downfall I have seen to this camera is the redeye, but I have yet to find a camera that has great redeye reduction, in dark areas even more so.<br /><br />If you have any questions about this camera, feel free to email me at c_lisa28@hotmail.com<br /><br />I was torn between this one and the 7590 but the only difference I have seen is the 7590 is one mp higher...thats about it. For the $100 I say stay with the 6490, amazing camera!","My husband got me this camera for Christmas with the dock/printer.  I love the 10X zoom on this camera!  If you're a parent, you have got to look into this camera for those plays, games and events your children are in.  The camera is so easy to use, you barely need the manual.  The settings range from action, night, portrait, movie etc and are very self explanatory.  The shape and weight of the camera is equivalent to that of a film camera.  I've had digital cameras that are just to small and too light and not comfortable to hold.  The bottom line is that the pictures are clear, crisp and vivid.  I've only had the camera since Christmas Day, but I've already shot, edited (software could be better), and printed many pictures.  I love this camera!","I think for just under $330 this is the best deal for such a high quality camera. Apart from taking still images you can also do movie recordings. We have a 512 MB SD card, which is good enough to take about 250+ pictures along with several short movie clips of 2-3 minutes (although the amount of movie you record is restricted by the size of your memory, so it could go as high as 1hr too if using a 1GB for example)<br /><br />The small disadvantage, a design consideration I would say, is that flash doesn't open atuomatically in dark, so if you forget you could miss a short.<br /><br />I see there are high praises for their newer version DX7590, so with the dropping prices, that seems to be a better deal.<br /><br />Just like to say that don't think a lot if you are researching to buy a camera, go for either a DX6490 or the DX7590, both are excellent.","I absolutely love this camera. I take a lot of personal photos of friends, family, and sunsets ect.. and then frame them for my walls.  I was paranoid to switch to a digital camera at first. I bought this camera when it first came out a year ago and if anything was to happen to it I would replace with the same one or possibly there new one.<br /> I also own a website for real estate rentals that I photo each and every room of the properties and display on the site.  I have never been more impressed with a camera than this one.  I was always an Olympus Fan and Kodak to me was bottom shelf for beginners. I am so glad I took the chance.<br /> It is easy to us for beginners, and easy to learn the more advanced steps. I have used it for Fireworks displays, (including Disney) with out a tripod in night mode and could not believe the results.<br /> For the down side I dont care for the software program they use. However, it is great for beginners to learn on and I do use it to keep my photos organized in albumns.<br />I do most of my editing and so forth thru Adobe photo suite.<br /> If  you are leary about this camera, dont be. My webmaster (who owns a $1000 Minolta) went and bought this camera after using mine for a day. We both have had photos purchased from us that were just look and shoot photos, spur of the moment shots.","I got a DX6490 in June for a trip to Scotland in July. I love the camera and the excellent picture quality.  I took over 300 pictures and a few videos on my trip and have really enjoyed sharing them with family and friends since then.<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews here about the camera and its features and I won't repeat any of them.  But I do want to add comments about the excellent service I have recieved from Kodak.<br /><br />The camera came with a battery charger for the Li-On battery, but it did not include the adaptors for non-US electric outlets.  (The charger, when purchased as a separate item, comes with 6 adaptors).  I called Kodak to see if I could get *just* the adaptors without buying another entire charger.  At first they said that was not possible, but we continued to talk and I explained that I would be going overseas and already had the charger, just missing the overseas adaptors.  After awhile I was put on hold and soon the service rep came back and said they were sending me the adaptors, no charge!!  GREAT.<br /><br />This Fall my camera started giving me problems turning on.  It got to the point that most of the time it would not turn on at all; the screen displayed \"B03\" error and said to refer to the manual.  I changed the battery, I cleaned the battery compartment, I wiggled the lens barrel; sometimes it would come on but usually not.  So in late November I called Kodak again.  They ran me through a few things to try (most of which I had already done) and finally said I would have to ship the camera to Rochester for repair.  I packed it up and sent it in on December 1; I figured there was no way it would be back before Christmas.  Well, much to my surprise they checked it into their system on December 7, fixed it and shipped it back to me on December 10!! It arrived on December 15 and works like new.  The repair slip says they replaced the \"MCU PCB\" whatever that is; plus they did a complete cleaning and restored it to it original condition.<br /><br />So this is twice I've been pleasantly surprised and delighted with Kodak's customer service.  This makes an EXCELLENT product all that much better!","My husband purchased this camera for me Christmas 2003.  I love to take pictures using my daughter as the subject.  This was my first digital camera.  I love the quality of the pictures and its ability to capture images in b/w, sepia, color... It is very easy to use.  However, the software is not so fantastic.  The worst part is that when upgrades to the software become available you have to download them from the computer which takes over an hour.  Kodak will not send you a courtesy upgrade cd.  I would even pay a few $ for this convenience.  They do provide online help where they respond to your email the very next day.  I did have loooots of problems with this software and I am familiar with technology.  I was impressed when I found out that other lenses could be purchased (I guess it is sort of a SLR camera a little...).  I turned off the lights and took a picture of my daughter with her lighted jack-o-lantern for Halloween and took a picture using the night vision and it was so clear, you would have thought that the lights were on.  Overall, good camera, not so sure about the software.","Before I bought this camera \"refurbished\" (slightly used but in appearance like new), I did quite a bit of research, including reading all the customer reviews on the Amazon website.<br /><br />There are features to like about this camera.  One is the large, easy-to-see LCD display.  The second is the excellent layout of the controls, particularly the review and delete buttons.<br /><br />The test of a good camera, though, is whether it accurately exposes in a variety of lighting conditions, and the DX-6490 does not.  You can get excellent pictures with this camera some of the time if you are willing to make the effort to learn to use it, but I think it is flawed in two ways.  First, it tends to overexpose in bright light and underexpose in dim light.  Second, the image you see in the LCD display is not necessarily the image you get when you make the exposure.<br /><br />It's true that you can dial in exposure compensation, but this is a nuisance if you have to do it often.  Worse is that an image that in dim light appears correctly exposed on the LCD display will turn out to be dark or even invisible.  You can use the flash, but I feel that what you see on the LCD display is what you ought to see when the exposure is made.<br /><br />My first digital camera is a two-megpixel Olympus D-380.  The exposures are excellent in virtually any kind of lighting.  White balance is superior to that in the DX-6490, and I feel that color rendition is better too.  I wanted a zoom lens, and I wanted higher resolution, but the various exposure flaws in the DX-6490 are a major disappointment to me.<br /><br />Would I choose this camera again if I could choose?  No.  From now on I will buy a camera only if I have the option of returning or exchanging it if I do not like its performance.","This is my third digital camera in five years.  I take a lot of pictures, and this camera is the best I have ever used.  I have owned this one for about four months and have used it in every lighting condition capturing great photos each time.  The 10X optical zoom is wonderful.  In good light with a steady hand even the 40X (10X optical by 4X digital) takes high-quality photos.<br /><br />In low-light (without the flash), you will want to use a tripod or set the camera on a steady surface because the slow shutter speed will give result in a blurry picture.  The manual settings give you the freedom and versatility to take pictures in all conditions.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I would change it is the amount of time that it takes between pictures.  It is better than most cameras, but the Kodak DX6490 is such a top-performer you will expect more.<br /><br />It did not take me long to decide to purchase a 256 MB memory card for the camera.  Without it, the camera holds about 15 pictures.  With the card I have taken close to 200 pictures over a three-day outting and did not run out of memory or battery power.<br /><br />The video mode is great too.  It is much higher quality than I was able to capture with my Sony Mavica.<br /><br />This camera takes great pictures, is easy to use, and will allow you to take professional quality photos with minimal effort.  I highly recommend it!!!","I've had several digital cameras over the past few years and this one is by far the best.  I did lots of research before selecting the DX.  I was looking through Consumer Reports magazine and noticed that this particular model is the best they tested in the 4MP group.  The zoom is great, I took it to a basketball game and was able to take pictures of my friends way on the other side of the court.","First let me say that I'm an experienced 35mm photographer.  Having used everything from an Exakta VX to Nikon N90s, and using a Canon EOS Elan IIe for the last several years, I didn't expect to find a digital that I could afford that I would be happy with.  I saw this camera a while back at Wal-Mart, and looked at it because I thought it was an SLR.  I was impressed by the price and the Schneider-Kreuznach lens, but a little disappointed that it wasn't really an SLR.<br /><br />Last week, I found it on clearance at Staples for $100US less than it usually sells for elsewhere and bought it.  I'm not sorry at all.  In everything from convenience features to quality, I'm still thrilled.  Pictures are sharp, properly-exposed, and colorful, just like they should be.  The preview screen is the largest available, and excellent.  The electronic viewfinder works well and is nearly as sharp as the screen on back.  It's easy to use, takes great pictures, and is essentially silent if you turn off the ersatz \"motor drive\" sound.<br /><br />Let me address the shortcomings mentioned by other reviewers.<br /><br />1.  Blur.  Many people mention blurry pictures as a criticism of this camera.  They probably don't mention that they were trying to handhold shots at full zoom.  The lens is 38-380 equiv. in 35mm terms.  I always used 1/focal length as a shutter speed guide.  It would be bright conditions indeed for the camera to select 1/380 sec.  The camera can shoot from ISO 80 to 400 with acceptable results, but 80 is by far the best and the camera does default to 80 if it possibly can make the shot that way.  This might sometimes mean that you have a vivid picture that's motion-blurred.  If you can keep a reign on trying to use more zoom than you have the hands for, you won't encounter blur.  Also remember that focus precision is more important at longer focal lengths.  It takes longer to focus when it's zoomed all the way out.<br /><br />2.  Bad night pictures.  I've not encountered a camera that has a night mode that's better than I am.  If you take over control of this camera, you can get great night pictures.  I shot pictures of the stars last night, and they came out perfect.  Most of that was because I knew to shoot on manual, bracket exposures, and have realistic expectations.  No camera's automatic modes will let you shoot pictures like in National Geographic or the Neiman Marcus catalog.<br /><br />3.  Rechargable battery.  Many people wish it used AA batteries so you won't be tied to a charger.  Don't worry about it.  It will shoot hundreds of pictures on one charge, so just remember to charge the battery after a long day of shooting.  Big deal.  I like that I won't have to buy AA batteries for it.  The cost would add up.<br /><br />4.  Lack of \"raw\" image format.  I havn't had a problem with this, and noone short of a real pro is likely to.  It does store pictures only as JPG, but I havn't seen any problems one would normally associate with that. YMMV.<br /><br />5.  Slow movie framerate/noisy movies/no zoom in movie mode, etc.  This is not a camcorder.  The movie mode is like a freebie for me, and I recognize the reasons for these weaknesses.  If you really want to shoot movies, buy a MiniDV camcorder instead.  You'll be a lot happier with it.<br /><br />6.  Non-pocketable size.  How could you possibly expect it to be much smaller?<br /><br />7.  Uncomfortable grip.  I've got bear-paw hands, so it's not as comfortable as the meaty contour grip of my EOS.  It's not the worst I've felt, but they could've gotten this a little better by adding a little more size to that end of the camera.  I don't think that it would hurt anyone's feelings if that end were just a smidge larger.  See #6<br /><br />8.  Controls.  These are some of the best and most intuitive controls I've seen in a long time.  However, it seems that way to me because they so closely mimic the controls on my EOS.  I especially like the fact that the control dial is lighted.  Expect to stumble through it a little if you aren't generally used to using versatile cameras, but you'll quickly find that it can do most of what you'd expect from a 35mm SLR and then some.<br /><br />And now my own criticisms:<br /><br />1.  Software.  Once I got it installed, it works flawlessly and easily.  However, it required a service pack update to my Windows 2000 that gave me a BSOD and required a full reinstall.  Ouch.  That upset me a little, but I did fix it.  That wasn't really Kodak's fault, but just be warned.<br /><br />2.  Power up takes a little longer than I would like, mostly because the lens folds itself into the body when the camera is powered down.  It takes it about a second to reach shooting position.  Once there, focusing and zooming do not change the length of the lens barrell.<br /><br />3.  Using \"speeds\" higher than ISO 140 gets grainy in a hurry.  It looks remarkably like enlarging old high-speed film.  Dark areas get a random blotchiness that averages to the right color, just like the Konica 3200 color print film used to.  If you can stick to bright lights or the tiny flash.  An external flash can be used for better range.  Vivitar 283 fans, rejoice!  It doesn't require a dedicated flash.","I just upgraded to this camera and I have been very pleased with it's performance.  I like the DX6490 because it is a nice even balance between \"point & shoot\" capability and added functionality for more adventurous photography.  I also picked up a lens adapter which allows me to utilize filters and different types of lens.  If you want a great camera that takes crisp, clean shots and has a variety of functionality, this camera is for you!<br /><br />The only downside is that it is somewhat bulky but, it's very lightweight which makes up for it.  I find it to be a nice compromise between a point & shoot and the large, very expensive digital slrs","I have owned this camera for almost 1 year.  I love it!  The picture quality is phenomenal.  The pictures I print far surpass any I get from negatives at a store.  It is very easy to use, but you can customize some of the settings to allow more flexibility, and the zoom is awesome.  The only problem is the flash is not bright enough indoors with zoom feature.  So you will need to invest in an external flash and as of yet kodak does not make one; so you must go with another brand. The lithium ion batteries hold a charge for a very long time.  Lets just say I have never needed to use the 2 back up batteries I bought and I have used my camera for 200 pictures at a time and used many of the advanced features.  You can't go wrong with this camera.  It is larger than most cameras, so if you want a small, compact camera, find another one.  Happy shopping and enjoy!","My fiance and I are getting married in June and we wanted to make sure that we had a nice digital camera before the wedding so that we can document stuff leading up to the big day and honeymoon.  We had seriously considered getting a less flashy camera and then save up for a nicer one for later on (with a big zoom etc...).  We got this one for several reasons.  If you are just interested in a \"is it good or not?\", my short answer is yes and it will be worth your money spent.  If you would like a more detailed analysis, read on.<br /><br />We were looking for a digital camera with lots of automatic functions, the ability to do things manually if we choose, and a nice zoom.  We wanted four megapixels, not really more or less.  It will be really rare for us to print any pictures larger than 4X6, but we wanted to be sure that we had the option of 8X10 (hence higher than 3.2 megapixel).  The difference between a 4 MP and a 5MP camera as of 9/04 is about a hundred USD, so we decided that we didn't need to spend an extra hundred for one more megapixel.  We are both biologists (me a teacher, she in environmental biology).  It is really important for us to be able to zoom in when at a zoo or in natural areas.  We ARE NOT professional photographers and are just getting into understanding manually setting the shutter speed, ISO etc.<br /><br />We looked at the Canon S1 IS, the Panasonic FZ15 or FZ20, the Minolta Z series, and the Fuji E550.  All of these, PLUS this camera (the KODAK DX6490) had cons that we didn't like.  It really frustrates us that the current state of the digi cam market within our price range ($400 USD) does not have a combination of all the features we want.  So, if you are shopping around, don't necessarily expect to find a camera that has all the features you want.<br /><br />A brief list of the cons of the cameras above:  Canon: only 3.2 megapixel and confusing menus, Panasonic:  most of the features really great, but not available at any of the retail stores where we could get the no interest financing that we really needed, Minolta Z series:  very small (1.5\") LCD screens, Fuji E550:  only 3X optical zoom, expensive picture cards, movie format is AVI, not quicktime.  I'll give a detailed discussion of the pros and cons of the Kodak 6490 below.<br /><br />Now, all of those cameras above are really nice cameras within that price range.  The Panasonic and the Fuji E550 were top choices for a while.  We did a lot of internet research into a lot of different cameras, some lacking zoom, some with, some in a much lower or higher price range.  So, our choice was a choice of what we considered to be the best combination of what we wanted, not because the Kodak was unbelievably better than any of the others.<br /><br />We have now had the camera for about a week and are very pleased with it.  The camera is very easy to use in many ways.  The buttons on the actual camera are obvious in terms of their use.  It takes a very short read of a few pages of the manual to understand what the very few \"not so obvious\" buttons do.  The menu navigation is incredibly simple.  Every option selected has a message in the upper right hand corner of the screen telling you what that menu selection does.  The screen has the capability of showing you a lot of info about your settings, or you can turn it off.  The choice is nice.  The software is also really easy to use.  Its not like high quality software that you buy, but it does its job.  The software is very similar to iPhoto, and unlike my version of iPhoto (which is very new), the Kodak software will find and catalog every picture on your computer.  The other nice thing about the Easyshare system is that you can upload picture directory names (called albums) to your camera and then tag pictures with those album names so that your pictures will automatically be sorted to the directory you want.  Today I noticed that the Easyshare software will \"auto-detect\" other digital cameras and download the pictures for you.  This is a great aspect to those that have another digital camera with bad software.  Olympus' software is horrible and it took me one tenth of the time to download my last pics from the old camera before I sold it to someone!<br /><br />Feel free to read other reviews about the \"share\" button.  It is a nice feature, but since I don't have an internet ready computer at home (only at work) and since I can't afford a nice photo printer (or even the Dock after buying this : ) ), the feature is kind of useless to me.  It doesn't surprise me that Kodak has developed features to streamline photo printing, but you have to have the equipment to email, photo print, etc, and on my salary and with a wedding coming up I just can't afford those accessories.<br /><br />This camera has an awesome zoom.  I'll discuss more of the cons of a zoom this big later on during the \"cons\" section.  The 10X is really nice and you can and should turn off the digital zoom as it reduces picture quality.<br /><br />I really like that the camera allows you to select picture quality settings.  You can save pictures as 4MP, 3.5MP, 2 MP or 1.1 MP.  Each is good for different applications and is nice to be able to choose.  A real bonus is that if you KNOW that a picture you are taking will only ever be printed in 4X6, you can reduce the quality to 3.5MP, still get photo quality printing, but save space on the memory card.<br /><br />The movie mode with sound is great.  It takes movies at 320X240 at 24 FPS (movie theatre frame rate is EXCELLENT), which is not big enough for a TV screen, but a great size for the computer. Honestly, if you want to take video and project it on your TV screen, I recommend just buying a digital camcorder.  Movies are saved as Quicktimes.  With my 512 MB card that I stuck in it, I can get 30 minutes.  The movies are ultra smooth and the microphone picks up sound at a decent range.  It's nice to be able to take some nice quality video, even if that is not the point of a digital camera.<br /><br />This camera has the largest LCD currently available on the market at 2.2\". Its great to have a big picture of what you just captured.  On a quick side note, the camera does have an electronic viewfinder that you can look through and conserve battery power while still reviewing.<br /><br />We have had the camera for a while and the picture quality looks good to me.  I haven't printed anything yet so I can't really comment on that yet.<br /><br />Probably one of the best features is the rechargeable Li battery.  My previous camera (an Olympus D-380) had great battery life with CRV3 lithiums, but those batteries are $20 USD a piece!  It is awesome to not have to buy separate batteries and will practically pay off the camera over the years.  We have taken over 60 pictures so far with LCD on and with the flash and so far the battery is still going.  The manual says to expect to get 160-210 pictures before you need a charge.  I assume the 160 is if you use the LCD and flash every time.  That's pretty good!  I know spare batteries are available, but I have no idea what they cost.  The battery charged up in just over 2.5 hours.<br /><br />The camera has 16 MB of internal memory.  Many people would say \"Foul, it should have more memory than that!\"  I sympathize with this viewpoint but I think it is important to remember that most cameras don't even come with ANY internal memory.  Having the internal memory allowed me to still play with the camera while saving money by buying a separate card online.  SD/MMC memory are the more affordable memory types as well.  CompactFlash and xD-picture cards are retail almost double the price at Best Buy.  The manual only gives storage estimates up to 256 MB, but you can put any size card in it you want.  My 512 MB card holds 384 pictures on highest quality.  I plan to always split that between pictures and video.<br /><br /> The negatives of this camera are few.  My first problem is that the images can look really blurry at 10X zoom.  I haven't had many problems with taking pictures at 10X so far but they looked horrible when I tried it at Best Buy.  I plan on getting a tripod.  I hear this is a standard way of going about things for large zoom on ANY camera.  The image stabilization that Canon and Panasonic have on the cameras mentioned above would make this one near perfect.<br /><br /> My fiancé does not like the \"color enhancement\" feature that is on the camera.  Basically, the chip enhances all of the colors so they look really bright.  My fiancé thinks that sometimes the pictures look unnaturally colorful as a result of this.  You CAN turn this feature off by setting it to \"neutral color\", but you have to do this every time you turn on the camera.  The manual claims there is a way that you can set it to PASM mode and always keep the \"neutral color\", but this is one of the very few things I haven't been able to figure out how to do.  I personally don't think the color enhancement looks unnatural, but I also have really poor vision.  I did a test with \"saturated\" and \"neutral\" color of my fiancé, and her lips look rosier with the color enhancement.  I don't think they look freakishly rosy.<br /><br /> One minor gripe that could be fixed is that while in movie mode, you cannot use the zoom feature.  You can set the zoom ahead of time and then capture the video, but some cameras (like the Canon S1 IS) allow you to zoom while shooting video.<br /><br /> I want to echo the reviewer above that the plastic door to the USB port looks like it will eventually break.  Not a big deal, but worth noting.<br /><br /> One thing to note about digital cameras in general, is that different cameras have different chips that convert the optical image in the lens to digital pixels in a file.  They are called CCDs (Charge Coupled Device) and have ratings of 1/some number.  Basically, the lower the number, the smaller the pixels put in the file.  The smaller the pixels, the more crisp the image.  Most digital cameras on the market have a rating of 1/2.5.  The DX6490 has that rating.  Fuji has just finished some \"super\" chip that has a CCD of 1/1.7.  That is the best we have been able to find in the $400 USD price range.  So, the CCD on this Kodak camera isn't the best, but it is no different than most other cameras, and the pictures look fine.<br /><br /> I think that this is a great camera and a great product.  The cons that I have mentioned are more annoyances than real problems.  Kodak has just come out with a 5.0 MP version of this camera that may be worth checking out if you want higher resolution pictures.  I would buy this camera again.","I love my DX6490, I did so much research before buying it to go on holiday a few months ago.  I am a rubbish photographer, but get great shots, my brother-in-law is a good one and gets awesome shots.  It took a couple of days of slightly blurred pictures before I got a handle on how to use the camera, so I'd reccommend buying it a week or so before the big event! I also struggle with the zoom when it is right out, but am stunned by the results when I manage to get past the shake. I think that next time I'll go for a smaller zoom.  The macro is fantastic.  My inside shots became really good once I got into the habit of putting up the flash! I get frustrated by the fact that the manual is on disk, as I usually need to read it when I am away from my computer, but this would be my biggest gripe.<br /><br />I now have hundreds of photos on my computer and can never decide which to use on my desktop, they all look really good.","I truly loved my digital Elph.  While this Kodak can't match the Elph's convenient size, our new Kodak EasyShare is awesome!  My wife and I love the 10x zoom which blows away any comparably priced cameras.  The viewer is huge.  If you turn off the \"preview\" option, the camera can snap photos in pretty rapid succession.  We bought the camera mainly to get better quality photos of our newborn baby, and its been more than adequate for that.  Our camera came with the docking station too, but I don't really see that as any big asset.  We would like the camera with or without the dock.<br /><br />Complaints?  The only real problem I've had with the camera is taking photos outdoors in bright sunlight. I've had a tough time seeing through the viewer (but I am probably doing something wrong in all honesty).  I'm not a huge fan of the wheel that turns the camera on and changes modes, just a minor complaint.  And, again, I wish the camera was a little bit smaller.","The Kodak DX6490 is an amazing camera to use. For the price, far below other hi-end digital cameras such as Nikon and Canon, you get fine pictures, excellent control, features that allow you to treat the DX6490 like an old-fashioned SLR, and an effective lens whose clarity astonished me.<br /><br />From the hugh LCD readout, the the pop-up flash, I found the DX6490 easy to use. Unlike older digital cameras, the DX6490 has little lag time between the shutter button and the exposure.<br /><br />I found that when I set my ISO manually to 400, I could take pictures I only dreamed about with my older DC3400, capturing watersplashes, tightly focused portraits, and usable digital video.<br /><br />I bought a Kodak SD 256 card to go with the camera, having learned my lesson with my old 8 card for my DC3400. Of course, the DX6490 has an interal drive so you could use the camera without a card if need be.<br /><br />I was shocked pleasantly when I got home after a day of shooting and plugged my card into my computer and opened the pictures in Photoshop CS. I was thrilled by the detail, the range of lighting, the excellent contrast, and the work of the manual mode which froze motion like the best old Nikon.<br /><br />Some weak points: I am now tied to the Li-On battery instead of easily availible and cheap AA batteries.  Expect to use a tripod to get a sharp picture using the portrait mode and the 10X zoom together (but any serious photographer would expect the same from any camera).  The Camera is consumer oriented, with built in album naming and email capability which I know people might use. I would have prefered more battery power for extended use.<br /><br />On the whole, this is fine camera for a great price. I bought mine at Wal-Mart and I paid less for the DX6490 than any of the advertised prices on Amazon. Anyone interested in a controllable digital camera without taking out a second mortgage will find themselves more than pleased with the DX6490. How good is this camera?  My wife forgave me for buying it when she saw the pictures.","I purchased this camera as an upgrade to another digital Kodak I picked up about 2 years ago. I loved the idea of the zoom & sports setting, because I attend many professional wrestling events a year. It's nice to be able to snap photos of my wrestling heroes in action & this camera allows it w/no blurring. Lighting @ the events is minimal, but every shot came out perfect when I used the flash setting. It is *so* simple to use it's unreal.<br /><br /> I recommend picking up the largest SD capture card you can find. I use a 512mb SD card & it holds around 350 photos in the highest quality. I'm waiting for the SanDisk Ultra II 1GB card to come out, that'll be my next \"upgrade\". Ultra has one of the fastest write speeds available & my dad has a Ultra CF for his Canon camera, it makes the unbearable \"pause\" time between photos vanish, so I look forward to buying that when it comes out in a few months.<br /><br /> I picked up the EasyShare Printer along w/the camera & have already printed 50+ photos. The photos print crisp, clear, & look like they came from a professional lab. I highly recommend it along w/the camera, you'll love it. The prints come out *beautiful* when printed @ any size.<br /><br /> My only worry was that the Printer refill packages would cost a lot more than taking the photos to the store for printing, but they cost around 30 cents a photo which is even better than most online printing sources.<br /><br /> Just as I thought I couldn't live w/out my other Kodak, I have no idea how I'll live w/out this one.","I am happy with my camera. However, I was VERY disappointed and surprised that the ad claimed to have a dock included in the box, which was one of the reasons I bought this item. That claim has since been removed.","Bought this camera a month ago, and it is definately one of the best digital cameras, especially for its price. The quality of the pictures that this camera takes really pushes the limit of a 4 megapixel camera, and takes analog quality pictures.","This camera has almost all the features someone would need in a camera. Where to start...okay lets start with the aesthetics. I chose this camera for its size, looks, and the way it felt in my hands. The camera looks like its ready to work and its size is big enough not to misplace but not too big that I wouldn't want to carry it. I also bought it for the different shooting modes (including the manual modes). There's the auto mode where the camera does all the work, the sport modes for action shots (I needed that for I have a 2 yr old), the portrait mode, the night mode and last but not least the P.A.S.M (manual) modes. There are three other features that can be used with each mode: close up, landscape, and burst. The Easyshare feature makes it easy to get the pictures from the camera to computer at the touch of a button. You can also designate what pictures you want to send in e-mail before you even transfer them to your computer. The LCD screen was the biggest and best on the market at that time (2.2 inch, high def). You can view your pics no matter what kind of light you're in. The pictures come out great if you let the camera do its job. Most of my pictures are frame-worthy and the colors are great. You can also set the color mode too. Plus the electronic viewfinder eliminates the image parallax problems, what you see is what you get...no chopped off heads!!! There are so many other features that I won't mention because this review is getting too long.<br />As wonderful as this camera is, it is not without its flaws. The 4 megapixels can limit the size you can enlarge your pictures. There is no image stabilization at max zoom (not a major flaw as long as you let the camera focus on the subject). You can't adjust the JPEG compression (the new DX series camera have that option). Slow auto-focus in low light (sometimes has trouble focusing in very low light even with the flash operating if subject is a good distance away). All the flaws are defeatable if you take the time and learn the camera. Practice...Practice...Practice!!!<br />All-in-all a wonderful product. If Kodak goes back and addresses the flaws AND contain the price point it would definately have the camera to beat. Put it like this...I would buy the new version in a heart beat.","There is a Kodak case made for the 6490. You can see it, under 'accessories' on the Kodak website. Cost is around $23 and it fits the camera perfectly (you remove the insert...it even has a little padded back to protect the viewing screen!). The case also has a special space for BOTH addtl. battery and SD card. Recommend getting the case. Very nicely made. Gives peace- of-mind to have it fit perfectly.","OK, I've had the camera for a week, but took it to an important family party last weekend and shot about 80 photos--different modes, light, etc. Then took it to WalMart Kodak Picture Maker machine and got 2 CDs made, some enlargements and lots of 4x6s. This camera is wonderful. I did a lot of research before buying. It's true, you can use this camera \"out of the box.\" The clarity (resolution) is so good, it's almost too good. With the 10x optical zoom, I'm seeing (in the prints) veins on flowers, imperfections on human skin, every last detail! I didn't even realize it also gives you the option of \"dialing down\" to lower megapixels if you want to save space, and the lower resolution also produced beautiful pictures. I bought a 256 MB memory card so don't have to worry about running out of room. The \"burst\" mode worked great for action shots. The video mode worked great. I haven't had a chance yet to try the manual mode, but it's nice to have that option. Check out the other features I'm not even mentioning here (slide show on TV, for example). Some reviews on other web sites voiced concerns about battery life. I shot pictures over several hours, with the LCD viewfinder on, plus shot a short video clip with the camera, and never ran out of battery power. I've shown the results to people who know a lot more about photography than I and they were impressed. I even enlarged one photo to 8x10 to be hung on the wall, it is so clear, light-balanced, artistic (I didn't even try that hard!) etc. And remember, this was my first time out with this camera! I've already sold two other people on this camera, after seeing my pictures. I can't think of any negatives (no pun intended), other than I am still trying to find the right camera case for this. I had used my daughter's Easyshare on a previous vacation, and was impressed with the ease of use. I upgraded to this camera specifically for the 10x optical zoom, it was worth the extra money. Did I mention this is a great camera?? Buy, and enjoy!","WOW! I had this camera given to me as a gift knowing its quite demanding price of $500. But it's worth every penny! It has everything! You can take any shot you want to with every feature known to man to help you out. Check it out:<br />- PASM mode equipes you with not only full creative control of F-Stops and aperture, but also with a 16-second to 1/1000 of a second shutter speed to really keep the action shots sharp or to create a purposely fuzzy image<br />- Burst feature helps you really get multiple great shots at say, fireworks, or a baseball swing. This feature can shoot six photos per second!<br />- Ten-second timer<br />- Once you have focused on the image, the camera will give you warnings if you are about to take a pretty crappy photo!<br />- Multiple zoom zones so putting what you want to see into focus is easy<br />- Catch a beautiful, wide lake, or a tiny red flower with the landscape feature, and the close-up feature!<br />- Flash modes include:<br />  - red-eye<br />  - automatic flash adjustment (auto)<br />  - regular flash<br />- You can choose weather you would like the date stamped onto each picture<br />- You can also choose between many different special effects (this list includes some effects you can use on the free software)<br />  - sepia (western)<br />  - black and white<br />  - saturated color (intensified color)<br />  - cartoon<br />  - coloring book<br />  - fish-eye<br />- You can tag a photo to be emailed right when you dock it into your computer<br />- You can even protect a photo from being deleted<br />- With a four megapixel sensor and a whopping ten-x optical zoom, you can still have a breath-taking photo from a distance!<br />These are just a few of the hundreds of features on this camera! I would seriously suggest this for your all purpose shooting!<br />-","As my family's main photgrapher, I always wanted to buy a digital camera. The problem was that it was too expensive. Fortunateyl, Chirstmas puts love in your heart and takes cash out of your wallet, and my parents got me one. Boy, was I surpised by how great it was.<br />This may well be the best digital csmera ever. The zoom is great, and it's easy to use. There are four ways to take pictures with it:<br />Auto - used for general picture taking and the one I mostly use.<br />PASM: Used to access manual camera settings<br />Sport - Used when object is in motion<br />Video - Used to capture motion and sound (I dont use this one because this one takes up too much space)<br />Portrait - Used for full - frame photos of people and other subjects<br />Night - Used at night to capture subject and background<br />This are the explenations as written on the camera screen.<br />My favorite feature of the camera is that you can change the colors of the pictures. There's \"saturated\" (which is the one I usually use), \"neutral\", \"black and white\" and my personal favorite \"sepia\". I am also glad that you can delete pictures you don't want. You don't kow how many pictures I had to get rid of with throwaway ameras. Plus it saves film and money.<br />I highly recommnd this digital camera. It's a photgraoher's dream that you can take anywhere. My only gripe is that it doesn't come with the chip. I once took a whole batch of pictures without a chip and as a result couldn't print them.","This is one of the best cameras anyone could ever buy. So easy to use, it'll make you want to take it everywhere. I sure do! The camera's ready right out of the box. The pictures come out wonderful and the battery life is great. Only a few minor flaws (no image stabilization on extreme close-ups and the auto-focus makes you wait sometimes before you can snap the picture) but they do not transfer onto the pictures. Even with the jittery close-ups(when you use the digital zoom @ it's max) the pictures come out clear. With the auto-focus problems you just have to wait for the green light when the camera's ready. All-in-all you cannot go wrong with this camera. It, as with any new piece of equipment, takes time and practice to learn how to use it (to get the full advantage of its features). So just practice, practice, practice!!!! I took some pictures of my son in the park playing...they almost look like I hired a professional and I only have had the camera since December 2003. I would recommend this camera from the beginner to the enthusiast. It's worth the price just for the zoom and manual controls it offers.","I had been researching my digital camera purchase for some time. We have SONY digital cameras at work and this one is easier to use. Rarely do products do more than claimed. These are some of the features we found out about after the purchase:<br />Additional lenses - With the purchase of a 55mm screw on adaptor, 55mm lenses and filters can be used with this camera. Kodak offers a telephoto and a wide angle adaptor.<br />Photo album - You can browse through the photos you have taken with the camera from either viewing area. This allows you to see numerous photos at once and pick the one you want without scrolling through every photo sequentially.<br />PASM - This camera has 3 automatic modes or is fully adjustable. You can set the Fstop, the speed, etc.<br />Windows XP compatiblity - Windows XP reads the camera as another hard disk. You can attach images into an eMail while they are still on the camera. Images can also be deleted or opened from XP while still on the camera.<br />Red eye reduction - Didn't know it had it and that I can turn it on or off.<br />AC power - The camera can be run with an AC adaptor<br />Internal Zoom - Images can be zoomed in on from the within camera.<br />Photos with this camera have been outstanding! The files have actually been rather large for eMailing. For eMailing you may want to lower the resolution. The whole family is interested in photography thanks to this camera. I have already had to wait in line to use it! The 10x optical zoom really gives you the freedom to be creative.<br />The only better cameras than the DX6490 cost more than twice as much.","KODAK COULD ONLY IMPROVE THIS CAMERA IF IT CAME WITH A HIGHER MEGAPIXEL. THIS CAMERA ROCKS! WHEN I TAKE IT TO A PARTY, GUESTS LINE UP FOR 'THEIR TURN'; EVERYONE WANTS TO TAKE HOME A PICTURE THAT THEY WATCH COME OUT OF THE PRINTER DOCK 6000. THE EASE AND QUALITY RAISE EYEBROWS FROM EVEN THE MOST CRITICAL EYE!  I TAUGHT DARK ROOM TECHNIQUE ON THE COLLEGE LEVEL, AND HAVE DONE PROFESSIONAL PORTRAIT WORK WITH LARGE FORMAT CAMERA'S; I AM NONE-THE-LESS IMPRESSED WITH THE KODAK DX6490...CHECK OUT THE LENS; IT IS A FIRST RATE SCHNEIDER. KODAK GETS MY BOW!","I have had 4 kodak digital cameras and recently got the dx6490 as a gift.  It is a really stable and powerful camera that takes excellent pictures.  The low cost, high quality and simplicity are all reasons to buy this camera.  Night shots work better than most snap and shoot digital cameras that I have seen.  Outdoor and indoor shots are so simple, the only thing that takes some getting used to is the joystick function for moving up and down.  While it is small - it takes a few days to get used to, mind you the large viewing screen will impress everyone.  Buy this camera - its worth every penny.","Tested at least 20 different digital cameras (ranging from $300 to $1000+) before deciding to buy the Kodak DX6490. This camera is awesome...a digital treasure. I also lucked out (accessory-wise) when I bought it ($399). Among the INCLUDED items were a 128MB SD card, 6000 dock station, battery AND charger, leather camera bag. Liked the camera so much that a week later I also bought two extra 256MB SD cards (just wanted to play 'safe'). Am a professional photographer and have never used a digital camera until now. The DX6490 is now 'attached to my hip', along with my Nikon F4 and Fujifilm GA645Zi (medium format). Both of these cameras (combined) cost well over $4000...so that should tell you how much the DX6490 impressed me. It's a lifetime keeper!!! Anyone interested in buying an exceptional digital camera at an affordable price would be downright foolish to overlook the DX6490!!!!!!! Besides being an exceptional 'digital machine', it has a professional look as well (unlike some other digitals which cost MUCH more). Added note: it's unusual to find a built-in flash (in an affordable camera) that can take good pics up to 16 feet away. This one does it famously!!! And the 38-380 zoom is phenomenal. Superb results!!!!!! All the way!!!! Kudos to Kodak on this baby!!!!!!!!! Wonder if this camera is Kodak's flagship camera. If not, it should be!!","Tested at least 20 different digital cameras (ranging from $300 to $1000) before deciding to buy the Kodak DX6490. This camera is awesome...a digital treasure.

Besides being an exceptional 'digital machine', it has a professional look as well (unlike other digitals which cost much more).","I've had this camera for 7 months and, in that time frame, I've also tried out 2 other digital cameras. A Pentax Optio S4i and the Sony T-1. Here are my comparisons and observations.<br />I'll start with the flaws. The first and most annoying (and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is that this camera has difficulty focusing in low light (by \"low light\" I mean any time you might be required to use the flash). Many times, it just doesn't achieve a proper focus. This results in either a blurry, unfocused photograph or missing the shot all together. The Sony T-1 takes care of this by shining a red light on the subject so it can achieve a proper focus. The Kodak DX6490, and a lot of other digital cameras, badly need this feature.<br />The second flaw might not be a flaw to many of you. I personally think that this camera is too big and bulky. Obviously, that is the trade off for the huge zooming capabilities. But still, the Sony T-1 is so compact and easy to carry! The Kodak DX6490 needs a big carrying case. You can't just clip it to your jeans or put it in your shirt pocket. You have to have to carry it around like a purse. It's like carrying and old 35mm camera. Definitely not very convenient. And since it's not convenient to carry around at all times, you're going to miss some shots `cause you didn't have your camera with you!<br />Also, the start-up time takes too long. 4-5 seconds vs. the T-1's 1.5 seconds.<br />As for the good stuff, I have to say that this camera takes great photos! It blows the Sony T-1 and the Pentax Optio S4i away. If you can achieve a proper focus when you're in low light, the flash is definitely adequate (the T-1 and S4i have very inadequate flashes). In low light and daylight, the colors are vivid and the depth and quality of the shots are very good. Much better than the 5.1 mega-pixel T-1 and waaaayyy better than the S4i (the S4i is a crappy camera).<br />The 2.2\" screen is really nice (the T-1's is better, though). The zoom is incredible. It feels secure in your hand. The features are a little limited compared to the T-1's but they're adequate, none the less.<br />Conclusions: If the Sony T-1 would take photos like the DX6490, I would have a T-1 in my hands right now. But I don't. I'm holding the DX6490. It ultimately comes down to \"how good are the photos\" and the DX6490 takes some damn good ones!","I had never use a digital camera, but i ever ask a friend any time i'm interested in one. Suddenly, i look the offer of this camera in a kodak store. I get my friend to look it before buy and he said me that it's a good offer.<br />The pictures that i have take with it are of a great quality. It's very easy to use. Only target and shot. It have a lag of 3 or 4 seconds between two shots, but instead have a function to shot 6 pictures with one shot, ideal to capture movement.<br />The only cons is that you need a tripod to take pictures in the night mode.","I can't figure out if all the sellers are confused, or if they are intentionally trying to confuse all the buyers!  The DX6490 is now being sold two ways--with and without the dock.  The one you are looking at on this page has NO DOCK!  Thus, you will not be able to recharge your camera battery unless you also buy a dock, or buy the Kodak battery recharger kit for the type of Li-Ion battery enclosed with this camera.  The AC cord does not recharge the battery; it's just for saving battery life, which you will probably discover you don't need to do; the Li-Ion battery with this camera is better than any other camera batteries I've ever used.<br />I believe they are selling it without the dock, for those who travel and prefer the battery recharger that fits right into a wall outlet. Or, even more likely, they want people to buy the PRINTER DOCK.  The printer dock recharges the battery, so you don't need the recharger dock that comes with this camera, if you buy the camera with a dock at the higher price.  The printer dock price has drastically dropped this month, which makes it more reasonable to buy this camera without the recharger dock, and then buy the printer dock.<br />The only question is--why did the printer dock suddenly go way down in price?  My guess is Kodak is coming out with a new printer dock soon, or they are very concerned about the competition.  For example, Epson just released a printer that uses printer packs--paper and ink included--that sells for $200, as the Kodak printer dock did until this month.  The Epson is not a dock, but uses memory cards to print.  Their printer pack refill kit is like $4 more than the Kodak refill kit, but it makes 60 more 4x6 prints!<br />So, you might keep that in mind when you are deciding what battery charger to get.  But this is a fabulous camera!  I've had it for 7 months, and believe there is none better.  If you want to read lots of reviews on the camera, just go to the page where the camera is selling with the dock."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC43","amazon_reviews":["Day time - it took  good pictures.

This camera will reliably take well-focused, perfectly exposed, brilliantly colored pictures over and over again with little hassle or fuss.  After evaluating several 4 megapixel pocket cameras, I selected this one for my 11 year old daughter for her Christmas present, and she now routinely takes darned good pictures with it.<br />Important feature: the camera has an optical viewfinder.  This is very important in my opinion.  I am of the opinion that it is very impractical and difficult to take pictures using just the LCD on the back of the camera as many small pocket cameras require.  Not to mention the fact that this will dramatically decrease battery life.  Optical viewfinders are the way to go.<br />Quibbles are minor.  The pre-flash of this camera is somewhat intrusive, but the flash does work if you don't expect too much of it in terms of distance.  The camera, in common with most pocket cameras, takes its best pictures outdoors in natural lighting, but the built-in flash can help via \"fill flash\" to illuminate shadows under these conditions.<br />This camera and others like it are why there is simply no reason for anyone to stick with film.  You can produce excellent digital pictures at less cost, with immeasurably less hassle, and you can see what your pictures are like ahead of time (further reducing your cost, since you can cull the losers before printing them).<br />Other comments: this camera is well-made, with a nice sturdy metal body.  The lens is an excellent Leica lens.  One of the things I really like about the camera is that it uses the ubiquitous AA batteries, so for trips you are always going to be able to have batteries handy--many cameras of this type use proprietary batteries, requiring you to lug a dedicated charger along on trips.<br />Panasonic has done a good job putting it all together in this excellent camera.","I got this camera a week ago after going to steve's digicam review and printing out sample pics from this camera, lc40, stylus 400 and sd100.  I found the lc43 produced the best overall picture with bright color and good depth perception.","If you're looking for a quick, easy to use digital camera with excellent resolution, this is it. It doesn't offer much in the way of manual operation, but it makes up for it in convenience. I got the DMC-LC43PP because it is small, fast, and has the 4 megapixel spec. Press the shutter half way to focus and determine the exposure, then fully to take the picture - it works faster than other models I compared it to. I wish the LCD screen could be pivoted to see easier, but look at the price - other cameras with the same specs are twice the price! Don't bother to buy a card reader for your computer either - the USB cable that comes with the camera will allow your computer to see the camera as another drive. Very fast. I do wish the flash had a bit more power, but like everything else, it's a trade-off. I'll use this camera more often simply because I'll carry it with me more often. Clear and sharp pictures, especially outside where there is good lighting."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P8","amazon_reviews":["Was shipped fast. Camera just as stated very happy  Thanks","I bought this (used) for my father.  I was a little nervous that the tech might overwhelm him, but he's done very well with this.  He's had it a few years now, and I'm very impressed at the quality of the pictures and videos that he's able to capture with this.  One of my best purchases!","Nice  cam for the price but the battery pack is wimpy and needs replaced . Other than that the camera works great and have no problems .","After 5 plus years of use, the camera is still taking pictures and pretty good ones at that!!! You can't say that about a lot of cameras!!","I've had this Sony Cybershot camera for 8 years now and it still takes great quality photos. It has been on many family vacations and taken thousands of photos and it still works great. For the size and price it has lots of features and takes excellent photos. I would recommend to anyone who wants a great little camera but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.","This is just a great camera, especially for night-time and low-light pictures.  The shutter speed is super fast, and the variety of shooting options is pretty impressive for such a small (and older) camera model.  It was a reliable digital camera for about 4 years.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was out one night and it literally fell out of my pocket 5 times before it finally broke.. Every Sony Cybershot that I have had since has been a disappointment.  The night time shots are full of noise and the extra megapixels do nothing for the quality of the photos.  Don't be fooled by the newer cameras,this is the one you should get!","Took this camera on a vacation and it works fine just like my old one did .","We've had our Cyber-shot for several years now.

Finally I chose DSCP8 and so far it has given me the performace I expected. It has an excellant result in its category and it's easy to use switches let my 9 years old son use this camera comfortably. He also used this during his recent field trip and results are just excellant.<br />I recommend this camera to everyone who trust this brand. It won't let you down","We purchased our DSC-P8 on holiday in Malaysia last year and have been extremely happy with it. I read a lot of reviews on the net and in magazines and decided this would suit us best. It has taken some fantastic shots, and the battery life, and ease of media (memory sticks) is very practical, although the memory sticks are a bit expensive.<br />Unfortunately I broke the LCD display last month when I fell on the camera whilst snowboarding. The camera still works fine but the LCD is useless. I telephoned Sony UK to see if it could be repaired but the quote they gave me was more than the camera would cost to replace. This seems like such a waste, as essentially the camera still does what it should do, but with out the screen navigating the menu's is impossible.<br />I'm desperately trying to track down a new LCD screen for the camera, as it is very easy to remove and will try to fix it at my own expense and calling our insurance company if it still doesn't work. I find it so frustrating that companies would rather throw things away than try to repair them at a reasonable cost. Even with the engineers time there is know way it would cost the figures they quoted me. After all I managed to remove the screen (6 screws and two cable sockets) in less than 5 minutes! Add another 5 minutes for installing the new screen, if I ever get one, and you'd need to be on a very high hourly rate to warrant the money they're quoting.<br />My advice, look after your stuff, don't snowboard with a camera (in a case) on your belt, take out good insurance, and put pressure on companies that would rather replace than repair.","My first sony digital camera! I am becoming like it. Nothing's special comparing to other digital cams, but battery life is great. Sony products never let me down :)","This is by far the best camera I have ever owned.  The camera is jam-packed with features and can take great pictures in almost any conditions.  I recently took it with me on a trip to Disneyland with a 128 mb. memory stick which was plenty of room (about 80 pictures, or 5 min. of video on highest quality settings). The detail in the pictures was amazing and the color was impecible. I highly recomend this camera to anyone looking for a digital camera, it's quality and functionality seem to be well above most cameras in the price range.  I also find the video mode to be a very nice plus, as it is very high quality as well.","Its about 16 months , im using this camera. Frist of All it has amazing durability. Here are , sora good advantages:<br /> 1. red eye reduction, its ok, but sometimes doesnt work properly.<br /> 2. Auto focus is amazing ....While u  push \"shot\" button half down , this will still be coosing the optimal focus rate..<br /> 3. Better picture quality - If you are not professional, its just enough. But in dark places you will have troubles. For my opinion , this camera is just perfect for open environments.<br /> 5. Very compact and great durability (its case  is made of alminium)<br /> Cons:<br /> Supplied memory stick is not enough... you'll need another  (128MP or more) memory stick.<br />Baterry life is little short.<br />Low shutter speed in dark areas.","This camera is a good buy as long as one use it correctly<br />and properly. Almost of the pictures I've taken are good<br />except the one that I've taken under a bright fluorescent<br />light. But overall, I'm satisfied with its performance and I didn't regret buying this camera.","I previously owned a sony dsc-p51 a 2 mp camera and was pleaed with the quality. When I decided to purchase a new camera one with more megapixels I came across the Sony P-8 the reveiws for this camera superceded all of the other cameras in its class. This camera is excellent. Easy to use and has many functions that my previous camera did not have like multiburst and able to make a movie with sound. Overall I am very pleased with this purcase. The only bad thing about the camera was the software. I purchased Acdsee 6.0 and it works well with the camera and is very easy to use.","This is my first digital camera, however before I purchased it, I did a lot of research and tried the various ones available in the market. Ok first off, if you are not planning to enlarge the picture greater than 8\" by 10\" [inches], then you dont need a camera with more than 3 MP[mega-pixel] resolution. The greater the MP, the more you can enlarge a digital picture without causing to blur. Just for comparison, the 'old' film [35 mm] camera took a 1 MP picture, so practically with a 3 MP camera, you can enlarge it about 2-3 times without causing it to blur, so make sure you keep that in mind before going for the 8 MP camera. Next, the zoom....consider only the optical zoom of a camera to get a great picture. The digital zoom, is a computer enhanced image, which is not so great.<br />Having said all this, this camera is unbelievable! The results are incredible. It allows you to take pictures in an email mode, which stores two copies of the same picture, one for emailing and one for printing[full size]. Also the flash is quite extraordinary. The best is the result with movie mode. The movie is with sound which is also incredible. However you would need at least 128 MB memory stick to get a 4 and a half minute video. Dont get fooled by the 90 min video advertisement, that is only in VGA mode, and quite unacceptable for viewing or showing it to friends. Other than that, the camera works great, results everyone will enjoy and you will cherish. Sony ROCKS!!","Hi,<br />I bought this camera for my marriage day and my experience with it so far is pretty good. Following are some of the problems that I observed.<br />1. The image editing software that comes with camera sucks..!! Menus doesn't have written descriptions and very difficult to understand/use.<br /><br />2. Night shots in automatic mode were a bit dull. I encountered the red-eye problems too. Red-eye reduction mode is pretty slow.<br />3. LCD screen is too small to judge the quality of the photo. Sometimes I thought that the photo was good whereas after seeing on computer it was shaky.<br />4. When you watch images in playback mode, it takes sometime (around 1-2 sec) for the LCD screen to display the image with proper resolution. This reduces your playback speed. Sony says it is pretty normal.<br />5. In movie mode, you can not use zoom which is pretty bad.<br />I haven't used all the different modes and options. But,<br />Following are some of the nice things..<br />1. The image quality is very good and colors are pretty sharp. I have printed photos upto 8x10 size and I haven't faced any problem with the resolution of the image.<br />2. The camera has 3:2 mode which can reduce the problems of cropping when you develop the photos in 4x6 size.<br />3. The auto focus speed is very good. So, you can take more pictures in less time.<br />4. Camera is very cute and handy. You can keep the camera in your pocket and take it anywhere you want.<br />5. Menus in camera are very intutive and you can get used to it pretty quick.<br />6. Camera comes with AC Adapter and batteries also which is very nice. Other companys' 3.2MP cameras may come for less price but you have to spend additional money on rechargable batteries and adapters.<br />Overall I was only disappointed with software and in all other respects it is a nice camera to own.<br />-Raja","I received this camera as a christmas gift from my Mom.  It's light and very easy to use the basic functions.  I haven't ventured into the other options yet but I'm looking forward to doing so.","I purchased this camera this past Oct/03. Being my first digital camera It's pretty easy to use and compact size. I love the mpeg video option, 95% of pictures I've atlken come out great. The battery life is also good. I bought a 128MB memory stick that I can take about 80 pics at the highest resoulution.<br />I would highly recomend this camera to everyone.","Just got this camera last week..<br />The blue aluminium model P8... also i treated myself for christmas on a waterhousing that fits this camera ( mpkpha 40 )<br />before i had the mavica fd200 and de mavica cd 200<br />but this beats all... i love the Burst shots  16! in one click!<br />perfect for action and motion.<br />I took some awesome shots check my personal site for more..<br />since i live in the caribbean it is a must for my lifestyle to fit a camera that can cope with the extremes i go trough on a daily base.<br />Underwater diving and snorkeling and also in the lineup of my local surfspot the pics come out clear and my site looks better than ever!<br />.........<br />Get it nothing better that SONY","Great price for a powerful camera.  This thing is small compared to other camera's from sony.  The lenz hides which makes it easy to carry in your pocket.  Very easy to use and understand.  DO NOT BUY ONE THAT USES REGULAR AA BATTERIES.  They don't last more than 15 minutes.  The battery this one uses lasts almost an hour & a half in a single charge.  All you need is a larger memory stick.  The lowest resolution allows for 97 pictures with the supplied memory stick.  I am very happy.","I had been looking for a digital camera for some time.  I started to get caught up in the megapixels trap; that is, more is better.  But when I thought about it, the most common use for me is taking photos of the family to send via e-mail to our family and friends.  For that, you don't need all those megapixels.<br />So, I bought this camera.  One selling point was the lithium ion battery versus the nicad other models in this price range have.  Also, I have other Sony products and have never been disappointed as the quality is high.<br />This is a great little camera, with the emphasis on the word little.  It was easy enough to learn how to use in an hour or so with the owner's manual.<br />The memory card is big enough for weekend trips, but if you are going on a long trip, I would recommend a larger card.  Even at low resolution suitable for e-mail, you only get 32 pictures on a 16 MB memory card.","This is the second sony Digital Camera I've purchased, the first being a DSC-F707, and I am not disappointed.<br />First of all, this is a VERY small camera. One of the smaller camera that Sony manufactures, but it also provides lots of features usually not present in cameras of this size.<br />MOVIE MODE: The MPEG movie quality is just as good as my bigger SONY, the only downside being you can't use the zoom feature while recording. On the other hand, there is also another movie function, 16 frame burst, which my bigger camera doesn't provide.<br />STILL IMAGE: Since my other camera was a 5.2 megapixel, the lesser picture quality on the DSC-P8 was very noticable, but they are still quite good. Considering the photographer is not a professional, this camera has VERY GOOD pictures for a small point and shoot camera.<br />SIZE: This camera is both light AND compact. It's designed well enough to fit comfortably in one's hand, yet compact enough to be carried in a persons pocket or purse. The only downside with the size is that with one hand shooting, it's easy for your fingers to accidentally press the buttons on the back.<br />INDOOR SHOOTING: Differences in lighting and distance has negative effects on this camera. The subject or objective you're trying to shoot may not always recieve the type of lighting you wish with the flash on this camera. The flash battery recovery time is VERY GOOD though, pausing only one or two seconds before you can take another picture.<br />OUTDOOR SHOOTING: Taking pictures outside with this camera is GREAT. If the flash is not needed, the camera takes care of everything, providing sharp, colorful pictures.<br />OVERALL: This camera is exactly the same size as the DSC-P10, only SLIGHTLY lighter, both in weight and in color. The DSC-P10 also has a bracketing feature which takes 3 pictures with different settings for you, so you can pick the best, but most people do not need that. If you're planning to get a small digital camera and don't need extreme quality, buy the DSC-P8 and save a hundred bucks.","I wasn't sure which digital camera to choose and since this being my first purchase, I decided to go with the Sony DSCP8. I have no regrets ! I love it. Its excellent !","I looked arround, evaluated and read all reviews that fell in my hands about digital cameras before buying the Cybershot P8.<br />In summary: If you are not a professional photographer, this is the one for you. It is the right size, takes excellent pictures, even videos with sound (quite good for a Cybershot, but it is not a video camera, though) and reasonably priced.<br />Nevertheless, it lacks of some more manual control, especially needed for pros. But I am just an ammateur that likes taking a lot of nice pictures to download to my computer.<br />One important tip: you MUST buy more memory sticks. The included 16Mb should be unlawfull. With additional 128Mb you should be OK.","I am not your most computer savvy woman, but I was able to load the program onto my computer, download pictures and I didnt even break a sweat!  My camera is 3.2 mega pixels and the quality of my pictures are excellent.  I was using a canon elf digital camera prior to this but was not able to zoom in on things without it getting blurry.  With this Sony DSC-P8, I can zoom right in and get a crystal clear close-up.  I am thrilled with this camera...a keeper!","This is a great camera. I took 2 weeks deciding between Canon A70, S400, Nikon Coolpix 3100, Kodak 6340 and this P8 and finally decided to buy it. It is very similar to the A70 but has a Lithium battery rather than AA and is about 100 grams lighter (and also 100 Euro cheaper in Turkey). The picture quality is very good and even an amateur like me can figure out how the use the camera in 10 minutes without even looking at the manual and start shooting great photos. The USB connection and the software included in the package is very convenient although it is not the fastest available. Highly recommended.","I was debating between a Canon S400 and this Sony P8 so Idecided to play with both cameras at my neighborhood bestbuy.  The Sony P8 produces better image quality and color than the Canon.  The guys at BestBuy let me print out images taken by the cameras so I can compare the results instantly as the print out quality is very important to me.  To top it off, the sony has a much user friendly interface and I was able to master the camera navigation w/o asking questions nor looking at manual.  I couldn't figure out the Canon at all.<br />I took some amazing photos from my recent trip and blew some up to 8x10.  The quality is incredible and may I also add that I am no professional but the pictures turned out looking like pros!","The DSCP8 is the first digital camera i have ever owned.  This summer I made a promise to myself to buy a digital camera and a digital camcorder.  I purchased the camera first and selected Sony because of goods reviews and because I have a Sony VAIO computer.<br />For someone who knew very little about digital photography, it was surprisingly easy to learn how to operate this camera.  All of the controls are easy to get at and to understand.  The camera takes very good pictures and is not large and bulky like the DSC72,92 etc.  However, it is not too small either.<br />The software that is included makes it very easy to transfer images to my computer via USB.  Using USB was not my first choice but I have to use it becuase my one year old Sony VAIO can only read regular memory sticks and not the memory stick pro format.  I have found that pictures taken at the highest quality usually take up about 1.3 to 1.8 megs per picture.<br />I really like the movie capabilities of this camera.  You can take movies in two image qualities:normal and email.  The normal .mpg file will be quite large.  A 256 meg memory pro stick can hold one 10 1/2 minute movie and this file will be approximately 240 megs in size.  You can transfer these movies to your PC or watch them on your tv with appropriate cables.  The camera comes with a USB cable and an S-video cable for the tv.  As you are watching the movie on the TV or viewing pictures, you can zoom in/out, pause, fast forward, rewind, etc using the controls on the camera.  This has worked so well for me that I am no longer going to buy a digital camcorder.<br />I purchased an accessory kit with the camera that included an extra battery (even though I have not needed it yet), a case for the camera and a case for memory sticks for another $79.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this camera to everyone.  You may also want to look at the DSC10 which is a 5 megapixel camera for only $50 more and is the same size.  I did not get that one because I had to buy a new printer and other things at the same time and had to stay on budget.","Relative to the current crop of 3Mpix compact rechargables (Canon S230, Casio Exilim Z3, Pentax \"Tin of Mints\" and Minolta Dimage Xt), two aspects stand out:<br />1) Sony's user interface/heads-up-display is the most intuitive. Most features are accessible in a turn of the wheel and a button press, without hierarchical submenus or cryptic incantations. Although the feature set is rich, Sony's engineers prioritized the needs of the user over the needs of the engineer (or the needy ad copy). This is Sony's traditional strength; they aren't the leader in consumer electronics for bleeding edge innovation or gold-plated transistors.<br />2) The matchbox shaped compacts suffer usability in their small footprints. I don't have especially large hands, but hitting the shutter with my pinky without smudging the lens or dropping the camera reminded me of early laptop trak-balls and PDA keyboards. After the technolust wears off you're stuck with a camera.","I looked for months - every website out there that compares cameras, has user reviews and etc... Finally decided on the DSCP8 and am SOOOOO happy I did.  I've had the camera for six months and didn't want to write a review till I took it on a trip.  I'm now back and must tell you the only problem I had with this camera was trying to get night shots - really need to have the tripod for a serious shot.  Everything else about this camera is amazing!  I have the 128mb stick and can hold over 100 photos at the 2m setting.<br />The good stuff:<br />QUICK charge time (I have a spare battery for those long hikes)<br />Tons of built in settings for SCN's<br />Size - this thing is so small yet the LCD screen size and quality is unmatched on the market.<br />Great quality prints come out of this camera!<br />Skip all the rest the Sony DSCP8 is the only way to go!","This is the Ferrari of digital cameras! Why? It's powerful, stylish, fast, and has a great performance.<br />This summer I took 2 trips, one week long camp, and the other to Europe. I would have to say I didn't know how great this camera was until I was on those vacations taking snapshots of everything! First was the response I got. Almost everyone in my campsite or tour group said, \"Whoa, nice camera!\" No surprise though, this IS a nice camera! On top of it, when I compared the camera and photo quality other people had on their digital cameras, I noticed mine was sooo much better. Not to brag, but the P8 really did the job and impressed others.<br />This camera is worth every penny, and works like a dream. In a way, it has kind of spoiled me. This is my first digital camera, and really makes me optimistic about digital cameras, when in reality, not all cameras are as good as this one. Man, I had some great vacations with a few hundred great pictures to remember it by with this amazing, compact, stylish camera! This is the Ferrari of digital cameras! The Rolls Royce! The Mercedes Benz!<br />THIS is a Digital Camera!","Sony really got everything right on this little camera.  My wife and I already own the higher end DSC-717 5 megapixel Sony.  That camera is unbelievable in its own right, but I do home inspections and wanted something I could slip into a shirt pocket.  This little Sony does that well, but it does so much more.  I still can't believe all of the features they packed into something this small.  It's 3.2 megapixels which is more than fine for 95% of the shots you'll take; that will print up to almost 8x10 with no noticeable loss of detail.  Flash works very well, offering red-eye reduction if you want to use it.  Zoom is very good, offering both digital and optical zoom modes.  I personally don't mind the digital zoom, although some people prefer the optical only.  In the >3x zoom mode, the digital only kicks in for the last tiny bit of the zoom, so I don't see it as a pro nor con.  Battery life is amazing, as it has been for the past two years with all Sony digital cameras.  The new Lithium batteries just last forever; well over 100 shots, easily.  As we already have one Sony digital camera, I didn't have to install a thing; everything from the software to the transfer cable to the PC worked from the older Sony.  Thankfully, Memory Stick prices are coming down; a good 128mb stick will likely be all you'll need.  I'm using 64mb sticks and with the resolution set at 2mb, that's over 30 pictures per stick.  And since it's digital, you can instantly delete what you don't like, so, literally, all of your shots, in the end, are keepers.  Has an incredible movie mode; even better than the over $1,000 DSC-717; it eats up a ton of memory sticks to do it, but I'm thinking about tossing the videocam; it's really that good.  Menu options allow filters for sepia (so nice to see interiors in sepia; makes them look turn-of-the-century), solarize, black and white, negative, etc.  Plus it offers seven 'scene' modes, such as the beach (which corrects the balance to show the ocean in its correct shade of blue), fireworks, distance shots, etc.  Also has a very good macro capability if you like shooting flowers in close detail. All in all, I spent some two hours with the camera when I first got it homeand was truly taken back by how many features it offers.  And don't forget the biggest feature:  IT IS SO SMALL!!!!  Not so small like the new cell phones that are TOO tiny; just the right small so that you can put it in your shirt pocket.  It doesn't weigh a thing either (it's in the ounces category).  Just a real tour-de-force of what can be packed into a small package, still remain user-friendly, and put a true grin on your face when you use it.  There are a ton of under 5 megapixel cameras out today; Sony, Canon, Olympia, Kodak, HP, Panasonic, Leica, Epson, etc.  all make cameras that compete with this Sony.  Yet I don't see any of them offering all of the features this camera has.  I don't give out many 5 stars on products, but this one earns it in every way.  If you're just starting out in digital photography, you'll appreciate getting this many features in such a small package and one that doesn't need a PhD in Engineering to operate.  If you're a seasoned pro in the digital world, you'll love having this little guy in your pocket, just so you don't have to lug around the bigger equipment.  Highly recommended in every way.","I've had a Canon Powershot S330 and recently sold it in order to upgrade to Sony's Cybershot DSC-P8 model. Before making this particular purchase for myself, I've purchased it for someone and was particularly attracted to this camera's compact size and lightweight. Beyond that, everything including the menus and navigation were OK although I still find that Canon's operations are much easier. However, the most attractive feature of this camera is how silent the operations of its lens, particularly when zooming in and out, as compared to Canon's S330 noisy lens operations. I seriously recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a compact point-and-shoot digital camera.","I bought SONY P8 because friend had SONY P9 and was very satisfied with it. I must say it is very much comparable to the P9. Battery lasts 90 minutes and when you turn off the LCD, even when the battery is almost flat, you will still be able to make at least 20-30 pictures. The menu is easy to use. The only problem I feel with this model is that when using automat sometimes the pictures come out either too bright or too dark so it is actually better to use manual otherwise the pictures are a very good quality the same with the video. P8 makes excellent pictures in dark - flash is quite strong.The zoom is sufficient - I am only using the optical and switched off the digital zoom. To conclude, I like this camera, I knew what I was buying and I think it was a good deal (although I know that some other 3.2 MP may be cheaper), must recommmend it to everyone.","I was looking for a digital camera and ran into this one. I wasn't sure about getting it because there were a lot of good cameras out there I heard. But when I looked at this camera, and used it, then compared it to the others, I couldn't go back. For this price, it is perfect. It's considered a high-end camera, it looks so stylish, and it has all the features necessary (and more) for anything.<br />One of the things I also love about this camera is that you can take it anywhere with you, and its so portable! You'll have pictures on the fly. And it looks good and impresses your friends :) But anyway, you really should look into this camera at the least. I am so glad I choose this one!! I can't express it enough in words.<br />Sony DSC P8, Remember that name!!!","The DSC P8 is awesome. Just check it out and compare it to the others out on the market, and this hands down is the best (for its price and specs) out there. The competition is crushed. Why? Just take a look at it, and then take a look at the price for what you get. I personally like this product also because it's by Sony, and they put a lot of work into thier cameras. It's so detailed, sleek and cool looking!!! That's my main point. It's also very high quality and durable. On top of that, its most important part, its loaded with all the features for an average person, who wants to take simple pictures! You wanna take advanced pictures and movies with your camera also? SURE! It can do that to! It's packed basically.<br />Why to get this camera:<br />1) Beats all the others on the market! (ok, that might sound a little redundant)<br />2) You get so much with this camera!<br />3) It looks so stylish!<br />And there are more I'm just too tired now...<br />Bottom Line: If youre shopping for digi cams, go out and check all of them out and then take a look at this one (P8). You'll be stunned at how great it works and looks.<br />GREAT CAMERA!! ZEE BEST!","I searched around for along time.  I bought this camera  and liked it alot.<br />it has everything that you would expect from a camera at this price.  it is a compact design.  \"3.2\" (actually 3.1)is a perfect resolution.<br />Cons- there is a little time delay between pushing the button and when it takes the picture, just about every digital camera has this and you will learn to live with it.  the indoor quality is pretty good just some times it turns the flash on automaticly and that can get a little anouying.<br />I would recommed this camera to anyone who has the money.  I looked around alot and in my opion this is the best camera you will find for it's price.","The camera has superb picture quality. It has SCN modes, that takes amazing pictures at night, snow, beaches, and in very bright condition. Live Histograms helps in taking good pictures and setting light focus. The camera also shows shutter time for its current setting. Its a good feature for doing good photography.<br />P8 has MACRO mode that takes superb closeups. For the naive photographers, it has auto option. You can take movie of 640x480 with sound till you fill up your memory. It is a superb option. The movie is very clear in daylight.<br />No other camera with this specification, in market can take better quality of indoor pictures as Sony Cybershots.<br />The camera is small and light in wieght. Sony has once again come up with the product that rocks in the market. I think its worth paying for this camera.<br />Camera comes with lots of options that helps in taking good pictures at different times. I recommend you to take tripod and extra memory stick.","I bought this camera because my new laptop is a sony and<br />the salesman recommended me this camera . I wanted an olympus<br />but got the sony instead . I got the usb reader for the memory<br />stick that can work with my other computers ! it's a blast to<br />have this one , but a little dissappoint that it's not weather-<br />proof like the olympus has. Overall this is a nice camera to carry around .","First of all the image quality from P8 is very good in day light. The battery life is about average. The infolithium also shows mins remaining, this makes up for shorter battery life. The zoom lens is very good and so is the smart zoom feature. The movie are good but still very grainy & take up lots of space on the stick.<br />The problem with the camera is its expensive and proprietary battery. The extra battery from Sony is priced very high. The expensive memory sticks make it worse. Just check out the price of sticks versus the CF card and you will realize the premium Sony charges on each of these sticks. Most other accessories are also priced very high. All these things add to cost of the camera substantially, so keep them in mind.<br />Finally the camera isn't as small as Canon Elph's and neither does it offer any good shots at night or indoors. All in all its a good camera if you want to pay for its Sony label, otherwise there are many better compact cameras. Infact Sony P72 has same features with AA batteries and a slightly bigger size, check it out!","Sony has really done it this time!<br />For a full review see Jeff Keller's Digital Camera Resource Page (he does a great job).<br />Hits:<br /> This camera has the perfect balance of features for those who are \"on the go.\" The durable all-metal body is sleek and small, fitting into most pockets easily. The battery life is excellent (second only to the DSC-P72/92). The 3x zoom is suitable for 95% of travel shooting situations. With the addition of a 128mb Memory Stick (which are very cheap after rebates, see Lexar/Sandisk), this camera - at full 3.2 megapixel resolution - can fit tons of shots.<br /> The video mode is what sold me! Imagine taking 640x480 resolution video, with sound, for as long as the Memory Stick can hold... (Heck, I returned the DV camcorder I just bought, and waited for a month for this camera to be released.)<br /> Good selection of accessories (although pricey). Best accessory? Two words: Underwater Housing.<br /> The controls are VERY easy to use! I haven't look at the manual yet... but I will soon... there are probably many new tips/tricks to learn.<br />Quality of photos:<br /> The wonderful thing about this camera is that on full-auto mode, the shots are outstanding. Are you in a tricky shooting situation? Take control with \"Scene Modes,\" making those snowboarding pictures come out awesome!<br /> The camera does lack fully-manual control over exposure, whitebalance, and f-stop, but my wife does not have the patience to learn photographic theory, nor does she have the patience to wait for me to tinker with the shot. Most of the photos I've taken have been in full-auto mode, and I'm very pleased at the results.<br />Misses:<br /> No remote control... I love this about my Canon film camera. You don't realize how handy this is until you don't have it. Also, the add-on lenses require a plastic snap-on adapter. But that's the price you pay for unbelievable portability.<br />Slow focusing in low light (especially outdoors). Sometime you have to hold the shutter release button down for five seconds before it will fire. Set to (P) program mode and manually set the focus distance to speed up the process.<br />Conclusion:<br /> Excellent camera for the price. Resolution is more than adequate for my shooting situations, and it fills up the Memory Sticks slower. Video mode is the best out there. Portability, durability, reliability."]},{"name":"Olympus C-5000 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["I bought this wonderful little camera back in 2004 or 2005, maybe earlier, whenever 5.0 first came out, and have used it all these years.

So I required a bit of patience for composition and lighting. Its good enough to print big tabloid sizes on an epson at 200dpi (heavyweight matte) at the maximum tiff file size. The colors are great especially after you fight to get the right exposure at non-optimal conditions. But it took me like 1000 shots to get over the muddy exposures. (crash course in photography - lighting is king)<br /><br />On a sunny day its great. I like the manual controls though you can't save the settings completely and have to reprogram the thing.

I tried the nighttime mode and it was remarkable compared to say playing around with a manual film camera for the first time. the flash is adjustable and having a hot shoe helps for the glamour shots.<br /><br />Scrolling through all the menus and submenus are okay. I use a Canon G5 at work and its numerous buttons at first is intimidating but seems quicker access than this Olympus. Yet the scrolling on the C5000 is okay to use unless you are freaking out and rushing. Its better than the Canon in that it seems more logical as I didn't really study the manual in detail.<br /><br />Back to the controls, it has some good adjustable controls to hot rod your shots. I just wish it could stop down (or is it up?) to smaller aperature than F/8. The zoom is average range. But for some reason the super macro has great shots - probably because all the light is up close - compared to regular shots.<br /><br />Sometimes when you shoot dark shots there is some noise and speckles in the image dark areas even when you use noise reduction. And there is a somewhat vignette phenomena as well.<br /><br />Other good things about the camera: the various white balance controls helps alot; the camera starts fast. the controls are fast.<br /><br />Not so good things: transferring files is not so fast as the Canon G5 and its software. the included 16mb Xd card is a joke. waiting for the camera to reload after the 15 mb tiff file is saved is tedious.  you have to have a spare proprietary Olympus battery if you get carried away and run out of juice. no included hand strap.","I thought my camera was faulty after the first video taking, never had I thought that anybody would like to record videos without sound.  Yes, it is mentioned ONLY in the reference manual.  The camera is very good overall, except that there isn't any built-in microphone, therefore, when you record video clips, they become silent movies!  DON'T buy this unless you don't mind silent clips.<br /><br />Usually, batteries in the camera will be taken out after use to avoid leakage, but the date setting will have disappeared when it is used again.  So far, I have not seen any camera comes with small battery that can keep the date setting after the big batteries have been taken out.","I was initially attracted to the Olympux C-5000 by the terrific Amazon price - $310 or so.  This was my first venture into digital photography: I wanted to migrate from loyal old familiar 35m equipment but at 5MP. and when the price was right.  Only after purchasing the camera in May did I read some of the reviews and the negative comments alarmed me.  Had I bought a discontinued dud?  Absolutely not.  It's a superb camera.

I got the exact same camera for $313 and free shipping....shop around","I am very impressed with the high quality of pictures the camera produces. It captures great detail and the photos look very good in print 5x7 as well as on the screen.<br />Positives:<br />Great price for 5 mpx<br />Controls are easy;<br />operates like a point and shoot;<br />lightweight;<br />many shooting modes;<br />panaroma mode - excellent for 180 deg views of landscapes<br />Negatives:<br />a. Boot up time : about 45 secs to 1 min<br />b. Battery<br /> 1. Propriety size battery : expensive to replace ($50 US)<br /> 2. Life of battery : Not in line with my expectations<br /> 3. Battery life remaining indicator: Not accurate, misleading.Jumps rapidly from full charge to no charge.<br />c. Focusing close subjects a problem sometimes<br />Overall its a great camera with these small problems.","The picture quality of this camera is something to behold. I read of people saying the camera gives noisy pictures and all but they're probably using their camera with the settings at default. Set the sharpness to -2 and the aliasing and sharpening artifacts just disappear! You end up with rich and highly detailed pictures worthy of the 5MP tag. The colour that this camera gives is simply beautiful.<br />I have found the FL-20 flash to be a very good match as well. This small unit balances nicely with this camera and lends a lot more oomph to strobe lighting needs.<br />Yes, it's not a perfect camera: no low light focus beam (though the camera still focuses quite well in lowish light situations - you can also just switch to manual focus if you need and just guesstimate distance to subject); no histogram (I don't use it much anyway) and no sound with movies. But the goodies especially the picture quality outweighs the bads: Li-ion battery (very good battery life), good usable ISO range from 50, 80 ,160 (320 is as expectedly noisy), lightweight and small size, good manual exposure range (A/S), etc.<br />If you're after very high picture quality, pictures that have great detail (without that almost over smooth \"Canon look\") and colour, this is a terrific option for the money.","I bought this camera about 2 months ago and as far as I'm concerned it's a great little camera. I don't understand some of the other comments that give it a low rating. But in my experience I've taken my camera on field trips, weddings you name it and the pictures came out great. The quality of the pictures are excellent indoors and outdoors. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have audio on the movies. Other than that this camera is terrific. Some of these people need to get a life.","This is a great camera with a lot of features at a very reasonable price.  The camera is very easy to use, has great battery life (I took 75 pictures over a week w/ flash on one charge), and produces excellent pictures.  I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about with the colors.  Maybe they should learn how to operate the camera or get their vision checked?  The color looks perfect...better than a high quality film camera.  The software that comes with the camera is adequate.  My only concern before buying the c-5000 was with the xD memory format, which I had never used before.  It has worked better than I had hoped. The camera writes to the card very quickly and the camera is able to hold over 200 images at the highest resolution on the extra 256mb card I purchased.  Overall a great buy.","This is a great camera that is easy to use yet has advanced features if you want them.  The controls are very intuitive, and the display screen is excellent.  I can't quite understand the negative reviews because I haven't had any problems.  The pictures are crystal clear with great color, even when displayed on a 32-inch TV.  Great buy for a 5 MP camera ranked by PCWorld in the top 10 of advanced digital cameras.","I did a lot of research before I decided on this camera.  I was going to Europe and I wanted Digital, but I'm a broke student.  I wanted something that would be good for awhile, but wouldn't put me completely in debt.  Technically, I am still paying this off, but it was totally worth it.<br />Great quality.  I can take a picture, zoom in on it, and still blow it up to 8 x 10 photo quality.  Plus, it's really easy to use.  I mean, it has all the little special features if you want them (and I wanted them), but if you don't, it's just point and shoot.  Then, plug in the attached cord to your computer, click the copy photos button, and you're ready to print or email or whatever.  And it doesn't have that \"waiting\" problem that you'll get with a lot of digital cameras.  It has all the positives of a 35mm and all the positives of a digital.  I am completely satisfied with my choice.<br />If you're willing to spend a bit more, I'd still recommend staying with this Olympus series.  It's the best you can get.","this is the BEST 5MP dig. cam.!  it has more shooting functions you'll ever need, great picture quality, and it's extremely light!","I am new to the digital photography world, yet consider myself fairly well adept at picking up digital devices if provided with good information and clear instructions. After researching and test driving most major brands and models of 5 MP Digital Cameras recently, I kept coming back to the Olympus C-5000Z and simply could not pass up all the features of this camera when all was said and done. Especially at the price that I did not see even remotely matched by any of the other big brand manufacturer's.<br /> However, if size is an issue and a compact, lightweight camera is a priority, you will probably opt for something else. Auto feature allowed me to literally put the battery and memory into the camera, shoot pictures indoors and out, and download to my laptop, even email the photos to anyone in my address book - without one hassle or hitch.<br /><br /> It does seem to do better in brighter or well lit areas versus darker, primarily indoor environments. I also learned when I went to purchase the camera there was a $50 manufacturer rebate available, effective through 3/30/04 (I believe)?<br /><br /> The rebate and most every other basic feature necessary for the beginner-to-intermediate digital photographer, made the Olympus C-5000 Zoom extremely hard to pass up. Thus far, I have been completely satisfied with the camera and have no regrets with my decision whatsoever.","I've had this camera for a few days now and it is awesome.  It takes great pictures and has a lot of options.  I don't have a detailed review since I've only owned the camera for a short period of time but when I was trying to decide which camera to purchase some of the reviews for this camera said it took poor indoor pictures...this is not true.  I've only taken pictures indoor and the quality is above most cameras.","This would be the perfect camera for most, if only it had a focus assist light.  Noise if very high for indoor shots, epecially if you leave it on auto.  This is a camera that requires you know alot about iso, focusing methods (such as spot focusing) and setting the contrast (this camera uses a contrast focusing system).  The less light you have, the longer it takes to focus.  Shutter lag is excellent for daytime, outdoor shots, and much slower with low to moderate light. Due to Olympus using a contract TTL system, adjusting the contrast to -1 really helps, as well as setting the metering to spot.  Also setting the sharpness to -1 helps with noise.  A flash is a must for indoor shots, provided you can get the camera to focus lock.  A bigger xD card is a must...The 5060 is a much better camera, but costs $...more."]},{"name":"HP Photosmart 735","amazon_reviews":["good","This camera is still going strong after years of use.

Once, I dropped it from 5 feet onto a sidewalk and it didn't even get a scratch.  The outdoor picture quality is excellent, as well as the macro mode, but if you have shaky hands (like me), you will have a ton of blurry pics.  The screen just can't compete with new cameras, being too small and dim to see outdoors.  The flash is weak, but if you know how to use aperture and ISO settings, indoor shots will turn out pretty good.  Personally, I think buyers would be better off buying one of HP's new R-series cameras (R717, R817, etc).  While this camera is cheap and pretty reliable, the newer models have much more features and are still around $200-$300.","this cam was great when untill the flash didnt work! i went online for support but after talking to them, they said it was a internal malfunction or something like that but by then the warrantee already expired so im stuck with a flashless camera.

It's a very good point and shoot camera with enough modes and settings to satisfy those who like fiddling with such things.<br /><br />Many of the reviews here complain about battery life.  Turn off the live display, you don't need it anyway since the viewfinder is accurate.  I never got *fewer* than 60 pictures (sometimes more) in two star mode with the live display off, on a pair of 1800 mAh rechargeables.  I also had a big difference when I changed the auto shutoff to a shorter time period.<br /><br />Also, yes, you need a memory card -- but what digital camera doesn't?  I had a 64 MB card with mine and only once completely used the card up.<br /><br />Shutter speed is a little slower than average for the class but fine for everything except action shots.  Lens glass is by Pentax and is good quality.  No, you won't get digital SLR quality from this camera, but at <$140 it's a great deal.","good","This camera is still going strong after years of use.

The video mode is pretty good....i also recommend using the power adapter when possible! that way you can turn the camera on as long as you want without worrying about the batteries dieing out!The printer is a really great printer as well!...but sadly i cant live any longer with a flashless camera so im going to sell this up or just give it to my brother or something and saving up for a Fuji Finepix s5100...Good luck!","This was my first digital camera and it's because of this camera that I stuck with HP when upgrading.  It's a very good point and shoot camera with enough modes and settings to satisfy those who like fiddling with such things.<br /><br />Many of the reviews here complain about battery life.  Turn off the live display, you don't need it anyway since the viewfinder is accurate.  I never got *fewer* than 60 pictures (sometimes more) in two star mode with the live display off, on a pair of 1800 mAh rechargeables.  I also had a big difference when I changed the auto shutoff to a shorter time period.<br /><br />Also, yes, you need a memory card -- but what digital camera doesn't?  I had a 64 MB card with mine and only once completely used the card up.<br /><br />Shutter speed is a little slower than average for the class but fine for everything except action shots.  Lens glass is by Pentax and is good quality.  No, you won't get digital SLR quality from this camera, but at <$140 it's a great deal.","I bought this camera for under $140 for a trip to Montana.  This was the best investment.  It took great pictures outdoors of the mountains and at Yellowstone - true to life color.  Indoor quality is pretty decent - not the best in darkness.  It is slow to take a picture - but most digitals do have a split second delay.  As with any digital camera buy rechargeables because they do eat the batters.  I have owned this camera for 2 months and have taken over 2000 pictures on it.<br /><br />Another great HP product is the HP psc 2175 all-in-one copier.  By far this is the best printer we have ever owned and especially when you can find them on sale like we did for just $99.97!!!!","Th hp735 is an good value for a 3.2MP camera.  The image quality surpassed my expecations for an HP camera.  The sharpness and contrast has never been an issue.  The color seems to be on the blue side and a little under-saturated.  But as long as I have a sharp picture, I can deal with tint and saturation in pretty much any software.<br /><br />If you're starting out with a new digital camera, the HP735 is an excellent value for the price.  The shutter to shot, shot to shot and turn-on time is slow but tolerable.  The beginner photographer will enjoy this camera.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. focus brackets indicate focus lock; invaluable when you don't have time to review after the shot is taken; pretty reliable<br /><br />2. lcd on the top of the camera keeps the back panel display from being cluttered<br /><br />3. nice, sharp images.<br /><br />4. the macro feature renders excellent close-ups with nicely blurred backgrounds.<br /><br />5. their software detects already uploaded pics and gives you the option of only transfering new images.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. does not automatically return to your settings; you must hold the \"ok\" button when powering on the camera<br /><br />2. not enough cursor keys to pan when zooming in to review an image.<br /><br />3. slow shutter to shot; slow shot to shot; slow turn-on; this is typical of entry level digital cameras;<br /><br />4. battery life but i typically carry an extra set.<br /><br />5. tint and saturation is a little off; but correctable with software","I bought this camera from Target. It is a great camera. My only peeve is that the battery door is weak, and it broke while inserting batteries. I called HP and they promptly replaced the camera. I got my replacement in less than 2 days!! As far as power consumption goes, I don't use the LCD display at all. I also use NiMH rechargables, and I get about 65 pictures each charge. I use the optical zoom sparingly and transfer pictures to my computer about 3 times. I best feature about this camera is that it has a little display on the top, where you can adjust picture quality, mode and flash options. That, I guess saves a lot of battery power. All in all, a great product and I am really happy with it.","I bought this camera as a \"fill-in\" while I wait for the price of 5Mp+ SLR types to fall from $1K to <$500. Have used it for about a week. Pros are: Good quality lens - takes very good pictures (as good resolution/quality as most any 3.2 Mp). Simple user interface (most important stuff on three simple buttons on top with LCD display). Cons are: Movie mode is too low resolution and grainy. Has some delay between camera and playback mode (slow processor). I installed lithium batteries and have taken a few dozen photos and it still shows full battery, so this issue (complaints by others) has not bothered me. Overall, a good camera if it stays well below $200. If you can afford $250 to $300, you might look at others too (e.g. Canon A75 or A80).","For those of you having problems with the batteries...  We finally bought more expensive, non rechargeable batteries.  Otherwise you could only take about 5 pictures, and it took FOREVER to save them.  Try Energizer Litium.  They worked great right up until the time someone stole it!","Almost every reviewer has complained about short lifetime with alkaline batteries. This is because you are NOT suppoused to use these! It says so explicitly in the manual. If you get rechargable batteries the camera works for several days before you need to recharge.","Given the price of the camera, it is a great preformer. The pictures, when set on the 2 star quality, are good, and they're somewhat better on 3 star quality (the camera has adjustable photo quality). I'd reccomend a memory card, but that's normal with digital cameras; most don't come with more than 32MG internal memory, and this one only has 16. On high quality settings, that'll last maybe 10-15 pictures.<br /> The pictures on the higher settings are as good as one can expect from a camera in this price range; they don't compete with the 5 megapixel deals, but what do you expect? They're more than good enough for email or photo work on your PC; I blew a photo up to use as my desktop (on a 17\" flatscreen) and it was still photo quality.<br />The video and audio capabilities are neat, but I don't use them; just have no reason. Also, they seem to eat the batteries. They do work though, and are surprisingly decent (of course, they do not compete with a camcorder).<br />The interface is easy to figure out, and the camera is easy to use. For most of us, it takes photos as good or better than we'll need.<br />The only complaint I've heard is that it eats batteries, but so long as I stay away from the video and audio features it doesn't seem to to so badly; they'll last more than the 10 pictures or so that other people mention. I've taken more than 40 pictures since I've gotten it, as well as a 2 minute video (which killed the first set of batteries), and I'm only on my second set. Just buy rechargables.","I read multiple reviews...not just on this site, how this cam can't take indoor or dark pics, or how it eats batteries like mad. Well, I'm here to tell you that if you read the manual, learn the different modes and qualities and so on, you won't have any problem indoors, or in dark. As far as battery consumption, I am on my first set of batteries and I have taken 60-70 pics, plus uploaded 2 sets to my pc via USB. Now, if you have your red eye flash on, normal flash on, and are using the lcd screen as a viewfinder then, yes, you will burn up batteries...but if you are outside, and you are using the normal view finder and no flash, or inside and mess with the modes of capturing, then you will be fine. like I said...I have taken alot on one set. The quality is amazing, adjusting the saturation and modes and such is a snap, and it is big enough to be useful and small enough to be portable. The video capture is great too...64 MB card will give you about 4 1/2 minutes of video with sound at pretty good quality...fun for emails and such. So there it is. A great camera with quality pics and good solid construction...and with a little messing around the quality will only get better, I found a new hobby.","I recentley purchased this camera from target. I now wish I had purchased it from target.com, due to the $ 50 mail-in rebate. But, anyways the camera is a solid performer, I purchased it for taking basic everyday pictures. The 3.2 megapixels are more than enough for my photos. The zoom is the reason I bought it (15 x total zoom). I am happy with it overall. The uploading process is fairly easy too. If you plan on purchasing this camera, be sure to buy good batteries (NiMh) and a charger. You will be set to take pictures for a long time. The battery cover is very flimsy so be careful there, so you may want to buy a camera case. The internal memory is allright, but dont rely on it to store all your pictures. I also purchased the 64mb memory card and at the lowest quality you can take over 400 pictures with the card. The video mode is suprisingly decent, but don't expect to shoot whole concerts. Overall, for the price its a decent camera.","that's right,i run out of batteries in a very short time.i bought lots of rechargable batteries,they are always in charge. so this solved my problem in a way.<br />secondly when i saw my friends' cameras(like fuji) i ve been shocked.because their image quality was better.but then i learned their prices..really high!<br />i think this is not a bad camera considering its price..","i just bought a hp ps735 a present for my husband for our anniversary. reading all the reviews seems to be balance thats why im rating it 4stars. but so far i had the camera for a day so i cant say too much about it...and i dont know if im keeping it while i can still return it.  like some people would say the batteries seem to show a bit problem. i tried playing with the camera and video clips so far it works awesome im happy with the video clips i can imagine i my husband can use video clips longer if he gets a bigger mb. anyways im scary about the battery problem since i know my hubby likes to play with the cam. i still have 90days to decide to keep or return the product as i was told by the sales clerck at target 15% of $199.00 to return or exchange is not a big deal if it breaks within 90 days i dont have to pay anything. right now ill keep the camera and try to get energizer industrial batteries and see what happens. i will let u know if im 100% satisfied with the hp ps735. all i can say is that before purchasing anything make sure that if u are not satisfied with the product u may return or exchage with the one u like to get and so far hp is the best product when it comes with computer so as compaq.","I've gotten this camera for Xmas and I am attached to it. It takes great pictures in 3 different formats and has a video option as well (you can record pretty nice videos too).<br />It's really easy to use, and the USB plug & play feature for connecting to any PC is awesome since you do not need to have the special software installed, thus enabling to download the photos in every computer (especially handy when you are traveling and do not carry with you your own) and emailing them.<br />I have heard about \"swallowing batteries\" by a hundred, but the time I have had the camera, I only needed to change batteries once and before running out of them it kept on warning me about it.<br />I am truly happy about it.","I purchased this digital camera for my wife for Christmas after comparing some 6 different cameras.  This was our first digital camera, but we pretty much knew what to expect.<br />Some of the negative reviews I believe are a little unfair.  The picture quality is completely dependent on the photographer.  The camera allows you to take 1, 2, or 3 \"star\" pictures.  The 1 star photos are the poorest quality - we found them to be equivalent of taking pictures with a cheap disposable camera.  But the higher star photos are quite good, and we had no problem using the zoom.<br />Two words of advice - since you will need to take 2 or 3 star photos for the quality, you will also need to purchase a memory card expander.  And this camera is a monster on batteries - we used Duracell Ultras for our first pictures and the batteries died after 10 pictures.  My suggestion is to use the camera's manual viewfinder whenever possible, don't take too many video or audio clips, and buy decent rechargable batteries.<br />The viewfinder was easy to read, the directions were clear, and the camera is easy to use.  For people interested in purchasing their first digital camera who don't want the poor quality of a 2MP camera and/or can't afford a 5MP, this is a smart purchase.","Unless you're a avid photography buff, you really don't need too many megapixels or very high-quality lenses.  The 3.2 mp HP 735 is a fine camera.  It reads the Secure Digital format which is preferable to CompactFlash.  Storing a picture sometimes takes too long, especially when the camera first boots.  Battery life it what I would expect from a digital camera.  They all could make more efficient use of power.  Overall a decent camera","I love my camera!  The lady who gave it a bad review sounds like she wasn't too paitent with it..I was worried if I had gotten a jicky one at first, but after playing with it for awhile and leaning all that it can do I love it..plus it prints out perfect pictures!  I bought rechargeable batteries and a charger so I don't have any problems with running out of batteries when I'm using it awhile, plus the more I recharge my batteries the longer life cycles they seem to have (Duracell).  It's simple to use even with all the options it has, such as portrait shot, action shot, landscape, burst of pictures, video and audio recording options, so on and so on.  It does have a slightly delayed flash depending on the flash you use (reg., auto, red-eye, night, no flash), but it hasn't been a problem for me. I especially like the self-timer..we took a family portrait in front of the tree and gave them for X-mas presents! I would reccomend this camera to anyone who just likes to take pictures for fun like me...five stars!","This is my second digital camera.  My first (canon) turned up missing.  We believe our 20 month old daughter may have tossed it in the trash.  Even she knew that it was garbage..LOL! So we replaced and definately upgraded to this HP.  I LOVE IT!! I take a ton of pictures between my 2 babies and selling on ebay and I couldn't be happier.  The pics are crisp and clear, and you have so much control with all the manual settings. Yes, there is a delay from the time you push the button to the time the pic is actually taken but that is because it is focusing. All digitals have some kind of delay. If you are taking action pics you can manually set it for such but the quality won't be real great.  If you want great quality, action pictures you are gonna need to spend a heck of a lot more than 200 on a camera, or better yet use a regular one and have the pics put on disk.  I compared every single camera in this price range in person, online, and asked around to see what people had to say and I think I found the best.  If you go to best buy, walmart,whatever...pick up each camera and look at it closely you can definately tell which ones are better quality, and this is definately a great quality camera.  Buy this one you won't be disappointed!","I've been using this camera for the past month and have been very happy with it. I have but a few pet peeves with this camera:<br />1. Batteries ran out too quick -- I just took a dozen pictures and the included Energizer batteries ran out?!<br />2. Internal 16 MB memory is inadequate. At highest resolution, you can only take 8 pictures before memory runs out.<br />3. Processing time after taking a picture takes too long. You have to wait for about 20-25 seconds before you can take another.<br />Fortunately, the first two problems are easily solved. I immediately bought 6 good quality NiMH rechargeable batteries (the camera accepts 2 at a time). Other digital cameras fix this problem by using 4 batteries at a time for longer life, but I think I would rather have the compact design of the 735.<br />Then I bought a 256MB SD flash memory card and it now shows it can accomdate 164 pictures at max resolution. That's a lot of pictures!!<br />The third problem, I guess I have to get used to since I always like taking pictures at max resolution, making the processing phase a little slower.<br />The last thing I did was buy a camera bag at Target for $6.99. It fits the camera perfectly and has an additional pouch for the extra batteries.<br />As can be surmised from my issues above, I'm not a professional (or even amateur) photographer. I just like taking pictures during events, and of my son (who's growing so fast!!). I just want a camera that works. And since I'm upgrading from a non-digital camera, seeing these problems that I didn't have with the old camera is a little annoying.<br />Despite all that, at this price, I really think the 735 gives the extremely good value for a 3.2 megapixel camera.","I owned HP's photosmart 315 camera for the last 3 years and decided to upgrade to the HP 735 and WOW! am I glad I did.<br />This is one fine 'automatic' camera and I am having loads of fun with it. They really thought this one out well.  I also bought the 'dock' and it is making my life with this new camera so much easier. It recharges my batteries without taking them out of the camera and it hooks up to my TV to view my photos there if I wish.<br />Two things I would recommend you upgrade as soon as you receive this fine, easy to use, camera:<br />1.  Purchase a set of NiMH/1800 to 2200mHh rechargeable batteries. (Use the set that comes with it in your child's toys.)<br />2.  Upgrade that 16MB memory card that comes with it to at least 124MB SD card or even an 256MB card.  You will be glad you did. Like any computer, we always have to upgrade that memory!<br />HP products ROCK!  No other for me. I highly recommend this camera with all it's ease of use features for the 'snapshot enthusist'!  Which most of us are.","I bought the hp 735 photosmart camera to replace an hp 315 which, contrary to reviews I've read, I thought worked very well.  I used it a lot for snapshots, eBay ads, and some pretty good picture taking, editing with Ulead iPhoto software that came with a scanner and displaying photos on my computer with GPhotoshow freeware, which I recommend.  The 315 display was too dim.  The 735 is better.  The 315 had 2.1-megapixel resolution and that was fine for me because I wasn't printing larger tham ordinary print sizes but I'll tell you where the higher 3.2 MB resolution has already helped:  when I wanted just a small part of a picture that I couldn't get close enough to - just used my software to crop what I wanted.<br />The 735 is nice sized - I like to carry it in my pants pocket.<br />The 16 MB internal memory is totally inadequate.  I knew that but so far haven't gotten what I need, having once ordered (then resold) the wrong card on eBay.  Plan on spending for more memory right away.  Plan on something like a 128 MB card.  That's what I expect to get, or 256 MB - I sure wish I knew for sure what product to buy & if they work right!  The manual that came with it says \"128 MB is the largest memory card tested by HP.  Larger sizes ... should work - use at your own risk\"!!  So you tell me!<br />The movies are worthless indoors.  Unless you provide very bright lighting, or can accept just a dark suggestion of what you saw.  And a couple of those very few movies I've taken indoors so far had a blue line down the images!  It worked ok outdoors.<br />You have to solve the battery issue.  It ought to come with better info on batteries.  I don't like being expected to research the hardware.  So far, I've found most of the ordinary AA batteries I have around the house don't work.  But I'll tell you this much:  right now I have some Energizer Industrial batteries in it, and they seem to work fine.  If only I knew where my wife bought them ...<br />And I have around the house some Radio Shack rechargeable batteries that work in other things - The 1.2 V 1000 mAh AA Ni-Cd versions do NOT work at all in this camera, while the 1.2V 1600 mAh AA METAL HYDRIDE versions do seem to work okay.  I'd guess you had better carry some spares in your pocket when you walk out of the house with the upgraded memory card.  With the 16MB, no problem.<br />Beyond that, it has more features than I really want to worry about - for you pros - and the biggest issue I have with those is that in a dark room I find it hard to see what settings I'm on - really more difficult that the older camera if only because with more choices it's harder to tell, for example, do I have it set for fill in flash, red eye reduction, or suppressed flash - features I DO use and find it hard to use on this camera because I can't see the tiny LCD indications in typical indoor lighting, such as in a club or coffeehouse where I'm trying to take photos of my favorite band.","I purchased this camera before taking a trip out West.  I'm not a great photographer but found that this camera took good quality pictures without much fuss on my part.  I liked the fact that I could change the picture quality settings to hold more pictures (I took 92 one day without having to have a memory card) and I liked being able to set the camera to landscape or portrait or action mode depending on my subject.  I found it very easy to use.  It's also possible to fine-tune your settings if you're a more experienced photographer.  I thought it was a really good value.","Very solid, Auto mode makes point and shoot easy, Bright clear photos, Easy download, workable manual, tons of features, Feels good in hand. Easy to review pictures<br />Weaknesses:<br />Hard to see display in bright outdoors. Batteries go fast. slightly confusing access to Image Display and Capture Menu. The Capture Mode more confusing than handy. Limited shots at high resolution<br />Summary:<br />I have enjoyed using this camera, my first digital. I find it easiest to use this camera as a basic \"point and shoot\" I hardly use the Live Image Display although tempted to. It's fun to play cinematographer, but It burns out the batteries too fast.<br />I don't mess around too much with the Capture Mode option's offered; shoot Micro, Landscapes, Portraits, or Action. My technique is too spontainious for me to set the mode every time I want a shot.<br />More functional is the capture menu, not the easiest to locate and manipulate when you want to modify a shooting mode, but helpful when an artistic effect is desired. Items from the Capture Settings Menu that I use; The White Balance feature is good to be aware of, for example, If I shoot in the shade mode, even in bright daylight,I don't worry about backlighting. I also like the Saturation feature, nature can be Psychidelic. I leave all the other options to the default (auto) mode. I skip things like EV Compensation, although well laid out in the manual, it is too much to recall on the verge of a picture, the default (auto) mode will take a good picture.<br />Another Menu, the Playback Menu allows you to review your thumbnails, delete or rotate your images.<br />I guess I have to buy a memory card if I wish to shoot in only the 3.2MP mode. I only get 8 shots in the highest quality mode. The lowest setting is most memory efficient at 80+ pictures. 14-18 pictures in middle setting is respectable. Next stop? 5MP maybe a digital SLR","I love this camera!  I sold a 2.1 megapixal HP to upgrade to this one.  The photos are fabulous, the camera easy to use.  I have no problem with fuzzy pictures as one of the other reviewers stated.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.","For the money this is a great machine.  The lens is sharp, colors are well saturated, and everything on the camera actually works.  This little guy has rekindled my old interest in photography, and it is possible to take this camera out and come back with hundreds of reasonable pictures.  My bags full of high-end 35mm are likely to gather more dust.  The optional 8881 dock works well, and the HP photoshare feature allows encoding email address targets or printing instructions on the camera for automatic download/print/email sharing when docked.  Standard AA batteries (only two) and generic storage expansion are appreciated.  Buy an extra few high capacity NiMH batteries on your own and you will be able to shoot all day long.  Moderate resolution setting and a 256 MB SD card will keep you busy for over two hundred shots with very reasonable resolution.<br />The HP 735 performs much better than I expected it to, and it's highly recommended.  A manual focus option is the only feature missing that I would find useful, especially for macro shots.  If the functions and output do not satisfy, then the only option is to move up to >5 Mpixels at a much higher price point."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-U30","amazon_reviews":["This camera and my U20 is a technological wonder. It is as small as a large pack of stick gum as everyone has stated, but it is also light and pretty tough as it has a completely aluminum shell. I dropped it a few times on industrial carpet (no padding) and its still kicking. All shots I took were razor sharp and the things that I really liked about this little camera were its speed to start up and the shutter lag. It takes about a second to boot up, great for impulse shots. Something happens and you are on it, a one handed operation to pull it out of your coat pocket, slide open the lens cover/power switch and hit the shutter release. It is small enough to just hold out and shoot, the LCD is TINY and is more of a review tool than a frame tool although it works fine for that too if your eyes are good enough. The shutter lag as about 1/2 second counting flash, a little less outside, not really good but deffinately better than some cameras. There are some functions that are useless, like the index function that shows 1/4 inch thumbnails of pictures on the memory stick, that is a small picture, large enough just to make out what the pic might be of. I wear glasses so this may be a little biased. It has a few modes, like sepia, black and white, scenic and close up, dont really see a diference in the scenic and close up, maybe an F-stop difference. All in all, I was REALLY impressed with my 20 dollar Ebay purchase, although they have really gone up in price on the popular auction site. I would imagine the CCD recall from Sony has really made these popular again as it is a VERY popular free service. I had my camera for little over a month when it started to show the signs of the CCD defect, Purple and green images, and the entire LCD image seems to melt befor your eyes like a watercolor picture put under a faucet. Very \"trippy\" looking image. I power cycled it a few times and it cleared up but it always came back, probably why it was 20 bucks! I stashed it broken for almost 1 year until I heard of the recall and promptly dug it out and sent it away to Sony after filling out the online repair request, they even sent me a pre paid UPS label, very accomidating of SONY as it was a real PR nightmare when over 100 models of cameras from 6 different manufacturers started to hear of the bad SONY made CCD going out. Excellent little impulse camera when it works, probably not the best for a scenic trip, but great at parties and glove box shooting. Zinc batteries last about 4 shots, NiCD are better, NiMH are great and the new Energizer lithium batteries will work for a few days of shooting!","I love cameras and this camera is a Keeper!  It fits nicely in the handbag/pocket and takes great pictures!  When I want to take a camera with me while power-walking (maybe catch a deer or ducks in my view...) this camera fits perfect in my pocket and doesn't interfere with my \"steps\" :)","Picture quality is great and it's so easy to throw in your pocket or purse... a nice camera to have as a second camera.","I bought 5 of these when Ritz Camera were closing them out at $100 each. Love it as a second camera, easy to use and great as a second small digital camera if not also as a primary one. The other 4 were given as gifts and all those who received it love it too. Easy to pack for everyday carrying! Included NIMH batteries and charger made it even a better deal!<br /><br />Afternote: I gave this to my son for his E-Bay use and got a Canon SD 400 which I love.","This is my second purchased. I've taken my camera everywhere I go and people notice the size and simplicity of the use from this camera. I have to tell you, when you need a quick shot of a special moment, simply whip it out and snap! That's how easy it is. Battery lifetime is good, just make sure you maintain it well.<br /><br />Anyhow, I've got two now! One for personal use and the other for work. So if you are looking for something small, light weight, and easy to use, GET this one! Good luck and have fun with it!<br /><br />DL","Images can be stored on the included 8 MB Memory Stick, which can store approximately 15 images at 1632 x 1224 pixels. The Cyber-shot DSC-P92 is also compatible with optional Memory Stick PRO media, which can extend data capacity up to 1 GB.<br /><br />Images can be downloaded to either a Mac or PC via ultrafast USB 2.0, which means it can be connected to any USB-compatible Windows Me/2000/XP and Mac OS 8.6 or later computer without installing any software. When used with USB 1.1 connection, transfer will slow to USB 1.1 rate.","This camera is perfect for replacing the 35mm point-and-shoot camera you use on a daily basis. The ease of use is unparalleled, just slide open and take your pictures. Prints look well on 4X6 paper.  The Flash is sort of weak, anything beyond point-and-shoot portraits gets somewhat dark but no different than the 35mm camera I used to have.  I was originally concerned with the poor battery life associated with alkaline batteries that I first used after I bought the camera.  The camera died after about 20-30 minutes of use.  After purchasing rechargeable batteries, I was able to use the camera for a whole week in Europe without even getting below the 1/4 mark, so I would recommend rechargeables with the alkaline as a supplement in case you need them. No complaints or regrets with this camera, a 128mb card holds well over 200 pictures.","I bought this camera in March 2004 with a plan to have the smallest camera available to compliment my Canon Digital Rebel.<br />This thing is freakin' amazing. The picture quality is ALMOST as good as my old 1999 2.1MP Kodak DC290 that retailed for $1099.<br /><br />It is in my pocket anywhere I go. Two weeks after buying this camera, our 2005 Escape was rear ended (with 306 miles on it!, $4200 damage!) and I was able to get pics of the accident scene. Awesome.<br /><br />I used it on vacation and stuck it out of the sunroof to get scenery pics. The LCD is nice in the sun, you can still see the images.<br /><br />Seven months after buying it, I have already taken 8,300 pics! You just want to take pics of everything since its so convenient. Mountain biking, home projects, the garden, pets, my partially chopped off index finger last weekend, whatever. It can focus down to about 4\", but it has no zoom which can be annoying at times. That is my only complaint.<br /><br />The casing is metal and mine has several large dents from hitting the ground. It fell in the dirt a few times and the sliding cover trapped some dirt that grinds into the metal when sliding it open/closed.<br /><br />I see it on Amazon for [$]!! Makes me want to buy a spare at that price. Paid $149 from Sears. There is now a U40 model out. Not much different.<br /><br />Check out my pics at:<br />[...]","This camera and my U20 is a technological wonder. It is as small as a large pack of stick gum as everyone has stated, but it is also light and pretty tough as it has a completely aluminum shell. I dropped it a few times on industrial carpet (no padding) and its still kicking. All shots I took were razor sharp and the things that I really liked about this little camera were its speed to start up and the shutter lag. It takes about a second to boot up, great for impulse shots. Something happens and you are on it, a one handed operation to pull it out of your coat pocket, slide open the lens cover/power switch and hit the shutter release. It is small enough to just hold out and shoot, the LCD is TINY and is more of a review tool than a frame tool although it works fine for that too if your eyes are good enough. The shutter lag as about 1/2 second counting flash, a little less outside, not really good but deffinately better than some cameras. There are some functions that are useless, like the index function that shows 1/4 inch thumbnails of pictures on the memory stick, that is a small picture, large enough just to make out what the pic might be of. I wear glasses so this may be a little biased. It has a few modes, like sepia, black and white, scenic and close up, dont really see a diference in the scenic and close up, maybe an F-stop difference. All in all, I was REALLY impressed with my 20 dollar Ebay purchase, although they have really gone up in price on the popular auction site. I would imagine the CCD recall from Sony has really made these popular again as it is a VERY popular free service. I had my camera for little over a month when it started to show the signs of the CCD defect, Purple and green images, and the entire LCD image seems to melt befor your eyes like a watercolor picture put under a faucet. Very \"trippy\" looking image. I power cycled it a few times and it cleared up but it always came back, probably why it was 20 bucks! I stashed it broken for almost 1 year until I heard of the recall and promptly dug it out and sent it away to Sony after filling out the online repair request, they even sent me a pre paid UPS label, very accomidating of SONY as it was a real PR nightmare when over 100 models of cameras from 6 different manufacturers started to hear of the bad SONY made CCD going out. Excellent little impulse camera when it works, probably not the best for a scenic trip, but great at parties and glove box shooting. Zinc batteries last about 4 shots, NiCD are better, NiMH are great and the new Energizer lithium batteries will work for a few days of shooting!","I love cameras and this camera is a Keeper!  It fits nicely in the handbag/pocket and takes great pictures!  When I want to take a camera with me while power-walking (maybe catch a deer or ducks in my view...) this camera fits perfect in my pocket and doesn't interfere with my \"steps\" :)","Picture quality is great and it's so easy to throw in your pocket or purse... a nice camera to have as a second camera.","I bought 5 of these when Ritz Camera were closing them out at $100 each. Love it as a second camera, easy to use and great as a second small digital camera if not also as a primary one. The other 4 were given as gifts and all those who received it love it too. Easy to pack for everyday carrying! Included NIMH batteries and charger made it even a better deal!<br /><br />Afternote: I gave this to my son for his E-Bay use and got a Canon SD 400 which I love.","This is my second purchased. I've taken my camera everywhere I go and people notice the size and simplicity of the use from this camera. I have to tell you, when you need a quick shot of a special moment, simply whip it out and snap! That's how easy it is. Battery lifetime is good, just make sure you maintain it well.<br /><br />Anyhow, I've got two now! One for personal use and the other for work. So if you are looking for something small, light weight, and easy to use, GET this one! Good luck and have fun with it!<br /><br />DL","Images can be stored on the included 8 MB Memory Stick, which can store approximately 15 images at 1632 x 1224 pixels. The Cyber-shot DSC-P92 is also compatible with optional Memory Stick PRO media, which can extend data capacity up to 1 GB.<br /><br />Images can be downloaded to either a Mac or PC via ultrafast USB 2.0, which means it can be connected to any USB-compatible Windows Me/2000/XP and Mac OS 8.6 or later computer without installing any software. When used with USB 1.1 connection, transfer will slow to USB 1.1 rate.","This camera is perfect for replacing the 35mm point-and-shoot camera you use on a daily basis. The ease of use is unparalleled, just slide open and take your pictures. Prints look well on 4X6 paper.  The Flash is sort of weak, anything beyond point-and-shoot portraits gets somewhat dark but no different than the 35mm camera I used to have.  I was originally concerned with the poor battery life associated with alkaline batteries that I first used after I bought the camera.  The camera died after about 20-30 minutes of use.  After purchasing rechargeable batteries, I was able to use the camera for a whole week in Europe without even getting below the 1/4 mark, so I would recommend rechargeables with the alkaline as a supplement in case you need them. No complaints or regrets with this camera, a 128mb card holds well over 200 pictures.","I bought this camera in March 2004 with a plan to have the smallest camera available to compliment my Canon Digital Rebel.<br />This thing is freakin' amazing. The picture quality is ALMOST as good as my old 1999 2.1MP Kodak DC290 that retailed for $1099.<br /><br />It is in my pocket anywhere I go. Two weeks after buying this camera, our 2005 Escape was rear ended (with 306 miles on it!, $4200 damage!) and I was able to get pics of the accident scene. Awesome.<br /><br />I used it on vacation and stuck it out of the sunroof to get scenery pics. The LCD is nice in the sun, you can still see the images.<br /><br />Seven months after buying it, I have already taken 8,300 pics! You just want to take pics of everything since its so convenient. Mountain biking, home projects, the garden, pets, my partially chopped off index finger last weekend, whatever. It can focus down to about 4\", but it has no zoom which can be annoying at times. That is my only complaint.<br /><br />The casing is metal and mine has several large dents from hitting the ground. It fell in the dirt a few times and the sliding cover trapped some dirt that grinds into the metal when sliding it open/closed.<br /><br />I see it on Amazon for [$]!! Makes me want to buy a spare at that price. Paid $149 from Sears. There is now a U40 model out. Not much different.<br /><br />Check out my pics at:<br />[...]","I've owned several digital cameras.<br /><br />I disagree with anything negative anyone has had to say.  Mine came with a rechargable battery - it gets AMAZING battery life.  The absolute best feature is the super quick shutter speed.  They rate it at 0.9 seconds.  And unlike most cameras that have a button you press to power on, on the dscu30 you just slide the cover open and its on instantly.  Also, people love it - you whip it out and people are amazed at how tiny and cool looking it is.  Its smaller than alot of the \"flat\" design cameras.  My favorite feature is the fact that it has the lens slide cover (mine is not wobbly).  It is so convienent to be able to carry the camera in your pocket without worry about it powering on , or even worse - scratching the lens.<br /><br />Downsides:<br /><br />-2.0 MP - I do webdesign, personal photos for fun, email, etc. It is good for me - If I ever wanted to blow up pics or anything like that - I would want higher resolution.  But that is nothing specific to this camera.  Standard size pics print just beautifully.<br /><br />-Comes with a meesly 8mb memory stick, you definitly need a minimum of 64mb - (about $40 and up - shop around).  Again, not specific to this model, every digi cam maker throws you a tiny card. Just plan for the expense.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Sony digital cameras.  They make high quality, solid products.  Need convience, portability, and quality - buy this","This a nice digital camera, it's worth it. The only problem is as well with all the other electronics gadgets, battery life, this itsy bitsy camera eats a lot of them, you will need at least two other sets of rechargable ones.  And the red eye option not working very well. I love it","I bought this camera because I just had a baby and I wanted to be able to just throw it in the diaper bag and not miss any cute little thing my new baby did.  It's good for that.  My two problems are why I only rated this 3 stars.  One-it eats up batteries FAST!  It's just not convienent to have more batters rolling around a diaper bag.  And two-the red eye is horrible.  I end up with demon baby every time her eyes are open.  Even after I turn the red-eye reduction on.  Maybe it's just my camera, I don't know.  Most people seem to love this camera.  I wish it didn't have that red eye problem.  I'd be much happier with it.","I just purchased this little gem at my local Target here in Albuquerque NM. I have been impressed with the innovative, quality technology products Target has been carrying. I purchased a Apple iPod for Christmas at Target and absolutely love it. You won't find these types of products at Walmart - Sorry ! Anyway this is one great little camera. It is very small and fits anywhere. The style and design are great. It is very simple to operate. I was taking pictures all around the house right out of the box without even opening the manual, although I did read it cover to cover later on and learned a few shortcuts. That really means something as many digital cameras today are quite cryptic to understand.<br /><br /> I connected the camera to my Apple Powerbook and the photos instantly appeared in my iPhoto application. No drivers to load, no fuss, no muss. It just all worked - now that is technology the way it should be.<br /><br /> Photo quality was sharp and vivid and just fine for 4X6 prints, emailing, and Web posting. This probably covers 90% of what digital cameras are used for. The other 10% is higher end needs that of course require larger, more feature rich cameras, greater pixels, and bigger wallets.<br /><br /> The bottom line - Very small, so you can take it everywhere. Very easy to use. Great Sony quality and nice looking photos instantly. The photos far exceed those that current cameras on cell phones can take. I seriously do not recommend purchasing a camera cell phone at this time as the quality of photos they take is very, very poor. The Sony DSC-U30 is a much better investment. You will love it and take it everywhere.","I bought this camera for several reasons...1) I am a gadget junkie, 2) I love digital format cameras, 3) I truly love the portability and compact size so I'll \"never miss a shot\".  This camera rounds out an extensive collection ranging to the top of the line Sony MEGA-pix camera I use for serious shooting...  Granted, this midget will do far less than the big guns, but I am very impressed with some of the shots, especially outdoor shots!!!  It offers true Sony picture quality and color.  I bought the camera especially for a multi-state bike ride where economy of equipment and supplies was a must and I was not disappointed.  In fact, on a recent company outing where we had commissioned a professional photographer, we resorted to taking ALL company group shots with my camera when the \"pro\" didn't show up and noone else in the group had a larger camera.  This little puppy did just fine and the result was several high quality outdoor group photos which everyone raved about from such a small camera.  And the BEST part of this was, I found a NEW unit on one of the main online auction sites and got it out the cyber door for $125 including shipping (no tax).  I equipped my camera with a 128 meg MS and carry a 64 meg as backup (both also purchased off online auction for a fraction of the best store prices!!!)  Had I known how satisfied I would be with this camera, I would have gladly paid retail price...but do shop around, whether through Amazon or other online sources, or check out the Sony website for promos!!! THis is a fun camera to own and use!!","I own several other digital cameras with 5-7 megapixels, but I have to say this is one sweet little camera that gives excellent pictures (color and clarity). It is so small that I keep it in a cell phone pouch clipped to my belt and found that I use it more than all the other cameras combined. It does not have a zoom or audio with the MPEG video, but the sacrifice of these two features for the size, is well worth it. It is a GREAT second camera to carry on vacation so you never miss those once in a lifetime shots.","If you're looking for a compact sized digital camera this is for you! Sony CybershotU30 has good resolution according to its size and pictures taken are very neat at 2MP. The LCD, although small, is completely visible for the average person and you won't have problem taking good pictures. Start-up time is almost none, and time between pictures is very little! It has few drawbacks like its handling : it is so little that people with big hands should be careful of not letting it slip away while taking a picture or viewing them. Another one is the playback mode, the index selection feature is definitely useless because pictures appear too small (4 pictures in a 1\" LCD display makes it impossible).<br />My rating for this camera is perfect because you get more than you can from this size and the price is near fair, it could be cheaper.","I bought this camera and used it for 10 days.  I was very happy with it's compactness and its picture quality.  However I found myself replacing the AAA batteries often, so I returned it.<br />One feature I would like to see on this camera is a pan function while viewing a zoomed in picture.  You can zoom in on a picture but you cannot scroll up, down, left or right.  This means you only zoom in on the dead center of the photo.  This is quite annoying when you are trying to verify you took a good picture.<br />Also I could not figure out how to disable the flash.  I'm am unsure if it is even possible.","I would have to say the best part about this camera is how it looks.  The whole camera just gives off a very... sleek look.<br />Image quality isn't the best out there, but it's a $200, 2.0 MP digital camera that's smaller than most cell phones out there.  Keeping all that in mind, I'd say that the quality is excellent for what it's designed for(point-and-shoot).<br />Haven't been able to really test the battery life, but been playing with it for a while and it's still going strong.<br />One thing that irks me though.  The camera slide is a bit wobbly.  Like a previous reviewer said, one is able to rock the slide back and forth, and it makes it feel a bit flimsy.  Also there are times when I try to close the slide gently, and it does not close all the way.  Small design issues, but nothing too big.<br />Overall, nice point-and-shoot camera in a very sleek pacakge.","As you know this camera is tiny, with well-thought-out ergonomics, and just enough features to ensure decent picture quality.  I bought it so my parents can have a simple digital camera to use that wouldn't require them to fiddle with the pictures on a computer afterwards.  With resulting picture sizes ranging from 200K to 500K, they can just attach pictures on a e-mail and send them to me without resizing them.  I bought a 128MB memory stick along with the camera so they can shoot over 250 pictures without ever having to change memory cards.  Simple, easy to use, decent picture quality, it was a perfect choice.<br />Of course I just couldn't resist playing with this camera before handing it over to my parents.<br />Ergonomics: A-<br />With such a small camera, the buttons are necessarily small. But they are well placed and intuitive to use. I was able to figure out about 90% of the camera's capabilities on my own, referring to the manual only for the shooting modes.  The camera becomes ready for taking pictures quickly, and the lag between taking pictures is very short due to small file sizes.  I've accidentally left the sliding lense cover not fully closed on a few occasions, but this is probably just me. About the only major wish I have is for a larger LCD.<br />Quality: B+<br />Lable on the bottom says this thing is made in Japan and it certainly looks and feels like it. Why the B+ rating?  Well, the sliding lense cover on my camera feels a loose and floppy.  I can rock it back and forth like a see-saw by about 1mm, which is quite a bit of play.  I can't help but wonder if my camera is defective, but I can't confirm until I get my hands on another DSCU30.  Other than that, everything else is A+ quality.<br />Picture Quality: C, B+ with consideration<br />My digital camera is an Olympus C-50Z, a 5.0 megapixle powerhouse packed into a compact body. I am obviously not expecting the DSCU30 to provide similar levels of detail, but I did expect it to provide a decent picture quality otherwise. With pictures taken by both cameras in full automatic mode and resized down to 800x600, the DSCU30's picture was noticeably more washed out with less vibrant colors.  Also, strong light sources, such as flash glare on eye glasses, produced large X-star patterns.  The pictures were also noticeably grainy in all situations.  In all this is very average performance from a 2 megapixle camera.  However, given the intended use for this camera, the picture quality is adequate.  So for my parents, this camera would probably be more like a B+.<br />All in all not a bad camera.  I would strongly recommend it for anyone who wants a camera that is easy to use at a moments notice.  I am sure my parents will love it.","INTRO:<br />I just got this camera a week ago, and it's great.  I wanted a small camera that fit in my pocket, and offered good combination of resolution and size:  this is probably the best example of that compromise that exists in the market today.  When I got the camera, I was amazed at how small it actually was.  It fits right in the palm of my hand and is a little bit bigger than a pack of Extra gum (the 15 stick pack).  It's perfect for the shirt or pants pocket.<br />THE GOOD:<br />I figure most people that buy this camera are looking at the size first, then the picture quality second.  Overall, the picture quality is right in line with what you'd expect from a 2.0 mp camera these days.  It's not top notch, but for it's optics size, it's what I expected.  Indoor shots come out pretty good, outdoor is excellent, and pictures at dusk seem even better.  The pictures can be a little washed out on occasion, especially when using the flash, but it's great for what I wanted - a camera I could take with me and use when out with my friends.<br />It's got a great constructed feel to it.  The shell is practically all metal and feels very solid in the hand.  It's not heavy at all, but not so light that it feels unworkable in the hand.<br />The controls are simple to use - there's shoot, review and movie mode.  Plus, there's a \"joy stick\" style dial (with buttons) underneath the viewfinder where you can scroll through images, zoom, and set shooting modes.  The a short learning curve considering there's so few buttons to control all the functions of the camera:  It's very intuitively made.<br />The viewfinder even offers some power saving options, where you can turn just about everything off.  You can turn off all sounds, and even turn off the backlight on the lcd display.  It gets really hard to see anything, but I'm glad that Sony actually thought enough about it to include it as a feature.<br />The camera includes a standard USB connection so that you don't have to buy a reader for the card.<br />It uses two NIMH AAA batteries, which includes the charger.  Even at full price, I think it's great they kept it affordable enough to include a charger and you can use it to charge both AA and AAA batteries.  Plus, the charger only needs an adaptor (instead of a converter) when in foreign countries.<br />Power management is really great considering the size.  It takes some time for initial battery charge (6 hours recommended), but they seem to last a good amount of time.  I've been using it pretty much all week, taking a total of 40 pictures (also, scanning through them, deleting, etc) and the battery indicator never went to low (half bar indicator).<br />COULD IMPROVE ON:<br />There's only two things that kind of get me down about this camera.  First, is the sliding door.  Don't get me wrong, it's well constructed, but it's just way to easy to accidentally open the sliding door when it's in your pocket.  It takes very little effort to move it open.<br />Also, the USB connector on the back is not that great.  It kind of has a cheap feel to it and once you get it connected, disconnecting it takes some delicate shimmying.  Plus, the drivers do not work in WinXP (actually, I take it back - it worked once and hasn't since).<br />The mirror is a cool feature and it does work, but I think you'll get bored with it after the first day.  Unless, of course, you plan on using it for self portais a lot.<br />This is being nitpicky I think, but the battery charger takes a great deal of time to charge the battery (as I stated - 6 hours).  Plus, when it's fully charged I expected the amber colored light to turn to green - instead it just shuts off.  Which makes me think I lost power in the outlet or worse.<br />Lastly, I admit that this is probably my fault, but I tend to want to hold the camera with both hands to steady the shot.  However, the lens is so close to the left hand that you may occasionally cover up the lens.  I thought a centered location for the lens would be best.<br />Anyway, this camera is great, and I highly recommend it.  It's relatively inexpensive, you get great Sony quality, and the pictures are great for the size.  Enjoy!","I have received it today as an addition to my posession of TRV-900. In terms of its size and design, I am very happy with it. Picture quality is much better than I expected, and the controls are very intuitive and simple. My only concern is the battery life; the enclosed manual clearly suggests not to use any AAA alcaline batteries, but I used new AAA ones to test 'cause I didn't have enough time to charge NI-MH batteries which were shipped together. The result was that I could take only 20 pictures before it showed low battery warning. I hope rechargibles stay much longer as the manual argues(75mins or 150 images). If it proves true, DSC-U30 is another masterpiece from sony after TRV-900."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot A70","amazon_reviews":["all is well","I had to buy three off ebay to find one that worked like thay say it do.","IN TIME","Warked for many years, now in the garbage.","I've had this camera for a least 3-4 years, and love it.

It works great and I take it wherever we go","I am still figuring out how to use some of it's functions and I had to get somebody to help me with the screen because the ring around the lense was not screwed on correctly but once we fixed that it has worked fine.","I bought this camera for my godson who is ten years old. It was excatly the proper camera for a youngster to learn about photography without scaring him. He found his enthusiasm and began using it as soon as batteries and disk were inserted. Good camera for the novice with options for some serious camera emerging capability.","I received a Used Canon powershot that did not work sent it back. By MY MISTAKE it was returned because I put the wrong address on the package.  I returned again with correct address and I was credit immeadately.  THANKS  Kathy","I purchased this camera back in 2004 and up until recently it worked flawlessly. That was until the CCD Started acting up and gave me a pink and white screen when I was shooting. I later found out this model and a few others have a well known manufacturing flaw which canon admits to and promises to pay for shippping and repairs. I sent mine back hoping they hold true to their word. The camera was great for the time and would recommend it for a cheap point and shoot.","This camera takes good pictures and it's easy to operate. It is well worth it's price. However, there are some problems.<br /><br />1. The CCD has known issues. It is highly susceptible to moisture and will develop problems. The images will have horizontal lines in them and the color balance will be wrong. Canon fixes this problem at no charge and even pays for shipping. However, in two years of owning this camera, I've had to return it twice for this repair.<br /><br />2. The LCD display is rather small and hard to see. It is even more difficult to see in bright light.<br /><br />Other than those two things, the camera works great. It's easy to operate and use the camera's functions, and the results are very good. Color balance is good for all white balance settings, especially incandescent when shooing in incandescent light. Pictures are sharp and free from image artifacts.<br /><br />One minor annoyance is that the zoom is electronic. It is difficult to get the exact zoom you want, especially for normal (the human eye's perspective). Another annoyance is the camera's widest aperature. It is not wide enough to make things n the background go out of focus. However, with a little skill with Photoshop, you can mask the subject and perform blurring.<br /><br />Connecting and downloading images to your computer is easy and painless. The supplied software is adequate but not stellar.<br /><br />A nice featuer is that the camera uses AA sized batteries. Get yourself rechargable 2500ma batteries and an inexpensive charger and you'll get a lot of photos out of one set of batteries.<br /><br />One very recommended accessory is the lens adapter, the LAH-DC20. Even f you don't attach an auxilary lens, this provides some protection for the lens in case you drop the camera while it's powered up, and it provides a means to attach 52 mm close up diopters, filters, and any lens hood.<br /><br />For it's price, the camera is exceptional.","I've had this camera for 6 years and it still works perfectly! However, I gave it to a cousin of mine who is in grade school, because I wanted something with more pixels.","I bought this camera in 2003 and it worked GREAT. I have changed the batteries a total of 3 times since I've had it and have taken hundreds of pix. I have just purchased the Canon Powershot A570IS, because my A70  has just 'broken' down as of October 31, 2007 (no Halloween pix). I won't bother to repair it, since its not worth it, however it did a great job for the past 4 years, and I hope the new one does a better job, if that's possible. I would recommend Cannon to my friends. Its a great product and does what its made to do.","Takes excellent photos.  Heavy by today's standards but still takes excellent photos.","I bought it in June 2004 and took (only) near 3800 shots. The recent photos have distorted colors. Some experts told me that the CCD is dying.<br /><br />It was a great camera with great pictures. I only wish it could last longer. I hate to buy a DC every 2 or 3 years though it is the trend for consumer electronics.","My camera is about 3 years old.  It is my first digital camera.  About 1 year ago the LCD screen began to fade and soon I could no longer see what I was taking a photo of AND when the screen was dark, the photo did not turn out.  I would need to turn the camera off/on for it to clear.  I called Canon support and like the other person who wrote a review, I was told the the LCD screen was defective and that they would pay for me to send it back to be fixed and return to me at their cost as well.  They were very nice about it.  About 4 weeks later I had my camera.  While I am happy with the photos that it takes, I still have issues with the LCD screen.  Every once in awhile the screen will go dark and I need to hit the \"display\" button once or twice before it clears up again.  Very annoying.  I will need to call Canon service again but I don't know what else can be done.  I just had it \"fixed this past summer.<br /><br />W.Kohorst, Silver Spring, MD","I bought this camera back in July of 2004 and i have been a happy user of this product for over two years.  One of the things that i loved about canon powershot A70 is the battery life.  I use 4 Monster NiMH rechargeable batteries on this camera and they work awesome, over 100+ pics. The picture quality is nice, and the camera is easy to use.<br /><br />However now that 2007 is around the corner, I'm starting to think of upgrading, one thing that I don't like about this camera is that it is pretty bulky when carrying it in your pocket.  This camera is bigger than the newer cameras of its class, and at 3.2MP its starting to show its age.<br /><br />Overall, nice camera.","I think this is a great camera for the reasons stated by many reviewers.<br /><br />However, after several years of continuous use, the LCD viewer stopped displaying images and, when I took photos, the images did not appear on the memory card.<br /><br />Because I couldn't find anything in the camera manual or on Canon's web site that addressed this problem, I called Canon technical support.  The Canon technical support representative I spoke to told me the problem was a defective image sensor, which he said Canon would replace for free (even though the  camera was way outside the warranty period).  He even said Canon would pay for shipping the camera to their factory service center.<br /><br />I haven't completed this process, but assuming Canon follows through (and I have no reason to think they won't), I thought this was extraordinary customer service -- yet another reason for purchasing this camera.","I had purchased the camera on Amazon to give to my daughter as her first digital camera. It was used, and had only a 64MB CF card as its only acessory, no cables or software. On the second day, all I could get on the display while pointing at a light was a slightly purple screen. I went online to Canon, checked under the model number, and found a few things out. Some of the ccd's were made by a third party company, and they were sensitive to heat and humidity. On the A70 page, it said to contact them, and they will check it out and replace the ccd for free if it had not been damaged by dropping it. They sent me, by email, a shipping label for free shipping. After one week, they emailed me and told me it would be a free repair and would take 7-10 working days. I just yesterday received the camera, and WOW, what a surprise!! Canon had replaced my older A70 with a BRAND NEW IN THE BOX WITH ALL ACESSORIES POWERSHOT A520!!!!!<br /><br />That is customer service you can't beat. Just another of the resaons I will only buy Canon cameras and printers.","I have been using my A70 almost nonstop since i bought it, and have had no problems, I take it snowboarding, hiking, climbing, etc and I am not gentle with it. The aluminum case is very strong. I have dropped it from ~5' onto concrete and the only thing that broke was the CF card cover, which is no big deal since the camera still works.<br /><br />Recently the CCD failed on one of the cameras (not the one I abuse), I saw the post about the recall (thanks!) so I called their tech support, I hope to hear back from them soon.<br /><br />... They were very nice on the phone and it sounds to them like a CCD issue, they will send me a UPS label via email for RMA. w00t!","I bought this camera 2 years ago and it is just awesome. It was my first digital camera, and I couldn't have asked for a better equipment. Easy to use, high picture quality, many options. My friends always complain about why my pictures are always a lot better than theirs, and it's all the camera's fault! I never had any problem with it!","I bought this camera in the summer of 2004 and have really enjoyed it.  It was my first digital camera.  I have used it on a number of trips and it has made some fantastic photos.  It is small, convenient, and easy to use...just point and shoot.<br /><br />I did buy myself a 256k memory card, which is plenty for my purposes.  Downloading pics to your computer is a snap and is very easy to use.<br /><br />On the downside, it is only a 3.2 megapixel camera.  This was great for downloading photos to my computer, using them in slide shows as screensavers, etc. until.........I made the photo of all photos.  Yup, I got lucky and made the best photo I had ever made in my life.  Unfortunately, due to the 3.2 limitation, I am unable to have this shot blown up to a large size.  For this reason alone, it won't happen with my next digital purchase.<br /><br />Also, this camera will do tons more than I am able to make it do.  I consider a downside to be that it is a little complex to use unless you are doing the simple point and shoot kind of thing.  Anything more advanced is......well, advanced.  I always have to stop and look at the manual which is just not convenient when taking a shot on vacation.  So, I'm left with just \"pointing and shooting\".  Seriously, this is not one of those cameras you can just pick up and \"figure out\" as you go.  It is a little more complicated than that when you want to try some of its bells and whistles.<br /><br />All in all though, it is a good camera for the average homeowner who is not a camera enthusiast.","I had purchased this camera for my job.  I like the camers so much that when I changed jobs, I purchased one for my personal use.","Best digital camera I've had, good quality for the price.  Biggest problem is it's a little too slow.  I click the button, but by the time it takes the photo the action is over!  Also, for some reason the video only goes to 30 seconds now, but it used to do 3 minutes worth.  Great camera, though.","I've found this easy to use and produces great pictures.<br /><br />To  augment it I've bought a 1 gig memory card for $50 dollars and rechargable batteries.<br /><br />This allows one to take lots of pictures and even movies without worrying about battery power overmuch.","I have have this Camera for about 3+ years and it was been worked very well for what I wanted it for. Mostly pictures for my website and to print some for shareing with friends.<br /><br />I just recently started having problems with my camera not working all the time because of the screen, but now my lens is stock about half way out and will not right it's self. I did some searching and found that cannon has a service notice on this camera that will repair it even if it is out of warranty. I will be sending my camera in to see if I can get it fixed. To bad to because I just got a new camera for my birthday.","I agree with everyone else - this camera is awesome. the only thing i have to add is that if you are clumsy like me, and drop it with the lens open, it will break. (i'm sure this is the case with any digital camera....) the lens will turn slightly enough so it doesnt open/close properly...it kinda slowly malfunctions... it wont focus etc. if you have a canon warranty they will fix it. this has happened to me, my father and another family member that had the camera. just dont be clumsy and youre all set!<br /><br />like i said... AWESOME camera. quality is amazing, and 3.2 megapixels is plenty.","This was the first digital camera I bought and did so after a good amount of research and playing with a variety of other ones through my friends.  I've owned it almost two years now and it has served me pretty well.  The batteries don't drain too quickly, even when shooting video and the picture quality is good enough for almost anything you need to do.  Most of my pictures end up on-line and this camera serves that purpose well.  The features are standard, nothing too out of the ordinary now.  It's a little larger than I would have liked, but it's not a pain to fit in most places.  Overall, for the price I think it's a good deal and worth it if you are just looking for a recreational camera.","I'll make this short, but this is a good first camera.  I've probably taken over 1,000 pictures with this camera and we have some good memories already, in only just over a year.  Good camera for the price.<br /><br />However, I will hopefully be upgrading soon.  I want something with a more generous zoom and a camera that takes the pictures faster.  There is a pretty big delay in the way the camera takes the pictures.  It's good for portrait stills, but it's hard to capture action shots.<br /><br />Overall, good camera.","i've had a powershot a70 for two years, and in that time have taken thousands of pictures and hours worth of video clips.  this thing hasn't left my side since i bought it- it's become almost an extra appendage.<br /><br />unfortunately, i've lost two of these cameras to the dreaded \"purple haze\" now.  my first camera broke six months after i bought it, but i don't think this was any fault of canon's.  i was so hard on that thing.  i carried it around in a bag without a case everywhere i went, dropped it multiple times, and pretty much did everything with it that you shouldn't do with a camera.  and contrary to what others have been saying about canon customer service, i thought they were great.  i sent in my camera, and despite the fact that it was dented and scratched and clearly mistreated, they sent me a refurbished one, no questions asked.<br /><br />i've been a lot more careful with my second camera, but it's still been through a lot of wear and tear over the past year and a half.  up until it broke, it did everything i asked of it, and then some.  i realized about a month ago that it was about to go, and decided that it was fine with me, because i've more than got my money's worth in the time that i've had it.  my only regret is not buying the extended warrenty when i bought my camera originally, because i would love to get another identical refurbished camera from canon.<br /><br />this is a great camera for casual photographers.  it doesn't take professional quality images, so don't expect to be blown away, but the pictures still look great.  the video mode is pretty decent, and it's one of the features that i've come to love most about my camera.  and as for battery life, i have yet to find a camera with batteries that last as long.  the four double a's make the camera kind of heavy, but they last for weeks at a time. my only complaint is that the camera has troubles in low light, but that's to be expected with any digital camera in this price range.  the flash tends to be too bright and washes pictures out, but without the flash, the image will blur unless you keep the camera perfectly still.  this problem can be solved by buying a tripod, however.<br /><br />overall, this is a great camera.  my dad, sister, and boyfriend all bought similar powershots because they liked mine so much.  despite the fact that my camera is broken, i would say it had a good run, and would suggest it to any casual photographer in the market for a new digital camera","I got this camera in 2003.  It was my first digital camera, so I dont have much to compare it to, but it seemd somewhat troubled from the beginning--for instance, within a few months after I bought it the tiny memory card that it came with got corrupted and destroyed all the pictures that were on it.  I also found the flash to be too bright--if you used it, the pictures were too bright and washed out.  However, the real problem was that a few months ago (spring 2005) the camera died.  For a few weeks it would still take pictures but they were completely distorted, and then it stopped altogether.  Of course, the warranty was expired by the time this happened.  I have had previous, non-digital cameras for years and years, so it seems ridiculous that such an expensive camera would die so fast.  I will not buy another digital camera from Canon.","I have owned this camera for more than 2 years. It is one of 4 digital cameras I have owned. It has been trouble free, and I have used it a lot. It is one of the best all around cameras you can buy. You can even make very good (VGA) movies with this camera. It is easy on the rechargeable batteries. Professional grade.","I bought this camera in May 2004 and have been extremely happy.  It takes excellent videos and pictures ofcourse!  I bought a 256 MB card and it works great.  It is very frugal on the use of battery so my regular batteries last for a very long time. A great buy I would say.","My experience with this camera:<br /><br />I have owned this camera for two years and have taken thousands of photos with it.<br /><br />This camera has never broken on me. No software has ever screwed up. My belief is that cameras are NOT toys and should be treated with care - then they will not malfunction.<br /><br />The available shooting options on this camera are far beyond what any other similarly priced digital camera offers. The large variety of auto/manual shooting modes and other background manual settings are really what sold this camera to me. I wanted a digital camera I could toy with and learn the ins and outs of photography with...before spending money on developing costs associated with traditional cameras. This camera is perfect for me. However, if you want a camera only to take pictures of 'haha he's rolling around drunk on the floor, quick take a picture' or 'cute little fluffykins' - this may not be the best camera for you.<br /><br />As with all things electronic, it is well worth your time reading the manual. This is how you learn to save batteries/etc. I remember finding out the way to turn off the LCD display so that I could batteries, simply by reading the manual. Many complaints about power use or complicated features can be sorted out by reading the manual. I cannot stress this enough (I would be saying this about any other electronic prodcut as well, so don't take this as a point against this camera).","I've had my PowerShot A70 for about a year and a half and I love love love it! I bought it because I wanted a point and click camera that I could take anywhere. The photographs it produces are so much better than I expected from a camera in this price range. Pictures taken on the automatic settings come out well most of the time, and other options that can be set manually let you take perfect photos in trickier situations. Battery life is also good, and the downloading software that comes with it is easy to use. Highly recommended.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the red eye flash takes really bizarre photos - it looks like the flash goes off twice, so if you're taking a picture with any action in it, you get a sort of double image. But redeye is easily corrected in an image editing program, so I just don't use that feature.","We went everywhere together. I had it for nearly a year and a half when the mechanism that reads the image suddenly went dead. The camera displays photos fine, so it's not the LCD. I didn't drop it or expose it to any extreme  elements. I'm disappointed that it lasted less than 1.5 years - but I do have to say that it was a very good 1.5 years.<br /><br />If the camera didn't break so early on, I'd have given it the full five stars.","Dec. 10, 2004: My first digital camera and I found it very easy to use. Great high-quality pictures. Easy downloads to my computer. I would suggest using rechargeable batteries to save money in the long run - keep a spare set handy so you won't miss that great shot! I received great customer service with the Canon 800#: I damaged one of the prongs while reinserting the flash card the first week I had the camera. I called the 800# and they were very pleasant and patient, walking me through steps to hopefully resolve the problem while I was on the phone, but I ended up having to send the camera in to be repaired. The camera was returned to me within about 10 days good as new and I wasn't charged for the repair. ******Comment added 9-19-2005: Still loving this camera!","First of all, I want to say that I am not a technical minded person at all.  I love my 35mm camera and was really hesitant about going digital.  The ONLY reason I even considered buying a digital camera is that I was traveling to Scotland on my honeymoon and wanted to be able to see the pictures as I was taking them because these were shots that I would never have the opportunity to retake, should they come out badly.  So, I did a lot of research and tried to get the most user friendly camera I could find.<br /><br />This camera has really been great.  There are of course a lot of features that I have never used, and a few that I have finally learned. The owners manual was a little intimidating - it was so thick!  But with a little practice, I've become a pretty good photographer.  The Zoom works really well.  Batteries last pretty well - we have a recharger for when they run out.  The editing software that comes with the camera is very easy to use.  The panorma feature (or photo stitch I think it's called) gave us some great scenery shots and the \"auto pilot\" feature allowed us to both be in the picture at the same time.  The picture quality is generally good.  At first it was no match to my trusty 35mm, but then I switched the setting to capture the highest quality pictures, and have had no complaints since then.<br /><br />In the beginning it was hard to get used to the delay in shutter speed - I was used to \"snap and click\", but with the powershot I had to hold down the button for maybe a second or so before the picture would take.  I was missing a lot of action shots. But now, I've learned to set the speed to action and that is no longer a problem.<br /><br />I would definitely recomend this camera to any novices like me.  As a matter of fact, now that I have the hang of digital cameras, I am moving up to a camcorder - Canon ZR85 here I come!","I've had my A70 for a year now and have not had a problem with it.  It takes nice pictures and short movies. There are fancier new cameras out there now (like the A75 or A95), but if you're looking for a bargain the A70 is a good choice.  I've always had good experiences with Canon products because they're affordable and user-friendly.  Some drawbacks: shutter speed is slow, camera is heavy/bulky, LCD is small.  I do not mind the drawbacks, however, and I would recommend this camera for a bargain shopper.","This is my first digital camera, I have had it for 18 months, it works great, very easy to use, my 6 year old can even use it.  The pictures are great quality, I also use a Canon Rebel SLR camera for when I want top quality photos.  It is very durable, my 9 year old dropped it while riding an atv and it was undamaged.  Would highly recommend. We did upgrade the memory card to 256, would do that again.  If I were to buy another digital camera, I would buy Canon again.","My husband and I finally broke down and bought a digital camera when our 35mm Minolta broke on vacation in August of last year.  This is the camera we chose for two main reasons 1. It uses AA batteries and 2. The compact flash card fits into our laptop and HP printer at home.  We did not want a camera that was too \"gadgety\" that would be hard to use.  This camera is simple to use and takes good pictures.  I did not experience ANY of the problems posted on some of the reviews.  Personally I never use the LCD screen to take the photos.  It was a novelty at first, but uses a LOT of battery power.  I would suggest buying rechargeable batteries and a \"quick charger\" we bought one that will fully charge four \"AA\" batteries in one hour.  The quality of photos are very good.  We print a lot of photos of our daughter in the 8 x 10 size and they turn out beautifully with vivid color and detail.  I have suggested this camera to several people.  Several have perchased the S410, which is smaller and are extremely happy with it as well.  Others in our family have the 5.0 mega pixel version of the Canon and love it.  When we are ready to upgrade I would definitely buy another Canon product.","This is my 3rd Digital Camera from Canon that I have bought and I had it for almost a year, and it has work perfect.  Even it took a big fall from my backpack, it was inside the case (lowepro) and it still working just as new.<br /><br />This is a Camera to recomend.","This is a good camera no doubt but I won't rate it as the 'best' I have ever seen. Because 1st of all it's not so small. It can't fit in your purse. 2ndly, it takes four batteries every time. Batteries last long no doubt but since I had only four rechargable batteries, I couldn't let one set for charging and use the other one. When I was out for long time, I had to leave four of the batteries for charging for eight hours and go out without any camera. So, anything else which uses two batteries at a time is far more better. 3rd point is, sometimes the photos in night mode are hazy, for that you probably need a tripod, because if you shake your hand for a fraction of second, the photo will be a mess. Overall, canon A70 is a good deal.","I've had this camera for about a month now. I've been pretty impressed with the picture quality and features.<br /><br />One thing I notices recently is that it's making a grinding sort of noise aftering powering on/off. the noise occurs after the lens is fully extended. the same noise happens when focusing for a shot. i can't remember if it was doing this all along or not, but it's made me paranoid. wondering if anyone could shed some light on this...<br /><br />thanks --","I bought this camera for myself after hearing great reviews from friends and seeing it receive excellent marks in Consumer Reports. I have LOVED it. It has all the features I've ever needed, plus many manual functions that I haven't had time to play with yet. If you are averse to settings, you just need to keep it on \"Auto\" all the time. You'll get beautiful pictures. I don't even keep it on the highest resolution setting and I've never needed more resolution. Tip: I think using flash can make subjects too stark. When I turn it off, most pictures come out better. I have had the camera for 8 months.","This camera is very user friendly, takes amazing pictures and video footage.  I am not a technical type at all and after reading a few pages of the manual I can operate mose features of this camera.  I have had it for 6 months and it travels well too. I highly recommend it.","This is my first digital camera and I absolutely love it.  I am a computer guy myself, so the basic come a little easier to me than others but even my wife (not so much the computer person) is able to use it without reserve and she prefers it better than our still camera.<br />The shooting modes are easily accessible on the top dial.  You can switch from AUTO, to camcorder, to action shots within seconds.  I can get 137 pix out of one 128mb card.  The battery life is great.  I DEFINITELY recommend rechargables!<br />There are a couple little *quirks* about it like the fact that there are two menus which can be a pain if you know you saw a feature somewhere but don't remember exactly which menu had it.  Plus I can't figure out a way to get a date on the print.  It may be there but then I'd have to read the manual :-)<br />Otherwise, you simply can't beat this camera for the price.  Get it now before Canon phases it out.  There are two newer models out there now so the clock is ticking!","i got this camera after being disappointed with the quality of my 3MP fuji finepix s5000. i did my homework and researched 3MP digital cameras for a few weeks. i noticed the A70 had the same advanced controls as the finepix s5000. it got good reviews from both professionals and casual users. so, i bought it and i have been VERY happy with this camera ever since.<br />my advice? READ THE MANUAL if you ever plan on doing more than pointing and shooting. even if you don't, read it anyway! this camera has a great feature set and you'd be wasting your hard earned money if you don't check it out. also, as always, spring for a bigger compact flash card (at least 128MB), rechargable batteries and a case. protect your investment!<br />PROS:<br />* takes excellent 3MP photos (color is cool and images are sharp). isn't this what digital photography is all about?<br />* advanced features are great! it's a great point and shoot camera, but also has tons of advanced features for those wanting more control; white balance, shutter speed, aperature, ISO, and many, many more!<br />* movie feature is kinda cool. with sound, too!<br />* fairly small and feels comfortable in your hand. controls are where they should be.<br />* menu is easy to understand.<br />* battery life seems to be pretty good (i use rechargables).<br />CONS:<br />* LCD on back of camera scratches very easily. don't remove the protective cover, or buy one on ebay. people actually sell these things. :)<br />* LCD gets a pink hue to it when i am in daylight, taking photos. the LCD is hard to see in daylight. try using the viewfinder. though the optical viewfinder isn't exactly what you'll see when you transfer to your 'puter, but it's close enough.<br />* time between photos could be better.<br />overall, a SUPER camera! i just hope i don't get the dreaded \"E18\" error!<br />7.12.04<br />well, it's off to the factory already for repairs. it's been a little over a month since i bought the A70 and it's already got problems. pink streaking on the LCD and although it doesn't show up in the pictures, it does show up on the video. i am so scared of sending this thing to the canon factory to be worked on 'cause i have heard so many stories about their horrible customer service. oh well, here goes...","I've long believed that the only way to become good at photography is to keep experimenting and the move to digital allowed me to indulge in my hobby without worrying about consuming film on failed photographs. I have found the A70, with its impressive list of manual controls, perfect for the job. Its pictures are sharp and clear and uploading them to the computer is a piece of cake.<br />Its wide range of shutter speeds and apertures allows for a lot of experimentation, especially with low light and night shots. I've come up with some night shots and macros that I've been quite proud of. I also have a three year old and as anyone with kids knows, they never have the time to pose for a photograph. So for such moments when there isn't enough time to fiddle around with the settings, the preset modes like portrait, shutter priority, etc. work real well. The batteries last quite long(I've taken about 200 shots, most of them with the LCD on, with one set) and with 2 sets of rechargeables, I make sure I'm never without a fresh set.<br />The reduction of 1 star is due to the E18 error I've gotten several times. And apparently it is quite prevalent if the forums are to be believed. Though its never affected my photographs(since it occurs only when shutting down or turning the camera on in play mode), it is quite annoying and scary.<br />Overall, I love my A70 and never leave the house without it!","I love this camera. I did a lot of searching for a camera under $300 that had all the features I thought I needed like manual settings and focus. Turns out, the auto settings work just fine and I don't really want to stop what I'm doing and fool around with settings anyway.<br /><br /> Pros: (1) It just feels nice in my hand. Sure, it's a little bulkier than other cameras, but it's not so large that you can't carry it in your pocket. (2) The battery life is amazing compared to my last camera. I filled a 256k card on one set of AAs. (3) The video setting is better than I could have imagined. I thought the quality would be grainy and the sound bad, but happily, I was wrong. (4) It has a power button rather than a knob that is easily bumped or is flimsy and can break.<br /><br /> Cons: (1) I have a lens cover problem. It sticks a lot and has since day 1. I can't bear to part with it though so I never sent it in for service. (2) The software that comes with it is confusing. I now use another program to capture and download and it also has a way better editing feature than what the camera came with. (3) Picture quality is pretty good, but you really need an editing program to sharpen things up.<br /><br /> All in all, I'm really glad that I bought this camera and would recommend it to anyone, especially the budget minded person who wants a great first digital camera.","We just had our first child and needed to upgrade from our basic 1.1MP camera to something with a bit more power.  This camera is excellent.  It is a nice size and feel unlike other cameras which are so small, you forget you're holding a camera.<br />This model is feature packed.  I usually keep it on auto mode for shooting, but found the sports setting and P settings good for shooting in low light without the flash.  As much as this kid is photographed, we would blind our baby with constant camera flashes.<br />The photo stich assist feature is great for capturing panorama views.  I've used it to save a 360 view of the baby room to share with relatives.<br />As for battery life, my number one criteria is that we don't have to take a second mortgage to afford to power the camera.  So far, the batteries are hanging in there after many shots and on-camera reviews of pictures.  We have yet to invest in rechargable batteries, but I imagine the performance is the same.<br />If there's one piece of advice I have for new parents, it is this:  Leave your camera out ready to go so you can capture those special moments.  With a 128MB CF card, we can get over 100 pictures at the highest resolution.  We can shoot many pictures before off loading to the laptop.  Then, the blurry, low light, or otherwise uninteresting shots can be dumped.<br />Bottom line:  This camera is a great value.","Easy to use and trouble free since day one.  I absolutely love this camera!","OK So the camcorder comment may be a bit overdone...but this really is a great camera.  The price, for what you get, is very fair and unless you're taking pictures for publication in National Geographic magazine, it's going to do a great job for you.<br />From still shots of a european vacation to shooting thirty second videos in the manufacturing facilities where I work, this camera does a great job and with a little tweaking it will make great videos in Windows Movie Maker where you can cut custom DVDs.  I use it to make training DVDs for machinery and equipment.<br />One thing in particular that needs to be pointed out is that you definitely need to upgrade to at least at 256 MB memory card (around $75), rechargable batteries (around $30 for batts and charger), and a padded case to protect your imvestment.","I am a reader and not a photographer.  I enjoy taking pictures with the next man but I would not call it my hobby as much as a necessity from my wife.  I bought this camera because frankly we needed a new camera that was digital and would allow this amature to delete pictures before running to Wal-Mart to process them.  This camera is great for me!<br />The camera itself is lightweight and quite easy to learn.  I had some difficulty at first figuring out how to take pictures, switch to the video, and then move to cutting and deleting pictures and short films.  However, Canon sends an easy to follow book that teaches you all you need to know to run the camera.<br />Finally, buy rechargable batteries!  This camera (as I am learning with all digital cameras) eats batteries for fun.  Spend the $50 to get a battery pack and get a nice camera case as well (Canon does not provide you with one).","This camera is worth every penny you will pay for it. I could not expect anything more out of a low-mid price range digital camera. Canon has thought of everything when it comes to making their products user-friendly. I have messed around with a lot of digital cameras recently and most of the non-Canons have not yet mastered camera ergonomics. Many manufacturers are trying to make their camera super small, which I admit, can be nice sometimes. But in doing so, they've thrown ergonomics out the window, so using the more advanced features is very frustrating. You have to have sharp fingernails to press some of the buttons on other cameras. But with the Canon A70, fingertips work fine. The camera is shaped so that your right hand fits perfectly around the body without obstructing the lens or mashing unwanted buttons. I don't need to list all the features here, as they are listed in several other reviews. But one neat feature(some people think it's a negative) is that it takes four AA batteries instead of a battery pack. The real trick is to buy two four-packs of either the Rayovac or Energizer rechargeable NiMh batteries and a charger. Instead of spending 80 bucks on an extra battery pack, you spend 15 bucks on a charger and 12 bucks per 4-pack of AAs. Plus, when your friends are scrambling for a wall-outlet to charge their camera battery packs, you just drop in the other set of AAs and shoot away. It has been an invaluable asset when I'm shooting in the field away from AC power. The software that is bundled with the camera is almost limitless. The \"Photo-stitch assist\" mode of the camera is really cool. It helps you line up subsequent pictures for a panoramic, so when you bring the pics into the computer software, it does an amazing job at making a panoramic image! I'd recommend a 256 MB CF memory card for this camera for more than enough storage. (...)Way to go Canon!","I've had the camera for over 2 weeks now and I must say I am more than satisfied with the quality of pictures. The optics and electronics produce really neat pictures. Has good features like full manual control of shutter speed, exposure etc..<br />The only problem I had with this camera is that it sucks on batteries. within a few days of clicking, i exhausted the battery pack and am now left looking for a good set of rechargeable batteries.<br />Also, it doesn't have a battery status indicator (only beeps alarm when battery is critically low).<br />Otherwise, it is worth every cent :)","The camera took great pictures for a full year.  2 days after the warranty expired the lens cover got stuck.  Support said they 'might' replace it since it was so close to the warranty period.  They wanted me to ship it back and they'd let me know.  Instead I called American Express (the card I purchased the camera on) who doubles all warranties up to one year.  About 2 weeks later I received a check for my full purchase price and am now shopping for a new camera.","I have owned this product for almost a year now. It is still in good condition and I love it a lot. The image quality is excellent. The good part about this camera is that it gives you a lot of control - for a non-professional camera, contrary to other camera which really on gives you ability to POINT and SHOOT. It gives you control over shuttle speed, focus length, ISO speed, various image sizes, flash intensity, just to name a few.<br />The con about this product is that it needs 4 AA batteries, which makes it quite bulky and heavy. Nonetheless, if you are looking for a camera which is easy to use and still does not want to lose too much of control, pick Canon A70.","Is the Canon Powershot A70 camera pictbridge compatiable,and does it come with a cable to conect to and print pictures directly from my Canon i560s printer?","After doing TONS of research over a span of about two months, i finally bought this camera.  I tried it out in stores (along with many others) and it was simply the best for the money.  Though it may not be one of those TINY pocket cameras, i never had a problem fitting it in the pocket of my cargo pants or jeans.  If you are unsure about this camera, this may help:<br />1. Great quality pictures.  Believe me, 3.2 MP is plenty for the average person.  Amazing quality up untill 8 by 10 inches<br />2. Though it is not advertised, the camera lasted through a day of pouring rain while i was hiking without a problem.  It was very wet, but even in a cloud on the top of a mountain i found no problem with the camera.  I would still suggest avoiding wet weather (just in case), but it stood up fine for me.<br />3. Panoramic mode is really great - stiches very easily together<br />4.  Movies have great quality with long length - sound works well, i have a lot of fun with them.<br />5. Software is simple to use, easy to upload pictures<br />6. TV output made it easy to show everyone the pictures<br />7. Long battery life (with rechargeables)<br />9. Nice zoom + nice quality = good editing.  I was able to zoom way in on pictures i took in NYC from a building to see the license plate numbers clearly - the quality is that good!<br />10. easy to switch between modes<br />11. personalizeable<br />12. Reasonable weight - not cumbersome evern for long hikes<br />The only problems I encountered with this camera are:<br />1. Long period of time between when you press the shutter button and when it takes the picture - if you are going to need to catch very fast shots of things (maybe whale watching) you could have a problem - i solved this however by using the movie mode and taking out the frame i wanted on the computer.<br />2. Took a while to get the correct settings for museum shooting.  too bright, too dark - i did get it to work well eventually.  it just needs some fiddling.<br />3. The software isnt amazing, you may want to buy a better program for editing.<br />I would suggest buying several accesories for the camera:<br />1. a larger memory card (I got a 512 MB card so i would never need another, and I am very happy with it.  It stored every picture I toook over the span of a week in the Virgin Islands no problemo.  at highest quality, you can take over 300 pictures without a worry!<br />2. Rechargable batteries (i got 2200) they last very long!<br />3. a good case<br />All in all, this is an amazing camera.  a solid choice for everyone except maybe a professional photographer.  after the research, this is definately the best value for the money.","I admit that I don't have anything to compare this to--but I am very happy with this camera.  Is simple to use, takes great pictures.  I'm sure there are people who have a lot of experience with digital cameras that could find something to be improved on this rather inexpensive, average number pixal model, but for a newbie like me it's great!!  I'm glad I bought this one rather than the other 20 or more I looked at.","This is the third Canon (we have one Sony) in the family.  I bought Canon because the other two provided good pictures, good software, easy and user friendly operation, all at a good price.  My A70 has been a joy to operate.  This is my first digital camera to call my own.  I have two Minolta 35mm camera, and although this digital won't replace them, it can be carried a lot easier than my two film cameras, and all their lenses.  I also like the instant color-to-B&W (and other special features) rather than switching out film.  The batteries last for a long while, but even longer since I bought (free with rebate) a card reader.  The local retail store prints copies of the digital pics that you want to put in the album or in a frame.  Good camera with no problems.  The 3MP at just over $200 has served me well.","I purchased this camera two months ago and do not have a single complaint. It is easy to use (though I did have to spend an afternoon with the manual to understand the more esoteric features) and takes wonderful pictures.<br />The batteries that came with the camera were eaten up in about two days. I decided I'd better get rechargable batteries at that rate of consumption so I picked up an Energizer kit with four batteries, and got 4 extras so I'd always have a charged set.<br />What I have found is that the second set of batteries probably was not necessary. We use this camera a couple of times a week for 15-30 minutes at a time - including making several movies - and after two months the original rechargable batteries are still going strong! That is much better performance than I ever would have dreamed.<br />The camera fits comfortably in an adult hand and is easy to operate. The only quibble I have with the construction is that the cover to remove the CF card is poorly designed - when you unlatch it, the bottom of the cover \"sticks\" so you have to be careful you don't snap it trying to open it. The plastic on this cover feels flimsy, like it could break easily if extreme care is not taken.<br />Still, anhyone with common sense will use care when handling a camera, and I haven't found this one issue annoying enough to regret my decision at all. A very good bargain.","I have taken about 500 pictures so far in the last couple of months with the A70, my first digital camera.  My review is strictly my opinion on using the A70, since I have never used any other brand, so I don't know if other may behave similarly or not.<br />First the good things: The A70 produces excellent color images, both on the monitor/tv or printed. It uses the least expensive memory card - compact flash.  It uses the least expensive AA size batteries. (I bought 8 rechargeable ones, still very inexpensive compared to those batteries used in some very small tiny digital camera).  Direct hookup to tv for viewing without the need of a dock.<br />Now the negatives:  It bothers me very much that what you see in the viewfinder is not what you get.  The little 1.5 inch screen seems to show what you will really get, but not the viewfinder.  Under bright sunlight, the little screen is totally useless, you cannot see a thing.  And since using the viewfinder does not correctly show you what you'll get, it's very frustrating to have to guess.  Also because of the little screen becomes totally useless under bright sunlight, it is extremely hard to make any setting changes since settings are only displayed on the little screen, not through the viewfinder.  For example, if you need to change from flash-on to flash-off under bright sunlight, good luck.  The second annoying thing is the zoom control.  It is almost impossible to zoom precisely.  You'll go too far one way and when you zoom back, you'll go too far the other way.  No precision control on the zooming mechanism.  It is fine with casual snapshot type of pictures, but not when you want a little bit of artistic creation.  Third annoying thing is the delay reaction on the shutter, which I have read on other brands also, so it is not a unique A70 issue, but that does not make it not annoying.  Among the three, the third is the least annoying.","This is an OK entry level digital camera.  It's small and well built, not a cheesy piece of junk.  When it manages to focus on the subject, it takes pretty decent photos.  There lies the rub.  The focusing system is worthless.  It picks random points within the field of view to focus on and I have not found a way to make it consistantly focus on the center of the frame.  The small lens picks up no light, so every indooor shot is a flash photo, which leads to red eye and flash bounce from everything.  The time between finger press to shutter release in agonizingly long.  Half the time, you'll move the camera thinking something is wrong just as it's releasing the shutter.<br />If you can deal with these problems, then it's not a bad system.  I would go the next level higher and get one that you can actually pick what gets focused on.<br />My 2 cents.","I have had this camera for about 3 weeks now and am very happy with it. The image quality is very good with good color and contrast and sharp images. They are not as good as my father's Canon Digital Rebel, but then his camera also cost 3 times as much. I have printed the photos on my Epson Stylus C84 (also available at Amazon, and highly recommended) and the results have been truly great. I got the printer because of the camera, and the 2 are a perfect team!<br />It is a nice size to hold, not too big and not too small. The features are many and it has many manual controls, including flash level, focus, and many other things you would not expect on a camera like this. The only real feature that I have found sometimes not that great is the AiAf (artificial intelligence auto focus), sometimes it is not artificially intelligent but instead genuinely stupid. It is possibly to manualy control the focus on the camera though.<br />Pros:<br />Good pictures<br />Lots of control when wanted<br />Lots of features<br />Solid build quality<br />Cons:<br />AiAf can sometimes be just plain stupid","I have had this A70 since Christmas 2003. All who see the finished pictures always ask how many pixels it is because of the extra fine quality. The battery life is absolutly unbelieveable for a Digital camera. I love the panoramic view photos which are very impresssive [and very easy to make].<br />The ability of conecting it to the TV and seeing the photos so big is a great big WOW!  The setting for the best quality picture is 38, but the quality it produces is worth it.","Very good overall  but design and battery is a big problem.Since Canon does not supply battery charger with the camera you have to pay 20 bucks more.And the camera is very battery consuming.But other features are good enough.It is worth buying it.","This camera works great and has tons of modes. In auto mode all you need to do is press the shutter and you have an instant picture. Very high quality pictures with very little noise. This camera also includes a manual mode for the advanced users and people who want to learn it.","I have been very pleased with the A70.  I used to do a lot of photography in college, but afterwards found that without access to a darkroom, point-and-shoot (Rollei 35S) was the easy way to make photos.  About three months ago, I made the switch to digital and decided to invest in a camera with the capability of manual controls.  The learning curve for the A70 was not trivial, and it took awhile for what was obvious thirty years ago to come back.  The biggest challenge has been focusing using the macro mode.  In general, I find this camera a hoot and am enjoying photography again.  I feel liberated by being able to pick the 10% of the photos that really stand out.  The amount of info in the 3.2 meg image seems adequate for 4x6 or 8x10 prints.  As I said in the title, I'm very pleased.","I waited for a while for this Camera to come down below $250.00 and I scored it for $220.00 or so here on Amazon and I couldn't be happier. Great print out quality at 8 x 10's shooting at the highest resolution and superfine quality. The video function is actually practically useable with a 512, 9mb write speed card. Sequence shots have been great with wakingboarding and skating. Can't wait to get the waterproof casing for it. Aluminum body is sturdy and ergonomic. Doesn't eat batteries. Get ya one!","I'm new to digital cameras and I'm not even sure why I bought this one.  I think I got one just to do it.<br />I'm not quite sure what to take pictures of yet, but what I have taken pictures of look very good.  I don't have any other cameras to compare it to though.  The images are good quality, but I wished it was even sharper than it is.  When you look at the largest images (2048 x 1536) with a desktop resolution of 1280 x 960, the images are somewhat blurry when you zoom into the image 100%.  It looks very good though.  I took pictures of my backyard and I tested it's ability in low light.  I took a picture of myself with me only being lit dimly by my computer screen and it showed up pretty well (I used the nighttime photo mode).  And even if the image isn't bright enough or colored the way you want you could just edit them once you download them to your computer.<br />I was suprised with the quality of the video.  It is very good looking, but at 640x480 it can only record for like fifteen seconds.  I suppose I can make movies like Michael Bay though with thousands upon thousands of 5 second shots.<br />I researched different cameras and went to review sites with image quality tests and this one seems to have the best looking images for the cost.  And it also seems to have the most features.  The bottomline is that the images taken with this look great, the video feature looks great, lots of options to choose from and the camera itself is very sharp looking.","I have been using this camera for over six months now, above and below the water with the Canon housing. Don't get hung up on higher resolution camera - 3.2MP is terrific. I bought Maha 2200MaH batteries plus a couple of 256 Meg CF cards. It's all been reliable. The software is good too - I make panoramas with the Canon - some of them 9' in length.","I'd been waiting to get this camera for a while and got it about a month ago when it finally went on sale for under $225.00. I love it. It doesn't eat batteries as bad as most of the other digital cameras out there. The aluminum case is super sturdy. Picture quality is great. I got the viking 512 flash card on sale and it will take around 300 pictures at highest quality and highest resolution. Pictures print out well at 8 x 10. With the standard viking card at the highest resolution and size it will shoot about one frame per second. I would suggest getting the Ultra II compact flash card with the 9mb write speed if you plan on doing a lot of action sequence shots. I'll be getting it soon. Also having all the manual features available is great. Plus the camera is nice and compact and very ergonomic. Over-all I give this camera a 5 outta 5 as a great point and shoot camera. Plus you can get the other lense attachments from Canon if you want or the waterproof case.","Love it!  So much easier to use than the Kodak DX-3215 I bought previously.  Simple to use, many cool features.  I'm still learning what it can do.  Plugs right in to the usb port to transfer pictures.  My daughter didn't even have to teach me how to use it!  Great buy, great quality product.","Sharp pictures with 3.2 megapixels has turned out to be a great camera.","After much research I decided to buy the A70 as a gift for my \"technology impaired\" dad, and I wasn't disapointed. The camera is easy to use and the software is simple, yet effective. Most of the pictures come out great, the only drawback is that if you want to take shots of fast moving objects the A70 does not do the job too well. If you are looking for a camera to take on vacation this is a great one, easy to use and not too bulky or heavy. All an all, a highly functional machine.","After much research and testing, I decided upon the A70 because of the quality of the pictures and the look and feel of the camera. I upgraded the memory to 256MB and got the rechargeable batteries (a must) and also purchased a card reader.<br />I took the camera on a trip to London and Paris and I got the most incredible photo's! I'm not at all a photographer but when I showed the pictures to family and friends they thought that some of them were postcards. One picture of Big Ben had activists and police at the top of the tower. By zooming in on the photo (taken at least .10 miles away and the tower is quite high), I can actually see them and read the signs they were holding in protest. Just amazing. I took over 175 pictures and never worried about running out of space.<br />The card reader works just like another drive on your PC and I easily drag and drop the pictures to my hard drive or to write onto a CD.<br />Best Christmas present I ever bought for myself!","This camera is awesome. There isn't a thing about it that I don't like. It's extremely versatile. I've gotten fantastic shots of everything from flowers only a few inches away to horse races. I've heard complaints about its ability to photograph fast moving objects, but I've gotten great shots of both agility dogs and racehorses moving at 35 mph. Most of the shots come out crystal-clear, and if they don't, it's usually my fault. The shutter speed is a tad bit slow at times, but 90% of the time it's quick enough for what I want to photograph. Highly recommend this camera.","For the money this is a great camera!  For someone with large hands it might be awkward to use. My husband felt it was \"too flimsy\" and the zoom button was too small. I had a S30 Canon which was a lot pricier and more sturdy for my husband's large hands. After  11 months it broke. I got this A70 to replace it - I figured if it broke in 11 months I wouldn't have such a big $ investment in it!  After 8 months it's going fine. Would highly recommend for a beginner or amateur photographer.","I chose the A70 looking for a entry-level model, and this camera has met my expectations.  I feel it is a good value because it offers more than I was looking for but is still priced well within where I would expect it to be.<br />This camera is easy to use out of the box.  It has a lot of features and shooting modes that I would not expect at this price.  The manual is easy to follow, and the software is easy to install and use.<br />There are only a few improvements that I would like to see.  Regarding the body, the terminal cover seems flimsy and can be difficult to slide open, and the LCD monitor is glossy and seems prone to scratching.  There is also no battery meter other than a \"low battery\" indicator.  None of these issues would deter me from buying this camera.<br />I've also noticed inconsistent quality in low-light shooting.  That may be the operator rather than the camera, but keep this in mind if you will use this a lot for low-light pictures.<br />I like being able to use 4 alkaline batteries, and I got around 215 shots (most with flash) before having to replace the batteries.  The 16MB Compact Flash card it comes with will of course need to be upgraded, but this is true of most digicams.  The A70 does offer a wide range of picture size and image quality, so you can get anywhere from 8 to 150 pictures on a 16MB card depending on what resolution you shoot.<br />This is also a popular model, so there are a lot of resources on the web. After a month of use, I have not had any problems with it.  I'm very happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality entry-level digicam.","I spent quite a bit of time researching digital cameras in the 300 dollar or less range before purchasing this camera.  I am pleased that I picked the Canon A70 camera.  Uses AA batteries, rechargeable or alkaline.  So if the rechargeable batteries go dead on you, just slap some standard AA batteries in and continue shooting.  Uses relatively inexpensive CompactFlash cards.  Has manual overide capability if you want, so you can take total control of your shots.  The 15 fps movie mode with sound is awesome.  The camera can take a 640X480 movie clip of 3 minutes in length and produces about a 20MB file.  Of course you can take many of these 3 minute clips as long as you have space on your CompactFlash card.  320X240 movie clip lengths are only limited by the amount of free space on your memory card.  Definitely a good buy.","This is obviously a little more pricey than some of Canon's other 3MP cameras, but WELL WORTH IT.  The picture quality and features are amazing, and this camera was rated as one of the best in its class by consumer reports.  I am very pleased that I did the research and made the right choice by purchasing this camera.","For those non-techies out there (myself included) who just want an inexpensive, easy to use family camera, this is it. The A70 is a nice little camera -- it's easy to slip into a pocket or backpack, takes consistently clear pictures, and can take mini-movie clips that are wicked easy to e-mail (especially if you have Windows Movie Maker or similar, and can combine the clips and shrink the files down).  I purchased a larger memory card (128MB) and rechargeable batteries, and have really enjoyed using the camera for six moths without any problems.  You can also purchase additional lenses (which is nice, because it has a limited zoom).  We have packed away our Nikon and camcorder, because this is less obstrusive, more convenient, and simpler to use.  Pictures which we've developed at WalMart have also come out clean and crisp, although we've never done a larger size than 4x6.  My only complaint is minor -- there is no battery indicator, so when the batteries go, they go with minimal warning.  (I just pack an extra set of disposible AAs as a back-up.)  This is our first digital, and we will most likely purchase a Canon again based on this one's performance.  Hope this helps!","This camera has given me no problems.  The software that comes with it is great as well.  I highly recommend it!","This camera is well worth the money because:<br />- it has many features that many cameras in the same class don't have<br />- very good picture quality, even better quality if you know what you are doing and know how to tweak camera settings<br />- it can use refular AA batteries as opposed to propierarity batteries as Sony cameras do<br />- manual control; i.e. full aperture and shutter speed control<br />- satisfying picture quality in automatic shooting mode<br />I gave it 4 stars because:<br />- it is missing a battery indicator<br />- it uses 4 batteries instead of 2 (although this results in longer usage time)","I took the A70 to Argentina last summer along with 3 sets (12) of recharchable batteries, a Rayovac quick recharger (really nice here, and necessary there) and a power transformer.  The transformer cycled things down from 220 to 110 but it took a while to charge, nevertheless the battery life from 3 sets was enough that I could go on a side trip from Buenos Aires through central and northern Argentina without my charger and not worry about running out of juice for a week.  All in all I took about 600 pictures, and manyof them are really quite stunning post-card quality - the others are MISTAKES on my part.  I'm disappointed that the A80 has that flip out LCD which looks like a potential battery hog, I think they should have kept it simple.  This is a great model, and for this price you will definitely not be disappointed.<br />For the record I had a little case that I carried the camera and the two extra sets of batteries in at all times.  They all fit very compactly, and I never needed more than the one 256mb card I brought down with me.","I ordered 5 of these digicams last year for my workplace.  We use these to create training aids and to document problems and/or unusual situations.  Since then, I've recommended this camera to 4 of my friends, and they are all quite satisfied with the A70s performance.<br />There are better digicams out there, but for the price, the A70 cannot be beat.  The A70s are fairly user-friendly.  There are many technologically impaired people at my workplace, and I've managed to train them on the most basic features of this camera with little effort.  And for those who require more advanced features (f/stop, shutter speed, exposure compensation,...), the A70 will provide satisfaction (although some of these features are buried deep in menus).<br />The A70s size is compact, though not quite as small as many of the super-compact digicams (Canon ELPH, Pentax Optio, Casio Exilim, Olympus Stylus,...).  But for those with larger hands, the A70 is very easy to handle.  When I am using a super-compact digicam, I often feel as if it will slip out of my fingers.  The larger grip of the A70, however, provides a wonderful sense of security.<br />The biggest gripe I have with this camera is the lack of a RAW or TIFF mode.  Granted, most users won't use these formats, but some of the more advanced users may appreciate them.<br />We've printed pictures up to 8x10 inches with pretty decent results.  Most point and shooters will find the A70 to more than adequately suit their needs (when was the last time you had an 8x10 made?).<br />If you do get the A70, definitely invest in a larger CompactFlash card (consider 128MB).  And don't forget to purchase a couple sets of rechargeable NiMH AA batteries and a recharger.<br />If you think you need higher resolution, the recently released 4MP Canon A80 may suit your needs.  The A80 also comes with a swiveling LCD, which is quite helpful in taking self-portraits or shooting from an unusual angle (it also makes an excellent real-time \"reverse-mirror\").","I previously owned Sony 1.3 MP and I was not happy with the performance. I can compare image to image and find all the differences. I would give full stars to Canon A70 and this is my prized possession and I would recommend this to all.","I bought this earlier in 2003 since my children live in MA and I live in CA and I was tired of disposables and the trouble of the new xray machines. I love it. I wish it was smaller but at the time I purchased it it was the lowest cost for the best resolution. Canon has come out w/a smaller version that I would buy now - but this is a great camera for those looking for a real-size camera that offers FULL manual options for picture taking.  The batteries last the life of adding in a larger card to take over 100 pics. The software is very easy to use and now I print specific pictures for my children and myself.  Canon keeps coming out w/higher MP at a lower cost so now this model is not the optimum to get.  I won't buy a new digital until a 4MPx is $200 and the size of a credit card since, when this one is 'off', fits in any pocket of my clothing.  Drop me an email w/any questions - I'm an honest person who shoots straight...m_jessing@yahoo.com","I purchased my A70 4 months ago and it works great! I bought the NIMH battery pack with charger and rechargeable batteries. I had read reviews on this camera draining batteries quickly but this is not the case at all. The batteries don't need charging for quite a while. As far as features, I am a beginner at using them and haven't quite figured them all out. I have found that when using the P mode and changing the focus to spot metering, the camera takes better pictures particularly of a single person. I love having the movie mode. This camera was a great price and I do not regret my purchase at all.","If you are looking for a great digital camera with great features, this is the one.  This camera take awesome pictures and has more features than I know what to do with.  What I liked most about this camera is that it can be completley manaul and completley automatic.  This camera has all the features you will ever need and produces awesome pictures.  The only think I don't like about the camera is that it does not come with a rechargeable battery.  But this problem is easily solved if you buy the Canon battery pack.  All in all a great camera for a great price.","I bought this camera a couple of weeks ago... It takes excellent pictures outside and inside (auto mode), and you need to 'play' a little with the settings to get amazing pictures.. That's the good thing about this camera, you can adjust the settings manually... Also, you need to buy a bigger compact flash to take lots of pictures... And the only thing I would add, is a battery meter to know when the batteries are out... With four 2100mAh Ni-MH batteries you can take more than 154 pictures at full resolution... Buy and enjoy it!","I have been using the A70 for 9 months now with over 10000 photos taken.  Not even a single problem with the camera. I use a 256 Mb memory cart and standard bty.  I often take over 150 photos on a single set of bty.  When buying them in lots of 48 per pack at $20 you cannot go wrong.  I just return from a month vacation in France where I took over 600 photos.  All of them turned out picture perfect.  I would recommend buying this camera to anyone particulary new commers in the digital field as it is very easy to use.  Sorry no E18 errors.","The quality of the pictures are just amazing with this camera.  I personally took a chance with the whole E18 error and have not had it happen to me yet.  However even the sales folks at the local electronics store knew about the error and were looking forward to the A80 not having the same thing happen to it.  Let's hope so...but there are other issues out there with this camera.  The main one is for those of us out there that will be using AA batteries and rechargeable batteries.  It seems as though the A70 is a bit picky when it comes to changing out the batteries.  You can put in 4 brand new cells (all from the same brand) and the camera will reject the new batteries.  The message that is presented is \"change battery pack\".  By playing musical chairs with the batteries it will work after some dancing.  But this should not be necessary.<br /><br />So that is the negative stuff.  Here is the positive stuff that you will really enjoy to read.  We purchased the camera in September from Ritz.com off of this site.  You may read some reviews stating that the camera is heavy due to the batteries.  This may be true.  4 AA batteries can be heavy.  However the batteries are situated where the palm of your hand will be gripping the camera.  This provides a great feel for the product that feels like quite a bit of thought went into it.  The pictures will be bragged about it the other hundreds of reviews for the A60, 70 and 80 models so I will just concur with them stating that they are all subjective.  The functions on the camera are as intuitive to operate as say a Sony product who is usually the leader in this area.  Not to say that the Sony line is inferior but just to say that this would be a complimentary statment to Canon.  Oh and yes I nearly forgot.  The software that comes with this camera is really top notch considering what it can do.  It is so user friendly and makes you feel like you got everything under control with how to download and then email each image.  Thanks for reading and if the A70 ends up being your choice you won't be sorry.  I hope you enjoy the camera as much as we have.<br /><br />Update March 22, 04 \"E18 error\"  The error is the end of my fond and brief relationship with this camera.","Very versatile little camera. Compact, light, nice looking. Feels sturdy and is sturdy. My little daughter knocked it out of the car when I first got it. The body split apart a little, but I snapped it back together and it hasn't missed a beat.<br />3.2 megapixels is plenty to take nice pictures. Couple this camera with a Canon i860 printer and Photoshop Essentials (plus a Photoshop Essentials tutorial book - I recommend Photoshop Essentials for the Digital Photographer by Scott Kelby) to correct and touch up your pictures and you've got a nice photo studio right in your house.<br />Don't be afraid to buy this camera.","I bought this camera around Thanksgiving from Amazom and got an excellent price. This camera is easy to use and takes great pictures. I read one review complaining about battery life and a suggestion to turn the display off. I have taken around 250 pictures with the viewfinder and still am using the original batteries. Excellent camera","The camera performs very impressive in its price range, especially all the auto settings work in most conditions.<br />The problem is the software. The bundled ZoomBrowser is very badly designed in user interface. Too troublesome to download photos. The design was somewhat against intuitive -- the tags look weird, and the \"selection\" of photos is very tricky if you are used to windows selection keys. I had to use a CF reader to download the photos to avoid the stupid interface.","This is an excellent camera.  I have the Powershot A60 and have worked a bit with the A70.  The only difference on these cameras is that the A70 has more megapixels, other than that they are THE SAME.  The cameras offer various features, each with several different ways to manipulate the camera, including shutter speed and aperture.  For the beginner, it offers a few preset options that allow a quick switch to the desired need of the user.  The manual is very clear and easy to apply.  I would recommend this camera to someone wanting a point and click camera, as well as a more advanced person desiring some control of the camera.  The only complaint about these cameras is that they are poor for low light photos.  The low-light problem I have is in the requirement of using the flash and that the camera will usually not focus in low-light, creating not-so-nice blurry memories for many indoor family events.<br /><br />This camera has optional shutter speeds of up to 15 seconds, which I like to use with streams and other pictures involving water.  The speed has its highest shutter speed at 1/2000 of a second, which I haven't yet had success with, but will have fun playing with (it needs to be really bright for this).  I haven't yet played with the aperture, but it seems like it will be fun to play with as well.<br /><br />If you are wondering if you need 3 MP (A70), consider what you want to do with the pictures.  I would recommend a 3 MP if you want to do some cropping or want to blow up pictures greater than 5x7.  I simply use my A60 just for 4x6 and looking at pictures on my computer, which it does an excellent job of.<br /><br />I would recommend getting either a 128 or a 256 Mb compactflash card (cards used in these cameras) in addition to this camera (runs between $40 and $70), because the camera only comes with a 16 Mb card, which holds about 15-20 pictures.  I personally prefer Lexar's 12x or higher cards.  Get rechargable batteries!!!  Amazon's prices seems to be the cheapest for both cameras and compactflash cards (or within a couple bucks of other places).<br /><br />I would highly recommend either the Powershot A60 or A70 to anyone that wants a digital camera because of the versatility offered.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Update:<br />I have now had my Powershot A60 for over two years, and it is still functioning despite the serious abuse I have dealt to it. The camera has been dropped numerous times and has also taken a tumble down a 20 foot rocky steep hill (I thought it was a goner after that one). It has endured backpacking, rock climbing, and general outdoor adventures with me, and although its casing shows many scraps, dents, and scratches, the camera's functionality is beyond all of my expectations. The only problems that have developed is that the LCD seems to be dying slowly and about 20% of in-door poorly lit shots turn out grainy and have horizontal lines (all of which occurred after that major tumble, so I expect that is the cause); that is, 80% of in-door shots still look great. At the prices you can find this camera at around the internet, it is an awesome intro and general use digital camera, and with the low price, you can even pick one up for your kid (since it is now so cheap -- look elsewhere than Amazon). Anyways, I am looking to pick up a second one of these for the inevitable event that I completely destroy this sturdy camera.<br /><br />Also, in its 2 years of use, I can honestly say that I have not found a single time where I truly needed more than my 2 MP to get a great shot. I have taken this camera to the Canadian Rockies, to the Western Caribean, and all over the western US, and of all of the pictures I have, I don't see a true need for a higher megapixel than 3 MP (mine is 2 MP) or zoom (3x), unless you need a camera for your profession.","This is a great camera.  Easy to use, not to hard on batteries.<br />Does anyone remember an offer back in October 2003 that had a $50 Amazon gift card issued if purchased before November.  I bought this for Christmas (2 months early) so that I would get it, now Amazon is acting as if I'm crazy.","I own a Canon D30 and 10D and bought this camera for my Daughter, and I find myself asking her if I can barrow her A70, when I don't feel like carrying a large camera, it takes great pictures, eazy to use, great on battries, that's a big plus, I love ours.","I am completely satisfied with the camera.  I would recommed you read your manual before you begin taking pictures.  I was amazed by some of the features it does have.  I also like the fact I can use regular batteries in it.  Make sure you invest in a rapid charger and couple of sets of rechargable batteries.<br />It's not perfect taking pictures in low light.  I still did receive some red eyes even with red eye reduction light on.<br />I would recommend this camera.","This camera fulfills all its claimed specifications and shows that 3.2 megapixels are quite sufficient for producing really good images. Although the AA batteries are more bulky than the rechargeable battery on the S400 Powershot, it's great to be able to slip in instant replacement batteries, rather than be possibly stuck when the rechargeable one goes flat.","I bought this and ive had it for a while... ITS AWESOME.. i carry it everywhere, they say your best camera is the one you use the most... and this is the best.","Im enjoying my third day of play with this camera and looking forward to more. Im a weird combination of photo nut and tech geek so I decided to finally take the plunge and replace my dead point and shoot with a digital camera. Being anal I decided to do some serious research before choosing one. I decided to stick to 3 mp because Im dreaming of getting a digital SLR down the road and didnt want to sink too much money into this.<br />It seemed that everywhere I checked every serious reviewer raved about this camera. What finally sold me on it was the fact that it had a lot of advance features that would allow me to tweak my photos (aperture priority, etc..), movies with sound, autofocus assist for low light situations, and would still be simple enough for my wife to snap shots of the kids quickly. All I can say is WOW! I didn't even have to crack open the manual for the first 2 days. I printed out some 4x6's at a Kodak kiosk just to check the image quality and Ive got to say that Im very impressed. There is no way (at that size) to tell the difference between this camera and a regular film point and shoot. If you want beautiful 4x6's, the ability to tweak your settings, and ease of use in a digital camera I would run out and grab this.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good month and a half and I still dont have a real complaint. Buyers should be aware that the battery life on this camera is EXCELLENT! If you're put off by the idea of having to buy AA batteries get yourself 8 rechargeables. You'll always have a spare set charged up. And if you're ever traveling and run out its easy enough to get regular AA's anywhere. Try that with a proprietary battery. For those of you worried about the 3 megapixel just keep one thing in mind...It will only be a problem if you try to blow it up larger than 8x10. How many of you have ever felt the need to do that?<br />I mentioned the ability to tweak earlier. I'm happy. You get most of the options  that you normally have to buy an SLR in a compact camera size. All you semi-serious photo people should seriously consider this just for that reason. Many of the other digital point and shoots are just too dumb and would have frustrated me. OK...one problem is red eye. But I knew that going in just b/c of how physically close the flash is to the lens. But that's what photo software is for. Other than that the camera is everything I though it would be....a very useful quality digital camera for a very reasonable price.","By way of background, I've been using Nikon SLR's for nearly 30 years and have quite a bit of experience with film photography.<br /><br />I've been avoiding the switch to digital just as I avoided the switch to auto-focusing until earlier this year.<br /><br />After quite a bit of research, I decided on the Canon A70 as it seemed to offer the features I needed at a price that made sense. I really didn't know if I would enjoy digital or not so it wouldn't be much of a writeoff if I decided to stick with film. In fact, I've been a die-hard Nikon user but couldn't find an offering from Nikon that compared to the Canon A70.<br /><br />I've had the A70 for a few weeks and taken several hundred photos. During that period I haven't picked up any of my film cameras.<br /><br />Although it's only been a short time, I'm finding digital to be a revelation. The instant feedback I get on the LCD screen means that I don't have to worry about whether or not I \"got the shot\".<br /><br />Pros:<br />Available manual metering with ability to customize flash output<br />Sharp lens<br />Seems pretty sturdy for a plasticam (it's not all metal as the ads would lead you to believe)<br />Takes AA batteries...4 of 'em! I'm using 2000ma Powerex NIMH batteries and would recommend them to anyone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />In any of the auto modes, the flash is a little too powerful for subjects within 8 feet.<br />Hunts for focus in low-light situations. So does my Nikon N80 so that's not just Canon's problem<br />Cheap 16mb CF card. I bought a 256mb SanDisk with the camera and would recommend that you do too.<br />Software is suitable for only simple tasks. The red eye remover is a joke. I'm ordering Adobe Elements 2.0 from Amazon today.<br /><br />Overall, I'm still learning about digital photography but find it very enjoyable and relatively simple. I'm sure that my film photography experience helps with the last part but the A70 is really a point and shoot camera even though I don't use it that way.<br /><br />I can't imagine a better camera for the money. I'm considering the purchase of a digital SLR which will probably be a Nikon so that I can use my current lenses. If I were starting from scratch I could just as easily go with a Canon.<br /><br />EDITED: Coming up on 1 year of ownership, I'm still generally satisfied with the quality of the camera. No problems whatsoever so maybe I'm lucky.<br /><br />Prints up to 8.5x11 are acceptable but barely so. I've found that almost every image needs some correction in PhotoShop to looks its best but I understand that every other digital camera requires the same.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm not all that impressed with the whole digital thing. While I can understand the convenience factor when taking the shot, the post processing of every image defeats the purpose. I've been holding off buying a DSLR until I see a large improvement in this area.<br /><br />Right now I find that I can get better quality by simply scanning the slides taken with my Nikon film cameras. If I have to fuss around in PhotoShop, I may as well start with as high a quality image as I can get.","This camera has good and bad points like I am sure many others. It is up to the customer to decide what matters. I bought mine last april for the event of my daughter's birth - and after much deliberation.<br /> The camera is well-built. I had little problem at all with its robustness. It holds well in your hand too.<br /> As for photo quality it is very good - even excellent for indoor flash shots ( I have to differ with other customers on that). In fact flash shots are its strength. They are nearly irreprochable. Outdoor shots are good.... but I have noticed purple fringing on high contrast shots ( especially on branches of trees etc). Not to concerning as you'd have to be particular to it. However the lens flare is more irritating ( if rare). Bright light can cause rings of light ( yes you read correctly) like a western movie.<br /> That is a shame as the quality of the pictures are very good and noise is inexistant on most iso 50 shots - canon should have spotted this bug....<br /> But such a good alrounder, fast snapper that lens flaring is relative...<br /> Would I buy it again? Maybe, probably try another cam as others have come out and built on canons strong points ( manual control etc).<br /> But a sure value....","This camera definetly has a problem with indoor autofocusing.  While the little red light was shining (focus assist thingy) it still could only focus 2 out of 20 times in my house.  I had to return it because 90% of the time thats where I take pictures!  I would definetly say to not buy this camera if your an indoor shooter.","After reading other reviews with inaccurate information, I had to write a review to correct them. Here are few things to keep in mind as you read. Foremost, it should be noted that in almost any magazine you pick up, the Canon Powershot A70 is always rated #1. Second, the information I am providing has been gathered based on a comparison and my experience with other camera's in its field, more noteably the Fuji Finepix A310, Nikon Coolpix 3100, and lesser models such as the Fuji Finepix 2650 and Nikon Coolpix 2100.<br />To begin this camera has a wealth of features that other cameras do not, so if you are starting out on a digicam it has auto mode and if your a pro or trying to be one, then your all set in that department as well.<br />A few readers mentioned that it takes bad pictures in the dark or low-light conditions.  I would be interested to know what setting they used to take those pictures because I have gotten perfect pictures, sometimes better than with good lighting.  In a few scenarios, I have chosen to use no lights rather than use lights for the photograph.<br />In addition to being able to take pictures in both low and high lighting pictures, the Canon A70 produces very, very little image noise, only a few red eye images (which can be edited on a computer) and out of approximatley 100 photos that are taken produced only 3 unfocused pictures.<br />With the wealth of features, the excellent image quality and the long battery life, it is not difficult to give the Canon Powershot A70 5 stars!!!","Canon is really making a BIG MISTAKE by not improving on its low light autofocus ability.  This is another Canon that takes GREAT daytime shots but is incapable of focusing in low light (even with the assist beam).  Even my puny Sony U30 can focus in low light, and its only a 2.0 mp (though not a very good resolution).  Sometimes it even lies and double beeps that its focused but its not!  Don't get this camera (A60/70/80) or most Canons if you take dark indoor or a lot of night shots, they CANNOT FOCUS in low light!<br />The images are also a little soft.  They require a bit of sharpening to make them decent to view.  Nice that there is enough resolution to make it sharp but you \"have to\" sharpen.","The Canon A70 Digital Cam is just Amazing. It's easy to use and has so many shooting modes and features. 3 min video time and endless shots once you've got the right Compact Flash.<br />It comes with a 16MB card but i recently bought the 256 MB and now I'm able to take about 530 pix at the highest resolution. I just love this camera and would recommend it to everyone!!!!!!!!!<br />There lots of Pros about the cam and i suppose some Cons, like blurred images once in a while,  but truth is ; i'm still reading the manual so its a lot of stuff to play around with.<br />Overall , this is a damn good Digi Cam and trust me, Once you buy it and you see what it can do, you'll see how every dollar you spent on it is Soooooooooooo worth it.<br />I now have so many pictures on my PC  and i use it daily to catch all the great moments i've been missing in the past.<br />SHOUT OUT TO CANON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Love My Canon A70 just love ittttttttttttttttt<br />You should get one too!!!!!!!!!!","My first A70 did a very nice job for a few weeks until it failed without warning.  The camera simply died completely after writing two black \"photos\" to the memory card.  Perhaps the replacement camera will work flawlessly for years to come.  Canon can ill afford hundreds (or even dozens) of customers writing personal accounts of catastrophic failures of their products.  In my opinion, this model can only maintain its classification as a good value if at least 99.9% of the units shipped remain failure-free for at least two years in the field.","The A70 is a very decent entry-level digicam with the usual benefits that come from any Canon family camera: excellent options for a point-and-shoot lightweight camera.<br />But, if you are looking for your first digicam purchase and a smallish camera to carry around, I'd recommend you to also consider at the sleek S series line from Canon, or the smaller Nikons, or more recent versions of the Minolta Dimage.<br />Since I am recommending AGAINST the A70, I'll focus in this review on what is NOT necessarily so cool about this camera --<br />(1) The A70 comes with 3.2 megapixels. The S230 comes with 3 megapixels. Not that big of a difference especially if you consider the somewhat heftier price tag for A70.<br />(2) Images are not as vivid as the S-series cams. The feel of the pics is a bit blurred (soft focus) and need sharpening in a photo-editing software. Quickly gets tiring.<br />(3) You'll find the camera is prone to the dreaded \"E18 error\". Google for it.<br />(4) Uses AA batteries, which means shorter usage time than Lithium-ion.<br />(5) When you zoom in in dark surroundings, without Flash, the pictures have a problem with horizontal lining that is a pain to get rid of.<br />(6) Miniscule memory card included with camera forcing purchase of upgrade immediately.<br />(7) The ON-OFF button is a pain to operate in this design.<br />(8) Frequent purple fringing, plus red colors appear frequently as purples in the pics.<br />(9) Speaking of which, there is red-eye galore, even with the red eye reduction setting turned on.<br />I'm speaking of a 2003 model and while you read this review, Canon may have released a newer series of these digicams. Caveat Emptor. I evangelize Canon in general but this cam I'd recommend you to stay away from. However, do consider some of the other excellent value for money offerings from Canon, including, as mentioned above, the S230, the S400 etc.","A70 is a very good camera. Only problem I have had is that the button is so stiff, that each time I take a picture the camera shakes a bit (if I'm not very careful), which leads to a little soft (shaken) pictures..","I won't belabor points other have made. I just want to say in my expirience this is a great camera.  Takes outstanding point and shoot photo's with no adjustment, however if you want to control aperture/shutter speed, etc you have the option.<br />As someone knew to photography it gave me many options.<br />Consider buying a tripod and rechargable batterys as well","Using this camera was great on my vac. The battey last a long time if you don't use the flash. The picture at night came out great using the flash. Good value for the money","This is my first digital camera, but I have had experience with others that family members own. I did a lot of research to determine what I wanted out of a camera and the A70 had all the features I wanted. I have had it for about three weeks now and love it. The insrtuction manual isan easy read, so easy that when I was finished reading it I was taking pictures like a pro. The quality of the pictures is excellent. The options allow you to take pictures in all sorts of settings, and lighting. It's portability is awesome. I fit it into the lapel pocket of a jacket and it fit perfectly. I HIGHLY recommend this camera even though it is a bit pricy.","I got one in October 2003 and it makes images as good as my $4,000 DSLR.  You can see my comments in detail at [...] and examples of photos at [...]<br />I LOVE it!  Runs forever on a set of batteries, easy to use, great results.  Caveat: like all cameras, it is an artists tool.  No camera just makes great photos all by itself.<br />Ken","I was looking for a small good quality digital camera for around $300. I wasn't sure whether to get the canon a70 or the Kodak EasyShare DX6340. I read reviews anywhere i could. I saw some pretty discouraging reviews of the canon. Although, i liked the size and the layout. I also heard from friends and family that i should definitly go with the canon. That the lense was crystal over kodaks glass. I'm very glad that i chose the canon. It takes amazing pictures and i couldnt be happier! I strongly recommend the canon a70 to anyone looking for a great little camera.","I first thought it was gr8.  But now their seem to be probs.  DO NOT put the memory card in wrong because it willruin the camera and cause broken memory cards.  Good quality","This is my first digital so I'm no expert, but I've had nothing but trouble-free fun with this puppy since August. My wife and I took it on a cruise to Alaska and all our friends have complemented us on the pictures we took using the A70. The all-automatic setting makes pictures totally easy for the novice and the manual settings allow you to experiment. The user manual is pretty good at explaining basic operation and features and the free software helps you get your shots on your computer for editing and uploads.<br />Only two complaints: the visual display is very hard to see in daylight (use the old fashion viewfinder) and be sure you get rechargeable batteries. That huge sucking sound you hear is the power draining out of your alkalines.","Pros:  Photo quality is excellent, and the features are ruling.  The movies look good, and I haven't had any technical issues with it.  Compact flash is a nice storage medium.<br />Cons: This is a very heavy camera, and the end part is quite big, preventing it from being carried in a pocket (I don't carry a purse).<br />Final thoughts:  Excellent for photographing your friends in bars (and making new ones!)  Having said that, I would have rather had a smaller camera with the same features for the same price.  Maybe a Pentax or the Digital Elph....","I am an amateur photographer (vacations, get-togethers, etc.)  and I have owned a Canon A-10 for several years and it met all of my needs valiantly. I received the A-70 as a gift (which I researched)  and have been playing with it for a few months now,  before writing this review. All I can say is: WOW! You'd be hard pressed to find such a a great camera packed with so many features at such a great price.<br />What I like the most:<br />-Canon reliability and superior lens<br />-small size (smaller! than the A10)...really fits in my pocket<br />-no lens cover to worry about<br />-super-sharp pictures (both for web-publishing and up to 8X10 prints...SUPER!)<br />-fun movie function let's me take all the video that my friends could bear to watch (I've only reached up to 3 minutes so far)<br />-VIVID color<br />-the numerous manual feature options, which are allowing me to learn more about photography and experiment at my own pace<br />What I found useless in this package:<br />-while it's nice that it runs on AAA's, there's no use packaging with regular batteries (only useful in a pinch...you need NiMH rechargeables!)<br />-the accompanying memory card is nigh-useless...I carry it on vacations in case I fill up, but really, if you want to have fun you need a minimum of 512MB for peace of mind and room to make lots of mistakes and throw in a few video clips<br />BOTTOM-LINE: after months of research and endless reading, all roads led me to this camera and it is WELL WORTH IT! This will keep me busy for the next couple of years exploring and learning. In the meantime the AUTO options produce FANTASTIC pictures, and the video clips are great. QUALITY wrapped in a FUN, EASY and TRULY COMPACT package.<br />ALSO, as a Mac-user, this camera is completely Mac-compatible and a snap to use...plug-and-play in OS X...my dog could download pictures it's so ridiculously easy.","Excellent Camera -  Value for money. Used during my Hawaii trip and was amazed by the output. Not too expensive, but provides most of the features  you look for.<br />  Bottomline, the quality of the pictures is clear enough for human eye. Not sure, how someone can convince me to buy something more clearer for double the cost.","I've had this camera for about a week now, and I love it. So what that it didn't come with rechargeable batteries and a charger. I bought this separate myself using energizer rechargeable batteries and it cost less than the set offered by Canon. I've tried all the effects and settings on this camera and they all work great. It's also nice to be able to print directly to my printer and not having to plug the camera into my computer. I highly recommend this camera. It's the best for under $500. I got mine for $289. Need a camera without having to worry about film. Get this one.","I can sum the experience I've had with the A70 up in four words: I Love This Camera! I researched digital cameras for about a year, and learned a lot about them in the process. My reasons for buying this camera came down to a few: I wanted a camera that could go totally automatic for my \"point & shoot\" Wife, but that could go fancy for me. I wanted a camera that actually felt like a camera in my hand, vs. some of the \"mini-digitals\" that I've seen.<br />I've taken over 200 photos so far and am still using the AA batteries that came with the camera. I rarely use the LCD display to frame the photo, using the viewfinder instead. I purchased a SanDisk 256mb Premium Quality card. It cost $10 more than the standard 256mb card and is well worth it.<br />I've tried the direct connect USB cable to download images from the camera to my computer. It was quick, easy, and worked very well.<br />Of course with some flash shots you get some red eye, but that's easily edited. For outside photos, this camera takes shots with colors so vibrant the images are almost three-dimensional.<br />I really can't find anything with this camera that isn't perfect.Even the directions are clearly written and very easy to follow. What a buy! I'd recommend this camera to anyone who wants a quality product that is easy to operate and takes great photos.","Great camera.  Easy for a beginner, just point and shoot.  With it's advanced features an advanced user can use it like a full function SLR.  Great definition in photos.","I haven't even begun to get into the finer details of this camera but just fooling around with the automatic setting is producing some outstanding pictures.  I like the way it sits in my hand and it is easy to hold steady with just one hand. I cannot believe the clarity.<br />Worth every penny so far.  I don't know how it will hold up, time will tell, but for now: THIS THING IS GREAT!!!!","After owning the Canon A-70 for a relatively few short weeks, I am extremely happy with it. I have had other cameras in the past. Olympus 35mm, with wide angle and zoom telephoto lenses, small point and shoot, etc. This camera has them all beat, and comes in such a small size that it was and still is hard for me to appreciate just how complex it could be, if I choose to take advantage of all functions.  Ten years ago, a camera with as much versatility, would have cost thousands of dollars. This is one heck of a buy and for $300.00 you really can't go wrong.","This is the latest model in this mellenium.Everyone in the world over should strive to own one.","I AM A NOVICE DIGITAL PICTURE TAKER. I RESEARCHED NUMEROUS CAMERAS BOTH ONLINE AND IN RETAIL SHOPS, SOME SPECIALTY. WHEN CHOOSING A CAMERA I RESEARCHED FEATURES AND USAGES(RECOMMENDED) THIS CAMERA IS COMPACT, EASY TO USE, UPLOADING IMAGES WAS A BREEZE~ I DO RECOMMEND SOME RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES AS YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH PICTURES TAKING BECAUSE OF THIS CAMERA. I KNOW IM ADDICTED TO IT..I TAKE MY LIL POWERSHOT WITH ME EVERYWHERE~ THE SOFTWARE IS PHENOMINAL AS WELL! IT COMES WITH USB AND AV/AU, AND BATTERIES... RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX YOU CAN BEGIN TAKING PICTURES. THE ZOOM IS SUPERB ALL MY PICTURES HAVE COME OUT WONDERFUL...YOU CAN REVIEW AS YOU SHOOT AND DELETE, TWIST, ALTER, AND SHOOT PANORAMIC AS WELL...WHAT NEEDS EDITING CANON PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE TO DO WITH. THE EVEN PROVIDE TEXT ADDITION, FRAMES ND MORE!<br />WANT A CAMERA INVEST IN THIS ONE!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. OH AND DID I MENTION THE EXCELLENT VIDEO WITH SOUND~ AMAZING","I purchased this camera last week and love it. My wife and I have not stop using it. We take pictures of everything.<br /><br /> I read the reviews before I made my decisions and I have to agree with the rest. This is a good camera...<br /><br /> Of course I am not a professional but the shots I take are very nice. The quality of the pictures are great! I love the zoom. optical is 3x and then you can zoom in even closer digitally... At close range or far the picture is very clear. no purple problem...<br /><br /> The download to our PC was very easy. The use of the camera seems tricky with all the buttons; it's just intimidating; read the manual and after awhile you will be a pro at it.<br /><br /> We deffinately recommed this to anyone interested in going digital. I have to agree, the auto lens cover is a nice feature among all the others.","Found 3 pieces of dust on the top of the lens when I opened the package.<br />Then found 1 piece of dust under the lens.<br />Though I could clean the dust on the top, I couldn't clean the dust under.<br />So I returned it to the store, even the camera is fancy.","I bought this camera a couple of months ago despite some reviews I've read online about battery life, etc. The battery life was certainly not a problem with NimH batteries. I took dozens among dozens of pictures before I had to change the batteries. If you leave the camera on for hours and are taking pictures all day long then maybe the battery will not last for more than two days. But if you are like me and take a few pictures here, turn the camera off, then say an 30 minutes later take another few pictures here and there, etc. Then the battery should last for weeks. It did for me!<br /> It also takes great pictures in the dark. I had a digital camera years ago and in low light it was terrible. With the canon I turned off all the lights and had only the TV on and it still took great shots.<br /> It even takes short movie stills. Not bad.<br /> All in all, I cannot complain about this camera and I'm quite happy with it.","I am very pleased with this camera---The pictures turn out really good---The only problem we had was the memory card only holds a few pictures---So be sure and get a larger one for it---I think anyne would like it--It's small, but very good.","I agree with the positive reviews here.  I have taken some really nice pictures.  But one qualification: It does have a significant problem with \"purple fringing\": a very bright patch next to a very dark patch in your picture will sometimes have a purple halo around it.  I know this is common in cameras with higher pixel counts, but I don't know how this camera compares to similarly priced models.  It can usually be removed with a time consuming procedure in Photoshop, etc.  This problem could apparently be solved if the A70 used a better interpolation technique in the camera.<br />They say the problem can be dimished by using a longer focal length (zooming in) or a lower ISO, but even this does not always work.  But to be honest, the movie mode is so awesome (better than anything else out there for the price), that I am willing to put up with this problem.<br />BTW, I also recommend \"Complete Digital Photography\" by Ben Long if you want to know how digital cameras work, how to take better pictures, and even how to choose the right camera.<br />And the movie mode is awesome at VGA resolution--shown on my 19\" TV, it looks a lot like a really good super-8 movie.  The sound quality isn't bad either (mono, of course).  Downside: only 30 seconds, and the camera will not adjust for lighting conditions during shhoting.","Took me long enough to get this one. In fact I went ahead and ordered the A60. But then the A70 finally came. Gave the A60 to my sister. I have mine set on medium resolution (which is what the A60 is) and my pictures come out just fine. Instructions were simple enough. Too many steps have to be taken to set it on auto shutter release, but what the heck. Don't use it that often anyway. Thrilled I had it when our grandson was born. Taken lots of pictures already. so far ir has performed flawlessly and the picture quality is great. I would and have recommended this camera to relatives and friends.","I really have enjoyed my A70.  I don't know that I think of it as a point a shoot though, at least in the way many people do.  I think that too many people think of \"point and shoot\" as \"toss and bounce\".  This is a precision insturment, and should be treated as such.  Your total investment on a camera like this after you buy memory cards, case, rechargable batteries, better photo/imaging software (Photoshop Elements is great!), and any other desired accessories can be in excess of $500.  Treat it like that and it will be fine.  If you want a camera to toss about, buy a Kodak or Fuji that won't make you want to cry if it gets broken.  If you are wanting a digital camera that you can customize to take pictures the way you want, is flexible, but will also let you just snap off quick quality pictures when you don't want to have to think, the A70 will do the job well.<br />Why not 5 stars?  I don't understand why a camera at this price point can't focus as fast as a [cheap]35mm AF Minolta \"point and shoot\".  I have played with a lot of 3MP cameras (Nikon, Olympus, Sony, etc), and none of them focus as fast or as accurately as my cheapy Minolta, especially in low light.  I couldn't give any digital cam that I have tried that is priced under $800 five stars for this reason.  I would give 4.5 stars if I could.","This is my third Digital Camera, before I decide to purchase this particular A70 I did so many research on megapixel comparison, picture detail samples and many more.<br />The awsome thing is the FLEXIBILITY of this A70 you can find this things everywhere AA Battery, Compact Flash MEMORY is so cheap, the detail of the pictures quality is same as the 4 Megapixel believe it or not but I found other Camera that pull my head off is the Canon G3 4 MPixel but to bad had been discontinued... so anyway I do highly recommend this mini tiny and beautiful design camera to everyone from beginer to advance user.","I purchased the Canon Powershot A70 in May in anticipation of using it on a trip to Europe.  After researching several online photo equipment review sites and looking at the cameras in local retail stores, I decided on the A70.  The facts that influenced my decision to purchase this camera were: size, weight, type of battery, ability to shoot in full automatic or with some level of manual control.  The additional advantages this camera offered, were the ability to use rechargeble batteries and add a macro or telephoto lens.<br />The learning curve is very fast.  I didn't have time to get very familiar with the camera before leaving, but it didn't take long to learn how to make adjustments.  Digital cameras tend to be much smaller than film cameras and that affects their handling and controls.  The menus are easy to access and once familiar can be changed quickly.  At first I thought the words on the menus were difficult to read in the LCD but this became less of a problem with time and with my glasses on.  In outdoor light all LCD's tend to be difficult to see but this is a very bright LCD and indoors is fantastic for viewing pictures.<br />The macro worked wonderful.  If you are photographing a stationary object you could use the manual focus, but to photograph insects or anything that moves, use the autofocus in macro mode to get spectacular photos.<br />I used a battery recharger with 2 sets of 4 rechargeable AA batteries, so I always had a spare set.  I used the LCD all the time and reviewed images at night of the day's photos, the batteries seemed to last forever.  As long as you have a recharger with an adapter for European current, you can plug it in at night in a hotel room and be ready for the next day.  The AA batteries can double in an emergency to power up your PDA with an adapter so you won't be carrying dead weight for only one device.<br />The 16MB compact flash that comes with the camera is best left home.  Get a 512MB CF and you can put nearly 500 photos in L mode (2048 X 1536).  You can add music or a memo to your photos.  I added a music memo to a picture of a band playing 60 feet away and the camera recorded it flawlessly.  This camera also has a movie mode with sound.<br />All controls are easy to access, the camera is well-balanced, and fast to turn on and off.  Don't be fooled into thinking this camera is too big.  Many of the new cameras are smaller, but they are not easy to get a grip on or hold with one hand without getting your fingers in the way of the lens.<br />Once you get your pictures home it is easy to view them.  The camera comes with a cable to view them on a TV with video and audio inputs or you can upload them to your computer via a USB cable.<br />This camera is much more than it might appear and for a modest price it delivers.","I have just purchased the canon powershot A70 - my first digital camera. I love it. I have gotten a ton of great pictures in every type of setting and in different types of lighting. The clarity of the pictures has been great. Most of my pictures have been taken on Auto but the manual features have been easy to use and simple to learn. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to get great pictures of their family and record trips or special occasions.","I'll keep this short, because there are lots of other reviews for the techies. In a nutshell, I'd simply say if you want a digital camera that point and shoot, the A-70 can't be beat for under $ 300 --- probably not for a lot more dollars, either.<br />I have a huge old Sony Mavica FD-91 that has been a good, reliable workhorse.  I like Sony in general, and looked at several new models before coming across the Canon A-70.<br />I started to buy one at Amazon.com, but then I saw it was coming from Target (no free shipping!), so I said what the heck, I'll just go there and get one.  No luck, they were out, and could not say when they would get more.  Circuit City and Best Buy had the same story.<br />Back to the internet, and found a lot of the camera suppliers were also out. So back to good old Amazon.com.  When I did the deal, their supplier had changed to Office Depot, but they had some in stock and I got mine in just a few days, for about $ 8.00 shipping.<br />Canon has a nice package, including the camera, USB cable, a cable for hooking the camera up to a TV, four AA batteries, a stingy 16MB compact flash card, software, and about four pounds of manuals. I found the manuals to be nicely done, better than what I'm used to from Sony by far.<br />The camera is just jam-up.  For most of us, just leave it in \"auto\" and start shooting.  For shutterbugs, it has a number of features that will allow special settings. It operates on four AA batteries, no high dollar jobs like many other cameras use.  I invested in rechargeable 1800 mAh Nickel Metal Hydrides, having been forewarned by other reviewers. I also stuck in a 512 MB card so I won't have to screw around changing them, or at least not very often.<br />I think the A-70 is a great design --- the battery box forms a natural grip for right handers.  The optical view finder is far enough left so that if you use your right eye, you nose won't get the back of the camera greasy. No lens cap, it has an automatic eyelid, sort of. Only a 3-X zoom, but c'mon, we're talking a $ 299.00 3.2 Megapixel camera here! The \"feel\" is good and solid. The little LCD on the back is sharp and clear, and there are a minimum of buttons to deal with --- what is there is easy to use.<br />So, if you are a first time digital camera buyer, this would be the one I'd recommend.  It is small enough for a purse, or to slip into a trouser pocket, so it will go anywhere with minimal fuss. It's cheap, takes great pictures --- even videos if you want --- what's not to like?","This is my second digital camera and probably my last. I had a Kodak Easy Share camera just to see if I would like a digital camera, I am a photographer and thought I would really miss having everything on film. With a new baby, I am constantly taking photos and the digital camera has saved me tons of money. Though I still shoot black and white on film, I have switched over to mostly digital. The Kodak was easier to download the photos to the desktop but the Canon is a much better camera. I takes great photos and the short video clip option is really nice to have. If you plan to take any videos you will definately need to get a larger card, the one included will only take about 15 seconds at the high resolution. I am very pleased with this camera. It is all you need unless you are planning on shooting poster size images. Beautiful quality images and quicker shutter speed than other digital cameras I've tried. Its a great buy. I highly recomend this camera.","I love this camera so far....<br />My beef is with Best Buy.  I bought this camera at a Best Buy in Michigan, 4 hours from where I live in Canada and specifically asked if I could exchange it at a Best Buy in Canada.  They all said NO PROBLEM.  Turns out I needed to exchange it and to my chagrin I am unable to do it. Ya I could return but what a frekin incovenience...and they will not componsate me either.","I have been long awaiting my first Digital Camera purchase.  I have been putting it off for well over a year now because I just could not find a camera that I fell in love with.  That was until I saw the Canon A70 one day at work.  I started playing around with it and immediately liked it.  As I worked more I played around with it more, and before I knew it I had decided which camera I would purchase when eventually purchased a camera.  The first thing you will notice about the A70 is how comfortable the camera feels while holding it.  The camera is extremely easy to turn on, and selecting one of the 12 different shooting modes is perfectly placed for your thumb.  The zoom is more than enough for me at 3.2 digital and 3X optical.  Taking/viewing pictures is as easy as any other camera I have ever seen, and the battery life is what is excpected from 4 alkaline AAs(I havent used Rechargable batteries yet).  There is no lens cover to worry about because there is a shutter that comes over the lens when you turn the power off.  The software that come with the camera is above expectations so far, but I have not used it incredibly extensively yet.  The Canon A70 does have a movie mode, and it works fine for short clips.  I also have the Canon ZR45 so I do not use the movie mode on the A70 that much.  Everything you need to get started come with the camera, including a strap and a 16mb Campactflash memory card.  Another nice thing about the camera is that it takes the CF card.  They are by far the easiest to find and cost far less than a number of other memory cards.  The Canon A70 is a great buy for the money at an MSRP of $$$$$.  I would definitely recomend the A70 to newcomers of the Digital Camera world and even to people looking to upgrade from their current camera.  The A70 is a SOLID 5 star camera.","First of all, WOW! I bought this camera for my girlfriend for her birthday. She and her family are really into taking pictures of everything: their pets, each other, anything! Never having even seen the camera in real life I bought it off Amazon at a great price.<br />I'm giving it to her with all the extras (a usb card reader so you don't have to plug in your camera, rechargeable batteries w/ charger and a 256 mb CF card.) I will be giving it to her in a couple of weeks, so I decided to make sure everything works ok. BAD MOVE!!!! I love it so much! I am not much of a picture guy and I've used it for a couple of days and have already taken nearly a hundred pictures! It is a great piece of work. It's great to be able to see a picture on your computer within 5 minutes of taking it! I'm going to have to get me one.<br />The quality is great! When you get the focus right, which isn;t TOO hard, the pictures look professional!<br />This camera is great and I recommend it very highly!","I just bought it recently and found it is really an easy to use camera! Most of the features of it were already listed by other users. I only want to tell another one which might be omitted by the English speakers. I found there are more than 10 choices of languages for the menu on the LDC display. So it is more easier for the people who is not an English speaker to use this camera.<br />The 3x optical zoom may not be enough for the experienced users.But it is enough for a beginner. And you can use the digital zoom to compensate this shortcoming.Anyway,considering the price, it is a good one.<br />The quality of the pictures took by this camera is quite good. And it doesn't use up the batteries quickly.","While [$$] still isn't \"chump change\" to me, it is a bargain for this camera.<br />When you open the box and take the camera out, you're surprised at how small it is but then, you're surprised by how solid and natural it feels in your hand. Even though the body is plastic, it has a sturdy feel to it unlike some other cameras in this price range.<br />Once it's in your hands, you pop in the 4 AA batteries, the compact flash card and, away you go. Put it in AUTO mode and you have a nice 3MP point and shoot camera that responds very well to varying light conditions and circumstances.<br />In other modes you have control over; white balance, exposure compensation, Drive (Single shot, continuous shooting, self-timer), ISO speed, Light Metering, Image Quality and Photo Effect (Off, vivid color, neutral color, low sharpening, sepia, black & white) The other modes are:<br />P-this mode is the same as AUTO but you have control over the above mentioned options.<br />Av-Aperture Priority, you set the f-stop, the camera sets the shutter speed.<br />Tv-Shutter Priority, you set the shutter speed, the camera sets the f-stop<br />M-full manual, you have control over shutter speed, aperture, flash output, and focus.<br />In addition to that, there's six other modes; Slow Shutter, Fast Shutter, Landscape, Night Scene and, Portrait. In these modes, the camera sets shutter and aperture to the appropriate settings for each situation. Also included is a Stitch mode which lets you take a series of photos and then combine with the software for a panoramic effect.<br />The last mode on the camera is Movie Mode. In Movie Mode, you can record at 3 resolutions; 640 X 480, 320 x 240, and 160 x 120. In the largest format you can record for 30 seconds and, in the other two formats, you can record approx. 3 minutes. Movies are recorded with sound in the AVI format but unfortunately, you can not use the zoom while filming in this mode.<br />Performance<br />When you power the camera up, it takes about 3 seconds to warm up before it's ready to shoot. Once it's ready, you push the shutter down halfway to lock the autofocus and then depress the shutter fully. Now you have a pic! You can review it on the LCD if you want any where from 2 to 10 seconds. The LCD screen measures 1.5 inches and fairly clear and easy to see but it would have been nice to control the brightness.<br />Next move inside to take some flash pictures. Here you'll use the autofocus illuminator to help the camera focus in low light. There's a small orange light on the front of the camera under the flash, when you focus, it comes on to make it easier for the camera to focus. This eliminates the long focus times that some other camera have in these situations if they can even focus at all. Also inside, you'll appreciate the fact that Canon put a decent flash on this little guy. It has a working distance of about 13 feet at the wide angle setting.<br />Picture Quality is very good. Pictures come out sharp with accurate color tones. I do get red-eye sometimes in indoor shots but, not always and, not to the point that I would consider unacceptable. I have yet to have any incidences of \"purple fringing\"<br />Overall, a VERY solid camera!","After many months of research, decided to purchase the Canon A70.  The camera has provided an excellent entry into digital photography.  The features on this camera are excellent.  Can't believe how much flexibility in picture taking can be included in such a small package.<br />I was concerned about the small camera size due to my arthritic fingers, but it has been easy to handle and control.<br />Battery life has been excellent. The stitch picture feature is exceptional. Really happy with the camera with one exception - the shutter does not respond as fast as my Nikon N6006.  Will try the recommended method of partially depressing the shutter to allow camera to make adjustments before taking the picture.<br />Picture quality has been great and processing the digital pictures thru a flash card reader easy.","I've owned this camera for 2 days, and already I've had a blast with it. I previously co-owned an Olympus D-550, but decided to buy a second one just for me.<br />It has great battery life (well, for a digital camera at least).  The pictures come out very good, and it has very nice optics (interchangeable lenses [not included] which is a nice feature).  It also uses compact flash, which is way better than smart media.  It's very cheap and you can get up to 256MB of storage space for this camera.<br />The only real con is that it doesnt support uncompressed images (like TIFF files).  That is really something I would've liked to have, although the jpeg superfine compression it uses is practically lossless.<br />Another small quirk is that there is no battery meter.  It only tells you when you are about to run out (maybe 5 minutes of life left?). But it lasts so long, you really don't have to worry about it.<br />There was one other thing that bothered me, but was not actually a problem, was how the picture on the LCD got lines through it when zooming.  The lines disappear when you stop.  At first I thought this was an issue with the LCD, as it looked suspicious. But not to worry, according to a Canon technician this is normal.<br />It is neither annoying nor do the lines interfering with viewing your subject.  However new owners might think there is something wrong with their camera. Good quality batteries helps alleviate this problem.<br />As with all non professional digital camera's, the autofocus/auto shooting mode doesn't always work correctly... This model works extremely well, but of course is not perfect. But one should keep in mind that for 300$ this is by far superior to almost others out there under 500$.  Autofocusing by most digital camera's are distracted by anything that emits glare or is very shiny/light reflective.  The canon can be fooled, but it generally works even under tricky conditions.  But of course Canon gives you a very complete set of manual features to adjust for these conditions. Most of the time this is not needed... I find it hard to match the \"auto\" mode quality with my own settings, a very big positive.<br /><br />The ergonomics are also wonderful, it's very comfortable to hold and unlike other cameras you don't feel like you are going to drop it.<br />Although I have mostly listed some negative things about this camera, this is no where near a bad review. The camera is wonderful, and the best 3-4 MP camera you can buy IMO. The clarity of the pictures and their color is wonderful.  I really don't see how anyone could be disappointed with this camera.  In all likelihood every non professional user should be thrilled with it.<br />This is the best camera I've tested yet.","this camera is perfect for people who are starting off their digital camera career.  it will work as a point and shoot but this is a camera you can hone your creativity on.  when you're ready to experiment, the A70 provides a high degree of manual control for a camera at this price point.<br />pros:<br />- very nice resolution<br />- 3x optical zoom lens<br />- amazing manual control for the price: manual focus, selectable ISO sensitivity, and exposure (aperture priority, shutter priority, or manual)<br />- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail<br />- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours<br />- AF assist lamp helps auto-focus for low light situations<br />- nice layout of controls and easy to understand<br />- very nice build quality - feels more expensive than what its price would suggest<br />- bright, detailed LCD monitor<br />- good shot-to-shot times, quick start-up time too<br />- movie clip mode up to 3 minutes<br />- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)<br />- impressive battery life plus it uses non-proprietary AAs (but i'd recommend buying rechargeables)<br />- excellent value - no one else offers this feature set at this price level<br />cons:<br />- slight chromatic aberrations visible<br />- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom<br />- moderately underexposed flash shots<br />- RAW format not supported<br />- no histogram available - useful to see if photos have correct exposure<br />- distracting mirror finish frame surrounds the LCD monitor<br />- competition is lighter and smaller, but also does not give the same amount of manual control<br />- the supplied 16MB CF card is not adequate - be ready to shell out more $$ for more memory<br />i was surprised by this camera.  at its price point, it has the most features among cameras available today.  this camera will work well with beginners (but who'll want to spread their \"creative\" wings later) but will not disappoint more advanced photographers on a budget.  definitely a camera to add to your short list.","While [the price] still isn't \"chump change\" to me, it is a bargain for this camera.<br />When you open the box and take the camera out, you're surprised at how small it is but then, you're surprised by how solid and natural it feels in your hand.

Hook up the computer with the supplied cable to a USB port, turn it on and your computer (PC) will either open the appropriate program or, you'll have to.

With that said, I have to say this very loud and clear... the Canon Powershot A70 and the lower model A60 as well are the best cameras available in their price range. The only difference between these two models is the megapixel size A70 = 3.2MP and the A60 = 2.1MP size. The A70 a great camera for a photography novice like myself, but it also has tons of powerful features for camera buffs.<br /><br /> As others have stated this camera uses standard consumables such as AA batteries (always easy to find) and Compact Flash memory (easily the most common memory card format, I've even seen CF cards available at the grocery store). This camera is definitely designed for the masses and it shows because it sells out as soon as it hits a store shelf. I was lucky enough to get after searching for over a week. Several other stores were sold out and had no idea when theyÂ’d get one in stock. ItÂ’s h","I ordered my Canon A70 from Amazon less than a month ago and I'm truly happy with my choice! It arrived on time and in perfect condition!<br />I did a lot of research prior to buying this, my first digital camera! My original first choice was the new P8 from Sony, a nice camera indeed, but the more I learned about the Canon A70 the more I liked it.<br />There were a couple of things that really influenced my decission. The first one was the fact that Compact Flash cards are far cheaper and more popular than Sony's Memory Stick. I bought a 128mp card for $24.99, a fraction of the price I would have paid for a similar card for any Sony camera! The second thing was the fact that this Canon uses simple and easy to find AA batteries, which means that if my camera ever runs out of power (and I'm caught without a spare set of rechargeables) I can easily find batteries for it at any place!<br />I love the many features of this little camera, and believe me, it has lots of them! One other thing that I really like about it is that you can use it both as a completely automatic point and shoot camera or as a completely manual one! I've already taken several photographs, and I'm amazed with their quality!<br />It is not as small as other cameras, but it is small enough to be quite comfortable and easy to carry around! And it's quite stylish too!!!<br />I truly believe that nowadays this camera is the best deal in its class! The only problem with this camera is finding one...It's selling like hot-cakes!!!","I may just seem to be a teenager... But I work at a target as a level 2 over electronics... the Canon PowerShot A70 Digital Camera 3.2 mega pixel is the best digital camra that Target carries at this time. its a mix of good quality ... zoom, sofware, and camra, along with a good price. I wouldn't recomend anything else.","I bought this camera because I'm a \"tweaker,\" and I like to have as many controls as possible.  This camera has full manual control, which is unequaled in the price range.  I also have to take pictures under stage lighting conditions, which can be difficult.  This camera gets it done, most of the time on the automatic setting.<br />That said, here are my problems:<br />1. The optical viewfinder is pretty much useless.  In the manual, it says that it only represents about 85% of what the picture will actually be.  I'm not sure why they did this, or why they haven't fixed it, as I'm led to believe it's common to all of the powershot series.  Luckily, the battery life (even with standard alkalines) is good enough to use the LCD screen as the viewfinder, and you can turn the LCD off between shots if you want.<br />2. There is no battery meter.  Right before the camera is about to shut off, a little icon flashes on the screen.  This is very annoying, and you have to carry extra batteries in case it shuts off with the lenscap open.","With the A70's use of AA batteries to CompactFlash memory, the camera is a great package for the price. No worries about exotic memory sticks or expensive batteries.<br /> I've used it now to photograph close-ups to sunsets - excellent 4x6 and 8x10 photos with the superfine setting. The movie mode is fun and suprisingly good, especially when downloaded to my home computer.<br /> The mirrored plastic around the LCD is a bit annoying but I put protective plastic (especially designed for LCD's and available at camera or office supply stores) to not only protect the LCD but also take some of the brightness off the mirrored plastic.<br /> Obviously buy a larger CF card - 256 is good.<br /> Canon has a winner here and seeing how many retailers including Target are always sold out, word must be spreading.","This camera is amazing.  After using a sipix 2.1 and a very expensive Nikon 995 I'm glad to say this is probably the best camera you can get for the price.  The picture quality is great.  It is a very easy camera to use even if you've never used digital before.  CompactFlash memory is great and cheap.  I do wish they gave at least a 32 meg card though instead of the 16 meg card.  The software included is easy to use and has a lot of cool features to add to your pictures.  The ability to shoot short video is also great.  Although you will probably need a bigger memory card if you plan on doing this.  The LCD display is very clear and the red eye feature is very cool a lot of other digital cameras don't have.  If you are looking for a great digital camera at a reasonable price go with this one.  I looked into many other cameras before deciding on this one and can say this is probably the best thing you can get for just casual picture taking.","Just spent 3 weeks on vacation and after 237 pictures, I am still on my 2nd set of AA batteries.  I used the new Ultra Duracell batteries designed for this type of application.  I have been using disposable cameras prior to this purchase, and wanted a digital that was just as easy to use...and this camera is a great choice.  Software is also user friendly, I have not had to refer to the manual yet on sending the images to my computer and setting up slide shows and e-mailing photos.  Very satisfied all around...and there is so much more this camera does...if I ever decide to take advantage of all its features.","had this camera for a month  fo shizzle my nizzle 12032093  buy it buy it","I have to admit that this is not my first digital camera, but the one that I had previously was very difficult to work with and broke after 6 months, which is why I ended up buying this camera.  I had to go searching through many cameras and finally decided upon this one after reading the reviews here on Amazon and then checking it out at the store where I purchased it.<br />It is amazingly simple to use the first time around.  By just turning it on and playing with it, you can figure out just about all the basics right away, which is why I say it is an awesome camera to have for a beginner (which is how I classify myself).  It comes with so many features that at first I didn't think were really necessary, but now I feel I could not live without them.  Every picture that I have taken has come out perfectly, which is saying a lot because I go off roading all the time and you get to see some of the most beautiful animals in their natural habitat, but you have to be quick to take the pictures of some of them which is why the \"moving\" feature is awesome and other times the animals are far away which is why the zoom is great!  It does well even in poor lighting and at night.  This camera is very easy to hook up to my Mac but unfortunately is not that compatible with the iPhoto program, but that is okay because the program that it comes with is very easy to use!!  Overall I would have to say that this camera has not let me down yet and I don't forsee it doing so.  Just remember these two magic words: rechargable batteries!!!","I bought this camera as an upgrade from my Sony Mavica 75.  The Canon A70 is an excellent 3.2 mpix camera.  Not only are the photographs of 35mm quality (depending on your printer, upgraded that about a year ago), but the camera has several point and click functions.  For the seasoned photographer, the manual controls (manual focus, aperature settings, shutter speeds, etc.)are outstanding!  The camera is loaded with functions galore, hence the 230-page manual.  Invest in a 128 meg or higher compact flash card, the 16 meg fills up quick.  No camera bag is supplied, I bought one for $10.  Need to invest in 2 4-packs of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a charger, the cost of regular batteries will add up quick.  This will be the last camera that I need to purchase for a very long time.","The Canon A70 Powershot is my first digital camera. Before this one, I owned a Canon EOS 35mm and spent hundreds of dollars a year on printing photos. However, I wanted to save on photo printing fees, share photos with friends and family over the web, and still enjoy the features that used for years on my EOS. I wanted to take photos in night and dim light situations as well as daytime and wide scenery, and enjoy the creative expression I had with the EOS. Going digital with the Canon Powershot was the most sensible move I could have made.<br />Things I like about this camera:<br />- the 3 megapixel resolution allows printing of very clean, clear photos on glossy paper;<br />- colors are natural-looking, vivid and realistic<br />- the ISO setting of up to 400 makes it easy to take photos without flash<br />- CompactFlash cards are cheaper than the other alternatives on the market<br />- the software included allows easy transfer of photos via USB<br />- power-up time is minimal<br />- the camera is a comfortable weight, and feels like a more expensive camera to the touch<br />- battery life (when using standard rechargeable Ni-MH AA batteries) is more than satisfactory for the casual photographer (I take maybe 50 photos a week, most without flash but with the LCD on, and only have to recharge once a month or so)<br />- photos taken using digital zoom, while looking grainy on the LCD, end up with surprisingly crisp clarity overall<br /><br />Things I dislike:<br />- no 800x600 resolution setting (sometimes 640x480 seems too small and 1024x768 too large for photos shared over the web or used in PowerPoint slide shows)<br />- inept redeye settings (it never seemed to work too well for me - is there something I'm missing?);<br />- photos taken in sepia seem a tad yellowish for my taste (possibly a problem that could be adjusted in printing)<br />- the meager selection of LCD display background and sounds<br />- camera cannot read or display photos from a CF card that have been edited and resaved in a separate PC application (the LCD just shows a question mark)<br />- slightly flimsy focus knob/level (I would have preferred a bit more solid feel)<br />- removing the CF card requires a bit of a trick to get the lid off (it's fine once you get used to it, however)<br />- focus cannot be adjusted while recording video, and the sound quality of the built-in speaker is comparable to a cheap child's toy<br />- some purple stripes appear on the LCD in certain lighting conditions during shooting (these do not appear in the final photo, however)<br />All this said, for the main reasons why I bought this camera, I haven't regretted the purchase. (But for sharing photos over the web, the single most aggravating point is the lack of a 800x600 photo resolution setting! Alas, that is what Photoshop is for...) The camera is simple enough to use, feels sturdy, takes photos that are of excellent quality, and the benefits of this camera far outweigh the disadvantages IMO. Although I'm no expert photographer, I feel like I have purchased a product that will satisfy my basic needs and my creative needs for years to come.","After all the years and all the digicams I've owned, borrowed and/or tested, I've come to believe that the Canons are the most reliable of the lot. While the \"A Series\" may be Canon's entry level lineup, they may also be their very best value. They are well built and sturdy enough, not too large to carry easily in a purse (and in fact a bit easier to grip than are the Elph models, therefore making them easier to hold steady), and they offer enough adjustable features for 99% of the digital photo takers whom I know. Happily, the A70 will also function nicely in the automatic mode for folks who just want to point and shoot.<br />The combination of an optical 3X zoom plus a 3 megapixel resolution is truly ideal, a place where I think most users will find their \"sweet spot\" in digicams. The 3X (true) optical zoom is powerful enough to make itself useful in many non-portrait settings (sightseeing, sports, etc.) and the 3 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for computer viewing and storage, emailing, website posting and for printing crystal clear enlargements up to 11\" x 14\". Of course, the A70 offers all the expected niceties, such as easy connectability to your PC, good battery options (including disposables and rechargeables) and an almost infinitely expandable memory. Then there is the price; certainly the A70 is competitive with all other 3X/3Meg cams. This is a good enough digicam that hardly anyone who gets one will likely be the least bit disappointed.","i want to buy a canon digital camera but having difficulty<br />arrangeing shipment to jersey uk can you help?","I am very pleased with this camera.  The image quality is vivid, even when enlarged.  The 3x optical zoom is a must.  The LCD screen is clear and bright.  I found the move-capture feature worked well, and playback was easy.  Overall I am impressed with this camera.  Only drawback is the somewhat cryptic LCD menu system, but even it's not that bad.","+ all the features I wanted and then some<br />+ easy to use point and shoot mode but other features to play with<br />+ a generation ahead of my last digital<br />+ burst mode is great for capturing a baby on the move<br />- I'm getting more blurry pictures than with my old Kodak<br />- the camera can turn off with the lens open if it runs out<br />  of batteries and each time I never saw any warning that I<br />  was running low","My Second Digital Camera, I just love it.I am not a professional but the pictures I take with this camera makes me look like a like a professional. The pictures I take are very sharp and no adjustments are needed when you download the pictures,unless you feel you have too. It's very easy to operate,just leave on AUTO if you want too,the batteries last a very long time,(keep a spair set)there is no battery use indication.Just a warning to change the batteries.I discover more and more operating features all the time. You just can't beat this camera. It's small,well balanced ,feels confortable also.Check this baby out! My last camera cost [a lot], but when I downloaded the picture's,I had to adjust every picture to make a decent print.","I've had this camera for about a month and I must say it has not dissapointed. If you are comparing costs though, I would include at least a couple of items you may find necessary. A set of rechargables and a higher capacity CF card. I have found the 3.2 MP number to be very acceptable even when printing larger formats. What this means is that when printing a full size 8.5X11 page, you'll get the same quality from this camera as a 5 Megapixel. The higher megapixels will only help if you are thinking of printing poster sizes. One thing I have not liked is the response time when taking pictures. If you really like to take action photos, this camera may not do the trick. When you snap a picture, you have to allow .5-1 sec for it to autofocus. I think you can get around this by disabling some of the auto-functions, but you need practice to get those shots right.","This camera offers all the manual controls you need, plus several preset shooting modes to simplify life, at a very cheap price!.  Because it uses 4 AA batteries instead of specialty expensive lithion-ion batteries, you can shop around for the cheapest recharble nimh's.  Also because it uses the Compact Flash card, these cards are readily the cheapest out there, and availble in large sizes, plus any multi card reader usually has the compact flash, because it's the most used card in electronics.  the camera itself is a bit bigger then u'd assume, but can fit funnily in most kahki pants pockets- jean wearers beware if u wear semi fit to tight jeans.<br />  The photos this camera takes can be quite exellent, although as with all digital photos, extra sharpening is advised(around 80%-100% i'v found is adequate).  Also purple fringing is very noticible in shorts with high contrast in light levels.. such as fireworks.  Colors are perfect matches, while it may seem like those kodak cameras can take better looking photos, it is because kodak uses a special algorithm to make the colors more saturated and whatnot, in other words, kodak manipulates the colors of images so they look better then real-life, whearas canon photos are 100% exact color matches nearly all the time.  ISO 50 to 400 are available , but once again i advise not to use higher then iso100 because images become significantly noisey with extreme film grain visibility.. \"iso\" is the light sensitivity of the camera to take brighter pics in lower light levels, but at the cost of grain and noise(grain and noise are pixels of unnaturual colors within the photograph, that cause the photo to look very \"digitally processed).<br />  The camera comes with a new digic proccessor which speeds up the focosing tremendously, and allows for faster operations in general.. for example the time it takes to turn the camera on is about 2-3 seconds, and the time the camera actually takes the picture after u press the shutter release button is unnoticeable. with about 2 seconds between single shot images, but u can also use drive mode, where u hold the shutter button and it can take about 10 pics at 2pictures per second. then u need to wait 6-10 seconds for the images to write to the memory card.<br />  The camera now has 5 focusing areas within the image, and the camera chooses the best ones to focus with, this may be quicker and easier some of the time, preferably i turn this off and just use the center box to focus so that i know what the camera will focus on myself.<br />  the ability to manually focus is very helpful, because u can set the focus to infinity for fireworks or landscapes without relying on the \"landscape\" preset mode, also it allows you to prefocus on a spot so u can take photos quicker for fast action events.<br />  Almost forgot a big detail-movie mode. this camera offers VGA resolutions of 640 by 480 pixels, at 15 frames per second. you can take up to 30seconds of video at a time with this resolution, or u can use lower resolutions for 3 minute video clips at a time.  personally i love this! i always use the larger resolution and end up filling my camera with more movie clips then photos at parties or special events!  the files are saved as .avi extentions  and can be played using most all movie players such as windows media player.  Also if u have windows xp, and have downloaded the windows movie maker 2, you can use this clips to make a pretty darn good short film to help you remember those special and fun events in life!<br />  This camera is a great find, and buy for the manual, preset, and auto modes it provides  along with canon's reputable brand name(canon by the way makes all the parts to their camera's themselves, in other words, canon owns all facilities used to make their cameras).  The photos this camera takes are great and may be printed without any need to enhance the images afterwords.. but it's advised to use an autoimage correction, and some sharpening and see if the picture looks beter afterwords.  And if the pictures u take look a little, dull in the colors, just use the \"vivid\" setting and make ur colors stick out more!<br />  ***recommendations:<br />  You need to buy at least 1 or 2 4 packs of AA rechargable Nimh batteries, with a charger.<br />  You'll want to buy a case of some sort for this camera,<br />  Buy a Compact Flash card! this is very serious! i would recommend transcend 32x cards or lexmark 32x and up cards. i use a 256mb card, and still find it's not enough space for all the video clips and photos i take!<br />  Take the time to buy a compact flash card reader for your computer while your at it, this allows faster write speeds from the card to your computer, and does not drain your camera's batteries.<br />  Invest in a microfiber cloth to clean your lense, if someone touches the lense(whenever i let someone hold my camera they end up pressing on the lense without knowing it, because they are used to larger film cameras!).  DO NOT USE GLASS CLEANER ON THE LENSE, OR AN ORDINARY CLOTH, glass cleaning solvent contains chemicals that can harm and damage the lense special chemical coatings, and an ordinary cloth scratches the lense even if u cant see the scratches by looking into the lense.  personally i find just buying a microfiber cloth and using ur breath's moisture enough to clean the lense, without needing to buy a special lense cleaning solvent.<br />  u may want to look at the sony dsc-p8 or p-72, the kodak dx6340, minolta dimage s404, or olympus d-560 zoom.","Basically my headline says it all.  I love this camera's ability to set f stops, shutter speeds,  ASA/ISO speeds,  under/over- exposure etc etc.  Particularly useful to me is the ISO 400 setting -- set the camera there you can take lots of pics indoors without a flash (like film cameras usibg hi speed film,  the images will be grainy,  but useable).<br />The main problem is the lens.  It performs overall less well than my 2 previous digital cameras (Fuji 2400 and 2800,  which regularly gave me tack sharp pictures).  This lens gives you OK shots,  but often without that extra edge of definition,  despite the high number of pixels.  There is a fair amount of flare at large apertures,  and the program modes like to keep the lens wide open and aim for higher shutter speeds. One workaround to this problem is to use the aperture proiority mode and to stop the lens down to f 4.5 or so.<br />I am keeping this camera because of all the creative control it gives me,  but I still have a Fuji 2400 in my desk drawer when I need to take a really sharp product photo for ebay.","This camera is a wonderful machine. Well priced and packed with features and capabilites. Small, light weight, and very versitle. Sound and picture quality are wonderful. video is awsome for such a small device. Takes some getting use too if used other digital cameras before. would not recomend this as a camera for kids as it could be fragile and is a little too expensive to be tossed around. but still a great deal. recomend getting lots of memmory cards or a few very large ones at least, you will need them for all the pictures and videos you will take.","This is the product I want to buy but my problem is that I am currently travelling in Latvia and need a camera as soon as possible. I will be spending a few days in Riga next week and want to know if it's possible to have the camera delivered to my hotel there.","This camera is the perfect compromise for my needs. It is compact yet easy to handle and the controls are in a logical layout and similar enough to my film camera that I don't fumble when switching.<br />It has full PHD Modes (push here dummey), yet gives me full manual control when I need it.<br />The resolution is adequate and the images I get don't make me wish that I had used film to record the image.<br />I now have a camera that goes with me all the time so I don't miss that shot of a lifetime.","I was really surprized..I returned my Canon A60 to get an A70 cos I really loved the results from the A60...and guess what the photos from the A60(2 MP) are 100 times better that the A70. The view finder too had dust particles inside it...<br /> One of the reasons may be that the A60 was made in Japan where as the A70 was made in Malasia...so try and grab an A70 (if u must) that is made in Japan:)","At the time this review is written, Powershot A70 is the best digital camera someone can get for this amount of money. After doing some research, by comparing to other digital cameras at the same price, the choice was easy . A70 outstands them all. The image quality is very good for 3.2 mpixels, the manual mode is excellent for such a cheap camera, and it is possible to use extra lenses from Canon. The only problem is the Red eye effect which is quite intense with this camera. This is not very important of course because it can be corrected with the use of software. Another drawback is the use of 4 batteries, where other 3.2 mpixel cameras use 2 batteries. Last but not least the flashcard included is way too small and the purchase of a bigger one is mandatory.<br />In a few words :<br />Pros : good quality, excellent manual mode, excellent video mode<br />Cons: Intense redeye, small flashcard, 4 batteries required.<br />I highly recommend this one, it's a great buy.","Im a novice with digital cameras and this is actually my first one. It is sooo cool. so many excellent features!! and it is pretty easy to navigate too. Buy it!","Hi,<br />I Desgin Web sites and do graphic design for a living. For the past few years, I have been using my high resolution scanner to get film images onto my computer and then upload them to my web server. But within the last month I have been using Canon's Powershot A70 to reduce work time.<br />But I did not only purchase the Dig Camera for Web site building...(seeing as how you probably don't need anything more than 2.0 Mega Pixels for viewing images on a computer only). But since our old SLR camera broke (dropped it and never worked since), I wanted something to get good prints as well.<br />Well, judging by the reviews, I figured I shouldn't write something without doing my homework as well. Also, I didn't want to write this after using the camera for one day. So I gave myself quite some time to play with it to give this review more detail.<br />I would love to make a PRO vs. CON list, but to be quite honest, I haven't found any CONS.<br />So, For the Features this camera has, the quality of the name and the lens, and the price you pay, you couldn't find a better camera anywhere.<br />It has a great 3.0 Optical zoom, with a combined digital zoom, you can get up to 10X focus.<br />It's the perfect point and shoot, but doesn't limit itself to beginners only as it has several (12) shooting modes...plus a manual mode where you can change the shutter speeds and aperature level.<br />With the movie mode (which includes sound) you can choose three levels, which also includes the 640x400 AGP mode. I recommend trying out that setting and burning your videos on a CD and watching them on your DVD player. (pretty cool)<br />The Digital zoom is hardly noticeable at all when I used the \"Super Fine\" setting....and that was at Max zoom.<br />It has an easy to use panorama function where you can take 360 degree panorama shots. It also has a fairly simple stitch program in the software bundle to automatically put together your panorama shots into one using artificial intelligence...bla bla bla stuff.<br />I agree that the 16M FC is barely sufficient if you want to take plenty of pictures. I would also recommend getting a card between 128 - 512...just as a suggestion...but that has nothing to do with the camera itself.<br />Other than that, The camera is perfect, the quality of canon images are awesome, and battery life lasts quite a sufficient amount of time. Although I will always recommend that you get rechargables, not because the camera sucks up the juice (because it doesn't), but rechargable batteries are better for the environment. To give you an idea of how long the batteries last, I used the camera for about three straight days of constant picture shooting, movie making and lots of uploading to the computer. Overall I took about 600 shots (with a variety of different quality), and about 12 minutes messing around in moving mode...and the batteries finally started to give...<br />so, battery life is exceptional.<br />and that's about all I have to say","In case a fellow pro is reading these reviews, I would heartily recommend the A70 as a back-up. It resembles the Olympus XA that so many of us loved in the past.<br />I am writing this because the strong points of this camera are not easy to spot from the material aimed at the amateur market.<br />1. I can use the same cards as with my G3, which is my official travel camera (I am also a writer, so no SLR's for me, thank you). I can just switch the card from camera to camera and download material any which way. This might work with the SLR's, too, but I haven't tried.<br />2. The picture quality at ISO 50 is actually quite usable, at least in a tabloid. At first look it is difficult to tell it apart from G3. Don't crop, though. The other ISO's have massive noise, but I use them anyway in special situations.<br />3. The wideangle add-on lens is no Summicron, but it is passable and very small. I have both the A70 and the wide tucked in the corners of my minuscule bag, so in case of a catastrophe, I still have a 24-105 mm camera to work with.<br />4. The waterproof case is a marvel. ... Okay, it is not a Nikonos, but it is a small, lightweight thing that gives me the option of taking splashy pictures on the go.<br />5. Then there are the obvious advantages: AA/Nimh batteries, tv/av/manual modes, single-point and manual focusing and other normal Canon stuff.<br />The disadvantages are naturally enormous from the professional point of view, but we are talking back-up here.<br />The competition is surprisingly scarce. First I gravitated towards the S50, but it has several shortcomings. No wideangle, no AA batteries and non-pocketable size. It doesn't support a proper flash any more than the A70. What's the use of having better resolution, if the camera is not in your pocket/the battery is dead in Ouagadougou/the shot calls for a wide perspective? Don't know about you, but I use 35 mm for shooting official state buildings, and not much else.<br />The Elph/Ixus-series is a lot worse. Sure, they feel better and are a couple of millimeters smaller, but they are hopelessly tyroesque.<br />If there are more options, I haven't found them. Please, correct me if you have better knowledge.<br />So the A70+wideangle+waterproof case gives me a rather complete emergency gear in a truly portable package. And, yes, I have indeed fallen in love, so I'm carrying the thing everywhere in my vestpocket.","Pros: Broad feature set for the money; speedy and efficient performance; accepts accessory lenses.<br />Cons: Flimsy-feeling CompactFlash compartment cover; distracting reflective frame around LCD.<br />I bought this camera because I needed a digital camera that had a good set of features without breaking the bank. This one fit the bill perfectly. Not only is Canon known for its reliable cameras, and this camera is no exception. While there are cameras out there with more features, nothing comes close to the features/value combo that this camera delivers. The pictures take so far have been great. There has been a bit of purple friging when taking high contrast photos, but I read many other types of review and knew about that. This is no big deal, however, becasue comparable camera in this feature range also suffer this problem. If this is an issue for you then don't buy this camera. Pony up and spend some more money in order to eliminate that problem. The software suite included with this camera is also decent. All in all I would say to those of you that are considering this camera to go out and buy it without hesitation. Good quality, good price, and good pictures will make you a happy photographer.","There were two things that really turned my head about this camera.  The first was it's use of Compactflash memory.  This memory is highly available, available in large storage sizes (512 megs, 1gig, etc) quite affordable, and can easily be used as a usb drive on nearly any computer system with an adapter.<br />The second feature that intrigued me was their use of standard batteries.  I've had camera's before used expensive disposable lithium batteries (upwards of $15 a piece)...and if your on vacation, it can be a pain to try and find something to bring your camera back to life instead of working on a suntan.  Even though I've been using recharchable NimH batteries in this camera since I've had it it is very nice to know that I should be able to find spare batteries for it almost anywhere if I'm in a pinch.<br />Now that I've had the camera, I can say that I am very impressed:  It fits well in the hand, is simple to use, is feature rich, and has enough interactive feedback available on the display to help you get great shots even in tricky situations.<br />This is a nicely featured camera at a great price - and the standards they've chosen have created a low cost of ownership.","This is my first digital camera purchase, so I did a lot of research to find the best camera for [the price].  I can say with certainty that this camera fits the bill!  It is 3.2 Megapixels, which some may not feel is enough, but unless you are going to print out photos larger than 8x10 I don't see any reason you would need a higher resolution.  In fact, most of the pictures we take aren't even at the highest resolution possible.<br />The 16MB CompactFlash card that comes with this camera is way too small.  Look at getting at the very least a 128 MB card, or even a 256MB or 512MB card.<br />I don't have any complaints about this camera.  In dark situations, the LCD becomes very grainy, but the pictures you take look great.  Red eye reduction works wonders as I have yet to see any red eyes from pictures I've taken.  In the sun, the LCD similarly gets sun circles, but those are not apparent in the final image when you take a picture.  The shiny chrome finish around the LCD is a little hard to deal with in the sun, but it's easy enough to get used to.<br />I highly recommend this camera.  It's geared toward the point-and-shoot consumer, but it has settings and the ability to add attachments for the more avid photographer.","After many hours of research I am happy to review the Canon A70 Powershot.  My first and probably only digital camera for a long time.<br />Easy to use, simple to learn, and compact.<br />I don't mind the 4 AA batteries.  I bought \"good\" recharable and have taken about 100 photos and a video on the first set with no end in sight yet.<br />The camera has many \"bells and whistles\" but not that many buttons and settings to use them.  Tricky.<br />The autofocus takes about 20 pictures to get used to, but then it is a worthy attribute.<br />I love the stitch command.  When you're standing in front of scenery that is 4 or 5 pictures long, the downloading software will \"Stitch\" them together into one long picture...very cool.<br />The camera is small but not too small.  The camera comes with all the downloading software you need and works with all the \"photoshop\" software that my Dell computer already came with.<br />The user manuals are useful, and not totally technical geeky.<br />Trust me, 3.2 Mpix is just fine.  The only reason to get 5.0 Mpix or higher is if you're making posters or just want to say \"it's a 5.0 Mpix\".  My opinion is don't waste your money, just get this camera.  It'll do everything and anything that \"joe-shmoe\" picture taker needs.<br />The only bummer, is the 16bit (or whatever the measurement is) card that the camera comes with.  It only holds about 25 pics or maybe 30 to 45 seconds of video.  I'm checking for a 128 or 256 card that will hold more pics than I know what to do with (download them and take more).  They make a 516 but again, do I need all that or do I just need to say \"it's a 516 card\".<br />Don't worry, the card is like a floppy disk.  It just clicks in and out.  BUT BEWARE, my friends told me if you take the cards in and out constantly you run the risk of bending or tweeking the tiny connector pins in the camera that connect the card to the camera.  If you do this...time to buy another camera.  This goes for all digital cameras so I'm getting a bigger card for $$$ to $$$ bucks and will never take the card out again (just download them, erase them, and keep on shooting).<br />Which come to think of it...you know those Windows Media Player videos all your friends send you at work...this camera takes those.  The software downloads it as a WMP video and then asks, \"want to e-mail this?\"...heck ya, this is fun.<br />Word to the wise...if you plan on taking action photos of fast moving/fast action sports or activities you might want to research more expensive digital cameras that can take 3 or 5 frames per second.  This camera can do it but not every picture may be in focus as the \"shoot\" button focus' the shot when pressed half way down, lets you know it's in focus, and then you press all the way down and it shoots.  If you just shoot away it focus' as best it can and takes the shot.<br />The camera does not come with a little camera bag, but hey, most of the little bags provided with electronic stuff is lame anyway.  It does come with a cord to hold it, but I didn't put it on.<br />Lastly...NO LENS COVER...totally cool, it has it's own that opens and closes when you turn it on and off.  Nothing to lose and no \"uh duh take the lens cap off\" moments.<br />Hope this has been useful.  A very worthy purchase.  ....","Great little camera. A ton of features for the price.  Easy to use features for someone who has not owned a digital camera before, but also more advanced features for those of us who have been using digital cameras for a while.  The movie clips and pictures come out great.  Even with the little microphone on the camera, the sound is impressive.  The option to add macro and telephoto lenses is a plus.  I plan on doing do.  Definately a lot of bang for your buck.","I purchased the A70 after some intensive reviewing of the current cameras in this low to mid-range price catagory.<br />I had narrowed my choices down to two canidates the A70 and the Nikon 3100. With the Nikon I really liked the sample pictures I saw taken with it and its recessed LCD screen, but it lacked the plethora of features the Canon came with.<br />Post Purchase...<br />I could not be more happy with it! It takes super clear/sharp pictures (Just as good as the Nikon samples I saw).<br />The non-recessed LCD screen is not that serious a problem with normal/thoughtful handling.<br />The extra features and the complete manual control the canon offers really makes for a fun camera someone can grow with.<br />Its size is perfect-fits right in the palm of your hand.<br />And the images download easily via the USB port into the computer.<br />Oh, did mention it takes great pictures?<br />I had debated a long time on which camera to purchase, and need not have worried. The Canon A70 is a bargain.","I just received my A70 today and within 5 minutes I was taking shots and recording video clips!  The shots I have taken are much better that I expected.  This little camera is great.  It's size is not too bulky to carry around, but not so small that you feel like you are going to loose it.  I can't comment on the durability of this camera, becuase I haven't had it very long.  I can only hope for the best, but so far I am not disappointed!","Excellent camera. Everything is great about it: very good optics; intelligent software for focusing, flashing, aperture and time; very good resolution, intuitive system of menus and user-friendly software for downloading images or films (yes, films!) to your computer.<br />You should order at least one 128MB card and a set of recharchable batteries.","I have a Canon A40 and have tried out the A70 and compared the pictures and operation. Image quality of the A70 doesn't match the A40. Sure, the resolution is better but not as detailed as expected compared to the A40. Also, the pictures in general show noticeable noise in the shadow areas (something not seen on the A40 and easy to see once you know what to look for) and are soft focused. Post processing can help but this camera should have offered a sharper focus setting. Colour is though generally faithful and the A70 has a slightly wider dynamic (contrast) range than the A40. But the crispness of the image is lacking. Landscapes show smeared detail and I have seen a published shot where there is a smeared area in the middle of the picture - a similar problem that I had on the A40. Purple fringing is not a general problem except against bright sky near the edges of the picture. Redeye in flash pictures remains a problem and the AF assist light in dark areas remains useless. The manual focus is therefore a useful improvement but not quick to use and difficult to judge in the dark. Overall, this could have been a brilliant camera if the focus, noise factor and anti-redeye system had been managed better.<br />Extra features such as accessory lens ability is not worth much as the cost of these accessories is ridiculous compared to the camera. Better to buy a SLR or a good 4mp camera in the first place!","To me, those gripes are for 5MP cameras or higher.  Soft-focus in the A70 is barely noticeble if at all.  This is still considered a entry-level camera guys, so if you're a professional photographer than you're really short of money or you stink.  Believe me I tried every brand 3MP camera out there, even bought and returned a couple (at places w/o restocking fee), and Canon A70 far outbeats them except for a few higher-priced, metal case, 3MP Canon models.  To me in addition to the great indoor/outdoor picture quality, the biggest asset is the longetivity of the battery life.  I bought 4 rechargeable 4 NiMH batteries (no-brand) and they lasted 4 days on vacation.  Are you kidding me, there's digital cameras out there that need a life support system just to last a couple of hours.<br />For those who think this has blurriness, try the Olympus 560 model.  That'll make you think twice before complaining of blurriness.<br />Heaviness of the camera, focusing delay, and the other gripes I hear are so typical of the many who try only one camera and never did research at other brands at the same level.  That means every little minor issue w/ the camera is magnified 100x if there's nothing to compare to.<br />But don't take my opinion for it.  Read all the professional reviews, ask every salesman, and try out as many 3MP cameras you can.  To me this is the best priced, quality 3MP out there.","I bought this camera 20 days ago from amazon.com for slightly more than the current price and have taken about 500 pics with it already in all lighting conditions and have been happy with the results. I love taking closeups of my daughter and Canon offers 12 modes in all including a closeup potrait mode which is very useful. I am quite happy with this camera as it offers manual control along with the usual Canon features and it is easy to create some special effects. I am just learning photography and this camera has a great price with good features for this purpose.<br />The software is easy to use and if you have Windows XP it downloads the images through the scanner and camera wizard even if you dont wan't to use the software that comes with the camera. I have used the photostich software the most which is quite easy to use, and took some great pictures with it. The image and video software is also quite easy to use and gives good results.<br />The only drawback to me was that this camera is not as small as the ELPH series and I have to carry it in my handbag instead of my pocket to avoid creating an ugly bulge. But it is still small enough to whip it out quickly and take shots. ...<br />Update after 6 months, Oct 2003:<br />For the price and the features this camera is still hard to beat. I still maintain my opinion above after taking about 2500 photographs. This camera has been tested to have the greatest number of shots from the 4AA batteries it uses. And I usually am able to take anywhere between 350-500 pictures with one set of rechargaeable Ni-MH batteries. I have used the sepia tones in the special effects to take some very special pics and many landscapes with the photostitch software.<br />The full manual controls for this price is a good deal and I have been happy playing the rookie photographer. If you just want to point and shoot you probably do not need the features on this camera and you can go in for lighter versions, but if you want to be a little creative its a cheap first camera to have which lets you play around with different modes and manual controls. The movie mode is quite good too and with a larger memory Compact Flash card you can make respectable clips to send off to your friends.<br />The only small complaints I have are that there is a time lag between when you press the button to when the picture gets taken and its hard to take action shots. But this is a feature of all Canon digital and film cameras and if you have used one you know what I am talking about. The other problem is that sometimes the Autofocus does not give as good pictures as my Canon 35mm film camera - Powershot used to give. But at these times I am glad that I can set the white balance manually!","I consider myself a knowledgeable amateur and I wanted a digital camera that would let me manipulate shutter speed, aperture, etc.  The A70 has these features and will accept other lenses (wide angle, telephoto, macro) if you decide to expand later on.  It's also suitable for novices who think they might want to experiment later.<br />The menu structure is easy to navigate through.  I love the speed at which the camera powers up and takes shots.  As with any digital, there is a lag, but it's minimal.  The thick instruction manual is a little daunting at first, but the Quick Start guide gets you going quickly.  Do read the manual, though, because it would be a shame not to learn all the tricks this pup can do, such as stitching together panoramic shots.  The autofocus works well, and even though it sometimes reports trouble getting a fix in low light, it almost always delivers a satisfactory focus.  Manual focusing is easy to do, if you decide to resort to it.  The macro mode picks up stunning detail on the highest resolution setting.  The LCD screen is tiny, but it has high resolution and crams a wealth of status and mode information into the space it has.<br />I got about 4 hours of shooting time out of the supplied alkaline batteries the camera came with.  You'll definitely want to get a set of NiMH rechargeables, but it's nice to know that alkalines will keep you shooting in a pinch.  The camera's structure seems pretty robust, although the plastic lens over the LCD screen is probably not scratch-proof.  Buy a case.  The bundled software is excellent, too.  I've deleted all the other photo software on my computer and now I just use Canon's.<br />My biggest complaint is the power-saving feature, which shuts the camera down a little too soon for my taste.  It would be nice if you could set the power-off time to whatever length you want.  Also, it's a little hard to remember what the two LEDs next to the viewfinder are telling you.  There's no brightness control on the LCD screen, so it can be a little hard to see in bright sunlight, but you can always fall back on the optical viewfinder.<br />If you just want a point-and-shoot camera, the A70's full list of capabilities may not excite you, but you'll still appreciate the high 3 megapixel resolution.  If you're an advanced amateur who occasionally likes to pretend you're a pro, to my knowledge, the A70's advanced features can't be beat at this price.","This is my first digital camera and I like it alot.  It is simple to operate and takes very good pictures.  The bundled software is also vey easy to use.  The red eye levels are very high on this camera which should be expected because of how close the lens is to the flash.  The macro mode works very well and I especially enjoy the movie mode which takes some very nice avi movies.  It would be nice if you could adjust settings in the movie mode on the fly but the camera does not allow for it.  Regardless, this is a terrific camera, do yourself a favor and pick it up along with a nice big memory card to capture all those great memories.","Really 4.5 stars.  The only bad thing is that some of the pictures have looked blurry  or soft (but you can just delete them and take them again.)and the LCD screen has looked fuzzy a few times.<br />All the good stuff overshadows that, though.  The camera has preformed very well in the inside(bright and dark rooms.  Dark are excellent.), outside, and in dark outside scenes.  I took 6 pictures the lunar eclipse last night and they are all crystal clear.<br />It powers up very quickly and the menus are easy to navigate. The digital zoom is very useful in far away subjects.  There is no delay if you focus first by pushing the 'shoot button' halfway down.<br />I spent 3 months comparing and looking at digital cameras and I finally chose this one.  I am extremely pleased.  I hope you will choose this one too- you won't be dissapointed!","I bought a Powershot A70 from a Gateway Country store and have no complaints about it.  This camera takes excellent photos and has more features than you will probably ever use but its nice to have them.  And even though this camera has a lot of features it is very simple to take photos with. I also enjoy the movie feature mode that allows you to take up to 3 minutes of video with sound. (Although you will have to buy a 256 MB memory card if you want to record 3 minutes worth, I purchased a 128 MB card extra and between the 16 MB card that comes with it and the extra one I bought I will never need more memory.) The software that comes with the camera makes downloading photos from the camera very easy.  Also I found the AV cables to be rather handy.  They allow you to plug your camera into your TV or VCR and view the photos from your camera on your TV in full screen. And there are other accessories that are available for this camera that you can purchase such as a wide angle lens, lens for greater optical zoom,  a waterproof case that will allow you to take you camera underwater! For all the features you get with this camera I don't think you will find another camera that can compare to this one in the price range.","I owned a Kodak 3700 for some time before my brother took it, so I agonized and researched all the digital cameras I could afford before I bought this... the competition was the Fuji 3800 and maybe the Nikon Coolpix. The 6x zoom of the 3800 was the best part, but its problems reported in low-light photography pushed me to this Canon A70, and boy, am I glad!...Lemme count the ways I love it :<br /> 1. [nice] Shape and size. I take it out, and it automatically attracts attention. And it weighs right, and snuggles neatly into my right hand because of the small 'bump' on the right side. ( But I wonder how comfortable lefties would be with this; it might get in their way). And the size is optimal - while I hated the elph's tiny size, the bulkier dig cameras would not fit my docker pants, like the A70 does; and if I leave out the case, it even fits my formal-suit pocket without a bulge.<br /> 2.The LCD screen functions as good as gold in low light, back-light, whatever-light. I should know, I played around with a friend's 3800 and found it a challenge to shoot indoors.<br /> 3.The picture quality is as good as I expected for a 3.2mp; someday I might be able to shell out [big money] and buy a 5mp, but then, maybe not : the biggest print I would want would be the occasional 8x10, while 4x6 would be regular, and for that 3.2MP is good enough.<br /> 4.The time-lag from the button-press-to-shutter-snap is about half-a-second, noticeable but not irritating. I know this exists for all digital cameras, so I have grown to work around this by planning the picture. This means I cannot snap a 2 year old running across the room, but I could always capture an endearing grin while seated!<br /> 5.So many modes...! This one is bewildering in the options it gives the user; it even allows you to make it 'fully manual', which would mean you set the aperture, the shutter speed and everthing else. I am not there yet, but this is where I can experiment and learn a bit...;-)<br /> 6.Stich mode. This needs special mention. You put the A70 in this mode, and take a series of pics by panning the camera horizontally, and voila, you end up with a fantastic panoramic shot of your room (or a single family photo at a huge family gathering). I am no specialist (as you can tell), but the software took care of the lack of precision in my hands and 'stiched' the photos together seamlessly! I can think of dozens of situations I can use this. I need to re-visit the Grand Canyon now!<br /> 7.I tried out the video mode and found it pretty nice, though unnecessary in a digital camera; what's the camcorder for...?<br /> 8.The software provided is awesome. I rarely depend on bundled software with any gadget, but Canon has persuaded me that they must have a great software division. Not very bulky, and extremely useful and bugfree.<br /> 9.Lastly, the optional accessories are also great : the A70 allows a lens adaptor which means you could attach other lenses you want; and there is also an 'underwater-case' which would allow you to shoot inside the swimming pool. As soon as I get some money to splurge I am getting that, just for the experience!<br /> The wish-it-was-better list :<br /> 1. The 3x zoom. I wish Canon had an A80 (or whatever) with at least 6x zoom. Would have been worth the price.<br /> 2. Red-eye reduction. I managed a bunch of great frontal portrait pics without red-eye, but once in a while it does fail, as reported by many others. I am told the design of the camera needs to change before it becomes fool-proof (the flash should be at a distance from the lens).<br /> 3. I never bothered using the bundled AA batteries; just bought rechargeable NiMH; What was Canon thinking, non-rechargeables with a digital camera?! Maybe they should not even bother with batteries, and reduce cost by some $ ;-)<br /> 4. Similarly, the 16MB Compact Flash is too small; I bought a 128MB rightaway which allows me 135 pics in Superfine, highest resolution mode.<br /> 5. I am also told that the memory usable (Compact Flash Type I) is slow and outdated. It should be at least Type II, if not a totally different and faster type. For now I am fine with the small time-lag.<br />To Summarize, go ahead and buy this. You will enjoy shooting pictures with it!!!","Pro's<br />1. Excellent features like 3MP, Video out, AA batteries, movie w/sound etc.<br />2. Very competitively priced.<br />3. Manual features like long shutter and shutter/aperture priority mode.<br />4. Superb battery life, works even on normal alkaline AA's.<br />5.Uses standard & inexpensive CF card. (not stick or xd card).<br />6.Good LCD screen, very good ergonomics.<br />Con's<br />1. Its effectively 2 inches thick not 1.3, when you consider the battery compartment size.<br />2. Not pocketable, very heavy with 4 AA batteries and thick. (Canon didn't use just 2 AA's probably to protect their Elph line.)<br />3. AF assist is just a gimmick, doesn't help camera focus better. The weak beam reaches only a few feet.<br />4. Soft images and lot of time needed to auto-focus & also shutter lag.<br />5. Build quality and reliability isn't as good as Elph's (Elph's are made in Japan in Canon factories unlike A70/A60 which are outsourced).<br />In short, if you want manual features and can live with its weight/size then this is the best 3MP for your money. If size/pocketability/reliability is more imp than manual features then Elph series is much better.","Canon A70 is my third digital camera experience following Fuji and Olympus 2MP models. Most Canon cameras have received nothing but praise, and I bought this one with rather high expectations. Outdoor shots in bright sunlight do not produce the sharpness and color saturation I expected based on my experience with Fuji. If you are planning to take lots of nature photos including trees and shrubbery, perhaps A70 will not be the best choice. Soft focus is very apparent with tree leaves. However, in low light and contrasting light situations, the camera produces excellent shots of people that are even better than the photos I took with my Canon SLR. It will certainly produce the 'wow' you are hoping for. Red eye in flash photos were not a major problem. Besides, the plethora of manual controls not found in any digital camera of its class will please anybody who would like to experiment. Again, the menu system were not as straight-forward as I expected.<br />The best thing before buying a digital camera is to go the review sites and see the pictures for yourself. I particularly like the comparometer in imaging-resource.com that will display the same picture side by side on the screen taken by two cameras for your judgement. Unlike Canon A40 and the ELPH series, price of the A70 has dropped markedly soon after the debut. Does it tell us something? In my view, Canon S400 probably takes slightly sharper and saturated pictures, but apart from the higher price, it has its own limitations like lack of high-res movie mode, lack of extensive manual control, use of special batteries, etc. I find Canon A70 to perform the best all-around in its price range.","Let me get the negatives out of the way first. This camera does have a soft focus, and that can be a problem if you are a precise focuser. About 90% of the time the autofocus picks up what the center of attention should be, but for the other 10% of the time learn to use the manual focus. If you're taking family snapshots, you'll be fine, so long as they're not moving too fast. This leads to the other issue: there's a slight delay (1/2 sec at the highest photo settings) when you take a shot. Most of the time, it's not noticable, but if you're trying to take action shots with precise shutter timing, it'll take some practice. The delay is much, much better than some of the waits I've experienced on older cameras -- sometimes it was a full second or more.<br />More to the point, if you're a photo perfectionist, then why are you buying a 3MP digital camera in the first place? You should save your money and buy a digital SLR where you don't have the limitations that come with cameras in this range.<br />All that said... you can have my camera when you pull it from my cold, dead fingers. I've had experience with a number of digital cameras, and I've never had one that actually makes me look like a good photographer. The A70 is a great fully automatic camera, but its manual settings make it the \"missing link\" between the entry-level and SLR models. I've never seen a $...camera that gives you this much control over your shots -- shutter speed, aperture, focus, white balance, film speed, and exposure are all under your control in program mode. There are a number of presets (e.g. fast shutter, variable aperture and time, and a few more I can't remember right now) that allow you to take control of only the settings you want to control. You can also attach proprietary lenses (with a sold-seperately attachment ring), adding still more flexibility. And, while it does have a learning curve, you can take great shots straight out of the box -- something I couldn't say for some of the earlier digital camera models I've used. If you're looking for a camera that gives you manual control, but you're not rich enough or ready to go for the high-end digi SLRs, give a long look at the Canon A70.<br />Two other things I should mention. One, it does take 4 AA batteries, but this is a good thing IMO, since it means longer operational time for the camera. Pick up a couple sets of NiMH batteries and a charger. I took the A70 on a four hour hike and one set of fully charged NiMH cells. Never lost operation of the camera. (I didn't keep it on the whole time, but I've used digital cameras in the past that would have petered out an hour in, even with limited operation.) Two, get at least one (preferably two) 128MB or larger Compact Flash cards. The camera will fit 76 large format, super high quality images on one 128MB card.","just determine your needs well. This camera satisfied our needs. It has some manual functionality like full manual, aperture priority, shutter priority, and it is fully automatic too. I don't use the movie capturing feature but it may be of help for some people. Image quality is great even using less resolution. another great functionality is the stitch which allows you to create panoramic pictures by shooting more than 1 pictures and then stitch them. I am thinking of getting the water proof case which will make this little camera work under water too.<br />One thing that i did not like is it uses 4 AA batteries I know some digital cameras of this size do work with just 2. But anyway that's not a big deal after all. It still gets 5 stars.","I love this camera! I purchased this one after returning a Sipix 3300 camera. I did a lot of research on digital cameras before making this purchase and I don't regret it for a minute. This camera is simple to use and it doesn't eat through batteries like the Sipix. The LCD screen is clear and I can even see it in the sunlight. The instructions are easy to understand too. I haven't used the software the camera came with yet.","First off, let me tell you that I researched the heck out of digital cameras before buying this one.  I read some of the disappointment reviews which made me hesitate....DON'T!  I put months into my decision and for the price, this camera is by far the best out there!  I PROMISE you will love it.  Here are just a few points I want to make.<br />First:<br />You are getting a Canon lens with this camera.  I would rather have a 1 MP Canon camera (my SLR is Canon and I have never been let down) than a 4 MP of many other brands.  The quality you get with the Canon name alone is worth it.<br />Second:<br />This camera is VERY user friendly if you take the TIME to figure it out.  As for the person complaining about the slow shutter speed, if they took the time to understand their camera they would have realized that the button has two features.  Your not supposed to just snap the picture.  You push the button half way to focus (which gets you a great picture), once the camera focuses for you it will beep so that you know its ok to take the picture.  Thats way you tell everyone to say cheese!  The shutter opens immediately upon taking the picture.  If you do not take that two step approach, the camera does a quick focus (which usually is not accurate) and then the shutter opens (hence the few second delay)<br />Third: The person complaining about the software conflicts....it has nothing to due with camera...those are just the brakes of computers...sometimes there is a glitch....the camera is still amazing!<br />Do not hesitate!  Its small, its user friendly, its a Canon, its worth every penny!","We were looking at a slightly less [costly] 3 megapixel digital camera when the sales guy told us about the Canon.  We are SO glad we got the Canon.  This camera takes terrific photographs, is easy to use and is rich with features. I haven't seen in any other digital camera at this price range with these features and we've been researching for months.  I'm looking forward to learning more about the manual modes and seeing the results in our photographs.<br />My mother has a Samsung 3 megapixel camera which is much slower and I think our picture quality is much better.  We're just THRILLED with the results.<br />I also love the short movie clips and was able to put together a short movie clip with stills and the video.  I think we'll be looking to upgrade the included software but it worked well for starters.","This camera takes excellent pictures and movies.  When I was reviewing cameras to pick one to buy, I read that this camera was nearly perfect in design and manufacturing but had \"soft focus\" and \"purple fringing\" problems.  I have seen no soft focus problem at all.  As for purple fringing, it has appeared in only three of the 600 pictures I've taken so far.  In those pictures, it was because the subject in the foreground was dark, the background was very bright, and I had the flash turned off.  When I turned on the flash, there purple fringing disappeared.  I highly recommend this camera!","This camera is amazing!  YOu can choose the quality and size of your pictures from the LCD  screen, with Superfine quality mode you can take a decent amount of pics but in normal you can take at least 2 to 3x as many.<br />I reccomend buying a 512 mb compact flash card.  This way you can do some video to.<br />The video quality is good at the highest resolution but it doesn't replace a *real* video camera.  However if you are someone who likes to just have some video in a small device and doesn't want the most incredible quality this camera is for you.  I originally bought this for skiing so I could video during ski trips. I really like the pictures quality as well.  The camera is very user friendly.  The only thing I am a little angry with is the red eye reduction lense.  It isn't as reliable as I would like it to be, but once you get it set to the different modes it works fine I guess, but still it is confusing.  Very small efficient and cool!  A+ Camera, buy it!","Let me start with the picture quality. It is great! Movie has bigger size than the other cameras (with sound too!). Wider variety of white balance, a lot of features like Canon SLR cameras, and the most important thing is the manual capability.<br />It has AF focusing light, and it uses AA battery so we can use AA rechargeable (cheap in the long run, and you can always use regular one when you really need fresh battery). I hate proprietary batteries, so AA battery is a big plus.<br />The size is perfect. It is smaller than Canon A40, but bigger than S-series or Elph. Smallish camera looks fun and easy to bring, but you will hate to use it. This one is just perfect.<br />Macro capability gives high quality pictures, and night scene features is also great. One more thing, it accept 52mm filter with additional adapter. I have a lot of filters for my SLR, so this feature will give you unlimited opportunity to explore photography world. I did my research for weeks before I chose this camera, and I am very grateful to finally choose this.","This camera prodcues incredible pictures, and is a great compact size.  The wide selection of available manual settings is almost unheard of for a camera in this price range, and the preset picture modes provide for a wide range of shooting options.  The movie mode adds some extra fun into those special moments.<br />Two comments in response to a previous reviewer:<br />ALL digital cameras less than eleven megapixels are lower resolution than 35mm cameras.  However, unless you make prints over 8x10 inches, you'll never notice the difference with a 3.2mp camera.  Finally, the lag time is due to the autofocus.  An inexpensive point-and-shoot uses fixed focus (which produces a blurrier image, especially at close range), and therefore has no lag time.  In fact, the lag time on this camera is much quicker (and therefore better) than other digital cameras I have used.","After doing much research on 3MP digital cameras, I decided on Canon A70, and so far I am very pleased with this camera. This camera can take nice outdoor shots, indoor (low light) shots as well as above average night shots. This camera has a fast 35-110mm lens (f/2.8-f/4.8). Please note that many digital cameras out there have 38-39mm lens, which I find a bit limiting, when it comes to capturing scenes/landscapes. This camera has a nice movie mode and offers a variety of modes ranging from fully auto, programmed auto, shutter/aperture priority and full manual control. Also, it is quite user-friendly. In a nutshell this camera is capable of surprising you with its rich feature-set. ... The pictures that I took from this camera came out very nice and sharp. I took some indoor shots - in low light - without flash and they came out very nice and with acceptable level of noise. Minor irritation - this camera doesn't allow setting the white balance in the \"full Auto\" mode as sometimes I just want to change white balance and let the camera take care of rest of the parameters. However, you can fallback on the programmed auto mode, where camera picks shutter speed and aperture, and you pick the rest. Overall, I highly recommend this camera and it is an excellent choice for beginners and enthusiasts alike.","A great camera.  The quality of the shots is excellent.  My last digital camera (Fuji 2600) took nice outdoor shots, but indoor shot had funny colors and the flash was not strong at all.  The indoor pictures on this camera are really nice.  The size in comfortable to hold and I can put it in my jeans pocket.  Also, once you get used to the menu system, it's really easy to use and navigate to quickly switch between functions.<br />For the price I highly recommend.<br />You must buy a larger Compact Flash card.","I received my Canon A70 about a week ago in the mail.  This is my second digital camera- my first being an old Olympus D360-L point and shooter.  Thus far, I love my new camera!  I can go on and on about it, but I'll try to summarize what I like and don't quite like about it.<br />Likes<br />1. Lots of manual controls - shutter speed, real manual focus, white balance<br />2. Great pre-sets - these let me take great pictures for certain pre-set environments (fast action, portrait, panoramic, slow shutter, etc...)  Easily accessible on dial at the top of camera<br />3. Nice size - not too small and light, so my twitchy hands don't mess it up too much, but not bulky like some of the other cameras with manual controls<br />4. Battery life - I still have not run out of a charge, during a day or two's use.  (Note: I use 1600 mA LiMH batteries and charge them after every day or two)<br />5. Sharp screen - hi-resolution screen, though not terribly bright in direct sunlight<br />6. Great looking pictures!<br />7. Video mode, with sound up to 640x480 for 30 secs, and lower resolutions for much longer.<br />8. Looks great!<br />9. Able to fit additional lenses as well as waterproof housing (Not that I'm planning on getting these yet, but its nice to know I have the choice to!)<br />Not Likes:<br />1. Takes a bit of time for the zoom lens to extend when turning the camera on.<br />2. Plastic tripod mount<br />I've printed my cropped 8x10\" photos out on my Canon S600 printer on glossy paper and they look awesome!<br />Anyways, I really like this thing a lot, so I heartily recommend this to people who are looking for a point-and-shoot, as well as those who are trying to learn to dabble a little bit more with their camera's manual controls (like myself!)","As some of the reviews on the web have indicated, the newer Canons have a problem with soft focus, almost to the point that the pictures are out of focus.  On the plus side, the camera startup time is very fast and flash cycle time between shots is about 3 seconds (very fast).  The camera has numerous manual controls, but lack of picture quality makes this camera less than desireable.","This camera has features that are absolutely unheard of in its price range.  It has full auto controls, full manual controls (i.e. Shutter-speed priority, Aperture priority, and manual focus), as well as a dozen or so photo effects.  They use the same DIGIC processor and AiAF system (5-point) as higher end models, so pictures come out very crisp and clear.  Night shots are great as well, thanks to the AF-assist lamp, which is not a standard in other brands.  One minor problem with night pictures is the red-eye effect, even with the red-eye reduction mode.  This is somewhat expected, seeing how close together the lens and the flash is.  However, this can be easily corrected with the included software package.<br />Another deciding factor for me is their use of standard AA batteries instead of a proprietary battery pack, which can be fairly expensive.  In a cram, I can just run to the store and grab batteries off a shelf, or have another set of NiMH rechargeables handy.  I also love the body size.  I was considering buying a Canon S230, which is one of the smallest digicams out there.  However, the ELPH series do not have any manual controls, the flash is weak, has a lower power zoom (2x as oppose to 3x), and they use a proprietary battery pack.  The A70 is only slightly large than the ELPH.  I actually like the size and the right hand grip on the A70, which gives you better control and balance of the camera.<br />The A70 is a very quick camera.  It takes about 2.5 seconds for the camera to power up and be ready to go.  Focus takes about a second, and you only have to wait about 1.5 seconds in between pictures.  In playback mode, it takes a little bit over a second to go between pictures in high res mode.  There is a lot of information displayed for each picture, with the exception of a histogram.  However, once the pictures are downloaded to the computer, you will have access to the histogram.<br />Other bonuses that I like about the A70 is the Stitch Assistant mode, which helps you make great panoramic shots.  It also has a video capture mode (up to 3 min) as well as audio memos that you can add to each picture taken.  This camera also supports some direct printing to some printers.<br />All in all, this is a great camera for a great price!  The pictures turn out great, even for a novice.  And for the adventurous, there are plenty of manual controls to play with.  There is no other camera in this price range that has all these features, combined with the great optics known for in Canon cameras.","This camera is a very great buy.  I highly reccomend this to anyone who wants a decent video camera combined with an amazing digital photo taker all in one in a small item.  I got a 512mb simpletech flash card, works great.  I can fit tons of pics and video.  For 350 bucks, 3.2 mp isn't that bad!"]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE Z1","amazon_reviews":["Bought one of these in Iraq at a PX while deployed in 2004. <current date: Jan 2017> It survived 2 tours threw the heat and dust and has served me well to date without any real problem.

I lost the lens cap and they no longer make them:(","Let me begin by saying: I am not a professional photogragher, so some of the technical terms in the reviews I've read, are Greek to me. But I love taking pictures. When I pull out my camera, people say \"wow, that's a nice camera\" lol. Little do they know I bought it at that supercenter we love,,,starts with a -W- and paid only $175.00. I took pictures of my daughters at the lake and people thought I had hired a professional photographer. Absolutely, breathtaking photos. It's very simple to transfer pics to computer and print. I save all my pics to CD's to free up space on the disk. I purchased rechargeable batteries and they last a long, long time before having to recharge. I didn't read the manual (completely) and accidently formatted the disk and erased some pics one time. Darn!! Other than that, I think it's a great camera for beginners. Overall, my experience has been great. I bought (two) 5 mega. cameras (Kodak and HP) at Xmas for relatives, and they don't take pics half as nice as my Z.","I have had this camera now for over a year and have taken pictures of grandkids, landscapes, concerts, etc. and have always gotten beautiful results.  The video mode worked great at an Anne Murray concert my husband and I went to - picture and sound both had good quality.  My son took it to Florida for his vacation, and was happy with all the pictures he took there.  I agree that when you have 10x zoom you can't get a good focused picture, but other than that I have no complaints.  In fact, my grand-daughter is graduating next week and is planning on taking digital photography in college, so I bought her a Z1 to start out with.  As for the simplicity of use, I had no problem using it right out of the box and I am certainly no \"pro\" (my last camera was a 110 pocket)!!!  For the money, I think this camera is super for the amateur photographer.","I am female and bought this camera to take to fiji (imagestation.com)  for landscape pics in auto its fantastic point and shoot.  However, at the family reunion all my people pictures were blurred and out of focus.  why?  you have to hold down the shoot button halfway to get the red square box that tells you its focused and then push the button all the way down for a fantastic picture.  If I had read the book duhhhhhhhh! I would have known this.  The only problem i have is that others cannot use my camera when I go on trips I am never in the picture, its confusing for others to use instantly.","I received a Minolta Dimage Z1 as a gift from my Father.  I hope all of the info. HELPS!<br /><br />My Z1 is a 512 MB SD card which takes 309 Pictures @ 2048x1536 Fine Quality, or 491 pictures @ 1600x1200 Fine Quality, or 754 @ 1280x960 Fine Quality or last @ 2380 pictures @ 640x480 Fine Quality.  At 1600x1200 Fine Quality I can take almost all 491 photographs with the flash with out changing batteries!  My Batteries were the Rechargeable AA 2000mAh Ni-Cad, I have since changed to a 2700mAh Ni-Cad!<br /><br />In Movie Mode with the 512 MB SD card it works out to 640x480 @ 30 Frames Per Second, it will give you a 7.41 minute movie, @ 15 FPS 15:10 Minute Move!

I have owned several digital cameras and would rate this Minolta Dimage Z1 9.8 out of 10.00!!!","I'VE OWNED THE DIMAGE Z1 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! IT TAKES GREAT ACTION SHOTS  AND  I REALLY LIKE THE \"VIVID\" COLOR OPTION AND SOFT FOCUS FEATURE. IT FOCUSES QUICKLY AND BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT...A GIANT STEP UP FROM MY FIRST DIGITAL, THE DIMAGE 5. I DO FIND FOCUSING IN THE MACRO MODE A BIT DIFFICULT AT TIMES, AND THE FLASH CAPABILITY IS LIMITED, BUT STILL A GREAT LITTLE CAMERA FOR THE PRICE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.","all you need after a purchase of one of these is a bag for it, 256MB memory card, a flash adapter (Z1 is poor at night), and rechargable batteries [AA] w/ charger, oh and a tripod preferably the tall one.<br />...go ahead buy it.","I bought this camera about 4 months ago and have taken about 1500 pictures with it thus far.  I've taken it on trips to DC, Philly, and London.  It's been windsurfing (though it stayed safely on the beach), and cross country skiing (where it got to go along for the ride).  I also use it for documenting projects around the house, and as the PR camera for my Toastmasters club.<br />The major technical cons with the unit are:<br />1) Noisy auto focus - the videos do in fact come out with a clicking sound in the background.  In fact they have disabled the zoom feature during video+sound capture mode seemingly for this very reason.<br />2) Movie mode auto focus is less than optimal and frequently loses focus.<br />2) Sub-optimal lens - Unfortunately this lens falls far short, and on many occasions the chromatic aberration problems have shown up.  It is most evident in shots where the light levels are greatly different between different parts of the shots.  For example, in a shot of bare tree branches in the winter against a bright sky, the tree branches will show up purple.  Other than the chromatic aberration problem, it appears to be a good lens, on 21st century standards (cheap plastic lenses with sub-optimal optical characteristics being the norm nowadays).<br />3) Lack of a remote shutter release capability - it is very annoying to be taking long exposures and having to use the 10 second timer function to keep the subject from blurring.  Seriously, how do they possibly expect us to make use of the slow-speed synch function without one???  On a positive note, the long exposure shots came out beautifully using the timer.<br />4) Macro mode is largely unusable due to the difficulty of the auto focus of handling these subjects, and the difficulty of accurately focusing on a subject on a low resolution LCD screen.  It has a 1:1 display function when you are using the manual focus mode, but even this is not really useable.  Fortunately since it is a digital camera (and film is free!), I usually get the focus into the ballpark, then take a series of shots moving the camera through about 6 inches fore and aft of where I thought it was in focus.  One of those shots usually turns out in focus and I can guiltlessly toss out the rest of the blurry mess.<br />5) The built in flash is utterly useless.  At 15 feet in a poorly lit room it will take a picture, but they will likely turn out blurred due to long exposures, grainy due to the increased gain, and overall pretty poor.  It does have a hot shoe mount, but see rant #1 for my experience with that.<br />6) The clear plastic back over the LCD does not appear to be replaceable.  This also doesn't appear to be the case on any other camera available today, and it does appear to be made of lexan or something fairly resistant to scratching, but it is only a matter of time before it becomes unusable due to this design flaw.<br />I have a few rants with the system as well:<br />1) Apparently Minolta changed their hot shoe mount sometime between the mid 80s when my Minolta Alpha-7000 was purchased and now, and as a result none of my expensive digital flashes will work with the new camera.<br />2) People can't seem to figure out how to use it.  I usually end up out of all pictures I take, which is disappointing because I usually bring this camera on vacations and trips.<br />3) Movie capture is in QuickTime only.  Unless you're in the 1% of the population who can afford a Mac, the player for these movies is buggy and has an annoying popup ad every time it starts up.  It does have a conversion program that comes with it so you can put it into a format you would be able to pass onto friends without being embarrassed.<br />4) The battery cover is pretty chinsy and I expect it to have duct tape on it before not too long.<br />On the pros for the unit:<br />1) It usually takes excellent pictures if you know how to use it.<br />2) For the price I think you would be hard pressed to find a better camera.<br />3) The SLR like controls make it nearly seamless for me to transition between my SLR and this camera, as well as allowing me to practice techniques using the same modes.  With this camera I can get instant feedback and adjust settings to get the perfect shot before it disappears.  This ability has allowed me to get some stunning sunset shots I would normally have missed.<br />Other notes:<br />1) While RAW format pictures would be nice, it still takes pictures good enough if you turn the compression all the way down.  With the resolution cranked and the compression at a minimum, the 3.2 shots come out to between 1.2MB and 1.6MB each.  With a 256MB memory card, this is the setting I usually leave it on, and I have never run out of memory.<br />2) The auto focus on the system overall is pretty good.  It is fast, as long as you are patient enough to wait for it to settle down.  It has a very difficult time with low light situations and I frequently find myself using the manual focus mode.  An illuminator would help greatly, and they do have one on their hot shoe mount flashes.<br />Also, make sure and look at this camera in person before purchasing - it is much smaller than it looks (for good or bad).<br />Overall I would buy the camera again.  For the price it takes very good pictures.  I don't expect this camera to last as long as my Minolta Alpha-7000 has, but I do expect it to get more use.","I got this cam for Xmas last year. The only problem I had was with the view selector not letting me switch to the viewfinder from the LCD screen. Minolta fixed it, and I got it back SOONER than they estimated!! Definitely get xtra memory cards, 16 MB just ain't enough. I got a 512 mb card for mine, now I can take up to 5,000 pics (yowza!)before having to empty the card!! This cam is packed with features ( 10X OPTICAL zoom!!) The black and white/ sepia tone modes are cool, and the software is very nice too. Picture quality is excellent. In my opinion, you can NOT go wrong with this camera. I don't see a need to upgrade anytime soon, but if and when I do, it'll be another Minolta.<br /><br /> Invest in a set or two of NiMh batteries, a bigger memory card, and a card reader, and you're all set for some serious picture taking. Five stars all the way!","I purchased this camera back in November.  Yes, I had to buy a card, and batteries, but I was extremely happy with it.  The LCD mechanism is different, but it didn't bother me.  Takes beautiful pictures (and I am a beginner.)<br />But...this camera is built out of plastic, and after only a few months, I am having mechanical difficulties.  I had to send it in.  The mechanical switcher quit working, and there was a crack in the battery door hinge.<br />The optics are great, movie quality with sound (that the Olympus C740 didn't have) but the plastic construction leaves a bit to be desired.  We'll just have to see how the warranty repair goes.","I'd never owned a digital before and have felt quite intimidated.  But the more I've played with this little camera the more I'm lovin' it.  I'm and American living in England and last weekend I traveled through the picturesque Cotswolds, a series of beautiful old villages.  I got some very professional looking shots that I'm thinking of making into greeting cards.  I've also been experimenting with the macro zoom feature and with the lovely flowers here in the English springtime, I'm getting some great pixs.  I'm amazed at the clarity of even the tiny little forget-me-nots that I've zoomed in on.  I've had the camera since January and I think it's a keeper.I'm happy with my choice.","I bought this Minolta Dimage Z1 camera about 6 weeks ago, and I am very pleased with it! The zoom is more than awesome!! I find it very easy to handle! This is my second digital camera, first being an Olympus, which I had really considered again! This camera really caught my eye! As with all cameras, they each have flaws, I have not found one perfect camera for everyone!  The zoom and the way it is design is what sold me on this one! The pictures are beautiful! This camera for the money is just hard to beat! I admit the battery compartment door is flimsy. Overall, I am very happy with my choice!","I have owned the Minolta dImage Z1 for six months and am extremely pleased with it.  I have over 25 years experience as an amateur photographer with 35mm Minolta cameras from point and shoot to semi-pro models.  When I started my home based computer and web consulting business I wanted a camera that would provide high quality results.  After researching cameras for about four months, including handling them in stores, I decided on the Z1.  It has 10x optical zoom, and the resolution that I needed for web based photos.  There really isn't a need for anything higher than 3 - 4 Mpix for this medium.  If you're going to print 10X20 etc., then sure, go for a 5 MPix or greater camera.","I'm new to digital cameras and my criteria was:<br />1. At least a 5x zoom<br />2. Quick shutter speed for sports shots.<br />3. Ability to manually control shots as I grow more comfortable with digital photography.<br />The Dimage Z1 has met my expectations with flying colors! Some of what I like so much about the camera is true of all digital cameras: seeing your shots as you take them, a memory card that can hold hundreds of pictures, digital video, and easy download to the computer. If you're on the fence about a digital vs. tradtitional camera (as I was for a while before doing lots of research), then let me tell you digital is SO nice! I wish I had a digital on my 5 week trip to Europe! That would've been so nice  not to have  to worry about rolls of film, wondering if my pictures turned out, and being able to take video -- how cool would that be to have video clips of my favorite places on my trip.<br />Back to the Z1: the thing is a work of art. I spent a lot of time looking for the right camera but it became very clear that the Z1 was the clear winner.<br />The zoom is really nice, the interface is incredibly easy and intuitive, and while its a little bigger than some of the postage stamp sized digital cameras you see nowadays, it's no where near as bulky as my Minolta 5000 with the telephoto lens.<br />My favorite features:<br />1. Choosing the size and quality of your image.<br />2. Digital video: up to 60 fps.<br />3. Zoom: Beautifully clear pictures at the 10x zoom.<br />4. Ease of use with capability to manually program your shots.<br />Anyway, I'm no professional photographer, but if you want a great camera for $300 then I strongly recommend you look at the Z1.<br />Be sure to get a larger memory card (the stock 16mb isn't big enough to be practical), and get the Nimh batteries with the recharger.","TRY TO GET THIS CAMERA TO TALK TO YOUR COMPUTER!  8 hours of fiddling, calling Minolta, calling Microsoft, and going through 2 card readers and the camera will NOT talk to my 2 year old HP laptop with Window XP!  I now have to sit down with a computer instructor in two days to see if I can resolve this problem.  For a camera that is supposed to be compatible with XP, IT ISN'T!","This is a great camera, I also have a Canon EOS with traditional film so I do know have to use a the functions a SLR camera give. so when I did had to choose my camera, y want a camera with functions like a SLR, i didn't want a pocket camera.<br />but also this camera is so easy to use that I can borrow it to my mother, and she can use it in mode AUTO.","At first I was disappointed and frustrated with this camera, however now that I have had it for over a month, I have really come to enjoy it.<br />Yes, it took some time to get used to all the fancy gadgets, but now that I have been playing with it, I have gotten a lot of compliments for the clarity of my pictures.  I run auctions on ebay (under the same name if you want to see my pictures), and compared to that cheaper camera I talked of earlier, the pictures are 100% better.<br />There are some things that I don't like about this camera.  The software and lack of technical support are lacking.  The battery slot is wobbly.  Other than those issues and a little time spent playing around with the settings, I have to say that I would recommend this camera as an upgrade from a \"starter\" camera.<br />A great value for the buck.","Confirming what Mr. Brody said Minolta Z1 IS THE BEST camera among others 3megapixel camera. I've read all the reviews on web about digicams, sent mails to lots of photographs asking about, and my wife bought a Z1 for me. Here in Brazil its to expensive e hard to find a friend of her went to US and bought one. The colours, sharpness, contrast. everything is perfect. Ultrafast autofocus, ISO(50-400), incredible zoom(40x with a tripod i took good pics), video quality, battery lifetime... There`s a thing that you should know, if you're going to take pics just in the AUTO mode you dont deserve a camera,like this, with lots of manual settings. You need a full auto camera. Anyway its the BEST 3 megapixel nowdays.","I've been using three major brand SLR cameras for the past few years.To satisfy & explore further stages of my increasing interest in photography I decided to move on to digital level. I started to look for a good digital camera. I wanted to have at least 3MP with zoom & other basic functions. Since my knowledge about digital cameras were limited, I researched a lot, starting with Steve's Digicams ([...] reading almost all the reviews posted on various sites on the net and trying out almost every possible camera on display. After reading all the reviews and observing the market prices I went for this model. Dimage Z1 looks and feels like a real SLR camera. Perhaps this may be the main reason that made me buy this model. However it turned out to be a ideal choice for me. I can't explain how easy it was to zoom in on distant objects to take a sharp, bright & clear picture without a tripod. This is one fine user friendly camera with too many features to mention, yet simple to use. Excellent battery life ! I love this camera !!! If you've time check out my photos located at<br />[...]","If you were unable to get sharp pics with this camera, then you've done something wrong. Pics are VERY sharp. I'm formerly a professional photographer who has used some of the best cameras ever built.<br />The Z1 is a CONSUMER camera packed with a lot of features for the money. Construction is fair and this is not a TOUGH unit like a Canon G3 or G5. The lens is of very good quality at this price point and can deliver crisp images fully zoomed in. I've zoomed in to 40X with the digital kicked in and gotten sharp images HANDHELD. But the truth is that even with image stabilization extreme zooming is hard to keep steady. The fellow who said you need 4 mp or more clearly knows little about cameras. You can crop fine at with a 3.2, unless you have a printer that does posters! Focus works great on manual settings as well, but the camera lacks a focus light which can give it some trouble. The Z1 can also shoot good quality video, above and beyond what most others can do. It has a great display, among the best I've seen and is easily balanced. B&H sells them every day for 329.00 and it has utterly replaced my G5 for day to day shooting. It's an amazing value.<br />I'm sure Minolta will come out with a better version soon...and I'll probably buy it!","By far the best on market for the features in this price range. The zoom is great. When we first began taking pics we notice the pics were very blury, I have also read other reviews that also stated there pics were blured. After reading the booklet for a second time, we learned that, You must press the shutter-release button half way (hold for a second) before taking a picture, in order for the camera to focus. So if your not getting clear shots make sure you are doing this. Also you can set the camera mode to take black & white photos and also Sepia photos (which is the aged photo look). If you have children you must try taking pics in these modes.  The main thing that lead us to this camera other than the 10x zoom , is the size of the camera. It is  bigger than other digital cameras and it feels MUCH better in your your hand than the small compact cameras. It does have alot of different features and you must really read and re-read the booklet in order to work the camera correctly and learn all that it has to offer. Once you see your pics it will be worth the time that you spent reading. We have had no problem with the battery compartment thus far , it seems to be a very strudy camera in my opinion.","I've been using three major brand SLR cameras for the past few years.To satisfy & explore further stages of my increasing interest in photography I decided to move on to digital level. I started to look for a good digital camera. I wanted to have at least 3MP with zoom & other basic functions. Since my knowledge about digital cameras were limited, I researched a lot, starting with Steve's Digicams ([...] reading almost all the reviews posted on various sites on the net and trying out almost every possible camera on display. After reading all the reviews and observing the market prices I went for this model.  Dimage Z1 looks and feels like a real SLR camera. Perhaps this may be the main reason that made me buy this model. However it turned out to be a ideal choice for me. I can't explain how easy it was to zoom in on distant objects to take a sharp, bright & clear picture without a tripod. This is one fine user friendly camera with too many features to mention, yet simple to use. Excellent battery life ! I love this camera !!! Check out some of the pics that I've captured with this camera at [...]","Well our first adventure into the digital world has been great thanks to the Minolta Dimage Z1.  We've owned Minolta SLR cameras in the past which was our deciding factor here vs. the Olympus and we've been nothing but impressed.  The zoom is absolutely incredible and the camera functionality as well as picture quality is superb.  If you're on the fence..don't be--get the Z1","My husband bought this for me for Christmas.  He was well intentioned and excited about my surprise, however I am the resident techie in the house and as soon as I picked it up, I thought \"Uh oh\".<br />It rattles and feels like cheap plastic.. You paid how much?  I have a cheaper 1.3 mega pixel Olympus that has more stability and is a lot easier to use.<br />I wanted the zoom features.  My daughter is in the chorus and getting a clear shot of her with my other camera was impossible.  I am hoping that it will be better with this camera.. hoping.<br />The video clips are grainy and dark.  The audio has a lot of clicking.<br />The software is complicated and insufficient.  What ever happened to instant fix?  Do I want to know about white balance, and hystowhatever?  No.. just give me a damn camera that I don't have to spend hours editing the pictures through the computer. I tried to get images from the camera through the software and it can not read the camera.  I am using my photo printer software and windows to upload the pics.<br />I have had the camera for 4 days, and have changed batteries 3 time already.  The door to the compartment was originally easy to operate now has me scared to death that I will break it.<br />I have been reading the book and it sounds pretty easy, but when I try to implement the instructions for a clear picture or video, I am left with foggy out of focus video.<br />Tell me.. please.. those of you with glowing reviews.. how are you getting those nice \"TV QUALITY\" videos and Sharp crisp pictures?  Sincerely.. advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />If you are looking for a simple point and click camera that will get you great pictures with ease, don't get this one.<br />I am going to stick with it because I just read the return policy for the store hubby purchased this at.  It has to be Mint in box in order to be accepted back.  Hello.. how am I supposed to know if this camera is functional unless I take it out and use it? If you are going to buy this camera, please make sure the store has a flexible return policy.","This camera is certainly in a class of its own. But before you buy it, here's what I found :<br />(I wont comment on photo quality as anything these days over 2MP will produce excellent and sharp images - the Minolta being able to do this with ease)<br />1. I initially wanted the Fujifilm S5000 - a very very good camera. However, when I compared picture quality, the Minolta Stood out. The Minolta also stood out with its SLR-type viewfinder which helps a lot in taking pictures.<br />2. Bluriness : The camera does not use infrared focusing but rather \"calculates\" the focal points in the picture - and then uses that to focus on the correct items. This works very well BUT - I have noticed that when taking pictures with moving smoke (i.e a barbeque) the autofocus struggled and had to switched to manual. Other than that it has given me no problems and is capable of allowing the user to focus on particular parts of the picture.<br />3. The cameras looks and \"handle\"-ability are superb. Its easy to hold, the buttons are reachable and its comfortable.<br />4. The Macro is just stunning!<br />5. The LCD display is the sharpest I have seen - another plus over the S5000.<br />6. And last but not least, it has a wicked flash. This baby will light-up people in pitch-black darkness like they've just been struck by lightning!<br />All in all I am very happy with the camera.<br />However, the choice comes down to the users. For the same price I could have got a 5 megapixel or higher, but with no zoom lens it kinda makes your pictures look a bit cluttered when you cant focus on what you want.","Got mine on Friday so far it's great.  The pictures I took at night were impressive.  The only think I have to pick at is that it shows the movies in quicktime which seemed to work well with this camera but I prefer realone or MS media player. (no good reason I just prefer it)  Other than that it's pretty nice.  The zoom is awesome.  I used it to get the serial numbers off of an overhead transformer mounted on a 45 foot utility pole (those serial numbers are not much bigger than the print on this page).  You wouldn't believe the clarity.  I was going to hold out for something with more megapixels for the same money but I'm glad I didn't.","You get the best of point-and-shoot or go fully manual, or anywhere in between.  Great zoom, great macros, easy to use controls, suprisingly light weight and compact! Does really well with low light, stops action well.  All around great camera.  (This is th 9th digital I have bought)","I've read many reviews(dpreviews.com, pcphotoreview.com, dcresource.com,..etc) about the Z1 and 90% of it has been positive.  The 10% that was negative have been from more of the advance to professional photographers. Many of the problems has been aesthetics and the purple fringing with night time shooting. Anyone who is starting out or who is at the intermediate level will find the Z1 the best value for the money. THE Z1 IS NOT A CAMERA FOR ADVANCE or PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS, AND SHOULD NOT BE RATED/REVIEWED IN THAT CATEGORY.<br />I'm reviewing this camera from the beginner - intermediate view. The Z1 has auto functions for the beginner and manual controls(Shutter control, Aperture priority, Manual Focus, and Manual White balance) for the intermediate photographer, But ( There is always a BUT) there are some things that due concern me.<br />1.  The shaky lens. Minolta says they designed that way purposely for when carrying.<br />2.  The battery cover. Not very robust<br />3.  The mirror system used to reflect the LCD to the viewfinder. Could see this jamming or breaking down from continuous use<br />With all that aside, the DIMAGE is still a very solid camera. So what if it's not black, So what if its got unconventional styling  Bottom line is; it takes excellent pictures and is priced very competitively.<br />Nuff Said!","A friend of mine saw this on TV and bought one.  I played around with it some, and thought it was a nice little camera.  It definitely has some good points.  Its light, its loaded with features (you practically get bored reading the list of specifications its so long), and it has a bigger zoom than most of the other entries in this price class.<br />Unfortunately, I noticed some missing items while reading the specs, that downgrade it, at least some.  File types for one, most of us use computers to change, view, print and modify files, so having a number of file types supported helps.  JPEG is about the only standard format supported by this camera.  Next, I would have figured by now the makers would have gotten the message that we don't like digital cameras with a throw-a-way memory card.  I really think today's digital camera should come with a minimum of a 32 Meg card, or larger.  This one has only a 16 Meg card; it won't take many quality pictures without downloading.<br />I really liked playing with the 10X zoom. You could get a clear image on some really distant stuff.  I did need to set it down on a rail though to get a steady shot.  One of the reasons, I would wait for more of the new models to come out is to get the Fuzzy logic type of steady cam I have on my five year old camcorder.  It's only a matter of time before it shows up on these medium priced models.<br />The camera looks really great, and has simple enough to use controls.  A special feature lets you see the LCD through the viewfinder.  Different from the digital optical views you sometimes get mixed results from.  One thing I was impressed with was the resolution in the viewer screen.  Too often these things are very blocky, but this one was clear.  The flash really lights things up well, and the redeye reduction actually works!<br />I'm not a professional photographer by any means, so I can't comment on all the optical specifics.  Suffice it to say, that the camera is probably not intended for the professional. It's easy to use, has a great long range zoom, but I think its lacking in some important areas.","I have used the Z1 mainly to capture the precious moments of my kids.  After taking over 300 pics, I liked the Z1 very much.  It just delivers the results it declares (fast focus, low shutter lag, long zoom, manual controls).  I agree that there are better cameras out there (A1, FZ10, 300D) but they are all at a different price range.<br />I should say the Z1 is 'just enough' for me, 3 MP is just enough, 10x zoom is just enough, weight and size is just enough (FZ10 is too big, A1 too heavy).  Originally I was planning to buy the Optio 555 which is smaller and lighter. But the 5x zoom is insufficient to keep a reasonable distance from the kids and keep myself unnoticed.  And of course the Optio 555 is nearly twice in price (when considering the additional battery packs, etc).  The Olympus C750 has also been considered, but rejected due to its slower performance.<br />Some pics from the Z1 are posted for reference:<br />[...]<br />Regards,<br />Keith","Great little camera, fully functioned. However the software that comes with it has proven difficult to get working leaving me to download the files from the camera to my laptop by dragging and dropping same. ...","This is a very good camera; excellent value.<br />My priorities were:<br />1. Good picture quality (obviously).<br />2. Quick response time.<br />3. Big zoom to get close to subjects without being intrusive.<br />Z1 does a great job on these features. Additionally it has many other valuable features such as 60 fps screen, exposure control modes, 30 fps high res video, ease of use, etc. But it isn't a \"pocket edition\" due to the 10X optical. Highly recommended.","as far as i have used it, it's good.<br />very satisfying for me.<br />it's got a very far zoom (10X) and many automatic and manual setting.","the minolta dimage z1 is an affordable and capable entry into the 10x optical zoom camera class.  but there are a couple of watch-outs to consider.<br />pros:<br />- 10x optical zoom - this is the main selling point of this camera (make sure you get a tripod or monopod to hold the camera steady at 10x to prevent blurry shots).<br />- 3MP resolution.<br />- generally good image quality.<br />- good redeye performance (better than competition).<br />- uses a passive AF system that theoretically speeds up focus times at all light levels although low light focus speeds were not as fast as expected.<br />- has several burst mode options that should appeal to sports photographers.<br />- allows a great deal of manual control.<br />- fast start-up.<br />- minimal shutter lag.<br />- fast shot to shot times.<br />- external flash hot shoe - but only compatible with minolta-based flashes.<br />- support for optional wide-angle lens.<br />- bright, hi resolution 1.5\" LCD display (smaller size than competition, though).<br />- has intriguing Switch Finder system reflects the LCD image to the viewfinder so you see what the CCD sees.<br />- movie mode supports VGA quality (640x480) capture at 15 or 30 frames-per-second plus the AF system operates continuously during movie mode ensuring sharpness.<br />- non-proprietary AA batteries used. this means replacement batteries are as close as the nearest convenience store (i recommend rechargeables though).<br />- not the most compact 10x zoom camera: 4.3 x 3.1 x 3.2\", but one of the lightest at 10.8oz.<br />- for the price, has a solid feature set.<br />cons:<br />- noticeable purple fringing in high contrast and night shots.<br />- soft images with details having over-processed feel.<br />- some barrel distortion at wide-angle.<br />- does not support RAW or TIFF formats.<br />- build quality suspect as evidenced by lens rattling and a battery door that feels like it will detach easily.<br />- the feedback when using the Switch Finder system does not give the solid feel that is confidence building - will this system last?<br />- the passive AF system does not perform very well in low light.<br />- the supplied 16MB SD card is inadequate. be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for more memory.<br />- add more $$ to buy more rechargeable batteries and a charger (only disposable batteries are included).<br />the dimage z1 is a good value (for the feature set) in the 10x zoom camera class but two areas of improvement are: noticeable purple fringing and suspect build quality.  if this camera holds up well, it's a very nice value.  but if it breaks prematurely, you're out several c-notes.  in the 10x optical zoom class, also consider the olympus c-740 and c750 as well as the fuji s5000.<br />i hope this helps you with your buying decision. peace.","I got this camera a week ago. I'd been shopping for a compact replacement for my bulky Kodak DC5000. I had considered the Canon A70, but then I saw this Z1 and took the leap.<br />It's a little bigger then the A70, but the 10x zoom, ergonomics, and unique viewing system really appealed to me. I'm glad I got it. I'm very pleased.<br />The camera is feature rich. You have control over everything or you can just go with AUTO. I haven't even tried the MOVIE features yet.<br />The picture quality is, IMHO, excellent. I've taken a lot of pictures of my dog, and the color and detail are very good. A close examination reveals exceptional detail in each hair on her coat. Snapping action shots is great because the camera is fast. The auto focus is fast and the recovery time for the next shot is fast. The camera is very light weight and ergonomic so holding it and setting up a shot is a pleasure.<br />The unique SLR-like viewing system is very natural. Nothing out there comes close unless you're looking at a digital SLR for $1000 & up.<br />Yep, it's only 3.2 mega pixels, but I'll take the 10x zoom over an extra megapixel since getting a good shot, more often then not, benefits from a little detachment (with people, as well as dogs :).<br />I've seen criticisms about the camera's use of plastic, and comments like the NY Crank Yanker's below on picture quality & steadiness and low light issues. Hey, the camera isn't for Ansel Adams. It's not a Leica, or a Hasselbad. As to the plastic materials, I think this contributes to the camera's light weight and ergonomics and to some extent it's price point. Nevertheless, for features/performance/price ratio, this camera is an excellent value and a real joy to use."]},{"name":"Sony Mavica CD350","amazon_reviews":["Loved this classic camera!

It's not the most expensive or the best resolution but we all thought it did the best job.<br /><br />Mavica CD500: best of all....resolution, reasonable recording time, great image control for exposure, close-ups, better controls, pretty much everything<br /><br />Mavica CD400: best resolution but extremely slow recording time made it impossible to work with most of the time....the CD300 often got 3-4 shots while the 400 was recording one.<br /><br />Mavica CD350: not enough manual control for us, but usually got great images on automatic....some problems with exposure range for close-ups though<br /><br />Mavica CD300: not the best resolution, but now that I've done some prints for publication from it's highest res setting I will not be buying any more 400s....just not a significant enough difference,<br /><br />plus it's not as heavy or bulky.<br /><br />Nikon Coolpix: not in the running by comparison with the Sonys....although it is more lightweight....we are buying mini CDs for 33 cents each in bulk... and getting 140-180 high res<br /><br />images per CD.....they are so easy to format, initialize, and copy on any CD burner that I can't believe we even considered using memory stiks, or USB downloads.<br /><br />The best features are common to both the Sony Mavica CD300 and 400 series though.....manual control of the images, excellent close up abilities, decent wide angle (which can be enhanced with add-on lenses if necessary), and both rapid video and automatic functions with night focusing for flash, etc., etc.<br /><br />Finally! There is a great digital camera!","I absolutely love this camera...very easy for an \"old gal\" to understand and use, and reasonably priced.  I'm enjoying my family's pictures as a slideshow on my desktop, and I learned how to do it myself!!!  Not bad for someone who's \"older than dirt.\"","I had no intention of getting this item since I already had a digital camera, but I was immediately drawn to buying one by the ability to use cheap CD-R and CD-RW media, and the unlimited movie mode (limited by media only). As of this writing, no other camera matches this series at the comparable price. Unless Sony releases a DVD-RW capable camera at similar cost, I expect that this camera will last me for some time!<br /><br /> Pros:<br /><br /> - CHEAP media - great for trips when you don't have a computer to offload pics, and you don't want to spend almost the price of your camera to get extra storage space. Since it's just normal CD's, you'll be able see the pics on pretty much any computer (make sure to do the \"finalize\" on the camera beforehand though).<br /><br /> - Video mode - get a cheap digital video device. It can store about 8 min per CD on high quality (640x460) mode and 1.5 hours on low-quality (160x160). (see related CON)<br /><br /> - Picture quality - blows my old Olympus digital camera away. Lots of options to configure and learn to make you feel like a wanna-be pro photographer.<br /><br /> - Pretty good reaction time - People worry about extra lag in burning each pic onto the CD, but I don't really notice it.<br /><br /> - Consistent battery - I had doubts about the proprietary battery, but it is BY FAR better than my old camera that used normal rechargeables. Each charge lasts about 2 hours and the indicator is pretty accurate down to the minute pretty much.<br /><br /> Cons:<br /><br /> - Larger physical size - This is probably THE biggest deterrent to getting this camera. You can't exactly keep it in your pocket to point and shoot at parties, or sneak shots without people noticing. So think about how you're going to use a digital camera, and if having a camera that fits in your palm is more important than the advantages of this camera, look elsewhere. To be fair, it's not that much bigger than my parent's non-digital camera.<br /><br /> - Resolution - 3.2 is not the highest resolution available at this price these days. however, it's DEFINITELY sufficient for my needs, and each pic takes up less storage space. heck, I'm not trying to print posters here!<br /><br /> - Video mode - Although it suffices to capture lots of things with accompanying sound, the camera has no lighting in video mode -- making night-time movies not so great. The captured videos also seems to come out darker than other digital cameras without lighting, though that may be helped by some post-processing. This camera is also awkward for capturing lengthy events at high quality (changing discs every 8 min isn't exactly ideal). Again, think about what's important to you. At similar prices, devices that advertise themselves as multifunction video and photo probably take better video, but much worse photos.<br /><br /> Warnings:<br /><br /> I bought 200 mb discs for this camera ignoring warnings that 156 mb ones work best. Well, I found sometimes I did have some issues with reading completely-full discs in the computer, but just used the handy USB cord to transfer instead. Out of about 10-15 discs of pictures and videos I've taken, I also had one occasion where the disc got corrupted. However, that happened when I was at critically low battery trying to take video on an almost-completed 200 mb disc.<br /><br /> Bottom Line:<br /><br /> After I got this camera, I found that I didn't want to let go of my old (smaller) digital camera because I still liked the small size for some things. That's probably the only reason I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone and everyone. It's funny to me that even with digital cameras, people still find themselves having to think about whether to take a picture or not since they don't have so much storage space, or haven't unloaded old pictures, or are not sure how much battery they have left. This camera solves these problems. I wouldn't want to go on a vacation with any other camera.","We bought this camera in Mid-January.  And Both my husband and I love it.  This camera has EVERYTHING we could want.  And is SO much better than my cheap Kodak DC3200.  We are expecting our 4th and final baby in June.  And this is another reason why we purchased it.  Although we didn't pay 399. for it.  We paid 379.00.  The clarity of these pictures are just AWESOME!  We have even printed them out and they are SO clear!  I would purchase this camera again in a heartbeat!","I've had this camera for about a yr now.  And like any digital camera it has it's pro's and cons.  First off at 3.2 megapixals it's at where any digital camera sould start at for megapixals.  The more the more you can crop your photo's with out loosing picture quaility. But that comes with a  price tag.  More megapixals means more memory consumption.  3x optical zoom is great but could be better. But that's where most digital cameras are at.  The veiw finder is only a lcd screen.. it's great untill u have to take pictures in sunny areas.  Very easy to use.  This camera uses cd's to store images which means 210mb. at somewhere 50 cents a disk.  But the downside to that is it takes abit longer to store an image then it would a memory card.  Lot's of extra features like movie mode and burst.  The battery last along time and is a snap to charge.  Battery is also compataply with most sony movie cameras.  A plus for some.  final verdict.  Want a digtal camera to take great pictures with out croping to much, and worried about the high price of memory cards.. this camera is for you.","WOW!!! This camera not only made me happy, but it was much more than what I thought it would be. Features galore, so be sure to read the manual. I'm currently taking highest quality pics and it will be sometime before I take my CD to Costco for development. Another really interesting feature is the video mode. My family and friends all have digital cameras that are strictly cameras. This one is a videorecorder too. At $375, this camera is a steal!!! I'm not into writing reviews for products, so if I take the time to do so...I'm really behind the product. Hope I can spread the joy to other lucky shoppers.","Everyone needs this camera because it's brilliant. My husband and I just bought it, and yes it's very costly on the front end, but we will never have to buy another roll of film, or waste money on processing. We can take tons of pictures now and not even have to think about printing them until we are much more fincially stable. Just last night we went to a Halloween party and took 132 pictures (I kid you not) and it didn't cost us anymore money than if we had taken 2, not so with regular film cameras. You do have to buy the pocket disks but they are dirt cheap, 10 for $6.00 or so and each disk will hold about 145 high quality picutres. I recommend the Memorex cool colors pocket CD-Rs because they are colorfull and therefore easy to keep track of. We haven't had any \"technical difficulties\" as far as the battery goes or the disks. If you are considering buying a camera you should definitley get this one, even if you have to do a payment plan of some sort.  It will end up saving you money in the long run.","Great Camera. Love the Cd type Media and it has a great deal of special features. Just don't leave it in a cab in Boston like us dopes.  I recomend the Mavica","I love this camera.  I don't have to develop film anymore or find a computer to remove the pictures from my camera when I am on a trip.  I just need to pop in a new cd and keep on snapping!  This camera takes great pictures in all kinds of light--we have beautiful pictures of sunsets and the ocean on a bright sunny day and clear pictures of us around a campfire.  I don't have the problem of waiting for the camera between pictures like I had with previous digital cameras.  You can also film close to an hour of mpeg movies on one disc.  The battery runs practically all day, too.  The only drawback I found was it was a little heavy to lug around Disneyland all day.  We solved this problem by rotating it among our family members, though (everyone got to take their own pictures then, too).  If you are a novice at photography like I am, this camera is for you.  It is easy to learn how to use features like the zoom and flash (even without the manual) and takes nearly foolproof pictures, although you still have to remember to keep your thumb out of the way!  The cds are great for storage of pictures--no more boxes of pictures that can get ruined over time or big, bulky photo albums.  To anyone considering this camera, I say throw away those old rolls of film and buy this camera!","After a couple of years of using a Mavica 73 for web shots and a Canon 35mm for vacation photos (the serious stuff), I decided to upgrade digitally for a much higher resolution with the 350.<br />After taking some test shots, I realized I could trust this camera with the vacation and family photos that required superior reproduction for prints.  The resolution is terrific!  This is coming from someone who made money with theatrical, model, and advertising photograpy and even had a photo published in the World Book article on theater.<br />This is actually a computer that takes pictures and movies, and is easy to operate if you limit your technical requirements.  There is very little intuitive about using the buttons & controls through series of menus, so I brought copies of the most important instruction book pages along on our cruise, and did refer to them two or three times.<br />Just like with the 73, the results appear much better on the LCD screen than on the monitor, so most shots needed photoshop enhancing to increase bot brightness and contrast.  Of course, the corner drug store photo processors will also increase brightness, but they ordinarily do not touch contrast.<br />Also, several shots needed -cyan for better color balance -- just like the early 73 Mavica.<br />Two of my Sony disks failed in the camera, and my friend, who bought a 350 because she like mine, also lost all her photos when her Sony disk failed in the camera.  The Sony tech support guy said \"It happens,\" and sent me a replacement for the first one.  But after 30 days, no more replacements.  I did buy three costly re-writeable disks at $6 each from Sony on line, one failed with only 12 photos taken, but it was too late to get a replacement from Sony.  \"Sorry.\"<br />Luckily, I came across some software that lets users miraculously recover otherwise \"lost\" files on CDs and DVDs, and I was able to save nearly all the shots from disks that, when examined with Windows Explorer, showed NO FILES!  I recommend non-Sony disks that are five for six dollar at retail, and the first five that I used not only worked flawlessly, but held about 30 more photos than the Sony disks.  It's because of the latent possibility of such devastating disk errors that I took one star off the rating.<br />Also, the file transfer software supplied with the camera does not display any text, so I have to rely on using a magnifying glass to read the tiny screen captures in the instruction manual.<br />Neither Sony nor the software publisher's tech support could help with this stupidity, and each referred me to the other.","This a great camera!  We purchased it three months ago and have not had one problem.  It is easy to use, the cd's are wonderful, and the screen lets you see your pictures clearly.","I mastered this camera in ten minutues after I opened the box. The best part it uses the 3 inch CD-R and CD-RW's from Sony and so you don't need or worry about memory sticks etc. The CD-RW lets you take 80 images on 640 * 480 size which can be transfered either by playing the CD-R or CR-RW on a PC or transfering the images via USB datalink cable (I took me 2 minutes to transfer all images to the PC via datalink cable). I would recommend this camera to any one shopping for a 3 MP Digital Camera to seriously look into it.","I bought the Sony Mavica MVC-350 camera to compliment my Nikon film cameras.  I wanted a camera to build a website and to take photos of things that did not necessarily need to be printed out on photo paper.  Most of the digital cameras I found were small and the controls tiny.  Or they needed a memory stick with very limited photo storage space an then these memory sticks were expensive.  Some cameras are so small you can barely hold them without fear of dropping them and this is not the case for the Sony.  Also battery life was also a concern as my first digital camera ate AA batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner!<br />Floppy disks were ok, but again, photo capacity was not very large in the higher resolution modes.  That's when I found the Sony MVC-CD350.  It is a 3.2 megapixel camera with a 3x lens and built-in flash.  It has a CD-R/RW drive in it for high capacity storage onto a 8 cm CD-R or 8 cm CD-RW disc.  The MVC-CD350 uses a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery and it's life is about 130 minutes.  It was exactly what I was looking for!  The picture quality and the speed of the drive is very good.<br />After charging the battery (it comes with one and a charger) I dropped in a CD-RW and turned on the camera.  No, I did not read the manual....  I was asked to initialize the CD-RW and after a few seconds I was snapping pictures.  I also discovered, on my own and not by reading the manual, that it can take MPEG movies.  I will never use this mode but I know it would be a handy feature for some folks.<br />After filling the disk with a few dozen pictures I finalized the disk (had to read the well laid out manual) and put then it into my computer.  It was very simple.  The MVC-CD350 also comes with a USB cable (version 2.0 compatible) and, after installing the software on my PC, I downloaded the pictures from the camera.  There were about 50 MB (or so) of photos and the transfer process went rather quickly; I'll guess 3 minutes or less.<br />The controls for the camera are nice size, even for my fat fingers and the layout is fairly logical.  The only thing I do not care for is the location of the power button.  I think it's too close to the shutter release.  A friend owns the same camera and she doesn't think it's a problem, so it has to be me.<br />The built-in flash does a pretty good job and it has the red-eye reduction mode. You can vary the light output from the flash to from \"Low/Normal/High\".  I call it a \"party flash.\"  You can buy a better flash from Sony but, like any powerful flash, it's big.  For a party or casual use, the built-in flash seems to work fine.<br />The display/viewfinder on the back is bright and quite large. It measures 2\" wide and 1-1/2\" high. The display is of high enough resolution so you can review all pictures you have taken.<br />Overall I like this camera.  The CD drive and rechargeable battery are big selling factors for me.  Also, since it is made by Sony I know parts and service are easy enough to find.<br />What would I improve?  The lens.  I wish you could change the lens out, like an SLR type camera.  The lens is ok, but I would love it if Sony had a interchangeable lens system.  Otherwise, no complaints from me!","The Sony CD Mavica is a great camera.  It takes great pictures and is real easy to use.  I would reccomend it to anyone that isn't sure what to buy."]},{"name":"Kodak DX4530","amazon_reviews":["It's a little bigger than my last Kodak digital camera.  But I put in one of my CRV3 batteries (I have several left over from my last Kodak that died on me.) and it powered on, did the date/time thing, inserted an SD card, and ran it through all the functions.  Perfect!","Great little camera for the money. All these Kodak EasyShare are Awesome and take great pics!","The camera was perfect! Thanks!","So far it is a very good camera that looks & behaves like my las Easy Share camera.

For the most part the camera is simple to use and the 5.0 megapixels is good enough for anyone who just wants to take quality pictures. The downside that I had with the camera, is when I was on \"Live View\". Being on Live View allowed me to view my subject through the LCD screen instead of using the viewfinder, and the Live View setting drained a lot of battery power, especially when I was in Macro and Video mode. I highly recommend rechargeable batteries. Other than that, the camera is perfect for the beginners.","It's a little bigger than my last Kodak digital camera.

Had a previous one and used this to replace it after I dropped the old one on a tile floor and broke the lens. It's very basic, but works quite well for simple picture taking.","I have had one of these cameras for years and will put the picture quality up against my professional digital camera any day. For a point and shoot, I have never found one easier to use or that takes better images.  After years of bumping around in soccer bags, pocket books, etc, mine finally lost the shutter motor.  I have ordered another as a used model from Amazon and can't wait to continue taking quick and easy shots.  If you can find one of these, get it.  They are awesome.","Ok, all previous reviews for this camera were 2003.  LOL at how far camera technology has come.  When I purchased this camera, 5 megapixels was HUGE in a point and shoot camera.<br /><br />This is a eulogy to a wonderful camera, I purchased the easyshare in November of 2002.  My husband had dunked our 20 year old (hand me down from his parents) Cannon with all the lenses in the Atlantic just weeks before our son was born.  The cheapie 35 mm camera from the drug store wasn't doing it, so we purchased the Easyshare.  What a phenomenal camera!  The software practically loads itself into your computer, I guess I read the instruction manual, but the camera is so easy to use its barely neccessary.  I have taken incredible pictures with this camera in all kinds of situations, babies sleeping in darkened rooms, playing in their pool outside,later running and jumping action shots, this camera captured all of it, with amazing clarity and color.<br /><br />My complaints about the camera are few, I wish it could take a faster photos, its a long time between turning the camera on and the photo.  Like digital cameras of today, it eats batteries.  I liked that the camera had the option of looking through the eyepiece or use the display screen, that saved a few batteries.  At some point I started to feel like the camera was a little too bulky,  I didn't bring it to my 20th class reunion because it was a little to bulky to fit easily in my purse.  The ultra thin models were ubiquitous at that point, I didn't want to appear outdated.<br /><br />Nine years later, we are at an amusement park, it's my daughters birthday, she is surrounded by princesses, storybook characters and a dancing troupe all singing happy birthday to her, and my Kodak chose that moment to die.  I will miss that camera.  I had that camera so long I had to call Kodak and beg for a software update for our new computer, the original was too outdated to load properly.<br /><br />I just spent the entire weekend looking over Amazons hundreds of cameras, reading countless customer reviews.  After much deliberation, I chose the Panasonic DMC-ZS8.  I chose it for the quality of pictures it takes, and the hopes I can get 10 years out of this camera as well.  Panasonic, you have big shoes to fill","Very rarely do I like a product enough to take time to write a review, but my old friend the Kodak DX4530 deserves some love.<br /><br />I bought this camera \"like new\" in its original packaging at a local pawn shop in 2004 - about a year after it hit the market with a $400 list price. This camera was made before you could buy a 10 MP camera new for $75. I paid $75 for it used and it has proven to be money well spent. It is our \"go to\" camera for point and shoot use.<br /><br />Every family gathering we attend, this 5 MP camera routinely outperforms newer model cameras with larger file size capabilities. The sister in-laws with 8 and 10 MP cameras are perplexed by their cameras inferiority to the DX4530 and always ask how we take such great photos.<br /><br />One cool feature this camera possesses is that it actually has a viewfinder (you know, the little glass window folks used to peer through for a preview of their shot) in addition to an LCD screen. I am not aware of any point and shoot digital cameras made with a viewfinder now. The viewfinder is good for two reasons - (1) it allows you to save money on batteries by disabling the \"live view\" LCD screen, and (2) it reduces camera shake when you press it against your face to take a photo.<br /><br />I really don't have a problem with the lens cap and \"bulk\" I have read others complaining about. Compared to the 35mm's I grew up with this thing is tiny.<br /><br />This camera has been a real workhorse over the last 6 years. If you can find a used one in good condition I would jump on it. It will take photographs comparable with many of today's point and shoot digitals.","I bought this camera 5 years ago during a Black Friday sale for $140, and its best some of the best money I've ever spent on any piece of electronics. Rarely is a tech product good enough to remain useful nearly 7 years after its debut, but I still use this camera all the time.<br /><br />The camera takes beautiful shots, especially outdoors. The optical zoom is great, and always provides a clear picture when employed. The flash is good, though you do need to be careful about redeye. The facial recognition software is great, and for the time this camera was made, was absolutely fantastic. The image stabilizer is really great as well. It was one of the first camera's Id used that let you focus by holding the shoot button down half way, letting you take instant shots with no delay. (If you dont realize this, your shots will take forever, and will always end up blurry, I think many buyers dont realize this).<br /><br />5MP is more than enough for most people, I end up shrinking down most of my photos anyway. A few people mentioned interior photos are too dark, but if you give the camera a second or two to adjust, or manually change settings, Ive had no problems at all.<br /><br />The camera is exceptionally durable. After my friend crammed a broken SD card in the slot, the sd reader rarely works, but I can't blame that on the camera. It spends most of its time getting crushed under text books while my backpack is being thrown around, and the though the plastic cover for the LCD screen recently cracked (the screen is still 100%) Ive never had any problems whatsoever.<br /><br />The only downsides are only a few downsides. This is a large camera. Though not oversized for the time, modern consumers will find the camera very bulky and a bit heavy. It's comfortable in a pants pocket, but its the only thing you'll be putting in that pants pocket.<br /><br />The other big downside is the battery. While it claims AA batteries are usable, they really aren't. You need to buy http://www.amazon.com/Kodak-MAX-CRV3-Lithium-Battery/dp/B0000632T3 or equivalent. When I first bought the camera, these were expensive, which was a major downside. Now however, they're only about twice the price of 2 double A's for the Duracell brand, and they last a for a long long time. I can count on my fingers how many times Ive changed the battery in 5 years. I dont have any experience with rechargeables on this camera.<br /><br />The only other improvement I can imagine is allowing longer video clips. Each video clip is limited to 60 seconds. This is enough to make it useful, but it would be great to be able to record for hours to an big SD card. You also cant zoom in or out whithout stopping your video shot and starting again.<br /><br />Overall a great camera. If you happen to come across one I'd still recommend it against most new cameras for the price. The camera feels more like a film camera than a digital camera, and this could be nice for not so tech savvy people.<br /><br />Then:<br />-------------------<br />Overall: 10/10<br />Picture: 9/10<br />Durability: 10/10<br />Features: 8.5/10<br />Ease of Use: 10/10<br />Size/Weight: 8/10<br /><br />Now:<br />-------------------<br />Overall: 7.5/10<br />Picture: 8/10<br />Durability: 10/10<br />Features: 7.5/10<br />Ease of Use: 8.5/10<br />Size/Weight: 4/10","This is my first camera, bought it on Black Friday of 2003 for $299 (included a free 128mb card)<br />I've taken over 6000 pictures with this cam, a majority of them are good.

I ordered this exact duplicate on Thursday and the postman put it inside my front door on Saturday. It looks and works like new.  Thanks.","I've had this camera for almost two years and am now in the market for a new one.  It served it's purpose well and I can not complain about the camera.  Although starting about 6 months or so ago, the quality of the pictures started to diminish.  Now everyone time I upload pictures I have to lighten every single picture - which is quite time consuming.  The pictures turn out very dark.  So if you're looking down the road on how the camera will perform after lots of use, this is just what I experienced.","I have had this camera for about 3 years now and I am still very happy with it. I take this little camera every where I go and am constantly taking pictures, my kids automatically turn and smile when I call their names lol. I am still using the original battery that came with the accessory package, I charge it on the cradle when I think about it...lol. I love the fact that the lens cap is attached so that I wont lose it and the fact that the viewing screen can be turned off to provide more battery life. The pictures come out just awesome, I have compared them to pictures taken from a friends 8.0 mp camera and there is no distinguishable differences that either of us can see. I have had several cameras before this one and this is by far been my favorite. The pictures I took of my daughters tee-ball team came out better than the pictures the professional photographer took with his high dollar equipment. My six and ten year olds are able to use this camera and easily take outstanding photos, I would recommend this camera for anyone.","Just a quick note: the lens cap attaches to the camera via a string, and is a real pain.","I bought this before Christmas 2 years ago.  It is simply a great digital camera for the money.  I just returned from a 14 day European trip to Italy, France and Spain, and got some fantastic pictures !!!  I also got some great pictures using the NO FLASH and the landscape mode.  It is so user-friendly!!  I love this camera and will probably purchase Kodak in the future.","I have pictures inside a night club that came out spectacular, im really blown away with the way it takes pictures in any settings, my only dislike was that it was rather big and a little bulky but the performance was up to par!","I would like to sell this digital camera with leather case included, as I use a Fugi. This camera has had very little use. Original price was 429.00. Willing to sell for 135.00. Gathering income from electronics to purchase new printer. I am a professional photographer. Comes with manual as well.","I had this camera almost two years and foolishly bought a Canon A95 5 mpx camera.  Sure the Canon has slightly sharper pictures but is terrible in low light.  The Kodak 4530 takes great pics under almost any conditions, simple to operate and I took it out of the drawer and am delighted to return to this terrific camera.  Highly recommended for anyone and at a great price if you can still find one.  My Canon A95 will just rot away in the drawer, I guess.  My next camera will be a kodak, I'm pretty sure.  PS  I shake a lot when I take pics so I always use the \"<br /><br />sport\" mode for a faster shutter speed.  Majority of pics are great and I can see the quality of the shot in the LCD.  My Canon had an artificially enhanced LCD that makes every shot look good, so you have no idea if your shot was good or bad. The Kodak has a true LCD that does not lie.","I bought this camera because it was one of the lowest priced 5MPs at the time.  The two major complaits I have about the camera is that (1) it takes blurry photos and (2)the lens cap continually comes off.<br /><br />Unless your arm is as still as a table top, many of your photos will be blurry.  I took several photos on a trip to Asia that looked great on the display panel (even when I magnified the image) only to find that they were actually blurry when they were on a computer screen or printed when I arrived back in America.<br /><br />The lense cap can be taken off with the slightest touch.  It continually came off even while it was in my camera case.<br /><br />The other features on the camera are fairly nice.  The menu is very user friendly and the movie making mode is okay (although the camera sometimes rotates the movie 90 degrees, and I haven't found a fix for this yet).  But regardless, the camera takes blurry photos, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.","Alright, so this camera is not the worst, but it is not the best. I bought this about 2 years ago. This was my first digital camera, and for that purpose it was good because it is pretty much idiot proof. I have used this camera a lot over the years, and here is how I feel about it now that I have become more familiarized with the digital camera world.<br /><br />a.) this camera is a big large & clunky<br /><br />b.) aside from the different shooting modes (landscape, motion, etc.), it doesn't have any special features, it's a pretty plain point and shoot camera<br /><br />c.) I feel that the color on the pictures from this camera comes out a bit pale/bland and I don't think that they are as clear as pictures that I have seen from similar cameras.<br /><br />d.) the lens cap! I hate the lens cap! I usually just throw my camera into my purse with or without a case, and the lens cap always falls off! It's not a big deal I guess, but it's something small that has really annoyed me with this camera. If you want my opinion, unless you're buying a SLR camera or something like that, stay away from the lens caps! They're just plain annoying.<br /><br />That's about it. Like I said, this camera is mediocre. If anything, I think it might be decent for beginners.","I bought this the day after Thanksgiving with the dock. I have no complaints. I have taken tons of pictures of my newborn son, and almost all of them have come out perfect. A few have come out a little dark, but the software program enhanced them really well.  Also, the ones that came out dark were taken with only lamplight.  My husband (who can't use my olympus 35mm camera very well) had no problem figuring out this camera. It is so user-friendly!!  We love this camera and will probably purchase Kodak in the future when we need another camera.","Got mine right after Thanksgiving and haven't had a lot of time to experiment with it.<br /><br />I took it to a concert, and the photos in the low light didn't turn out very well, but I'm not sure that I've mastered how to use it in low light.  \"Regular\" photos turn out great.  I don't care for the software, but I think it's because I'm used to the one that came with my WINDOWS package.<br /><br />I got the docking station and love the convenience of uploading without a cable.  Way kewl on that.","I did extensive research on 5MP cameras and this one was consistently the highest rated for its class -- especially the price, ease of use and quality combined.<br /><br />Best for: Novice to experienced amateur<br /><br />Product Uses: Family / Travel / Special Events<br /><br />Digicam Design: Point and Shoot<br /><br />Picture Quality : Very High, 5.0-megapixel CCD<br /><br />Print Sizes: 8x10 and larger<br /><br />Mac and PC/Windows compatible + software.<br /><br />According to imaging-resource.com:  \"Kodak's EasyShare digital cameras excel in user-friendliness,  and offer good image quality in addition to their convenient setup and compact  size. The DX4530 updates the line with a larger, 5.0-megapixel CCD that captures  high-quality images with good detail. Although exposure control is fully automatic, the DX4530 performs surprisingly well in a variety of situations, and offers a few preset scene modes for shooting in low lighting or capturing action shots.  A range of manually-selectable longer exposure times extends the camera's capabilities  as well, without getting too complicated. If you're looking for a lot of pixels  combined with ease of use, all at an attractive price, the DX4530 would be a  good choice.\"<br /><br />Also why it's great for novices to experienced amateurs:  \"Although the DX4530 offers only fully automatic white balance, Kodak's Color Science technology does a superb job of producing  accurate color under almost any light source.\"<br /><br />\"The DX4530 squeezes into larger shirt and coat pockets, and comes with a wrist strap for carrying. The camera's compact design includes a retractable lens, protected by a removable plastic lens cap (a tiny strap tethers it to the camera body so you won't lose it). Though exposure features and overall setup are similar to previous EasyShare models (most notably the DX4330 model), the DX4530 boasts a larger, 5.0-megapixel CCD for capturing high resolution, print quality images, as well as smaller image sizes better suited for distributing via email.\"<br /><br />Another review at Steve's Digicams concludes: \"The DX4530 is an entry-level yet high resolution camera with a quality 3x optical zoom lens. This is a perfect camera for anyone that wants to easily capture sharp and well saturated pictures, indoors or out, with little or no prior experience. And with an average street price of $350 or less you won't need a bank loan to purchase one.\" It shoots \"gorgeous prints\" and \"The bottom line on the DX4530 is that it captures very good images in a variety of sizes suitable for email use to wall-size enlargements. It's easy to use and is priced within the budgets of many consumers that previously would have only been able to buy a lower resolution camera.<br /><br />A world class lens and powerful 5.0 MP combine to give you huge, stunning prints up to 20\"x30\" (50x75cm)<br /><br />KODAK RETINAR Aspheric All-Glass Lens with 3X optical zoom<br /><br />Bright indoor/outdoor display<br /><br />Programmed scene modes and creative settings<br /><br />Sharing is one-touch simple<br /><br />Video and audio capture<br /><br />And as Kodak shows on their home page: \"J.D. Power and Associates ranked KODAK EASYSHARE Digital Cameras \"Highest in Customer Satisfaction in the $200-$399 and the $400-$599 price ranges.\"<br /><br />This is one of those cameras that will provide great shots and last for many years to come at a great price.  The kodak site (and many others) retail it for $299, camera only.  Because it's not the newest of the brand new, you can get a great deal on it in comparison to those that are the cutting edge, just-released models. Other 5MP cameras in this price range are nowhere near the quality, design or output.<br /><br />The DX4530  makes for a great holiday gift that's not so hard on the wallet.  This is one sweet camera especially for those who don't want to have to spend a lot of time reading tiny print, learning a million geek-tweaks -- it's easy to take it out and start shooting.  Great for grandparents, newbies and bargain-hunters.","I just got this camera, and so far it's great.  Don't buy it here, though.  WalMart has this, PLUS a docking station, PLUS a travel kit for $198.","I love this camera, I've had it just over a year. It's the cheapest 5 megapixel I could find with enough features. Perfect for novices but also has a few other tweaks you can handle on your own for more control. The only drawback I can find is that it doesn't have a continous shot mode, that would be nice for catching a baby's many expressions. But otherwise all the other settings are wonderful. The easyshare software is truly easy, upgrades are free and simple online, I recommend at least 256MB SD card for more picture taking, I also recommend rechargeable batteries and not using the LCD screen for taking pictures, just for reviewing them. The batteries last REALLY LONG if not using the LCD screen. I take this camera everywhere and have used it for everything from ebay pics at low resolution to printing 11x14 and higher images with perfect clarity. Ofoto.com with kodak perfect touch processing is the best so far, I've also tried samsclub.com, walmart.com, and snapfish.com with varying results. ofoto is the best but they are more expensive. samsclub is the cheapest but not consistant results so far.","Fair camera for the price. I have found out that a close up of something that has text is blurry. I have a college with a similiar Cannon product. When I compare the pictures side to side the Cannon wins out. I have had a brand new out of the box Kodak 4 MP camera that I gave to a relative. After 15-17 pictures it kept saying the battery was dead. With every NEW battery replacement it kept saying the same thing. My faith in Kodak products is going down hill","When I decided to buy my first digital camera recently I was quite dazed by the number of choices.  I checked magazines, Consumer Reports, etc...there were so many to choose from and what's more...digital cameras seem almost obsolete as soon as they come out.<br /><br />I was stunned by the number of different models available from such big names as Canon, Fuji, Kodak, HP, etc...<br /><br />I finally decided on the Kodak4530.  My choice was based on Consumer Reports ratings as well as the Kodak name.<br /><br />I'm pretty good with tekkie stuff but this was my first digital camera.  No problem.  This was one easy to use camera and really no different from a standard film camera.<br /><br />On the menu you can select from 4 grades of quality although beware that the higher quality makes the file size quite large if you plan on uploading or e-mailing it.<br /><br />The quality of the pictures is just fantastic.  sharp as glass...took a picture of our two year old playing with a garden hose and you could see the drops of water just frozen in mid air...clear as day!<br /><br />The camera can take short videos as well as pictures and comes with such features as zoom, red eye reduction and more.<br /><br />The 4530 doesn't have some of the bells and whistles of more high end cameras but a 5.0 mega pixel camera at under $300 is a great deal.  I highly recommend it.!","I love to take pictures, but I didn't want to spend a fortune on a camera. I bought a couple of different types and took them both back for a refund. I came on Amazon to see what viewers had to say about particular cameras and this one had high ratings and a good price. I have NOT been disappointed.<br /><br />I took pictures of my son's ball team this past Spring and the actual league photographer offered to buy the picture from me! Several parents thought that the pictures were professional! I also took some pictures in my garden this summer and it took very vivid, very sharp details of my subjects. I even captured a bumble bee hovering above my blue salvia.<br /><br />I tend to have a shaky hand and the pictures still turn out beautifully. My 9 year old used the camera to take pictures for a school project. His pictures turned out so well that the judges questioned if my son had any help taking the shots himself. My Mom and my neighbor are both thinking about buying this camera because they have been impressed with the results.<br /><br />I recommend this camera for any amateur. Pictures even print clearly to an 8 x 10 photo, but 4 x 6 is my favorite. This camera is just large enough that I can get a good hold of it. This helps with my shaky hands. My indoor pictures have been just as great as my outdoor shots. The camera instructions were written clearly and I have truly enjoyed this camera.","... a good and inexepensive solution -- don't start pulling your hair out!!  Get an SD/MMC card that fits right in the slot in the side of the camera, and a twenty-dollar USB SD/MMC card reader - you're good to go!!!  Check the owner's manual for instructions on transferring photos from the camera's internal memory to the memory card, then put the card in the card reader and voila!  ADDED BONUS: you will now be able to take more photos at a time - you can fill up both the internal memory and the card's memory.  This is a great little camera by the way, and I would still buy it again.","This 5.0 digital camera takes perfect photos and the ease of use is great.  I also bought the optional camera dock and it  makes it easy to download photos to your computer, but is way overpriced.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike about this camera is the VERY cheaply made plastic exterior.  I would have been willing to pay a bit more for a more substantial casing.  It was made in China though, and I'm finding goods made in China are very cheaply made.<br /><br />Kodak's warranty service is unacceptable to me.  I attempted to get warranty service and found through their RECORDED message that they repair camera's with used parts.  If your camera needs replacing it will be replaced with a re-furbished camera.  If Kodak decides it isn't covered by their warranty, they will let you know the cost of repair.  If you decline having it repaired, you will be charged $45.00.<br /><br />I send my photos online to Ofoto (Kodak) for developing.  I receive the prints by mail very quickly and the look is exceptional.","I bought this camera few days ago and let me tell you I cannot stop playing with it. Images are excellent quality.<br /><br />You can shot pictures in different modes like Sport - for objects in motion, landscape for distant Senery, Close Up,<br /><br />Night or you can leave it on AUTO which will do just fine.  I had no problems hooking this camera up to my PC or TV(ohh yes, you can do that).  It will record video/audio with good quality if its not too dark.<br /><br />You can watch you recorded video on TV.  If you want record it onto a tape, hook it up to VCR, play and record. Easy!!<br /><br />This camera has 3x optical zoom. Considering the price, that's fine with me. It comes with 32MB internal memory, PC software, Kodak batteries, USB cable and RCA cables for TV connectivity. For long video recording, you will need additional memory card.<br /><br />If you're planning on getting a Printer Dock later on please note that this Camera is NOT compatible with Kodak Printer Dock 6000.  You will have to get a 4000 model which is very hard to find at local computer/electronic stores.  You will most likely have to get it directly from KODAK.<br /><br />Personally I prefer and recommend EPSON PictureMate which is more expensive but you get 100+ pics per $28 cartridge/paper and print quality is even better. BUt thats another story.<br /><br />If you're considering buying this camera, do it. You will not regret. I read many review before I bought mine and believe me I haven't found too many negatives. I read reviews that complained about things like not enough optical zoom, lans-cap falling off when camera powers on, etc. All I have to say to that is please look at the price tag.  You're getting a 5.0mp camera for $200 not $500.<br /><br />Camera is well worth the price and I recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />Good luck and Good day to you all...","I bought this camera on Amazon and I couldn't be any happier. I bought a refurbished one that works flawlessly, so it was a great deal. The quality of pictures is great, the ease of work, everything. A great value and great Amazon service.","There surely are some things that could have made this camera better, but nothing is perfect.  But when you talk about picture quality, reasonable price, ease of use for occasional photographer, this camera is a great value.<br />I purchased mine with the charging dock and have no regrets.  The rechargeable battery seems to last infinity longer than my previous ricoh digital camera which absolutely ate the aa batteries.  Maybe there's a slight exaggeration but I have found the rechargeable battery seems to have a good life before it must be recharged.<br />Kodak is a name to be trusted.  I've seen cameras come close to this price on ebay, and that's for a REFURBISHED MODEL.  Buy new to ensure your warranty.<br />I'm having a lot of fun with this camera and am well pleased with the accompanying software and the picture quality.","Let's start with the negative first to get it out of the way. This camera does not take good dim light zoomed shots from a distance (as in from the back of a theatre to the stage). Everything else about this camera is great. It is easy to use, and well-lit or flashed photos are beautiful. The picture settings do help in different situations. The action setting is so good that I was able to take blur-free pictures of my cat jumping in the air after a string. Other settings include night shots, close up, and distance. You can also adjust the flash for red-eye, fill, or turn it off. Due to the delay from the time you press the button to the time the picture is taken, hold the button down slightly prior to taking the picture. When you do press, it will snap instantly.<br />The movie mode is actually nice. I didn't think I'd use it, but it's great to have when you want to capture more than just a picture.<br />As an added bonus, the software that comes with it to retrieve and view your pictures is very easy to use.<br />I highly recommend this camera, but you should also get a memory card so you can take more pictures.","My husband and I have never owned a digital before, so over several months Amazon reviews were very important to us when making the choice for our first digital camera.<br />Thank you Amazon, thank you everyone who takes the time to send in your reviews.<br />We got our camera, opened the box and learned everything in one night.  Fun, fun, fun. I am very comfortable with this camera and feel pretty confident using it.  The software was helpful and fun too.<br />WE LOVE THIS CAMERA!","I must say this is my first purchase of a digital camera, but I am very pleased with my choice.  I was looking for a resonably priced yet high quality digital camera.  I don't think you can find another 5.0 megapixel camera for this price.  Another thing I liked about it was the option to that videos with sound.  That was something I wanted in a camera.  Unfortunately, you have to buy a decent size card in order to get any length at all.  I bought a 256 MB card, and I take 1-3 minute clips.  It works out great for me.  I think with the card, I can take a little over 16 minutes of video, plus a few high quality pictures.  I bought the card from accupc.com which I ran across while looking for a the least expensive card.  I don't have the dock because I order my prints online from clarkcolor.com (can prepay for prints at 19 cents each), which to me is more cost efficient than the price of the docking station and paper, etc.  Plus I have a CD burner on my computer but not a DVD burner.  I found a program called EOVideo for 34.95 which converts the videos (in Quicktime format) to SVCD which can be burned on to a CD and then played on most DVD players.  Pretty good quality video too...about the same as any typical home video.  Bottom line, I LOVE IT!!!","I just recieved my DX4530 this afternoon and I must say I'm impressed. You can't beat getting a 5mp cam for under $300.00.<br />After searching for months, I decided to get this one because it's a 5mp cam that takes good quality photos and uses 2 AA batteries. So far, I have no complaints.","I finally decided to go digital, and got this camera right in time for the Memorial Day weekend. I couldn't be happier. I'm using the second best level, and the pictures are incredible, very, very crisp. I ordered some of the pictures online, and also blew one up to 10x8 using the Kodak machine at the local grocery store. They all came out beautiful!<br />One thing that worried me, however, was that after a while the camera wouldn't turn on by itself when the cap was on (I had to turn it on and off 2 or 3 times). But that wasn't a big problem, as it worked fine if I took the cap off manually. I have also noticed that you have to be extra careful not to shake while taking pictures inside, as they can get a little blurried. But that didn't happen at all with the pictures taken outside.<br />The other negative for me was the software included. I installed it at first, but noticed it overrode my Windows XP photo viewer -- and the annoying thing is that using the Kodak software, there was no arrow to go back or forward to view another picture on a bigger scale. I removed the software, and am doing fine downloading my pictures using XP's scanner/camera automatic detection, and fixing them with an editing software I have used for a few years.<br />Despite all the little problems listed above, for the price, you can't find a better camera. But shop around -- the day after I found it with a $50 rebate at an office-supply retailer...","Let's see here...<br />5.0 Megapixels<br />3x Optical Zoom Lens<br />3.3x Digital Zoon<br />Secure Digital Card Capability<br />Kodak<br />And this camera is $299? This is the best value you'll find for a camera of this quality, with these specs, for under $300. With the auto mode, you just let it do its thing. No fiddling with settings, no worries other than point and shoot. Perfect for those just getting started with digital photography.<br />The other modes and manual settings really show what this camera can do for the more experienced digital user. With night mode (for capturing the subject and the background), landscape mode (for distant scenery), macro mode (for objects 4-24 inches away), and sport mode (for subjects in motion, perfect for my shots at West Virginia football games), the DX4530 offers a myriad of options and capabilities for every kind of user. The video capability also comes in handy, with the ability to capture video at a resolution of 320x240 WITH sound. The max length varies depending on available memory.<br />In addition to the included features, the DX4530 allows the user to expand the features with add-on lenses available from Kodak, like the Telephoto Zoom lens and the Wide Angle lens. Both of these are moderately priced and of the typical high Kodak quality.<br />Make sure you grab a pack of NiMH rechargable batteries and a charger, because this is like most high powered digital cams...it eats regular alkalines for lunch, and it's very hungry! Also, the 32MB of internal memory is a nice backup for when your memory card is full but not as a main means of storage, so make sure to grab at least a 128MB card to make certain you can have all the pictures and video that you need!<br />Overall, a fantastic value and the same classic Kodak quality that has come to be expected.","I am a pretty die hard fan of film, so I was very hesitant to buy a digital camera. My opinion was finally swayed when I recently went on a trip to Ireland for a wedding. My sister had the digital camera and I the film. I was so delighted to be able to see her pictures right away that I decided to buy one of my own when we got home.<br />I chose the Kodak brand because 2 of my family members have one and rave about them. I agree. They are easy to use for everyone. This one was $279.99 when I purchased it and I couldn't be happier. It is quick, has great quality and I LOVE the features. I really like the option of being able to choose how many MP you want to use up for each picture. That makes it simple for email and prints. Overall I have no complaints about this camera. Enjoy!","If you don't know what an F Stop is, have no idea how shutter speed effects your photograph, or don't know aperture from temperature then this camera is for you. Kodak's Easyshare is your basic \"turn it on, aim and shoot\" type camera. All it takes to operate this camera is the ability to insert a battery.<br />The picture quality is amazing in normal lighting conditions, but does suffer a little in low light without some user knowledge or a tripod. The camera has a few features that you can tweak, such as small exposure adjustments. My favorite feature on this camera is the movie mode. Having mini movies with sound is such a joy when you want to show people something, and a still picture just doesn't cut it (like baby's first steps). I almost find I am making more movies then taking pictures these days.<br />I was initially unhappy at the ease of use, since I am a photography junkie that loves total control of everything. However, as time has gone by I find that I am getting exactly the types of pictures that I want to get, but I don't have to do all of the thinking anymore. If you don't mind letting the camera do most of the work then look no farther. For price, quality, and ease of use I would give this product an A+.<br />Lastly, I would recommend that you purchase rechargeable batteries and a charger, and also at least a 256k memory card.<br />Happy photographing.","I work at a retail store that sells both the Kodak DX4530 5MP and the Sony CyberShot P-92 5MP.  I only ever buy Sony products, so that's what I was going to buy, but I decided to try them both.  I walked around the store taking the same pictures with both cameras for comparison.  I went inside and out to compare lighting, textures, and zoom.  I was amazed at the difference in quality.  The Kodak, while having less features than the Sony, had far better print quality.  I printed 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, & 10x15 inch prints of several of the photos (We also have a photo lab in the store).  The Kodak camera blew the sony camera out of the water on the 10x15s.  The prints looked better than some film cameras produce.  I showed several people both pictures and all of them commented on how good the Kodak looked.  They couldn't believe that is priced $40 less than the Sony.  Bottom Line: Fantastic Camera that I recommend to all my customers.","Most 5 megapixel cameras are $600 and up.  This is an excellent deal for the money.  Nice 3X optical zoom.  Very pleased with this camera.","Yes I bought a refurbished camera, but to me it looks brand new, with a 1 year factory warranty.<br />  My dad bought this camera before me, and I was impressed with the picture quality.<br />  I paid $228 for it, and I feel i got an unbeatable deal!<br />  I have taken quite a few pictures already, even moving objects, and they all came out great. The printer dock, an optional accessorie also makes outstanding 4 by 6 pictures!<br /> I highly recommend this camera to anyone","I am such a novice, but I didn't want to be restricted when I do learn all the ins and outs of picture taking which is why I ended up with this camera.  So far it looks like this camera has everything.  Great price, great photos (I am using the 3MP setting-which is the 2nd out of 5 levels), ease of use, easy to program, easy to understand.  I do read manuals before I use any new piece of equipment and I do recommend it.  I haven't used it to its full capabilities yet since I bought it just 1 month ago, but so far it has proved its worth.  The lens cover only comes off when you turn the camera on ( this was one of the complaints that I had read..that the lens cover came off too easily) - and you can only put it back on if the camera is off - a simple way to make sure you don't leave your camera on unnecessarily.  It is a lot of camera for a little bit of money - if the adapter is purchased you don't need a dock.  You don't even NEED the adapter but having one saves on the battery.  I can't comment yet on the CRV3 long-life Lithium battery, but reviews were really good. It hooks up really easy to the computer via the USB cable. The software included is simple to install and easy to follow. I have already recommended it to friends.","Before buying my digital camera, I did tons of research. I wanted an easy to use camera, easy to use software, without breaking the bank.  My Kodak DX4530 did not disappoint me.  I've had the camera for 3 months now and it's taken great pictures. It's so easy to use, my 12 yr.old uses it all the time.  The one button delete and review is great.  The software does an excellent job enhancing the photos and taking out red eye.  All you do is plug it into your computer and the software quickly downloads all my photos.  It doesn't get any easier than this Kodak!  And with the one touch printing, it produces beautiful, detailed colored photos, using Kodak's Premium photo paper.  If you want a camera that takes great photos, without having to be a technology wizard to operate; this camera's for you!!","Just bought this camera a few days ago.  It could not be easier to operate. All functions are logical and clear. The menu items are made as easy as possible. The only gripe so far are the lens cap is a bit of a pain. It's supposed to pop off when the camera is turned on, sometimes it doesn't. The other is the camera needs to have some type of grippable surface added to the body. I can't get a firm, comfortable grip and feel like the camera could slip from my hands.<br />Pictures are great.","Kodak has this great low cost camera which is actually multinational. Designed in Japan, made in China and for Kodak.<br />As read here there are only a few flaws like when those counties use there people to model for clothes, shoes and other things. Sometimes the fit has things to be desired.<br />The lens cover does need to be improved upon as it drops when turned on. A small green light next to the viewfinder is not useful in that place. Software quirks do exist and need tweaking.<br /> We use the Windows 98 (First Edition) and Windows 95 First Edition (Remember BOB and the game on it?). Netscape 4.7 in a browser is still great I think also no attacks like people with MS Explorer and the newer Operating Systems by MS.<br />Taking pictures with this remarkable machine is wonderful then with ease a push of one button going into the computer (pc) controller. Wow talk about easy this is great and  with the  DX400 Easy Share Prointer also.<br />Reading reviews here, in magazines like Consumer Reports and asking others helps . Finding the best cost basis I think is most peoples factoring bottom line and here helps best.<br />Try this machine at your local stores and ask the agent to show you how it works too with exaples. Thats why they get paid eh?<br />Remeber the ad? TRY IT YOUALL LIKE IT!","Outstanding camera!  Even took it to Iraq on Day 1 of the northern invasion.  Took pictures with the camera up against the Night Vision Goggles, came out clear.  Don't know what that other guy is talking about who rated it low....poor photographer or got a lemon.  The internal memory is awesome as well, it is aways there so use it as a back-up. You can select which memory source you want to use ie. internal or flashcard.  Rec you get a 256mb memory card, then you don't have to worry.  I don't have the docking station, nor do you really need it.  It has a USB plug that is very easy to hook up to your computer to download photos.  Software they send you is a little awkward, during set-up, when it asks \"do you want it to start up auto\", say no...or it comes up in task manager running all the time.  USE THE LITHIUM BATTERIES, no normal Akal batteries.  Easy to use and nice size.  It's a Kodak, they've been doing this photo stuff for a little while, wouldn't you say?","Do not use Alkalines in this Non American Made Kodak named camera. Amazons editor must not know this. As it was listed in the product specs they entered(alkalines included, rechargeables recommended);. Use of that form of battery may/will damage it.A Lithium battery pack is included and has a LONGgg life span as reported in Consumer Reports.<br />Reading the reviews here is an asset prior to purchase as the aware consumer is the best user of any product/service in my opinion.<br />Comparison price and  find your best cost basis. This camera is a wonderful unit with low cost as well quality with ease of usages.<br />The light next to the viewfinder is a PITA as well the lens cover but like living near rail tracks you get accustomed.<br />I do wish this was MADE in the USA!","This was a Christmas present this year and has turned out to be the best present ever! The DX4530 is very user friendly and offers features such as a battery charger in the dock. Simple USB cable connects easily  with the computer, plus a video audio cable that connects to the front of a TV or VCR make this camera fun. I am impressed with the quality pictures and the Kodak software that is very easy and logical to use. I highly recommend this camera.","I purchaed this camera from one of the Amazon.com partners in December, 2003.  So far I have taken a lot of photographs with it and love it, save one flaw...<br />If there isn't adequate light, the camera doesn't take the best of photographs.  In dim light, at dawn or dusk, the photograph quality isn't all that great.<br />You can check samples of the photographs taken by me at [...]<br />I usually post photographs taken in all times of the day and you can see yourself and decide since the work is unaltered in any way or form by using photoshop or the like.<br />I guess the best way to decide would be to see the result for yourself and make a qualified decision.<br />The ease of use of this camera is probably unrivalled. The original battery lasted me for about two weeks using the preview LCD screen and about 400 photographs.  The camera is acutally smaller than I thought it would be.  I inserted a 256 MB card in it and with it I have taken video clips that are well over 3-4 minutes in length with good sound.<br />As far as value for money is concerned for the amatuer photographer, this is the camera for you.  I took the one star off for the lack of quality of photoraphs in dim light","I have been taking portraits and head shots for a while now with an SLR and just recieved this camera as a gift and am loving every minute of use! If you read all of the directions there is no reason that it should be hard to use, etc. The pics are high quality and the video option is great to have without having to drag along a camcorder. Very very easy to use and the results are terrific! I would definitely suggest this to anyone!","Great camera, great price.  I have been looking for an easy to use digital camera.  This one fits the bill.  The pictures come out great.  The price is wonderful.  Terrific all around camera.","I got the Kodak DX4530 as a Christmas gift and so far I am impressed.  I see many people have complained of low lighting problems, but all the pics I have taken in low light have turned out fabulous.  I must admit, I am an amatuer photographer and only use it for vacations, special occasions and my 3-year-old nephew but so far my pics have turned out great.<br />This camera is extremely easy to use.  I never even had to open the manual and was taking pictures immediately!  The software is a breeze and I am very pleased with this camera over all.<br />I will say the lens cap is a pain in the butt and Kodak should have made an automatic.  The only other thing negative I have to say is that the green light is right by the viewfinder so its hard to see when taking picutres in the dark.","I bought the Kodak 4530 plus the photo dock. It is the best purchase ever. The pictures come out like the store! We have lots of fun with it!","I received this camera for christmas and I just can't put it down!  It is easy to install, use, the directions are understandable to the average Joe, and man is it hard to mess up a shot!  LOVE IT<br />wxmouse","When I first got this camera after the price had dropped, it was worth it! The pictures are so clear and not to mention when I record video!.  The only draw back for the video is that you need quicktime to replay which I think many people prefer media player.  The setup is very easy to use and i would recommand anyone who's looking for a 5MP should consider Kodak.  Another reason i chose Kodak over Cannon A70 is because A70 use 4 batteries instead of 2 and i also i heard the A70 is easy to break....","This is my first digital camera. I hate to read instruction books. But this one is so easy to use, I just skimmed instructions, and was out taking pictures. It has 4 very straightforward controls, and also an auto setting. I love the software too, its so easy to transfer my photos & video clips, edit the photos (this is a FABULOUS feature; less-than-perfect shots can be brightened, cropped, freed from red-eye, etc.), and email them! So much easier to use than I feared a digital camera would be! Get the dock at the same time, its well worth it for data transfer & especially recharging the camera. Good camera for people who already know how to use email, but are not super-savvy at computers otherwise.","After shopping for the best quality for the dollar, my wife and i finally settled on the kodak 4530. We only had the camera for a week or so when we discovered a small crack in the lcd screen. target replaced the item immediately.<br /><br /> works great, extremely easy to use, takes great pics!!!<br /> thanks target & kodak!!","This is our first digital camera. Well worth the money. I thought we needed another one for Vegas, boy was I wrong. The card gives you 192 pics using the best mode 20\" by 30\" in the good mode it was like 260 or something. All the modes are great. The movie mode is awesome and we still had many pics left. We sat the camera down on the putting green right behind the hole and watch the golf balls go in not to mention the sound was pretty good. Don't by the docking station. We are still using the original battery that it comes with.Hope this helps you out. I was going to buy the Nikon I'm glad I didn't. The Easyshare software is great as well.","I have never owned  digital camera, so I was nervous about how to use it. This camera was easy to use right out of the box without reading the instructions!","I knew nothing about digital cameras, just knew I wanted one.  This has to be about the easiest item to operate!!  I followed directions and worked the camera as I went and I am able to use this camera.  I have downloaded the pictures from camera to pc and it is a breeze!...if I can do it anybody can.  The pictures came out crisp even on the computer.  I know the difference between digital zoom and optical...you need to know that there is a difference to get the best use out of this camera. The movie mode is a neat option this camera has,and is very easy to use. You can play back on the screen and it also has sound as it plays.  I can't say enough about this camera.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone.","For those of you who have this camera, how fast can you take pictures back to back?<br />Thanks","I have had a kodak DC series 2.2 MP for 2 years now and am quite happy with its ease in use.  So I bought this DX 4530 5mp for my husband for Christmas.  Quite pricey but well worth the money.  He uses it for construction before and after pictures and e-mails them or burns them onto a CD right from the kodak software provided.  We bought the dock just because it is so much easier, no messing around with cords and batteries, just put it back on the dock, press the \"transfer\" button on the dock and it transfers your pictures to your pc without even opening the program.  Then you can easily edit them when they go right into the Kodak photo editing program automatically.  A child could do it.  The pictures are clear as they can be, we actually had to read the manual to get full use of all of its functions at first, but I guess we can't get around that, it even takes short videos with sound, so there are alot of features with this camera.  I would highly recommend it if you can afford it.  The dock is on sale (make sure you get the C/D series dock) now at one of the big office stores for 59.00 extra.","I wanted to get a camera that was good enough to keep up with technology for the next couple of years. I then came upon this camera.  It has 5 MP max resolution, but if you want to save space or you have a small card, it can be lowered all the way down to 1.2 megapixels.  The camera comes with 32 MB internal memory, which is very nice, like if you are on a trip and you card gets full, you can easily switch to internal.  I got this on Christmas, and it did not come with a memory card, and no stores were open.  But i was still able to tqake 16 5MP pictures.  The next day i went to target and got a 128 MB card for $60. (Not the best deal but i was anxious and had money to spend).  This camera uses Sd/MMC cards (secure digital/multimedia card).  the Kodak Dock is nice but it is not necessary, especially for its $80 price tag. Just but rechargeable batteries and charger for $20.  I would reccomend the Kodak Easyshare starter pack along with this.  It is $35, but it has bettery pack, charger, and a bag, and some other accesories.<br />This is as of 12/25/03 (This exact product)<br />Includes<br />USB Cable (Kodak Easyshare Dock is nice but it is not necessary)<br />Kodak DX4530 5MP Digital Camera<br />Video Cable ( for slideshows on TV)<br />Product manual ( i suggest you read this)<br />Kodak Easyshare software ( nice software, with a simple, but effective and fun editing program.)<br />5 sheets of trial photo paper.<br />Other ads and papers reguarding registration.<br />AS i conclude, i have one last thing for those interested in it's 10X zoom.  optical zoom(3X) is the actual lens zooming in.  digital zoom(3.3X) is just the camera enlarging the pixels.  What is done with digital zoom is something that can be easily done on a photo editing software.  So if you're paying over 5-10 dollars for just extra digital zoom, id not.  The optical is what you really want.<br />Overall, i have been EXTREMELY pleased with camera, and i would recommend it for anyone.  The movie mode is very nice, although you can't zoom while it is recording.  But, what more could you ask for, hopefully you aren't buying this to make a movie.  My only complaint is that the movie mode is slightly blocky, but is still fun to play with.  This camera is very user friendly, and i would say it could be used easily by 10 years old and up.  The manual is easy to comprehend and read.  Kodak also has a good support staff, and my camera came in perfect shape.  Thank you for your time, and i would strongley suggest this camera for anyone.","Let's face it, most people want a camera that is easy to use. This was my first criterion in looking for a digital camera. But I didn't want to compromise on much else either: megapixels, flash flexibility, close focusing, size and weight. This camera can be used right out of the box, with plainly labeled buttons and knobs. But I tried all the features too, like zoom, no flash, night photography, close-ups, mixed lighting. My results show that this camera has the right mix of technology and ease of use. The software to bring the pictures to my Mac was also simple. The video recording capability was fairly good - not tape quality but lots of fun. Be sure to buy a 256MB memory card to supplement the 32 MB installed. I can take 500 good quality photos with the one chip. My 8x10 prints were super! Let this be your next camera.","I just purchased this camera for myself and I LOVE IT.  I am not a camera junkie, but just wanted a nice digital.  This thing is amazing!  It is so easy to use and takes GREAT pix.  However, I lost it New Year's Eve.  I am going this evening to buy another.  I have no complaints except that the lens cover is not too secure.  I also bought the printer dock and am glad I did.  Geezum, a 5MP digital for under $300?  It doesn't get any better.  I also like the EasyShare software & direct link to Ofoto.com (owned by Kodak) to send pix to family & friends.","First off, I am an amateur photographer and use a Nikon SLR for most of my \"serious\" pictures. But I really wanted a camera for every day use. One that fits in my purse, but wasn't so small that my husband couldn't use it too. After a lot of research, I decided digital was the way to go and bought the Kodak DX4530.<br /><br />I love the camera. My husband actually enjoys taking pictures now too. The picture quality is great. The night setting is awesome and has just the right amount of flash to take clear pictures in low light. The LCD screen is crystal clear in good lighting, but harder to see in low light, only when framing your picture though. Once the shot is taken, it appears in true form on the LCD. It is also fast - so you don't miss those important shots and I haven't had any problems with blurry shots.<br /><br />The only things I don't like about the camera are probably the features Kodak scrimped on in order to offer the DX4530 at such a great price. 1) The lens cap falls off on it's own in the camera bag. 2) The lens is a Kodak, not the higher quality lens protected by a shutter found on some of KPdak's pricier cameras. 3) This is no fault of Kodak, but with 5 MP, the pictures take up a lot of memory, on the camera and on the memory card, so you definitely want to buy a memory card, maybe a few. But I am sure those are the sacrifices made to get a 5 MP at or below $300.","second digital camera, first was a gift, DX3215. only 1.3 MP though. this is a very good camera if you do not want to deal with shutter speeds, or whatever those things are! very good deal for only $300!!<br />PROS: QUICKSTART 2 seconds!, get to use old dock from camera, good with recharging batteries, battery life is very good, much better than what you usually get, can use AA and not have to buy special batteries,  beautiful images, zoom excellent, also make videos long enough to fill up your space (no 1 minute caps, like others), if you do not have the dock it comes with software and cables to hook it up, very fast loading onto computer, camera looks good too!<br />CONS: lens cap falls off, would have been much better with a shutter, however when you turn it on the cap immediately falls off so no worrying about missing pics (i guess thats how they created it), 35 mb internal memory, holds about 21 at 5mp so should get at least a 128. i am getting a 2 256's ($60 each), 35 mb about 1 1/2 minutes of movie, no zoom on movie (but this is a camera, not a recorder)","I absolutely love this camera!  A lot of people have been complaining about the lack of \"features\" and that a serious photographer wouldn't like this camera, well, I disagree.  I am a professional photographer and use mostly Nikon SLR technology, but sometimes carrying around a bulky camera just isn't logical.  If you are looking for a camera that gives great results in a small package, this is for you.  At 5 MP you get the quality that a good photo needs, and the price is more than affordable.  Also, this camera is faster than a lot of others on the market right now.  The click-to-capture delay is minimal, and the size of the camera is great.  A+++","I got this camera about a month ago; I am a big photography nut and am very literate with both SLR cameras and digital.  My father bought this camera for me, and although it wasn't as \"high tech\" as the cameras I was originally comparing, I must say that I am fairly pleased with the Kodak.<br /><br />The internal memory is nice because you don't have to buy a memory card unless you take several dozen pictures at a time.  It will hold about 24 pictures taken in the highest quality setting.<br /><br />The controls are simple and easy to understand; many digital cameras overwhelm the user with difficult, confusing, and seemingly endless menus.  Unless you like being able to control the shutter speed, aperature, and other manual settings, you'll enjoy how simple the Kodak makes digital photography.  A big plus is that the camera includes a brief explanation for menu items so that the user isn't confused about what abbreviations stand for.<br /><br />Some people have mentioned the blurring that takes place; blurring takes place with most cameras because the shutter speed is generally slower with digital cameras.  And the shutter delay is VERY good with this camera; several digital cameras that I have tested have had horrible shutter lag.  The Kodak's delay is minimal.<br /><br />The dock is nice for convenient recharging; once you're done taking pictures, just put it on the dock.  It's also nice for transferring pictures.  Put the camera on the dock, push the \"Kodak\" button, and your preferred program automatically opens for downloading.  One downfall I've found is that the software is not compatible with Mac OS X, which I have, so I've had to use iPhoto for downloading pictures.  (Which is fine, since that's where I keep pictures anyway.)  (UPDATE:  The software is now compatible with Mac OSX.)<br /><br />In short:  pros of this camera: ease of use, simple menus, convenient recharging, internal memory (no need for memory card).  Cons:  short battery life when using LCD screen for picture taking; lens cap has a tendency to come off when bumped slightly (bad if you're carrying it in a bag).","This camera has been perfect for my wife. I wanted to get her into the digital world, and retire her 35mm camera. She began using this camera right away, with very little trouble (she still has trouble understanding the various flash modes, but I'm confident that she'll grasp the basic idea soon). I like the feature that automatically rotates the image when you shoot in portrait mode (holding the camera sideways) so when you review the images they're all oriented correctly. The buttons and dial are very easy for my wife to operate (one of the things she didn't like about my Sony). The only thing I didn't like was that it came with lithium batteries instead of rechargeables. I bought a travel kit (which included a case, rechargeables, and a travel charger) instead of the recharging dock for now. Also, I wish the battery strength indicator was always visible. Over all, my wife is very, very happy with the camera and the resolution is excellent. My wife also loves taking videos, but I have to keep reminding her that it's for \"short\" video clips - it's not a camcorder!","I just got it today, and this is an awesome camera, got it out of the box, installed really easy told you what you needed flat out. I have had it a few hours and i have taken a ton of pictures, videos and emailed them half way across the country successfully. This is an amzingly easy camera to use. Don't believe me? I'm 15 and I could use it right out of the box. And props to kodak on the index in the back of the instruction manual.<br /><br />Update in 2007: I STILL USE THIS CAMERA. I just got a Canon Powershot S3IS because I have artistic endeavors that needed a professional quality. But when I am out with my friends in college, need something for a family reunion fast. Or just taking pictures of my family around the house I still use my Kodak. Takes all my SD cards. Nothing has faltered NOTHING. It's a camera that has lasted through high school and my first year at college.<br /><br />If it can handle an angst ridden teenager. It can handle anything.","this camera takes great pictures--amazing details, true bright colors, pictures come out great even in low light settings. My two problems are:<br />-a 2-second delay between when you  push the button and the camera takes the picture (very hard to take a good picture of an active toddler)<br />-software that came with the camera offers very few editing options, you can only: brighten or darken the shot, crop, make it black and white, and take care of red eyes--that's it. This is strange since this camera is not intended for professionals who already own powerful photo-editing software.<br />Other than that, I like it and recommend it!","Soy un venezolano que compre esta camara en mi ultimo viaje en noviembre pasado y la verdad es que esto maravillado de lo versatil del producto lo facil de operar.<br /> Es una inverción en donde la relación precio - producto es lo optimo.","We purchased this camera.  Took it out of the box without ever oepning the instructions and used it.  It takes great pictures!  This is the easiest camera to use.  You can figure it out just by looking at the camera.  Very quiet little thing!  Just point and snap is what truely sold us.","The Kodak DX 4530 is the best digital camera that I've had.  I started with the 2 megapixel Kodak camera a year ago, which I thought was great.  Then I tried a friend's 3 megapixel camera and saw how much clearer the photos were.  I looked at Kodak's line of digital cameras and saw the 5 megapixel camera for $299 and the decision was made.  This camera took some awesome photos of the Yorkshire Dales in England.  Very crisp and clear pictures that had an \"alive\" quality.  I'm now buying this camera for my sister who suffers with a 2 megapixel camera.  This camera is a great value, easy to use, and takes great photos.","This camera is okay if you don't know much about digital cameras.  It's very very easy to use, but it is also very very cheaply made!  It feels like one of those $10  35mm Cameras.  The LCD display is terrible.  I've never seen a cheaper looking 5 megapixel camera than this.  Don't drop it, EVER!","We just got this camera, having decided to upgrade from a Kodak<br />CX4200 that took a swim in a nearby lake (it was submerged completely, but dried out and 4 days later, was working again  just fine). I chose the DX4530 because we already had the docking station and because this camera could take videos. We LOVE the videos! Both audio and visual are good. Someone said the videos were blurry, but ours seem crisp enough and don't look blurry at all. The Kodak is a great camera; good-looking video, excellent photos, well made, a snap to use; it feels good in your hand, not like a kid's toy. I'm looking forward to taking it on our next trip. Get extra memory and a battery charger you can plug into the car's cigarette lighter, and you can't go wrong. I simply can't say enough good things about the Kodak cameras I own. We're so pleased with them, and would never hesitate to get another one. The only thing I would change is to add a neck strap - I'm personally just not comfortable with the wrist strap. Otherwise, this camera is A-1 in my book.","I purchased this camera before a recent family trip to Disney World.  I bought the camera, loaded the software on my laptop and was up and running in less than 2 mins.  The docking station is a must for quick transfers of pictures.  I am also impressed with the software, as it is super easy to create albums, crop pictures, and order prints (Kodak uses Ofoto- which has been a good service for us).<br />My only complaint (and it is a big one) is taking pictures at night is a pain in the rear.  The engineers must have been drunk when they designed the camera, as they put the flashing green light next to the viewfinder -making it virtually impossible to see through the viewfinder at night.  It is completely annoying.  That being said, the quality of night pictures are good (if your lucky enough to hit your target through the viewfinder).  Overall, I am pleased with this little camera.","I got this camera a few months ago, and absolutely love it. The picture quality is outstanding, and it's extremely easy to use. I swore I'd never get a digital camera until I could get a 5.0 MP, and I'm really glad I waited!<br />I've had lots of people tell me the Kodak camera docking station isn't necessary, but let me tell you, it sure is convenient to use, one button, and the pictures download to the computer. The best part is it's always charged and ready to go, no dead batteries!<br />You won't go wrong with this camera no matter what your photo taking experience may be!","I bought the Kodak 5 MP camera as an up grade for my HP 320 2MP camera.  I notice another person here mention that he was displeased with his Kodak because he couldn't tell the difference between his new 5 MP camera as compared to his old 2MP camera, so he returned it.  My experience is the same as his - at first.  If I take a picture of my room with both cameras, I cannot tell the difference at all at casual glance simply because the 2MP camera I have does such a wonderful job of normal picture taking.  I really recommend people who just want normal pictures and don't want to part with a lot of dough to stick with the 2 MP cameras, because it costs half of what a 5 MP camera costs.<br />However, I must stress that there IS a difference between the picture qualities of the 5MP and the 2MP camera.  It is just that the difference isn't that obvious, and you have to look very carefully to see it.  The 5 MP camera is definitely better and if you look at its pictures long enough, you will notice it.  The main reason I bought this camera is so that I can take close-up pictures of dishes I cook so that I can show off my cooking to friends.  Without a doubt, the 5 MP camera takes clearer pictures of close objects, but this is not to say that the 2 MP camera can't do it.  It just doesn't do such a good job, but it does do an acceptable job - a friend said the shot of my lasagna with the 2MP camera made her mouth water.  The 5 MP cameras don't do a perfect job of it either when compared with the professional pictures I see in cook books, but it is better by about 20%.  You have to be picky to see the difference.<br />Overall, the Kodak 5 MP camera has the following major benefits over the HP 2 MP camera:<br />1. It has a lens cap.<br />2. It does short little movies.<br />3. It allows you to delete pictures selectively from within the camera.  This is a very nice feature when you go on trips because then you can get rid of messed up pictures and not take up as much memory space.<br />4. It has a close up option for objects between 2 to 28 inches.<br />5. It has a night option to allow you to take pictures in the semi-dark.<br />6. It has a sport option to allow you to take pictures that are moving.  (The HP camera does a fine job of taking pictures in a moving vehicle, however.)<br />7. The LCD screen is clearer and brighter.<br />8. There is a TV plug-in that allows you to look at the pictures from the camera directly into a TV (I can't imagine why anybody wants to do that, but it is an option)<br />9. It has an easyshare button to send pictures directly to printers, but I find this option pointless because printing pictures costs a lot (ink and photo paper), so why wouldn't anyone look at the pictures on the computer first and choose the best ones before they try to print it or email it?<br />There is one drawback to the Kodak camera package:  the software that comes with it isn't half as powerful as the HP software.  My main complaint is that you can't crop a picture completely at will.  What's worse, when the picture is cropped, it still just as big as the original one in memory, and even if you shrink it, it is still humongous and slow to send.  For example, I have the same picture cropped and shrunk to identical size (about 5 by seven inch) by the two programs.  The resulting pictures look identical, but the HP software's picture is 43 kB whereas the Kodak one is 304 kilobytes!  When you have a dial-up connection and have a lot of pictures to send like me, you will find the Kodak software very irritating.  I can't believe they call themselves \"easyshare\" when it isn't easy to share at all.<br />The conclusion is that if you are stingy and uncomfortable with dishing out a lot of dough, you are better off with a 2 MP camera.  It does an excellent job of point-and-shoot.  If you like to have a camera that does everything and you don't want to be caught with a cheap camera, the Kodak one is the way to go.  Don't be surprised, however, if you can't tell the difference.<br />A word of warning to those who wants the 2 MP camera:  My HP 320 has a very high customer rating at Amazon.com when I bought it six months ago.  Since then, however, I notice that HP came out with a newer version of HP320 that Amazon is selling.  It costs only half of what I paid, and the customer rating isn't as good either.  I cannot speak for that new model, but I can say that my HP 320 takes perfectly clear pictures.","I'm very, very impressed with this camera.  I've had no problems with it & I'm amazed at the quality of photos.  It's very easy to use, it's as simple as opening the box, removing the battery, and insert the battery.<br />Kodak makes it very easy to shoot, view & share your photos.<br />Two things that I wish were a bit different:  #1 32MB Onboard Memory, I wish it were larger, but you can get about 20 photos at the highest quality setting.  #2 The optical zoom is only 3x.  It'd be nice if it were more, but it does have an extra 10x digital zoom.","I bought this camera on Friday, my wife went into labor on Saturday night with our first child.  After flipping through the instruction manual for about 10 minutes, I was a pro with the camera within 5 minutes of picking it up.  I highly recommend buying the dock for this.  I purchased it at Costco and the dock came with it.  They pictures are incredibly crisp and it takes extremely good pictures on auto mode.  I was also very impressed with the close-up setting for shots within 28 inches.  The editing program that comes with the camera is pretty good but I only found two things I didn't like about it.  The first being the fact that, while it has a good redeye reducer and corrector, it doesn't do much for the other weird color reflections you sometimes can get from photographing animals.  Also, the automatic folder feature it has once you download pics into your computer is nice, but once they are modified, it lacks a feature that allows you to move them to other folders easily.  All of these problems can easily be fixed by working in other programs.  I would buy this camera again if I ever needed to.","Bought this camera last month to replace my 2 megapixel digital camera, and am very pleased so far.  I take lots of family snapshots, indoors and out, and do some touch-ups and tweaking with photo editing software regularly.<br /><br />When I need to crop my 4530 photos, they still look sharp and in focus (which I couldn't say about my last digital camera).<br /><br />Easy-to-use, lots of features, no complaints other than the short videos this camera takes are blurry.  I'm not too perturbed with that, though, because I didn't buy this for the video feature.  A great camera at a great price.<br /><br />6/6/2006:  I wrote the above almost 3 years ago and still have this camera.  It's still going strong with no problems.  Highly recommended.","I recently purchased this camera.  I was a bit apprehensive over the picture quality as some other Kodak easyshare camera's have taken some criticism.  However, this 5 MP camera has excellent, sharp photo quality (comparable to 35mm.)  In addition, it is so easy to use.  I never used a digital camera before and I still have no reason to look at the instruction booklet.  The camera is pretty self explanatory with its helpful menu screen.  Editing photo's is a breeze and the software is very user friendly.  The various setting mode's (sport, close-up, night, landscape, and auto) all work well for their applications.<br />I highly recommend this camera to anyone seeking a great value.","I have had this camera about 2 weeks now and I can honestly say there is not a single thing I dislike about it.  I took it on a trip to Estes Park, CO and the pictures came out fantastic.  The detail is amazing and the color was spot on.<br />I've also had no problems with the indoor quality of my pictures and what I don't like I can easily correct with my photoshop program.<br />The unit is lightweight and fits nice in the palm of my hand.  It has 5 seperate modes (auto, sport, night, scenery and macro) and it even takes Quicktime Video!<br />I specifically purchased this unit becuase of the Kodak name and the cameras ability to accept SD cards.  I think that CF (compactflash) is on the way out and I already had a SD card for my PPC.<br />The camera hooked up to my WinXP machine without any trouble and I was transferring photos and video within minutes.<br />Where I think this camera really shines is the Kodak Easy Share software.  It lets you unload your camera, create albums, modify the photo (very basic stuff though), and even order prints online!  I've already taken advantage of the online ordering and the quality is fantastic.  I highly recommend you have a broadband connection though, since the file size on \"best\" setting is rather large.<br />Dont be afraid to try this camera!"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S400 (Digital IXUS 400)","amazon_reviews":["Thank you to the previous owner.

Means the lense is not coming put ALL the Way. I managed to use vaseline and lubricate it the exterior and used<br />the CRC contact cleaner to clean any dust or debris inside the delicate mechanism.<br /><br />I was to place a Negative feedback to the seller, But Iopted to keep my mouth SHUT ! Just keep an eye of this sellers that are Selfish and sells bad items just  to make some Dirty Profits,taking advantage of the Ignorants.","Product arrived on time, looked very good for a used item. All the manuals and cables, etc. were included. It did ship in an A430 box and the documentation was for the A430 as well but it was not hard to adapt it for the S400. Only 1 complaint. The battery was n/g, it wouldn't hold a charge. I ordered a 2 pack of replacements for $8 and everything should be fine once they arrive.","The zoom function on the  400 almost eliminates clarity.  I had much more success with the Powershot 200.  The higher number does not indicate a higher performance in my experience.  Some of the less used functions, like reviewing movie segments, are not intuitive.  You almost have to be a camera buff to make this thing work.  I am a recreational user only so perhaps this assessment is not quite fair.  I much preferred the 200 for my purposes.","Product arrived before the estimated arrival date, in excellent order, ready for use, as described in the Amazon ad.<br /><br />Very satisfied.  Did not need the accessories as we already had them from a previous camera that had become unusable.  Was purchased for high school photo class use with an underwater housing.  The price was affordable for the kids.","We have had this camera for nearly six years, and it is still going strong.  We recently passed it on to our kids who use it for filming videos for processing in iMovie and uploading to YouTube.  Even with the abuse they give it, this Canon is holding up very well.","Camera was advertised to include a mini tripod which I did not receive.Contacted seller,no response.","I started with the original Elph, and have upgraded on the line ever since. This camera is a WORKHORSE. It's self sealing, so no need to keep it in a case, unless you care to keep it shiny and scratch free. It's durable, takes great photos and is handy to capture some rough video. If you upgrade the card, you can take about 5000 photos & 10 video (enough for most family vacations without downloading during your trip).<br /><br />The only think I'd like is a heftier flash - but I'm not thinking that's possible in such a compact camera.","I bought this camera new in 2004.  I still use it and love it today!  It is compact and easy to use.  And it takes beautiful, sharp, richly colored photos.<br /><br />Recently it started having a memory card error.  I called Canon, and they fixed it for free.  They even paid for shipping.  I was honestly blow away by the customer service.  I just sent the camera in, and it was fixed and returned within about a week.  Now its working perfectly, as before.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this camera is that is has no manual focus and light adjustment.  It has some fun and useful manual settings though.","We've had this camera for years, and have taken it all over with us on vacations. Still works just fine. Nice little pocket-sized camera!","I also bought an Canon Power shot S400 Digital Camera ...and it also stopped working a year ago with the \"Memory card Error\"..I was looking for a new camera...and saw that I wasn't the only one with that problem....I wrote to the Company and this is what they said..<br /><br />\"Thank you for writing to us.  We value you as a Canon customer and<br />appreciate the opportunity to assist you.  I am sorry that the PowerShot<br />S400 is giving you a memory card error.<br /><br />When memory card errors appear, a corrupted memory card might be the<br />cause.  Reformatting the memory card may solve the issue.  Please follow<br />these steps to format a memory card:<br /><br />NOTE:  Formatting a memory card erases all data, including protected<br />images and other file types.<br /><br />1.  Press the MENU button.<br /><br />2.  In the SET UP menu (wrench/hammer icon), select FORMAT and press the<br />SET button.<br /><br />3.  Use the left/right arrow button to select OK and press the SET<br />button.<br /><br />If formatting the card fails, turn the camera off and re-insert the<br />memory card.  Next, turn the camera back on and format again.  If this<br />does not work, you should try a different memory card.  If you only get<br />the error with one card, you will need to contact the memory card<br />manufacturer for assistance.  Unfortunately, if you have the same<br />difficulty with both cards, your camera will require service.<br /><br />We have discovered a memory card communication issue with the S400.  If<br />it is determined by Canon USA that your PowerShot S400 camera is<br />exhibiting the problem that has been identified, the camera will be<br />repaired free of charge, regardless of whether the camera is still under<br />warranty.<br /><br />We can send you a prepaid, and insured shipping label, if you will<br />confirm/provide the following information:<br /><br />Name:<br />Address (No PO boxes please):<br />Phone number:<br />Camera serial number:<br />Date of purchase:<br /><br />When shipping your camera, please be sure to remove the memory card and<br />battery.

Very clear pictures and easy to use.","Have had this for 3 years.  Worked great.<br />Recently dropped it in the Colorado river and it still survived.<br />So decided to write a review :)  Camera does take great pictures and is very handy. Battery life is about 2 years and then you need to replace them.","I bought this camera in 2004 and about a year and a half into the use I had the memory card error problem, did a lot of research and read somewhere it was a loose circuit connection common to this model.  Since my warranty had expired then and Cannon at that time would not repair it for free, I decided that if it is a loose connection, maybe if I shake it violently the circuit will reconnect, and it did!! Everytime the error message comes up (and it does recur quite regularly), I just shake my camera really hard (by the strap), turn it off and on a couple of times, and the magic works.  Tonight I took the internal battery out and will check back in a few months to see if it will permanently resolve the issue. Because of the picture quality and I don't really need more than 4 megapixel, I still enjoy this camera. It has travelled with me all over the world and been thrown around countless of time in my luggage, it still takes great pictures.","I have had this camera for 4 or 5 years now.  It takes great photos easily.  Small enough to fit it your pocket, but not thin enough to break in your pocket when you sit down.  I've dropped it more times than I care to remember and it still takes great pictures.<br /><br />My only gripe about the camera is that it is FREAKIN' SLOW TO FOCUS.  I'm suprised that my finger has not gone through the body of the camera a few times in trying to get the darn thing to click.  But I say this about all digital cameras that I've used.  This probably depends on how much the battery is charged, but tell that to a 3-year-old who won't stand still or a whale that just jumped out of the water.<br /><br />By now, there are higher-resolution, faster cameras with bigger screens on the market, but I will stick with Canon when this one ultimately dies.  Their optics and electronics are excellent.<br /><br />Thank you so much schmalyn!  Every 2 or 3 years you will need to replace the internal battery to fix the \"memory card error\".  The battery is an Energizer 339 also known as a SR614SW 1.55 volts.  Call around to watch repair shops.  Radio Shack and Circuit City do not carry this battery.  I would recommend buying an extra one ($8 US) and keeping it with your camera stuff.  It would really ruin a vacation if you couldn't find a battery, although any photos that you had already taken should be safe on the card.<br /><br />Not only did changing the battery fix the \"memory card error\", but the function wheel (as I call it) now works too.  I had always assumed it was a physical problem.  The function wheel (with the manual overrides and movie functions) has not worked for 3 years -- maybe it never worked, but now it does.  The battery is an Energizer 339 also known as a SR614SW 1.55 volts.  Call around to watch repair shops.  Radio Shack and Circuit City do not carry this battery.<br /><br />A few comments, there are ELEVEN not nine screws, and I would suggest marking the body of the camera with a thin permanent marker BEFOREHAND.  The screws appear to be of different depths and thicknesses.  Have a big clear flat surface to work on.  As you take out the screws, line up the screws as you take them out.  When replacing the front casing, make sure to put the A/V Out rubber flap back in place.  Before replacing the back casing, make sure you line up the camera/play switch inside and out.<br /><br />I cannot be angry with Canon for the battery going dead, but I can be upset with them for not putting it in an externally accessible place.","Great camera that has traveled with me all over thge world. Easy to use and quality of the pictures are excellent.","This is just a great camera but now outdated at 4mp.  but if you don't need the resolution, grab this.  it's unbreakable.  mine's been on every motorbike ride from lhasa to calcutta and most of the time i don't even have it in the case. its scratched, dented, and the paint is worn off, but it still performs flawlessly. canon, the only way to go.","I bought my S400 in May 2003 and fit it with a 1GB Lexar CF card.  This camera has been with me across 3 continents -- from -10C up to 40C climates -- and easily 17,000 photos in these 3.5 years.<br /><br />The camera is very solidly built, and has a reassuring heft to it.  The Celabrite finish on the front resists fingerprints and is pretty durable (except in the corners where some of it has rubbed off from roughing it in pockets/purses).  The S400 has a 1/1.8\" CCD sensor, which is larger than most of the subcompact cameras out there -- they have 1/2.5\" sensors -- and translates directly into better low-light performance before noise-reduction and processing can even start to help out.  Because of this, my next camera will definitely have 1/1.8\", regardless of its noise-reduction capabilities.<br /><br />This was also one of the first cameras to sport an \"orientation\" sensor, meaning it \"knows\" which way you're holding the camera when you're taking the shot, and inserts this into the JPG's EXIF metadata.  But while normal images are named IMG_xxxx.JPG, the movie files are named MOV_xxxx.AVI, meaning in a normal listing view, they don't show up in chronological order interspliced with the images.  And I don't believe the movies have datestamps on them besides the file timestamp.  Anyway, for today's standards, the movie quality (resolution and frame rates) leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />The custom white balance on the S400 is quite good, and saved me from having to do a lot of postprocessing to \"un-yellow\" some photos.<br /><br />Focusing on this camera is a little slow, and is definitely audible.  But if you plan to take a lot of photos of the same subject (or at the same distance), you can lock the focus once you have it, and keep shooting without re-focusing.  This also shortens the shutter lag!  Ditto with exposure lock, which is useful if your picture has a wide range of lighting conditions and the best exposure isn't necessarily in the middle or detected by the camera.<br /><br />A second (and third, maybe) battery is a definite requirement if you go for day trips, because like all Canons, the S400 doesn't show how much battery power is left!  You get a flashing red battery sign, meaning you probably have 5-10 shots left; twice that if you turn off the LCD and flash.  I found that on vacation, I would go through two full batteries per day.  Sidenote: my second battery was an aftermarket with slightly higher capacity (900mAh over 840mAh), and it was 1/4 the price and lasted great until recently, when it stopped holding much of a charge.<br /><br />There have been, of course, many complaints about a famous \"memory card error\", but I haven't had it happen to me.  [...].<br /><br />Sadly, some 5 hours before New Year's Eve 2007, my camera refused to power up.  It didn't make it into 2007, but it gave me a great run for the money!","I love this camera - I bought it after a trip to Europe where I shot 32 rolls of film and came back to the expense of developing them all only to find that half were garbage.<br /><br />Ever since I bought this camera I have been taking pictures like crazy and the ones that are not garbage come out beautifully!  I have played with all the color and quality settings and they really do provide fantastic results.<br /><br />The video is the most recent thing I have been playing with and with my 7 month old baby reaching all sorts of milestones I am happy not to have to drag my camcorder everywhere!<br /><br />I'm due for an upgrade but only cecause I am a new technology junkie and I am craving something new and exciting!","I've had the Elph S400 for 3 years.  It took excellent photos though its movies were pretty grainy.  I also experienced the \"memory card error\" problem which caused it to cease functioning.  But Canon has a recall program for this camera and will send you a mailer to return it to them for repair if you call.  No mechanical product is perfect and all you can ask for is good service if it fails.  I got it.","My wife and I bought this camera as a wedding present for each other for use at the Guest Book signing table at our wedding, and we took it on our honeymoon.<br /><br />The battery lasts a very long time.  The optical quality is outstanding.  We bought a 1GB CompactFlash card, so we shot our entire 2-week honeymoon without having to download, and we were not being stingy on the number of shots.  We even used it to shoot some video.<br /><br />One downside is the amount of time to shoot one photo after one was just taken, however that could be because the memory card we got was not a high-speed card, just the regular speed.  Hardly the fault of the camera.<br /><br />We did not experience the memory card problem we've heard some reviewers have had.<br /><br />After 3 years of use, our camera finally succumbed to our rough-and-tumble lifestyle when we accidently smashed the screen while on vacation.  The camera still works, though, but we're going to replace it.  We're definitely going to get another Canon PowerShot series camera as our replacement, probably the SD400 or better...  Happy hunting!","I have had this camera for about 3 years now, and I find it to be an amazing camera for the average person.  I am not a professional photographer, yet I can capture some great shots with this little guy.<br /><br />Recently, I got the \"memory card error\" that has been mentioned in a few of the reviews.  I also read the trick (taking the face off and popping out the internal battery and putting it back in) and gave it a try.  This worked wonderfully, and I am so happy that I don't have to get a new camera!<br /><br />I can't say that I have ever had any problems other than the memory card issue.  The S400 has been very pleasing.<br /><br />Canon is great!","July 13, 2006: I used this camera happily for 2 years before getting the memory card error.  Here are some more details about how to remove the internal battery: You must remove NINE screws in order to get to it.  Four screws by the loop (then the plate comes off, remember which side is up); One screw by the front of the tripod hole, plus the Two screws next to it along the front of the camera; and the Two screws on the side by the A/V Out rubber cover.  GENTLY pry the front of the camera off (I used a tiny flathead screwdriver, inserting it into the crack and gently turning it), and then lift the lower right corner of the copper flap (it might be held down by a touch of adhesive).  Gently pop out the little battery.  Reverse to assemble.  I haven't seen whether it works as a fix yet, but I know I wanted more instructions while I was doing it, so I thought I'd provide them for the next person.:)<br />August 2, 2006: After performing the fix, I took the camera on a 2-week vacation, took tons of pics and videos, and had absolutely no trouble.  The memory card error would definitely have shown itself at least once during that time if it had not been fixed.  Hooray!!","This is an amazing little camera that takes beautiful vibrant pictures and I was relieved to find out that Canon is offering to inspect it and fix it for FREE even if your warranty has expired.  This was taken from their website.  Pass the news along!<br /><br />If it is determined by Canon USA that your PowerShot S400 camera is exhibiting the CF Card communication problem that has been identified, the camera will be repaired free of charge, regardless of whether the camera is still under warranty. In addition, a refund of a previously paid repair will be made if it is determined by Canon USA that the repair of your PowerShot S400 was prompted by the CF Card communication problem that has been identified.<br /><br />We have implemented a plan to assist those of our customers whose S400 cameras have exhibited the CF Card communication problem that has been identified. Repair service will be performed free of charge. U.S. residents are asked to contact the Canon Customer Support Center for assistance at 1-800-828-4040.","I tried Ronald Jones' suggestion for fixing the memory card error problem got immediate results. So, for now, my camera is back in business. Many thanks, Ronald!","Besides the new \"Canon\" recall that offers a repair for all Canon Elph S400, I did a lot of research after my camera did this (mind you my Memory Card Error came after 3.5 years of use of my camera), and the trick is...... drumroll.. charge the battery to its full capacity.<br /><br />For some reason this trick ALWAYS works.<br /><br />Hope this helps for y'all...","It could be that resetting the camera to its default state (by holding down the \"menu\" button for an few seconds) initiates a soft reboot of the camera that is as effective as the hard reboot resulting from removal of the internal battery (and it's a lot easier). Any failures with either method?<br /><br />Note added: for a real fix the camera needs to be repaired by Canon. I gave up and sent mine in. Insist they not charge; similar models with the same problem have been recalled.","I bought this camera mainly as a snapshot camera. I especially liked the size of the camera. Eventually I started using some of the more advanced features and found it to be fairly easy to use. Unfortunately I never really found the pictures to be all that great. Coming from a Kodak I was surprised at how the Canon failed to deliver better pics than it did. Nonetheless it was a good camera for what I needed.<br />Then, like it seems everyone else has, I encountered the E50 memory card error. After looking online at potential fixes and seeing what Canon suggested and their cost, I found myself looking at new camera's last weekend. Something I really wasn't planning on being in the market for just now.<br />Fortunately I happened across a solution yesterday that did eliminate the memory card error, at least for now. Last night I took 300 pictures and downloaded them onto my PC and no problems.<br />The fix: I turned the camera on and put it in playback/review mode. I held the menu button down until I got a screen that asked if I wanted to restore the camera to factory settings and said Yes. I tried it in picture taking mode instead of review mode and it did not work, but when I did it in review it changed the settings back to factory and like I said, worked like a champ last night. I'll keep pushing it for a while and see if my error returns and report back.<br /><br />UPDATE:Two weeks and at least 1000 pictures later the camera is still working fine. I have four CF cards and after the fix all but one worked. The other I just did the same fix as before and it works as well. .","I've owned this camera for almost two years with no problems, and just like all the other reviewers, I got the 'memory card error' and my camera stopped working. Thank you all for posting the your comments on how to fix the memory card error. It worked for me too! (my tip: I stuck all the little screws on sticky shipping tape to prevent them from rolling around) You all save me from buying a new camera...I was actually on Amazon looking for a new camera before I decided to check out the comments on the Canon PowerShot S400.<br /><br />I've enjoyed this camera because it's small and easy to carry around, but one of the downsides of the camera is that you have to press hard on the button to take the picture. It's not a big deal for me, but when you ask others to take the picture for you, you have to explain to them to hold the button longer.<br /><br />With all the new digital cameras out there, there are certainly better cameras out there. But since this camera is working again, I'll keep it around for awhile. Thanks again for all the comments on how to fix the memory card error!","Gallo you are awsome.  We tried everything with this camera, even calling the manufacturer.  Extremely unhelpful - same garbage - send it in and pay them money for something they broke when building it.  And when just a little fix will do.  I was amazed that taking out the battery was so easy.  I took all the screws out just to be safe but laid them to the side in order.  Took no time to put them back.<br /><br />I would say that otherwise, the camera is durable and easy to use, especially for a young person.  And the quality of the pictures is good for the time it was made.  My daughter was 14 at the time and had no trouble using it.  The only drawback is that you have to use their battery, unlike my Olympus which uses AA and when you're out in the woods camping, it's not likely you'll find electricity.  So ease of use is good if you're always near an electrical source.","Same as everyone else has reported... after a little over two years of owning the camera I started getting \"Memory card error\"(s). Bought a new CF card, but the errors kept coming back. I could no longer see the pictures on the card, either!<br /><br />I followed C. Gallo's advice, took apart the camera and replaced the small internal battery (it's on the front of the camera, to the bottom-right of the lens... so try just taking off enough to get to that area).<br /><br />Others have reported that just buying a new rechargable battery (the kind you can easily take out of the side) will do you good for about a year. I'll try that next if the error crops up again.<br /><br />Thanks, C. Gallo!","Just like C Gallo says - take it apart, remove battery (I left it out for a minute or so), put it back together.  Not hard.  Just keep track of where the screws go.  :)","I was finally able to fix the memory card error I was getting on my Canon S400. After almost throwing the camera away, I did a last search online and found a way to fix it that worked for a lot of people. What you need to do is open the camera and remove the camera's internal battery and insert it again. This might seem like a major task, but it's actually not all that complicated (although if you are not comfortable with opening electronic devices and handling tiny screws, you might want to stay away). Here's a diagram to help you out: [...] (the battery is part #3 on page 4). Don't be scared with the diagram, as you won't have to take the entire camera apart. You will only need to open up the camera. Good luck!","I too was left with an unusable S400 for several months with the \"memory card error\". I solved the problem by formatting my compact flash cards by connecting them to my PC through a CF reader. I also reset the settings on the camera to the default by removing the card, turning it on and pressing and holding down menu for 10 seconds. Worked like a charm, and I can now resume taking shots with my S400 again.","I've had this camera since October 2003, and I haven't had any significant problems with it. I have experienced the memory card errors as previously described, but only twice, and the errors were not fatal. As soon as I went on my computer and deleted the faulty photo, I could resume my photo-taking. I use my camera on a fairly regular basis - perhaps twice or three times a week. I haven't had any problems connecting it to the computer via USB cable. I chose Canon because their colors are more vibrant than those of other camera manufacturers. I would definitely recommend this camera for casual use.","This is a great camera from Canon.  I've always been a fan of the Digital Elphs and I've had this one for about 2 years now. Canon has since come out with smaller versions with more capabilities.  So if you're considering this camera, I would suggest looking at the SD300, SD400, and even SD500 before making your decision.","After owning this camera for 1 1/2 years, it started to intermitantly complain about \"Memory Card Error\".  I tried reformatting the card and also tried a different memory card.  Neither of these fixed the problem.<br /><br />I had it repaired by Canon for $150 and it works fine now.  The warrantee  of course is only 1 year.  But, the good news is that VISA doubles the warrantee period, since I bought the item on VISA!  So, I got it fixed for the cost of shipping.<br /><br />The camera takes great pictures.  IMHO: the user-interface for anything other than point and shoot sucks.  But, that seems to be true for most digital cameras.","I am new to digital photography and this is the first digital camera I have ever had.  I bought my S400 approximately two years ago and I have never had any problem with it.  The controls are easy to operate and I have taken many great pictures with it.  I would recommend this camera to anyone, based on my experience.","This is my 3rd digital camera, and by far the best.  It is small enough to take anywhere, and powerful enough to print beautiful large 8x10 photos.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Small Size<br /><br />Quick and easy operation<br /><br />beautiful prints/photos<br /><br />stitch mode<br /><br />manual options<br /><br />cheap memory cards<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />blurry pix on some shots (mainly my fault)<br /><br />cheap memory card door - feels like it would break off easily.<br /><br />All in all an awesome camera.","I too loved this camera until I got the dreaded \"memory card error\" after I had had the camera 16 months.  Fortunately the credit card I bought it with doubles manufacturers' warranties so I am submitting a claim to them for the repair/replacement.  You might want to check the benefits that come with your credit card before you send any money to Canon for repair.","As for the camera, I love it when it works...<br />From my point of view:<br />CONS: The video capture could be a higher resolution and the response time between shutter press and picture could be better.<br />PROS: Nice, small formfactor, excellent construction materials, fit and finish. Easy to use and intuative user interface. Optical zoom.<br /><br />I too have had the same problems and symptoms with my S400 and CompactFlash errors. I updated the camera's firmware and it *seems* to have fixed the problem. Only time will tell, but the two cards I have that were not working for me are now working (or should I say working for now). I'm using a Mac and OSX, and it took me all of 10 minutes to read the instructions, download the firmware update (3.5 MB with a cable modem), and install it. It took me longer to write this review, than it did to update the firmware. Here is what I did:<br />1) went to: web -dot- canon -dot- jp -slash- Imaging -slash- PSS400 -slash- pss400_firmware-e -dot- html (sorry for the weird format, but the posting engine kept stripping out the link).<br />2) After reading the page, I went to the link at the bottom of the page, the \"Download Page\" link.<br />3) I entered my camera's serial number and clicked the \"Agree\" link.<br />4) Downloaded both the \"Firmware Update Instructions\" and the OSX version of \"PowerShotS400_f.sit\" (and unarchived the .sit file).<br />5) Connected the camera.<br />6) Double clicked the \"UploadFirmware\" application and followed the instructions.<br />7) Followed the instructions of the readme file included with \"PowerShotS400_f.sit\".<br /><br />After the firmware update, I had to start over with the cards... the images on them were not accesible via the camera. I probably could have retreived them with a card reader, but I do not have one, and I could take the pictures again (just some stills of a construction project). Anyway, both of the cards that were not working before the firmware update, now work. Hope this helps.","For what it's worth, the camera is really fantastic.  It works great when it does work, and it is light-weight plus compact.  I've gotten lots of great use out of it.  However, shortly after a year of buying it, I've gotten a memory card error as others have mentioned.  I reformatted the card, lost some important images, and it worked fine for a while.<br /><br />Suddenly connecting it to the computer wouldn't recognize the camera.  I thought it was the cord, or my computer, but it wouldn't work on 3 other computers, and getting a new cord didn't help.  A call to Canon's support told me that I had to send it in for repairs and pay $150, or $185 to trade in for the S410 model.  That's $100 less than getting a new S400.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm very disappointed because if this camera had worked reliably and didn't have these problems, it'd be a perfect 5 stars from me.  Sadly, this isn't the case, and I'm now considering getting a new camera that isn't Canon.","I've been using this camera for quite a while now and I've been very happy with it overall.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />This thing that most attracted me to this camera was it's size.  Yes, there are smaller cameras on the market but almost all of the smaller cameras lack an Optical zoom lens.  I wouldn't purchase a digital camera with out an optical zoom lens as I use it quite frequently.  Me, being a guy, and therefore not carrying a purse, I found it really easy to carry this camera around in my pocket when traveling.  I have felt so free on vacation now not being burdened with holding a camera or asking my wife to hand my the camera from her purse whenver I want to take a picture.  It makes vacations that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Ease of use:<br /><br />I find the auto mode useful frequently.  My wife is not a technophobe and enjoys the easy point-and-click ability of this camera and most of the time it works quite well.  I do use the manual mode quite often to optimize for lighting conditions.  I also appreciate the easy ability to disable the flash with a separate button on the back as I frquenty turn off the flash for indoor pictures when there is plenty of light.  I do find the flash to be a little harsh for indoor pictures when there isn't a lot of light.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />As several people have pointed out, upgrade the memory card size immediately to at least 512MB so you don't ever end up filling up the camera.  I recommend learning to download pictures on to a computer straight away and burn them on CD for long-term storage.<br /><br />Buy an extra battery.  There really is no warning when the battery is dying.  Once the warning hits, you will be lucky to get one more shot off.  I got burned on my one (and probably only) trip to Mt. Fuji in Japan and ran out of juice half way through the trip.  I do like the small size of the battery charger and it works quite well (no chords!).","I just this last week got the memory card error as so many other people have described.  And it seems clear that the problem is with the camera and not with the memory cards themselves.  Yet your solution (of formatting the memory cards) does not really do anything to the camera itself.  Are you sure this method works and that it's not only temporarily cooperating before it starts giving you the same error again?  Also, is there anything us consumers can do to get Canon to create some sort of fix to this problem w/o paying $150?","This camera takes great pictures for the point & shoot crowd.  Easy to use and easy to carry anywhere.","I love this camera but thank goodness that my memory card error occured nine months after I bought it and not after a year.  I sent it in to have it fixed free of charge and it was shipped back to me within the week.","It looks like we're all in the same boat.  I've had this camera for a year and a half and would have recommended it to anybody.  Then the memory card error.  It happened to me twice, both times just after I inserted a freshly charged battery.  I let it sit overnight, and it worked just fine the next day.  And the pictures that were on the card before the error were still there afterwards.","I thought this was a great camera, I bought 3 on the same day for myself and friends. 2 of these have now suffered the infamous Memory Card error.  Luckily it was under warranty and Cannon fixed the camera.  While I was collecting my camera from the shop after having it fixed another customer was in there, returning his for the 3rd time with the same problem!  My 2 flash cards are unuseable, Canon refused to replace their Canon 32 card and I had a fight for the shop to repace the 256 card. I dont expect it will be too long before my camera suffers the same problem again.  My brother bought this camera just after me and I now feel guilty for recommending it to him.  Beware!","Excellent camera, highly recommended. Only 4 chilis because it would be nice if they made the same with a larger display. I'm saying the same, not one with lesser optics like the SD200/SD300. I've taken almost 8000 pictures with it, very good.","this camera is great. it's small enough to carry w/ me everywhere and it has the features i need.  the pictures are amazing and the colors are great. it's easy to compare the quality against other cameras when me and my friends post our pictures on ofoto. i also love the zoom and the ability to take mini-movies.","This beauty is a legend. It is small, light, and good looking. Like somebody else here, I've had great success with the battery; it lasts way longer than the batteries in my old digital cameras. Also the video shooting is a neat feature. Highly recommended!","Like nearly everyone else here I love this camera! I have had mine for about a year. Quite simply, it is capable of taking \"wonderful\" pictures. Also, I like the look of it: compact, sleek and elegant. Limited in manual features as compared to other cameras and I wish it used non-proprietary baterries, but IT TAKES GREAT PICTURES! Buy one - new or used - if you can.","I have had my S400 camera for 17 months and have used it A LOT.  Lately have had a lot of \"Memory Card Error\" mesages.  I have bought new Memory Cards, but that isn't the problem.  The problem is in the camera.  It is very disappointing to not trust the camera to take a photo when you want it too. Very frustrating. Buyer Beware.","There are enough superlatives for this item in the reviews.  It suits my needs of quick informal photos.  I would like to comment and perhaps help those who report slow shutter response -- the time between pressing down and when the image is captured.<br /><br />I will agree with folks who state there is a noticable delay if you start from \"hands off\" to \"full down\" on the shutter.  I missed several shots the first several attempts.  (My kids are young and are constantly in motion!)  There is a trick which I'm not sure is covered in the manual.<br /><br />By pressing down HALF WAY, the camera will adjust focus and balance settings without taking the picture.  Then, from the HALF-WAY down position, when you press down FULLY, the camera will take the photo IMMEDIATELY.<br /><br />Wait, there's more!  If you release the shutter only to the HALF-WAY point (some practice required) then press down FULLY again, the camera will take another picture at the same focus/lighting settings IMMEDIATELY.  If you keep releasing to the HALF-WAY point, you can take pictures in rapid succession.  If you completely release the shutter then the camera will go through the process of focus and lighting settings again.<br /><br />So now, when I want to take a picture, before the subject is ready, I press down HALF-WAY and wait for the moment, then CLICK -- Gotcha!  Release half-way, wait -- CLICK -- Gotcha again!  For the most rapid successions make sure you set the LCD display \"after shot display\" to OFF.<br /><br />My wife was disappointed/frustrated with this camera until I showed her this trick -- now she LOVES it!","I don't understand the people that say that humidity has damage the inside of their camera. I was in Puerto Rico for 3 weeks and took it everywhere, even to the beach, sat it in the sand, dropped it a couple of times and it is still works great 5 months after. I also purchased one for my sister who lives there and after 7 months still works great. Maybe they got lemons or purchased their at one of those downtown/tourist areas, which are not the real thing. I also purchase a couple of batteries at e-bay for about $6 ea. and memory cards are so cheap now a days, I have a couple extras. The batteries need to be fully charged to get the best out of them. Mine last very long, about a week when on vacation and using it often. Overall this is an excellent, compact and user friendly camera. I love it.","This camera is light, compact, has extensive features for manual shots and zooms in on pictures right on the view screen.  It takes even high quality photos fast.  In my opinion, it's definitely the best bang for the buck!","Not all memory cards work well with all cameras.  I tried to use a Viking card with my Canon s230, and got the E18 error mentioned here.  As soon as I swapped my SanDisk back in, the problem was gone forever.  I think sending the memory card back was a much better and cheaper solution than ditching an excellent camera.","This is a beautiful small camera that takes great pictures and has all the feautures most of us photo snappers need.  The dials are fairly intuitive to use and the 3X zoom comes in handy.  The negative is that battery life is relatively short.  I would recommend a spare battery to be able to keep shooting if the battery runs out.  Also, now that the price of the CF memory chip has decreased a great deal, I would recommend at least a 256 mB memory card.","I bought this camera at a retail outlet in Malaysia. It came with an extra 128 MB CF Card, Bag and Tripod.<br />The most important thing for me in buying a camera is convenience. First of all, size is important. Spending this kind of money, I want to make sure that the camera is with me as often as possible. With the size of this camera, taking it with me is never a hassle. Although the Casio Exilim is thinner, I was not entirely happy with the quality of the pictures taken with it. I guess it's because Casio is a relatively newer entrant into this market.<br />The ability to just Point and Shoot is a must for me. Despite shooting a lot of photographs (I have small kids), I have no pretensions about being a master photographer. For me, this camera more than does the job. On full auto mode, I know that almost all the shots I take will turn out okay. As with most Digital cameras, the LCD enables you to see what your printed photo will look like.<br />I have used cheaper digital cameras before (a 3MP MDC3000) and did not get the quality of photos I get now with the Canon. For one thing, the flash intensity seems to be controlled somehow so I rarely get overexposed shots. Its also rare that I have problems with red-eye.<br />The navigation of features and menus is also a breeze compared to the cheaper cameras. I think Canon has done quite a good job in making sure their product is user friendly. Even the physical interface is clutter free. You can see they have put a lot of thought into optimising the space around the camera. Holding the camera for shooting and navigating menus seems very natural.<br />There is a slight lag time with the shutter. This is a small problem, especially with kids as the subject.<br />You can choose the resolution of the photos very easily. I use Superfine when I know I want to blow up the picture to 8R and 10R. The camera came with a 32 MB CF Card as well as an extra 128 MB Card. I can store 96 pictures at Fine resolution on the 128MB CF Card. I have enlarged photos taken with this camera to 10R photos. No problems.<br />Manual mode allows you to choose things like shutter speed and exposure as well as a few nifty things like Black and White, Sepia etc. Rarely used but nifty nonetheless. I have used the long exposure for some nightshots, using a tripod. I've never succesfully done that with a compact camera before this.<br />The ability for me to go through my photographs, to pick and choose as well as edit a few details before I send them to the developers is INCREDIBLE. Well worth the price of shelling out the cash for a good camera.<br />Connecting to my Win XP laptop with the USB cable(included) was a breeze. The installed software(s) is very good for managing the pictures but does take up a sizable chink of the hard drive.<br />Extras:<br />1) Camera Orientation. The camera knows if the picture taken was vertical or horizontal.<br />2) Photostitch - A feature that makes it A LOT easier to create those long panorama-like pictures by joing seperate photos. Comes with the software for this. Almost but still not quite seamless.<br />Could improve:<br />1) No Battery meter. You are only informed when the battery has like 5-10 minutes of power left. Guess I might need to invest in an extra battery.<br />2) Slight Shutter lag.<br />3) Photo size. I notice that when I send the photos for developing, the picture width is slightly cropped. I don't know if this is because the print paper here is not international standard? But it's slightly irritating that I have to be aware of this fact before i shoot.","This camera is simply the best in its class. If you want a camera that has incredible photo quality, small so you can take anywhere this is the one. I previously had a Sony (DSCP-92 in which I unfortunately lost, 4.0 MP as well) and it doesn't even compare to this Canon S400, the pictures come out a lot clearer and way, way less blurry pictures, as my Sony took many, many blurry pictures. Canon's battery also lasts a little longer but still should be improved. The flash is also not its best, but it does well for its size. I definitely recommend this camera if you would like to have a camera to take anywhere, and just take pictures randomly and get amazing photo quality.","I think this is a great camera.  I purchased a 256MB Flash Card, and w/ it set on the highest resolution & quality it will fit 250 pictures!  That's enough for me.  The image is beautiful - bright, crisp, clear.  The colors are excellent!  I have the flash set to auto, and I haven't had any problems.  The camera has been perfect so far.  It's small, and excellent quality for this price.","This is a great camera, I love it and even though when I bought it a year ago it cost quite a bit, I have never regretted it.<br />I have two batteries for it, one battery was just not enough for heavy usage of it.  I can get about a full day of heavy picture taking with one battery.  Ive gotten over 500 pictures taken with it on one battery, though sometimes i get much less. My premium memory card i bought ive noticed has greatly increased the battery length. Since there is no power-remaining display, it is hard to judge how much power you have left until it's too late.  Two batteries I find works great.  They charge rather quick.<br />The 32MB card that comes with the camera is fine if you dont mind taking lower resoultion pictures with it, but I liked taking pictures at the max settings; I filled up that 32mb card in a few minutes you might guess.  So, I went out and bought a premium 1GB flash card.  I can usually fill it up with about 400 pictures just before the battery dies.<br />The picture quality is great. In light the automatic settings are fine.  In the dark though, unless you use the flash, you will need to learn how to set the manual ISO and exposure settings because the automatic settings (flashless) arent so great in the dark as motions get really blurred.  A long exposure set in the dark also makes things become rather 'grainy', it still takes a rather nice picture.<br />The camera it self is rather heavy for its size i find, but it is a really sturdy design.  Ive dropped it on concrete many of times with only a slight scratch.  AS you can tell i abuse this camera pretty heavily, but it still keeps on working.  The trigger button recently has started to get stuck a bit sometimes when pushed, but i think that is due to my abuse of it.<br />the movie clip mode is pretty simple.  It only can take 3min clips with sound, 3 mins is okay though i wish it was unlimited.  The video quality is ok, but you cant zoom or get it to auto-adjust the exposure while recording.  THe sound recording quality could be improved, especially with being able to pick up heavy bass.  Heavy bass just seems to saturate the sound recording with a loud rumbling garble.  What im trying to say is that you cant use this to record sounds when you're at the movies or at a concert.<br />This camera has a lot more to it then that, but everything else about this camera just seems to be just the way i want it.  It really is a great camera that will do a great job for taking pictures for a long long time to come.","I bought this camera last year after my beloved S100 died after two years of faithful service.  The S100 was a prime example of how more megapixels does not equal better quality photos.  I took some panoramas while skiing in Banff.  One I blew up to 11x14 and it's simply breathtaking, always commented on by people who see it in my apartment.  And that was with a 2MP camera.  The S400 is similar to its predecessors, except for the higher resolution and 9 point autofocus & DIGIC processor.<br />For well-lit situations, this camera simply can't be beat.  You can also use the photo-stitch feature to take huge panoramas.  Enough can't be said about the fact that this camera is truly portable.  It's only a little more obtrusive than a cell phone sitting in your pocket, and it's right there for you if you ever need to capture a moment, either with a still shot or video (which is surprisingly high quality).  The battery is great - easily lasts a day of shooting photos - just recharge overnight and you're good to go.  It uses CF cards, which can be had dirt cheap these days, and work with almost any adaptor.  (This comes in handy if, say, you run out of room while on vacation and need to download to a CD - most internet cafe's will have a CF-cardreader, while the same cannot be said of, say, a memory stick.)<br />Drawbacks of this model are:<br />(1) Slow response time between pressing the shutter button and taking the picture.  It's hard to capture those moments that require split-second response (baby smiling, etc.) unless you use continuous shooting.  To be fair, this is a drawback of nearly any consumer-level digital cam.<br />(2) Poor performance in low light.  For some reason, pictures tend to get grainy when taken in low light.  This can often be made up for using photo editing software, and I've gotten big compliments on wedding photos I've taken in very dark settings.  However, the graininess comes out even in outdoor/cloudy situations.  A drawback.<br />Some things I've figured out after using this camera for awhile:<br />(1) You don't have to use the (included) TV adaptor to watch your photos on TV.  All you need is a stereo headphone jack to RCA cable adaptor, available at any Radio Shack.  Using this solution allows you to show/browse your photos on TV while sitting farther away.  Video goes to the red/right channel, audio goes to the white/left channel.<br />(2) Battery charges very quickly.<br />(3) Included photo software is the best of any I've seen yet at getting out red-eye.  On Macs, is OSX-native.  Pics are easily imported into iPhoto.  Use GraphicConverter for manipulating contrast/brightness/quality/etc.<br />All in all, this is a great camera.  You won't be disappointed.","I purchased this camera in January of 2004 and by Easter 2004 it had been sent back in three times for repair.  Canon's Factory Service Center in Elk Grove Village, IL is very poor.  There is no toll free number to call and you're often left to wait on hold (long distance).  The camera had a problem with the pins in the CF memory slot which subsequently ruined three CF memory cards.  The manager at the Factory Service Center told me you should only use Canon compact flash cards or you could invalidate the warranty. However, when the camera worked I liked it's features and size.","After doing my homework at CNET product reviews I decided that ELPH S 400 was a perfect fit for me. The color and detail in my opinion is just about perfect. I upload my pictures to ofoto.com (my pick for on line photo development by the way) completely unedited and they the come back true to the moment in tone and detail. Another plus is that the camera is idiot proof (I should know). There are advanced features but I find that I really just use a few of them like white balance settings and the macro and infinity modes close/distance shots. Unless you are a very serious photo hobbyist, this camera is perfect in my opinion.","First things first.  I LOVE this camera!  This is my third digital camera and the first one that didn't have me thinking about what I would want in my next one.  I had been researching a number of cameras including the Canon G3 and subsequently the G4 - both excellent as well.  And then a friend and an avid digital photographer (anyone who will spend entire weekends adjusting, tweaking etc their photos in Photoshop is pretty avid to me) suggested I take a good look at his S400 and read some of the reviews.  And then he said something to me that, once I thought about it, really hit home.  He said ... \"because this camera is so small (about the size of a deck of cards) you will take it with you everywhere.  You'll leave the house with it in situations where you would not \"pack up\" another larger camera. It's like taking your wallet.\"  The more I thought about this the more I remembered myself having to \"decide\" if I was going to bring my current and prior cameras with me and liking the idea of not having to \"decide\".<br />Well ... I've had it for more than a year and my friend was absolutely correct.  I bring it with me everywhere without a thought.  There is no \"packing up\" the camera and it is not an inconvenience to have it in my pocket.  The Canon leather case actually has a belt loop so you can carry it that way as well.  Over the past year or so I've taken great pix that I never would have taken otherwise because my camera would not have been with me otherwise.  The quality is outstanding and there are more than enough manual adjustments to suit most. Even though I have an excellent Canon Camcorder I find myself using the S400 for short 10-15 second clips of my daughter, my pets, co-workers behaving foolishly etc.  I even like the software that came with the package - something very rare for me.<br />Bravo Canon!","If you're buying a digital camera, you should really consider size and form. Too small, and you have to compromise with features such as screen size. Too big and you lose the convenience of being able to drop the camera in your pocket on the way out the door.<br />I found this camera to be the perfect blend of size, style, and function. It takes great pictures, decent video, and the battery life is as good as any other camera I've had before (although it doesn't give much notice before giving out).<br />Canon is putting out great products these days, and this is one of them. I highly reccomend it.","This is a pretty decent camera.  BUT one thing you REALLY need to get is a spare battery.  Why?  You never know when you're going to lose the juice!  It gives you about two picture warning before it goes dead.  I consider this to be a MAJOR design flaw.  Soooo, heed my warning and get a spare battery for this one.  You can get good alternative to OEM batteries on eBay for 3-bucks!","The first time I played with this great camera I was concerned about its tiny size... But once I played with it... I was so happy I decided to bought it!<br /> PROS:<br /> 1. SIZE: the smallest 4mp camera you can find.<br /> 2. SPEED: unbeatable start-up velocity!<br /> 3. MENUS: they are really easy to navigate.<br /> 4. BATTERY: last longer than AA's.<br /> 5. PORTABLE: (pocketable!) you can take it anywhere!<br /> 6. PRICE: going down!<br /> 7. CHARGER: no cables at all!<br /> 8. DESIGN: its clean. only the buttons you really need.<br /> 9. LENS: retractable, well protected.<br />10. PICTURE Q: the quality of its pictures is superb... I had a canon G2 and they are not to far from each other... I miss the tilt screen but now I can put it on my pocket.<br /> CONS:<br /> 1. LCD: small, unprotected. U have to be carefull with it.<br /> 2. BATTERY: can't recharge it inside of the camera.<br /> 3. NOTHING ELSE!","S400 Review:<br />It took me several weeks of research before I finally purchased the S400.<br />I had been looking for a higher mega-pixel replacement for my (excellent) Fuji MX-1700).  My first stop was Fuji, since the quality of images produced by my MX-1700 is excellent, and the camera is extremely durable and easy to use, not to mention that it looks very cool and is ergonomically well designed.  But, the latest Fuji products are simply too expensive.  So, I then toyed with a variety of cameras including the Canon G5, Nikon 5400, Olympus C5050/5060 and a whole host of others.  In the end, I went for small with reasonable power.<br />Now, I'm glad that I did!<br />The first thing that I noticed, right out of the box, is how well put together the S400 is.  It exudes quality.  It looks great and it feels solid.  Everything is small, which means that people with larger hands may find it a little 'fiddly' (I would recommend that anybody who is thinking of buying an S400 should first go to a local store, and actually handle one), but everything is neatly laid out.  The camera makes good use of what space is available, and most everything is reasonably logical and intuitive.<br />Now that I have had the camera for a few weeks, I can also state that the quality of the images is also very good.  I have taken a few hundred shots, and the only complaint that I have, is some (minor) vignetting when at full wide angle using the flash.  The battery life is good and I have taken considerably greater than 200 shots with the display turned off and at least 150 with the display on.<br />One of my major concerns when purchasing the camera was the flash.  Several of the reviews that I read had stated that the flash was \"puny\", so I was nervous when I first used it.  But, I'm not sure what kind of camera those reviewers were comparing the S400 too.  The flash is perfectly acceptable.  Sure, it's not a Vivitar Pro flash than can shoot 60ft, but it's just as good as any other flash on any other point-and-shoot camera.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br />In just a few short weeks, the S400 has taken a place in my heart.  I still have my MX-1700, which is now being handed down to my 7-year-old daughter, but the S400 is the camera that travels everywhere with me.  I got a Lowepro DS8 case, which fits it like a glove, and is ideal for day-to-day carrying.<br />As a final point, I should say that I have played a little with the movie capture mode of the S400, and was very pleasantly surprised.  I thought that it was nothing more than a gimmick.  But, I took a few minutes of video of my daughters, downloaded it to my PowerBook and then uploaded into iMovie.  It actually looks reasonable!  Obviously, it's not really of DVD quality, but if something was happening in front of you that you absolutely HAD to get on record, it's good enough.<br />So, provided you are looking for a small, easy to use, reasonable image-quality, ergonomically pleasing point-and-shoot camera, then the S400 is excellent.  If you want something a little more `professional', get a Nikon D70 - they are REALLY nice.","I can say that the canon was definitely worth the $$ that I spent on it.  Just like all cameras, there are pros and cons.<br />PROS:<br />-DURABLE:<br />I took the camera up on the ski slopes of vermont to<br />  take action shots and it held up to the beating I gave<br />  it when I took a spill.  Now I don't know if I'd<br />  recommend this to anyone else, but I just wrapped it<br />  up in some toilet paper to absorb any moisture and<br />  put it into a ZIPLOCK bag and placed the camera in my<br />  front pocket of my ski pants.  Dangerous I know.  But<br />  nothing broke.  Still works fine.<br />-BATTERY LIFE:<br />Now I don't have a spare battery, but the battery did<br />  last a full week of taking about 100 pictures w/o<br />  recharging at all while I was down in Dominican<br />  Republic.  Granted I didn't scroll through the pictures<br />  that I had taken to conserve battery life only b/c I<br />  forgot to bring the charger with me.  I did have the<br />  lcd on while I took my pictures.<br />-PORTABLE:<br />The camera is small enough to fit inside your pants<br />  pocket and fits nicely in the inside part of your<br />  sports jacket for those occasions that require<br />  suit and tie.  I didn't want to carry my camera<br />  in one of those small camera bags b/c then I would<br />  either have to put it on a belt (which isnt' to my<br />  taste) or it would be too bulky for the pocket.  So<br />  I decided to just use a ZIPLOCK bag to keep the dirt<br />  and water out, which worked out fine when I was<br />  shoveling sand and rocks into the cement mixer.<br />-PICTURE QUALITY:<br />Overall the quality is good.  I've used the camera w/o<br />  the flash several times to get the same light<br />  contrasts that you would see in real life instead of<br />  lighting up the object and having a darker<br />  background (just my preference).  That normally works<br />  out fine, but sometimes I have to lighten the picture<br />  up a little after downloading the picture.  I've had<br />  no problems w/using the flash in my pictures.<br />CONS:<br />-LCD:<br />  This probably occurs w/ other cameras, but just as a<br />  heads up, watch out for the plastic piece on the camera<br />  wrist strap.  If positioned right (or rather not right),<br />  the plastic piece can scratch up the lcd when stored in<br />  the pocket or wherever you store it b/c it could rub<br />  against the screen.<br />-I'm sure there are other cons, but that's all that sticks out<br /> right now.<br />-COMMENTS:<br /> I normally use the superfine, small picture mode so<br />  that the file is small enough for my friends and<br />  family who have hotmail accounts.  They can get<br />  several pictures w/o completely filling up their<br />  mailboxes.<br />  Downloading to computer is quick and easy.  I haven't<br />  upgraded to a larger memory card, but I would if I<br />  was going to be taking several pictures and videos<br />  before downloading, which I isn't a problem for me.<br />  Videos is where it starts to eat up the memory.<br />  Anyway, hopefully this review helped.  Good luck<br />  shopping.","I got it for Valentine's day and so far I am very happy with it.  The software is also great and easy to use (I used to have a Kodak camera and believe me, this is much better).  Also, battery life is excellent.<br />Manual controls and difficult to use, but after a while you learn the basic logic of the menus.","I purchased 2x of the S200s.  My first died in a rafting trip trying to escape the undertow of Idaho's Selway River \"<br />The Ladle\", a Class IV rapid.  Never again.  Needless to say, water and electronics don't mix.  Immediately after returning, I purchased another S200.<br />Now I own an S400 and what a great camera.  Big tip.  Get the Mizar Gallery scope.  It fits over the S400 lens and takes 10x zoom photos....and 30x microscope photos.  Wow!","I'm gonna make this very short. Order surely received in 7 (seven) days by UPS ground as it claimed. This is the second time I shop at Amazon.com and so far the service is 5-stars, and moreover the price+S/H are just right compared to others such as pricegrabber.com or mysimon.com. Keep the good service, Amazon!","Before you buy the S400, you should know it's already over one and a half years old, so it's in the process of being discontinued -- hence the low price on Amazon and elsewhere, even though this list price is still high.  That said, this is still probably the best consumer-grade digital camera on the market today.  Let me expound.<br />First, 4-MP is the perfect resolution for day-to-day photography.  That is, if you are a pro photographer and need the best resolution, you probably want 5+ megapixels.  But for us normal mortals, 4MP is already more than enough.  You can crop your pictures and still make great 8\"x10\" blow-up prints.  A year ago I would have recommended a 3-MP camera, but right now you can get this 4-MP camera for cheaper than a 3-MP a year ago, so go for this one.<br />Is more pixels always better?  Not necessarily.  More pixels mean bigger files as well as slower save speed, so it's best to strike a balance between resolution and speed, and 4 MP should be good enough.<br />Second, the picture quality on this Canon is just excellent.  Earlier models of Canon (esp. the Digital Elph line) tended to underexpose and yield cold color tones, but the S400 does a very good job of keeping a natural, slightly warmer color range.  The pictures are still a little bit softer than sharp images captured by Nikon SLR's, but overall you'll be pleased by the picture quality, both indoors and outdoors.  The flash range could be longer, but the same can be said of all built-in flash units.<br />The camera is easy to set up and use, and transfering pictures to Windows XP is a piece of cake.  The build quality is top-notch.  I highly recommend this camera.","I have bough this camera after extensive research. A very good review site is at [...]<br />I got this camera because it the perfect balance of quality, reliability,compactness and simplicity. These are enough to make it a \"winner\" traveller's camera. It is the perfect design. I carry it in my front pocket, not bothersome at all.<br />If you are looking for more controls, go for bigger models like A80 in the same price range.<br />This camera still has many essential controls you would need. One thing I wish it had is fast shutter. This can only be achieved in continous mode. It can picture a 40 mph moving car as it was still.<br />Extremely user friendly, very good material. Not perfect battery life. May need extra battery for trips.<br />I would strongly recommend it to every traveller who wants to take good pictures with minimum hassle %90 of the time.<br />The conclusion is, Canon rules the digital camera world. This camera rules the ultra compact world.","I just got a new s400 after giving up my s200. The finish on the s400 is far less durable than the titanium-like finish on the s200. The s200 seems to focus faster in spot mode than the s400, possibly because of the more advanced sensors and programming in the s400. The s200 was a great camera and produced superb results. I'm still very impressed with the s400. I like the Canon digitals far better than the others at this price point. I considered the s45, s50, G5, and A80 cameras. I may still have to exchange this for the A80 because of the pivoting display which I think is a fantastic feature. I will do some more testing and pass on my conclusions.","After having gone through countless Kodak brank cameras (each one broke) I deceded to go for the ultra sleek Canon Elf series.  While this advantax film camera served me well for many years (and is stil in great condition) I got tired of developing my film only to find that that my favorite picture wasn't quite right.  So I decided to step out into the 21st century and go digital... AND I AM NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!!  This little camera easily fits in my purse or pocket, has a great zoom and lots of extra fun features to play around with.  I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who wants a small, sleek, great performing, easy to use, brand name digital camera.  NOTE: before checking out buy a larger memory card and the PSC-50 soft leather case since it comes with no case and only a 32MB card.","Then look no further.  The S400 is so small you can practically take it anywhere.  It will easily fit in a jacket pocket.  You'll barely notice the weight in your backpack or purse.  A friend of mine wears it on a lanyard around his neck.  I've even carried mine in the front pocket of my jeans!<br />Yes, the S400 is a small digicam.  As a result, it leaves out many features that might be desired by more advanced photographers (manual focus, aperture/shutter priority, flash exposure compensation,...).  But for the majority of people, the S400 is an excellent point-and-shoot digicam.  If you don't need 4MP, then consider the 3MP Canon S300.<br />Sure, there are smaller digicams out there, made by various manufacturers, but most of the smaller digicams lack an optical zoom.  If you can live without the optical zoom and you want something smaller, consider the 5MP Canon SD10 or a camera from the credit card-sized Casio Elixim series.<br />If you do not need a small digicam, you may want to save some money and go with a Canon A70 or A80.  These cameras, which have larger grips, are especially a good choice for people with larger hands.  Where the S400 feels like it might slip out of the hands, the A70/A80 provide an excellent grip.<br />One final note: if you like water activities, Canon makes a waterproof housing for many of their cameras (S400, A70/A80, etc.).  I don't currently own a waterproof housing, but I am considering one to use when I go fishing.  These housings are also excellent for snorkeling.","I'm very happy with this camera.  It works just as the specifications provided says it should, and the quality of my pictures is outstanding.  The unit is compact and solid in my hand, and all functions are easy to use and adjust quickly after only a small amount of practice.  There are many different shooting options and you can manually adjust many exposure settings.<br />Most of the photos I've taken so far have a very \"snapshot\"-ish quality to them--nothing very impressive, artistically speaking.  The flash washes out colors up close (like flashes do) and shooting in low light is difficult if you don't have a steady surface to rest the camera; however, when the settings are properly adjusted to the environment, you can get some amazing pictures.  Sometimes I'll come across a shot and say, \"Holy cow! Did *I* take this? It's beautiful!\"<br />My only real gripe with this camera is that it didn't come with any helpful extras.  One battery, charger and 32MB memory card--that's it.  It would have been nice if they at least included a little cloth bag to keep it in until you purchase a case for it--and yes, you WILL want a case for this camera.  The 32MB compactflash card is good for starters, but it will fill up very quickly, and unless you're not going to use the video capture and you're willing to constantly do on-the-fly image selection--i.e. deleting pictures directly from the camera before you download them to your computer in order to make room for more (this is not difficult, but a nusiance when you would rather take pictures)--you will definitely want an upgrade.  Not much can be said for the proprietary battery except that it lasts about as long as you would expect it to.  A second battery is a must if you're out taking pictures all day long.  The charger is conveniently cord-free and plugs directly into the wall.  You can easily grab the whole unit and stuff it in a small bag with your camera for travelling.<br />And to the reviewer who complained that the flash mode isn't saved when you power-down: True, if you leave your camera in the normal, automatic mode, the flash will default to \"on\" every time you power-up your camera--but if you use the \"manual\" mode, it will remember the flash setting, even when you take out the battery.  I usually shoot in the manual mode, then when I need to take a really quick picture and I'm just not sure about the settings, I flip over to automatic and point and shoot.<br />I recommend this camera, but be aware that you'll probably want to spend at least another $50 - $100 on the following accessories right away:<br />Small case - I found one locally that fit the whole kit perfectly for less than $10<br />Spare battery - Use the genuine Canon part--people have reported problems with 3rd party batteries<br />Large CF memory card - 256MB seems to be the gold standard, but don't forget that write/access speed is almost as important as size","I own a 10D which I absolutely love  and was getting tired of using my old Olympus Epic (a GREAT film camera) and was looking for a good digital point and shoot.  My two major candidates were the S400 and the S50.<br />If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the S400 vs the S50.  The S50 offers excellent manual controls while the S400 is significantly smaller without any manual control whatsoever other than exposure compensation.  I just LOVE the look and feel of the S400 though if anything it could be argued that it is TOO small.  If you feel it is and you are looking for a carry everywhere camera it is well worth the effort to get used to the small size because the camera takes beautiful pictures.<br />The S400 is simply beautiful.  I can live without all the manual controls since I own the 10D and since this camera is primarily for my wife and for me when I don't want to lug the 10D around.<br />Several have pointed out that since this camera is so small it will always be with you whereas the S50 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size.  This is a very good argument!  The camera is SUBSTANTIALLY smaller than its bigger brother the S50.  The form and size factors are what finally won me over.<br />One criticism of the camera.  Low light focusing is less than ideal.  You need to work with the camera to understand its limitations indoors.<br />I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, Canon  currently represents the state of the art.","Simple to use, yet produces great quality photos. I was also considering SD-10 because of its size. I personally think that SD-10 is a bit too small. For some people, it may be a little difficult to hold SD-10 steady when using it. That was the case for me and instead, I decided to get S400.<br />Importing the images to my Mac was so easy. It comes with the software for both Windows and Mac, but if you use iPhoto, no need to install the included software. The iPhoto will automatically recognizes the camera.<br />As so many people have recommended here, you should consider getting a larger CF card. At the maximum resolution of 2272 x 1704, each image will be 1.2 to 1.5 MB. At 1600 x 1200, it will be about 800 to 900 KB.<br />It is a great digital camera for someone like me, a casual point-and-shoot user.","The only reason I gave this four stars is that, even though this camera is amazing (read the other reviews) it does not have the ability to put a date stamp on the images it produces. Therefore, when you download the images to your computer, you have to devise some clever way to do it yourself. Other than that, this camera is miles ahead of any other camera I've seen.","I wanted a very small digital camera to supplement my Nikon film SLR.  The S400 fit the bill.  The quality is excellent, the size perfect, and the pictures very sharp.  The red-eye problem noted by other users simply isn't an issue, as all software products offer red-eye correction.  I take a lot of shots and am pretty demanding.  I did a lot of research and comparisons before buying.  This is a good camera.","This is one of the best cameras out there.  The Canon PowerShot S400 4MP Digital Camera has many options and works great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This camera is the best thing I have come upon. I LOVE IT! I use it all the time and the picture quality are great. You won't regret buying this camera. There are so many neat features with it and endless opportunities. Worth every dollar. So go buy yours now! =)","This is the best compact camera I can find.  Picture quality is excellent, plenty of manual adjustments for the casual user, build quality is superb.  This camera is worth the money if you really want good prints.  Much better than the Casio and Pentax compacts.","I had a friend shoot digital pics of my wedding with my new PowerShot S400.  They came back sharper than my photographers (and a heck of a lot faster and cheaper, too!!!!)  I combined these pictures with an IWeD from anchordigital.com and had a beautiful digital keepsake collection in both digital pics and now a DVD as well.<br />Highly recommended for high-quality digital pics.  Just don't tell your photographer that he's got competition!","I bought this camera about 2 months ago to take to Afghanistan on my year long deployment. It fit all my requirements; small, 4 MP, and video. Perfect! It out shines my other camera, a 4.1 MP Sony. Recommend it to any soldier!","I use it almost every day and I have absolutely no regrets about buying this camera, the battery life is good, the memory card holds enough pictures I need for the day, the resolution is great, I can upload my pictures to the web or even print them and they look excellent either way. I would recommend this product to any person who wants an excellent camera for a great price.","I've had this camera for about 9 months and have taken about 1000 pictures.  It is my second digital camera (my previous being a Nikon Coolpix 950, which I used for about 3 years).<br />Strengths:  Size (obviously), battery life (I've never run out of juice in a single day), speed to turn on (about 3 seconds), ease of reviewing pics, minimovies (more fun than I'd anticipated), image quality (if lighting is adequate).<br />Disappointments:  More shutter lag than I'd hoped for, lack of manual controls (I knew that going in, but I do miss the flexibility I had with my Nikon), blurry pics in even moderate light without a flash (don't know if the shape makes it difficult to hold steady or if it's just a slower lens), more image noise than I'd like in ISO selections beyond 100.<br />I did have to send the camera back to Canon once -- I turned on the camera while there was light pressure on the lens and the whole thing became inoperable.  They returned the camera in less than 2 weeks, which I thought was reasonable.<br />In summary, this has been a nice little camera.  You're definitely trading off some flexibility for the size (Canon's G-4 isn't much more money and their A-80 is priced comparably.)  I find the images to be quite good.  The flash renders accurate flesh tones, unlike my old Nikon.  The biggest single negative for me is the shutter lag.  To capture moments well, you really need to be prepared, with the shutter halfway depressed (to lock in the focus).<br />For a very detailed review, check out dpreview.  They're pretty evenhanded.","This latest PowerShot is really a well balanced effort. Amazingly, even as the features list has grown, the cameras themselves have gotten smaller. As always, the body is a sturdy steel structure that is durable but not too heavy.<br />The 4 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for anything you can imagine, including shooting images for poster-sized enlargement. In fact, for anything routine, including keeping your options open for 8\" x 10\" enlargements, you'll probably want to dial the resolution down to 2 megapixels (this will make your digital files smaller and easier to transfer and will take up less space on the camera's memory card and will ultimately use less of the camera's battery capacity). There is a nice 3X optical zoom, as well as a less useful digital zoom. The movie feature has been enhanced, with 3 minutes of good quality video *with* sound now available.<br />Of drawbacks there are a few. As with all of these digicams, the included memory card is too small to be of much use, so you are forced into an extra purchase right off the bat. The Canon battery, while offering pretty good staying power, is nonetheless a proprietary one, meaning you won't be able to get a back up from anyone but Canon. Lastly, it is a bit late in the game to still be using a USB 1.1 transfer protocol. Were the camera USB 2.0 ready, images could be transferred from the camera directly to your computer 40 times faster. As it stands, you'll want to purchase a separate card reader to handle this task.<br />All of the above notwithstanding, this is a marvellous camera that anyone would be happy to have.","This camera takes fantastic outdoor shots of all types.  When it comes to taking pictures of people-- say indoors at night-- you get a lot of Red Eye.  There is a Red Eye reduction mode but it does not appear to help much.  I wish I could recommend this camera but I cannot on account of the Red Eye problem, especially since a lot of my photography is indoors: casual shots of family and friends.  Bottom line: a good camera but beware of the red eye problem if you are taking flash pictures of people.","I graduated from a PowerShot S100 to the S400.<br />Between the two cameras I've shot approximately 5,000 images.<br />That's the point.<br />You will carry the S400 with you because it's small, and you'll shoot a lot of images because it's easy to use. Over time you will find the major contributing factor to good images is sheer volume. Simply put, the more shots you take the more likely you'll capture a good image.<br />Sure, you can buy cameras that have more megapixels and more features. Unfortunately they come with more heft. Once you've shoved a camera in your pocket, you'll no longer want one hanging from your neck. You can buy smaller cameras. But for me, this one feels just right. It slips into a pocket with ease. It's easy to hold and shoot. And it's not so small it feels fussy and insubstantial when you're taking pictures; it's just big enough that it won't disappear. Judging by my first camera, which has been dropped and repeatedly sat upon (I'm telling you, it's small) and used so much the buttons are almost worn out, build quality is excellent.<br />The quality of your exposures on full auto will amaze you. White balance has been significantly improved since my S100, and whether shooting indoors or out the camera reproduces skin tones very well. (90 percent of everything you're likely to shoot will have a person in it, and if they look funny, the image looks funny. Skin tone matters.) If you're careful (good light, tripod) you can print enlargements to 8x10. Whether you print your own on today's better printers (use photo paper) or send them off to Shutterfly or the equivalent, in most cases they'll pass for film, rivaling even your best point-and-shoot cameras.<br />Don't forget that unlike film, when it comes to digital photos you get a second chance because you can retouch your digital photos on your computer. You can use the supplied software or whatever came with your computer or pop for Adobe Photoshop Elements and \"fix\" many common mistakes, like red-eye. You may also find that you'll like shooting high resolution images to make prints from, then use your photo editing software to reduce the image quality, and hence size, for easy emailing. Despite my best intentions, most of my images live on the computer and not in printed photo albums. At 72 dots per inch (computer screen resolution) they look fabulous. By contrast, paper prints are 300 dots per inch, and far less forgiving. It's also cheaper to email an image--no paper cost, no ink cost, no postage.<br />Film is still better than digital for a lot of technical reasons. The non-technical reason is the pictures look better. Especially if you're making big 8x10, 11 1/2 x 14 prints. But if what you're really going to be doing is point and shoot, do yourself a favor. Hang a full gallon of milk around the back of your neck and just reread this. That pain and the image library I've amassed explain why my very nice, very expensive Nikon film SLR, with its very nice lenses and very spiffy flash have been sitting in a closet for the last two years. And why I wouldn't consider carrying a camera much larger than an tin of Altoids.<br />Two final comments. One, after being inundated with my digital photos and then getting their hands on camera, my wife, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law all own digital Elfs. Two, with the three minute movie mode this little camera will likely replace your video camera as well.","Ok, I haven't received it yet, but the anticipation is worthy of four stars.  Quite noteworthy: the day following my order (just prior to shipment), the price dropped another 30 bucks.  I quickly wrote customer service, and within minutes had a $30.00 refund.  Bravo to Amazon's prompt service and attention!","I am a US Army soldier deployed in Iraq.  I bought this camera just one day before I left the states so that I may preserve my experience for my familly.  I've gotta tell ya, of all the things I got in preparation for my year long tour this takes the cake!  The 4.0 megapixel pictures are CRYSTAL clear, and the interface is wonderfull.  I am a Mac user myself and downloading my pictures is a snap.  When I'm not around my computer, but one of my buddies is on his PC - zip, bam, boom, he's got pics just as easy.  The video isn't super 8, but it IS a whole lot better than I expected from a digital camera not much bigger than a deck of cards, and three minutes (with audio) goes a really long way!<br />The extras are nice.  All the sounds the camera makes are changeable, and you can even record your own right there without hooking up to a computer!  It's rugged as hell too.  I spend a lot of time in the dirt out here and the camera has yet to fail me, nor has it taken any damage from all the bumping around that happens in my daily desert exsistance.<br />The software included with the camera might be one of my favorite features.  There is a photo editor, a video editor, and a zoom browser.  I have iPhoto for the mac, but I find myself using the cannon software more often!  The video editor is great.  My wife sent me a little model tank.  When I got it together I had an idea....so I took about 100 pictures and made my own little stop motion animation film, with a soundtrack and everything!  The zoom browser is nothing short of awesome.  It helps you D/L your pictures fast and easily and will also erase your camera's flash card for you so you can start fresh (out here it's hard to find new ones).  It also contains a program called \"photo stitch\" that pieces pictures together for you to create a panoramic picture.<br />All in all I've got to say this camera is incredible.  Whether experienced with digital cameras, or if this is your first, you'll have nothing but fun with it.  Spare yourself frustration...BUY THIS CAMERA!","I have been using the camera for 6 months and its the ultimate camera for quality and compactness. Only weak thing is the flash, especially red eye function, it just does not work...<br />I am very happy with it and reccomend it.","This is a biased review! I owned an S100 for over three years. I loved it! The S400 is even better. A lot of nice features, same great form factor, a longer zoom and twice the pixels! The buttons are all in the right places. The menus are easy to use. The camera body, the lens, color fidelity, CCD signal/noise ratio and everything else is of superb quality. Both the LCD and the viewfinder are very bright. The pictures are great! BTW, I have researched and tried all the other brands in this form factor. Casio Exilim perhaps comes in second.","I was asked to shop for a 4MP camera for an organization with which I am heavily involved. I recently took over the duties of official photographer. This little camera takes marvelous sharp clear pictures. It easily fits into a shirt pocket. I've only had it a few days and have much to learn about all of its features. I had purchased a digital camera (not a Canon) a few years ago which promptly malfunctioned at the end of the one year warranty. I swore I'd never have another digital. I also own a Ricoh manual SLR 35mm and an auto everything Pentax SLR 35mm camera. This camera will round out my collection. This little camera will cretainly be the most used as it it much more convenient to keep with me at all times due to its diminutive size.","Amazing resolution, incredible easy to use but at the same time it offers some advanced features.... this camera is very good option for those like me starting in Digital Photography.... Just add more memory (128 at least...) and a extra battery (you will need it!!) and is the perfect companion for your trips...","OMG! i just got this cam a week ago...less than a week ago and the price is lower now????? That is soo jacked up!  I like the cam and all but I shoulda waited...The price went down 1 day after i ordered this cam! So NOT Fair..For those who wanna get this cam just wait a while til the price goes down.  Ur gunna regret it like I did! I paid 399.99 just a week ago!! =/  Disappointed at that..that is why I gave only 4 stars instead of 5.  Its a great little cam.  Pictures come out greater than I thought. This is my first digital cam but when I compare to my friends digi cams its soo much clearer.  dunno how the battery lasts. That is one bad thing!  It doesn't tell you how much battery power is left!","I got this camera as a present and I have to say, it's really cool. The size makes it unbeleivably easy to carry to parties, to concerts, to anything! The pictures come exceptionally clearer than any other camera I've had before even when printed. The smart flash gives the perfect amount of light to make any scene seem like it was during the day without bleaching colors or creating obscure shadows.<br />The problem with the camera is that I'm not srue the price was worth it. Looking at pictures taken by a less expensive, less megapixel Canon digital and then at ones from the Elph, I couldn't discern which was from which camera. If you want to save money, but don't mind lugging a larger more bulkier camera, get a cheaper Canon. But for those who are willing to spend the money and have a camera that is significantly smaller and more compact, get the Elph. Either way you can't go wrong.","This is digital camera #3 for me.  The first two were Epson's and ok (the first one wasn't even 1mp).  The second one was 3.2 mp - nice and lots of features - but somewhat bulky for travel and lots of delay not only between pressing and actual taking of picture - but between shots too.<br />This camera is great.  Compact and solid.  Portability is great when toting it around on trips, etc. Though small, it is still extremely easy to operate.  The time between pics is fast.  The pictures themselves are very good.  The display is crisp.<br />The best feature:  photo-stitch.  The ability to take panoramic pics w/this camera is great.  Take a pic, see where it ends, line up the next one  and patch together.  The video features seem nice, but I've rarely used them on any other camera and not sure I will here either.<br />I probably could do w/a 3mp camera - but the price for the 4mp wasn't much more.  The price was decent for what I needed.<br />Good purchase.","Great camera.  There are many different options to shoot and review photos/movies.  It is a nice looking, excellent functioning product.  I love it.","I got the S400 to replace a Olympus Stylus Digital 300 (3.2 mp) that I returned because the reviews said it was medicore compared to other ultracompact 3.2MP cameras out there. The Olympus would have been my first digital camera. I got the S400 instead based on it's excellent reviews, even though I thought it was expensive. Out of curiosity I tested the S400 by taking pictures of the same things and places I had with the Stylus 300. I then compared pictures from the two cameras. Based on the reviews on CNET and other sites I expected the S400 pictures to be much better than the Stylus 300. They were not. The S400 pictures were a little sharper, but the Stylus 300 pictures had more vibrant colors. The S400 pictures were more natural, but the Stylus 300 pictures were more eye catching because of those colors. The Canon's low light pictures were significantly better than the Olympus. I found Olympus software much easier to use than Canon's. I paid $...for the S400. The 4 mega-pixel version of the Stylus can be had for $...after the current...rebate. Overall, I was happier with the Stylus pictures than with the S400's. I'll likely return the Canon S400 and get the Olympus Stylus 400 and save $...","... this camera is the best compact digital on the market.<br /><br />Sure, there are 5 megapixel compact cameras out now, but the cost is still too high. 4mp resolution makes great 8x10 prints, and lab-quality at 4x6 and 5x7.<br /><br />The combination if its tiny size, beautiful results, and stylish design is unbeatable at the current prices. I take it everywhere and hardly notice it. It's like carrying a deck of cards in my pocket. Most good hi-res digital cameras are much bulkier.<br /><br />Compact Flash memory is really, really cheap now. Buy a 512mb card and never worry about storage.<br /><br />3X optical zoom is wonderful.<br /><br />If you don't have a digital camera, or want a top-quality unit, you really owe it to yourself to check out the S400.<br /><br />Auto white balance, auto exposure, and auto focus help the least savvy technophobes take outstanding photos.<br /><br />Flash is surprisingly effective in dark rooms.<br /><br />Lithium-ion battery lasts a long time and charges quickly. Who needs rechargable AA batteries when this battery is so good? Prices on Canon batteries are also down, so buy a spare.<br /><br />The video out cable is nice for previewing pictures on a TV, but I usually use the computer for viewing photos.<br /><br />Bundled software does the basic image editing. You'll want to go with Photoshop Elements 2 or Paint Shop Pro ... for serious editing and enhanced capabilities.","It's probably still too early to write an adequate and informative review for this camera that I've had for about 3 weeks now, but there were some glaring items that I felt needed discussion.<br />I've been on the prowl for a digital camera for over a year now.  I decided to wait a while because I figured prices would come down and quality would go up.  That seems to be the trend.  I had thought for a while that I was going to end up with either the Canon A70 or the new A80, but at the last minute, I ended up with this nice little point and shoot camera, because that's exactly what I was looking for.  I was trying to convince myself that I needed all the manual features that the A-series offers, with their ability to use different lenses, etc.  But when it came down to it, I didn't really need all of that, simply because I have an SLR camera as well.  The main reason to get the digital camera was plain and simple: convienence.  The amount of features this camera has is outstanding, and you can play around with it for hours.  Even though the movie mode produces pretty fuzzy video, it's probably a feature I will use A LOT!<br />Three critisisms I need to mention though.  I was surprised with how blurry some of the normal pictures can be, especially when the flash comes on.  It seems that when you have the camera in auto mode, and it detects low light, the flash will automatically come one (unless you have turned it off).  When this happens, it takes a little longer to take the picture and any movement of the camera produces a not-so-great pic.  I'm sure I just need to get used to the camera and how it works in each lighting situation, but for a point and shoot camera, I was expecting a little better.<br />Also, accessing how much memory your card has left is a little tricky.  I just came back from a 2 week trip to Sydney, Australia to visit my mom.  I was very excited to use my new toy down there.  The first 3 days down there we spent on the sailboat and watched the fireworks in the harbour for New Years.  It was quite the experience and needless to say, there were some amazing shots.  By the third day I had taken over 100 pics and some video and wanted to know how much memory I had used.  In order to do that, you need to access a screen that asks you if you want to format your disk.  It also shows you how much memory there is.  I hadn't fully read the manual yet, and didn't know what that meant, so I ended up hitting \"ok.\"  Well, this erases everything on your disk, even protected images.  So all of my pictures I had taken were gone!!!!  Seems like a very stupid place to access your memory information.<br />One other trait that I've noticed too:  There seems to be somewhat of a fish-eye effect on some pictures.  Especially more up close pics of people.  But I've heard this is a common problem in little cameras, esp. digital camers.<br />Overall though, I've been very impressed and happy with my purchase.  I've gotten a lot of complements on it, especially when you can zoom into pics you've taken.  Some flower pics look really amazing with how much you can zoom and crop.<br />I got a 256MB card, and an extra battery.  Typically I went through a battery a day on my trip.  The 256MB card is more than I need, though I went through almost two of them on the trip (a friend lent me his 256 card as well).  The camera was set on the highest quality settings though, so that ate up a lot of space.  All in all I had about 250 pics and about 2 minutes of video.<br />I haven't dealt with the software yet, but I've read it's pretty good.<br />Other than some of the bad luck I had with it so far, this is a great little camera.  You can't go wrong with it.  I recommend it.","I love the size, the pictures and the features. I got it around Thanksgiving and by Christmas (in the middle of Christmas!) after 100 pictures and only 1 month of use it died -- with flash enabled (red-eye or automatic) it would not take any pictures. Left me without digital pictures for the first year since my daughter was born. My prior camera (a Kodak DC800) took 8000+ pictures over 5 years with no problems. I got the Cannon for size, speed and quality (4MP vs 2MP). I didnt expect reliability issues.<br />Cannon was fairly quick with a turn around fix (although whats the deal with no RMA #s?) and they replaced the flash unit and sent my same camera back. Its working again, but I wonder for how long.... And while Christmas will come again, my Daughter's 5th one wont.","A 4 megapixel digital camera with 3 times optical zoom that is no larger than a pack of cigarettes.<br />Be sure to buy a Tamrac camera case (on amazon.com, of course), to protect your camera because like all small electronic devices, this one is a bit fragile and easy to drop.","After much research, I got my girlfriend this camera for Christmas, and I can now report that I made exactly the right choice. She was one of those \"I like film\" girls...two weeks later it's like, \"What's film?\" She's loves it. I love it. In fact, I love it so much I'm thinking about buying a second one for myself. So obviously I'm recommending this camera. But I have a few suggestions for you folks who are about to hit that Buy Now button. First, this $400 to $500 camera doesn't come with a carrying case of any kind. You can get a great one right here on Amazon for $12 -- the Canon PSC-50 Soft Leather Case for Digital Cameras. Add to Cart. Second, this camera comes with a 32MB CF memory card. We've discovered this is fine for pics, but when you start taking movies (and you will, this is a great feature!) this size memory card fills up in a flash. If I was buying this camera today, I would also buy an extra CF card with at least 256MB of memory. This great camera is limited without it. Finally, while this camera takes amazing pics, it also produces amazing red-eye. Make sure your photo program has a red-eye reduction feature (and most do). Or load on the software that comes with the camera because you're gonna need to do some red-eye zapping.<br />So take into account these few learned nuggets of wisdom and take the leap into the digital age with a Canon S400! Trust me, you'll never look back.","I am using this camera for 2 months now, and I love it for the small size, nice picture quality, easy-to-use navigation. However, it require a lot of lighting when shoting outdoors. Manual mode is very helpfull, but camera needs a \"stand\" to shot at night time. This is still however, can not garantee good quality pictures at night time. I wish, this camera would have more manual options as some advanced Canon cameras.<br />If you are planning to use this camera as a point-and-shot one in an automatic mode, I believe, nothing better you will find on the market. If you are planning to shot at night or with extremely low lighting, go for something better. And, of course, buy a \"stand\" and get yourself at least 256MB CompactFlash Card.","This camera has been amazing. I bought it right before Christmas to replace the Powershot S200 that I had purchased last year. The Powershot S200 was a great camera but wasn't able to get the close-ups of my baby that I really wanted. This camera has made up for it ten times over. The pictures that have resulted from this camera have been awesome. The camera has a great zoom for long distance pics and yet still takes great close-ups as well. The size of the camera is what drew me in to begin with which is the reason I previously purchased the S200. I take this camera just about everywhere because of its size. You wouldn't be able to do this with many other cameras on the market. The cost of the camera was a little high but I think its comparable to other cameras that are 4 megapixel. Overall, this camera was definitely money well spent. It will get lots of use for many years to come. If you are considering purchasing this camera then take the plunge. I love this camera!!!","I recently purchased this camera and it is fabulous. It takes great pictures and the flash is excellent.  The only complaint that I have about this camera is the red eye problem, but besides that everything else is excellent.<br />This camera is great for everything, from taking pictures for your photo album to downloading pictures for your website.","I purchased this camera for my daughter for XMAS. Looking forward to getting tons of photos, videos of our new granddaughter.  I've been using the PowerShot S300 that I purchased from Amazon a couple of years ago and I love it.<br />One great feature is the power pak.  You do not have to mess with rechargable \"AA\" batteries.  Just place the battery in the charge plug it in a receptable and you are back in business in a couple of hours...Not to mention you can take about 256 pictures without charging again.","I recently got one of these cameras and I think it's wonderful!  It's incredibly tiny and easy to carry around all the time - it's about the size of a credit card (but thicker, about 1/2\" give or take).  It's so easy to fit it in my back pocket or a small purse.  I bring it almost everywhere!<br />Some great features on the S400:<br />-Powers on extremely fast!  I know with some of my other digital cameras, you have to wait awhile for it to power up.. this one does it in a matter of a few seconds!<br />-Takes pictures equally fast!<br />-Panoramic capability (and you can stitch together your pictures once they are on your computer)<br />-Macro mode (take pictures of extremely small things, this feature has been incredibly useful to me as I often photograph miniature figurines for ebay!)<br />-Easy to use menu, very user friendly!  Even a digital camera novice can operate this camera without having to read a hundred pages in a manual!<br />-Fast battery charge and it lasts a long time!  I barely ever have to worry about the batteries on my S400.. I can use it for several hours and not even come close to running down the battery.<br />Overall, its a fantastic camera!  I can hardly think of anything I DON'T like about it.  One thing to be concerned about is that it only comes with a 32MB card, which you will want to upgrade.  I immediately bought a 256MB card, which holds hundreds of pictures.  I highly recommend this camera - It's extremely small, sturdy, takes great pictures and is easy to use!","The size of a pack of smokes, and not much heavier, this amazing bit of technology has found a new home in my hands--and within the next few days, in the hands of my brother and a best friend as a gift.<br />I've left behind my old SLR and decided this camera has the quality and usability to do anything anywhere, with little hassle, speed issues, or clunkyness.<br />Although its slightly pricey, a premium is rightfully worthy.  Just like the iPod, it pays to get the BEST.","As the title says, the Canon S400 is THE digital camera. I've used another type of camera, the Sony Mavica, and while it takes 3.5 floppies or CD-RW discs that make it easy to transfer the pictures, what could be easier than simply plugging in a cable into your camera? Windows XP can be set to automatically transfer the pictures you took to a folder, so it's totally automated once you plug the cable into the camera and turn it on! Wow, what a feature.<br />  This camera takes such beautiful pictures, I find myself carrying it with me all the time. It's perfect if you're a guy or a girl. It fits very easily into your purse ladies, or into your pocket men. The height and width are the size of a CREDIT CARD! It's only a little thicker than your big thumb.<br />Some features I LOVE about this camera that you won't find on other cameras include:<br />  **Zooming in on pictures you've taken [this allows you to zoom in to see the smallest details of a picture you took without loading it on a computer at all! good for seeing if someone didn't smile well]<br />  **Ability to up to 6 of the pictures at once [makes finding a picture you took easy, no need to go through 18 pictures to find the one you want, instead see 3 screens of 6 pictures!]<br />  **Panaronamic mode [take a series of pictures then \"stitch\" them together using the software they provide. this allows you to take a 360% picture if you wanted to!]<br />  **Manual mode is loaded with options [adjust just about ANYTHING you can think of to make your pictures come out perfect. take pictures at night by adjusting the shutter speed]<br />  **Macro mode [allows you to take CYRSTAL CLEAR pictures of things as little as 2 inches away! you can see details invisible to the naked eye in this mode]<br />  **Auto-focus [this enables you to focus specifically on 1 aspect of the picture, someone's face for example. this ENSURES the selected area is perfectly crisp!].<br />  You can take this camera's memory card to any photo developer (Wal-Mart is cheapest) and get amazing prints with NO editing at all. The 4x6 prints are of FINER quality than film! I could see individual whisker's on pictures of my cat!<br />  Portability, though, remains my favorite feature of this camera. I can take it with me ALL THE TIME for those unexpected moments when having a camera is such a joy. You'll never miss the chance to capture anything!<br />  A definite awesome buy and very worth the money!","This has been a fabulous camera -- really easy to learn to use, great pictures, and easy transfer to the computer. I'd previously had a an SR35, and this is just as comfortable and easy to use in my hands. Two of my relatives have them, too, and we all love'em. Only drawback has been accidentally leaving it on while connected to the computer and running the battery out. However, the recharger  is fabulous and efficient.","a bit expensive but great quality and features packed into that little thing","I just bought the S400 from Dell for $xxx a little while back and was considering the Sony DSC-P10 at the time as well.  I figured I'd write up a review on amazon to help other people out that are in the decision making process.<br />Price:<br />-----<br />The Sony DSC-P10 is 5 MP vs. 4 MP for the S400.  The difference in resolution may immediately sway your decision to teh DSC-P10, but I would think very carefully. While the extra 1 MP sounds like a lot, my old 2.0 MP Canon S00 was fine for priting pictures all the way up to 8x10 (w/o any cropping). 4 MP resolution should allow you to price 11x14 with no cropping, and 8x10 with a lot of cropping.  5 MP is just excessive IMO. These days, it's just a race among manufacturers to see who can advertise the highest MP number.<br />Shooting modes and menus<br />---------------------------------<br />P10 also has some convenient shooting modes which make it more user friendly.  It also has great features like cropping, resizing and rotating right on the camera which helps when you are not by a computer and want to free up room on your media storage.<br />The Canon S400 has a far superior menu system and is much easier to use.<br />Size:<br />-----<br />Canon S400 is smaller, making it a more pocketable camera IMO. Trust me on this one.  The specs shown them being only very slightly different in dimensions, but the total volume of the cameras makes the S400 ideal.  Those with bigger hands may prefer the layout and slightly larger size of the P10 though.<br />Memory storage:<br />---------------<br />The P10 uses Memory cards, which are limited to 128 MB, unless you use the double sided ones (Sony Memory Duo), where you can flip them over to get another 128 MB. Far too much hassle for me.. sounds easy in theory, but in real life, you will hate it. My friend who bought the P10 surely does.  You can get larger memory sticks, which comes in the form of the \"Sony Memory Pro\", which are 256 MB and 512 MB.  Keep in mind though, that these cards have problems acting as regular storage for files, and things like Mp3s for sony mp3 players. They have some type of digital rights management (DRM) on them that have causes lots of problems for people (so i've read on many reviews).  Also, these PRO cards only work in 2003 (or newer) sony devices.  Lastly, the memory pro cards have some type of management files on the cards themselves, taking up about 20MB of space. So a 256 MB card, really only has about 230 MB.  Maybe not a big deal, but com'on, at advertise the size correctly!<br />Battery Life:<br />-------------<br />Battery life on P10 is better than the S400. It will last about 20% longer.  However, the batteries are cheaper for the S400 AFAIK and they also charge in about 1/2 the time vs. the sony batteries.<br />Conclusion:<br />-----------<br />All in all, i think the S400 is a better choice. Sure, CF maybe outdated in a few years in favor of smaller, superior storage media like SD, MMC or xD cards (which are going up to 1 GB btw), but until then you can get a great digicam with dirt cheap media. I picked up a 512 MB Kingston card for very cheap from eBay.<br />Tips for those buying the S400:<br />-------------------------------<br />1. Ensure you buy good quality CF cards for the S400. CF cards have on-board processor on the cards themselves which actually regulate how fast the read+write is, unlike smartmedia which reliees on the camera.  This means that CF cards will differ greatly in speed for read+write performance.  Recommendations are Viking, RiData and Kingston. I have used about 7 or 8 different types of cards, and these are definitely the best in speed and reliability.  Viking can be found cheap on Amazon deals quite often (with rebates), and kingston and ridata can be found on eBay for cheap.<br />2. Buy the legitimate Canon branded NB-1LH batteries. They can be had for about $30-$40 if you look hard enough. Stay away from NB-1L (notice the H is suffix is missing). The NB-1L is the lower capacity battery for these cameras.  Stay away from aftermarket batteries. Sure they sell for MUCH cheaper (often 1/3 the price), but reliability and longevity of these are just brutal. There are always exceptions to the rules -- some ppl have have great experiences, which others have dead batteries almost right away.  Why risk having a dead battery while you are on vacation and miss those Crucial shots of your wife/gf?  Spend the extra $15 and get the real-deal batteries.<br />Recommended purchase:<br />---------------------<br />-Canon S400<br />-256 or 512 MB Viking, RiData or Kingston CF card<br />-1 extra battery NB-1LH<br />-Camera Case PSC-100 -- padded case with front storage for extra battery and storage. Very compact and nice looking.","After extensive research my wife and I chose the canon s400 for our digital camera investment.  We could not be happier.  Don't waste you time researching, if you want a point and shoot model get this camera!!!","It's a nice looking little camera.  I was looking for a portable one to replace my aging Fujifilm digital, so I tried this one.  I ended up sending it back, since it performs worse than my old one in low light (i.e. indoors).<br />The problem is the focus.  By default (and always, it seems, when in full auto mode), the camera uses a special \"AI\" autofocus.  This puts up a series of green rectangles (when the shutter is half-pressed) on the LCD indicating focus zones.  For one thing, it sometimes picks rectangles that represent differing distances, which doesn't make sense to me, but...  Anyway, some of the shots I took indoors, especially candids, did not come out as focused as I am used to from my old camera.  Note that I did not notice where the green rectangles were, since a couple of these shots were taken quickly by pressing the shutter all the way and not carefully analyzing the pre-focus.<br />I did not try center focus mode (similar to the focusing method in many other cameras) too much, since I did not really give the camera much of a chance after getting some blurry pics.  But unless I misunderstood the interface, it seems that it is impossible to make center focus the default for full auto mode.  Take these comments with a grain of salt, since I did not perform any really scientific tests, and I did not have the camera long.<br />One other thing I didn't like was the shutter button - if pressed off-center (tilted), it seemed to catch a little, giving it a slightly cheap feel.<br />Otherwise, the quality of the images is pretty good for such a small camera (beats my old Fujifilm in image quality for sure - of course that was a circa 1999 1.3 megapixel model!).  Bottom line is it's not a bad camera, but it seems to have some issues that bothered me.","I searched long and hard for a digital camera for my husband. He often goes to various places and wanted a small camera to take with him. He loves the quality pictures I could get with my Nikon N65 and wanted the same ability, but with less bulk. We've gone several places and taken some awesome pictures with this camera. We're still learning all we need to know about using a digital camera, since it's our first, but so far the quality hasn't let us down.<br />I would strongly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a good digital camera, with good quality pictures, and small enough to fit into your pocket (although I suggest a bag to keep it from getting damaged).","After opening the box on this baby, I knew it would be good. It has an all metal body, with everything you need to get started.  After I charged the battery (which takes like... an hour and a half) I had this camera mastered in about an hour.  Now tht can be good and bad. For folks who want a great camera for vacations, the holidays and just for fun, this camera is the one to get. If you are a professional photographer, you won't find a whole lot of manual control. You'll find some though.  Now, at the highest resolution, which is what you'll want to shoot with, pictures come out absolutely fantastic!  I would suggest getting a memory card to hold these (the one that comes with it only holds 14 pictures). I have a canon s9000 photo printer, and it prints amazing 13x19 shots.  That's big!<br />I only have two complaints with this camera...<br />Poor red-eye reduction (It comes with tools to fix it but it's a bit of a hassel when 1 out of 5 pictures come out with red-eye)<br />Poor background lighting (when you take close-ups with people the background always turns out dark. This is because the flash doesn't have as big a range as it could have.)<br />All in all this camera is worth the money! (and that's saying something!)","After opening the box on this baby, I knew it would be good. It has an all metal body, with everything you need to get started.

My only complaint so far is battery life, and no display of battery life until about 2 minutes before camera shuts off.  Having said that though it is a lithium battery which means you don't have to totally discharge it before recharging (no memory build up).  Good idea to take an extra charged battery for convenience.  You probably won't be disappointed.","There are plenty of reviews written on the qualities of this camera in and of itself, so I will not go on about its small size, well designed interface, excellent optics, and so forth.<br />I will, however, compare it to the S330, which is the older, 2MP/3X optical model that was the previous top of the line Canon elph.  Versus the S330, the S400:<br />- Has a stepping zoom (7 steps) instead of a continual zoom<br />- Is much more sensitive to camera jitter (shake) in no-flash low-light photography. If you plan to do that sort of photography, you WILL need a tripod.  This is the most sensitive (to shake in no-flash low-light photography) digital I've used yet.  Conversely, if you do use a tripod, those no-flash pictures come out REALLY well for the same reasons of sensitivity.<br />- Has a less-easily scratched exterior material<br />- Has different (better) laid out controls.<br />- Has greatly extended battery life (improved battery and lower power consumption both).<br />- Has a more intuitive menu for controlling features in manual mode such as ISO, whitebalance, etc -- and the menu can be manipulated on the LCD while shooting (without having to switch to the menu and then back to shooting).<br />- And of course, the S400 is 4MP vs 2MP for the S330.<br />What I'd love to see in a future ELPH:<br />- Support for higher-speed flash memory, such as CF2.  Some elphs now support SD memory, but it's easy to design a camera to use both CF1 (what the S400 uses) and CF2 both.<br />- Manual aperture control.<br />- Better compensation for jitter during no-flash photography.<br />Otherwise, this camera is wonderful and hard to beat without spending a lot more money for a bulkier camera.  In its size class, the S400 can't be beat.","This is one of the best 4.0 Megapixel cameras on the market!<br />Pros:<br />Small size (fits in your pocket)<br />Excellent photo quality<br />Stylish body<br />Good features for price<br />Cons:<br />slow processing of digital photos (there is a slight lag when you push the shutter button)<br />slight overexposure sometimes<br />need better software<br />Conclusion:<br />If you are a novice photographer and like to travel with your camera, then this camera will work for you!  It is small, lightweight, and the quality is very good for the price.  I compared this camera to a higher model by Sony and decided to buy this Canon because it was designed better (the 5.0 megapixel Sony camera had a design flaw with its placement of the flash).<br />The software needs more features.","I bought this so that I could leave my G3 at home and still carry a little camera in my purse. I recently took it to a concert and was pleasantly surprised at how decent photos looked with the digital zoom on...I probably won't be printing many of the close-ups, but they are pretty darned good for sharing with friends over the Web. The ability to take little Quicktime movies is a plus.<br />Its super-portability makes this the perfect camera for taking EVERYWHERE with you. I mainly bought it in anticipation of an upcoming snowboarding trip...I knew I didn't want to take my larger digital camera on the mountain with me, but I can wrap this teeny thing in some fleece, stick it in my pocket, and be ready to capture images and movies from the first run to the last. The metal casing feels very solid and I have no worries about damaging it. I also bought it with the plan to stash it in my small \"going out\" purse to capture fun moments at dinners, nightclubs, and other fun social situations.<br />The only con I've found so far is that it's very difficult to avoid red-eye, but with most ultracompacts you'll find a similar issue because the flash is so close to the lens.<br />This is my third Canon digital camera, and I also own a Canon miniDV camera...I've never been disappointed in their products and am happy to say that the S400 meets and even exceeds my expectations!","My last digital camera was a Canon Powershot S100. It was the 2.11 megapixel version. My experience was so positive, that I upgraded to the S400 after 3 years of solid service from my first S100.<br />You can't find a more useful, quality camera at any price. It's powerful, yet very small and light. The hipness factor is alse very high. People love to ogle it. Camera envy!<br />I carry it in my jacket pocket ot attache wherever I go. That's a huge plus on my scorecard. I also have a small camera case from Wal-Mart I bought for $5, just in case I think I need a little more protection for it (like when traveling, or outside a lot). I can wear it on my belt, yet it is well padded, and can carry spare memory cards and an extra battery.<br />The S400 takes 4 megapixel shots. Using an Epson Stylus Photo RX500 (multifunction device: printer/scanner/copier), I printed 4x6 photos and 8.5 x 11 photos. To my eye, both were photo lab quality when printed on premium glossy stock. I used Canon paper for 4 x 6, and HP paper for 8.5 x 11. I believe that the premium glossy photo paper from all the major manufacturers is excellent. Shop price, rather than feeling you are forced to go with the same brand as your printer. I print about 30 4x6 photos for every 1 full page photo.<br />I set my S400 at the highest resolution and the next-to-highest quality. That way, I get all the pixels, yet there is adequate compression. This keeps the files manageable, and you can fit more photos on a memory card. I use a 256MB card, with a 128MB spare. At current prices, everyone can afford to have more memory handy.<br />Not being a camera bug or serious photo hobbyist, I use all the automatic settings I can. Auto focus, auto white level, auto exposure. When it needs a flash, it flashes. The only time I make any adjustments is when I am in sunny conditions or I am close to an object I am shooting (macro).<br />Generally, I just point and shoot, and it is a thing of beauty. Semi-pro camera gurus can probably make this thing take even better shots.<br />Battery life is fine, with the new Lithium-ion cell. It's better than the one that came with the S100. The wall charger they give you is also tiny, and charges it quickly. Die-hards might want an extra charged battery when they are going to take a lot of shots in a short period of time, or when the flash will be used on every shot. I have  never run out of battery juice while in the middle of taking shots. But I don't take 150+ shots without a chance to charge it back up.<br />The 3X optical zoom is better than the old 2X from past models. I disable the optical zoom, so my image stays in native full resolution.<br />I rarely use the video mode, because I have a newer Sony mini-DV camcorder that is incredible for video.<br />It's best to stick with the strengths of each device. Camera: photos. Camcorder: video. The video quality on the S400 is poor, and the digital photo quality on the Sony camcorder is poor. If I can only take one of these with me, the S400 almost always wins. While the Sony camcorder is small and light, it is still about 5x the size and weight of the Canon S400. Convenience often carries the day.<br />I never use the USB connection to connect the camera directly to the computer. I have a 6-in-1 card reader for my computer, and my printer is compatible with all memory types. It's nice to know the direct connection is there if I need it, though.<br />You can't go wrong with the S400. Prices are even starting to come down, as 5 megapixel cameras are coming out. I'm sure Canon has a 5 megapixel Elph in the works, but for high-quality photos up to 8.5x11, it's hard to improve on the S400.","Hope to help Xmas shoppers with this review.  We just got our S400.  We've had a Fujifilm Finepix 1400 for about the last 3 yrs, but it is only 1.2 mp and larger in size than the S400.  The Fujifilm camera was a good one to learn on though and has helped us to understand a number of features on the S400.  If you are techno-savvy, go with the S400.  If not get a more simple camera to learn on.  The quick start guide is easy to get you going.  We also bought a case, 256mb simpletech card, simpletech card reader, and extra battery pack.  Don't buy a charger like we did as one comes with the camera.  I followed all the instructions and have had no problems taking pics and downloading.  To use the card reader you have to download the software for it from simpletech's website if you have win98.  The manual is sort of hard to follow for me (a non-techno), but the illustrations are helpful.  Haven't used the movie feature yet.  I would highly recommend a 256mb + card as only a 32mb card comes with the camera.  We use the card reader to save the camera battery.  The reader is only $11.","This is an almost perfect little piece of equipment.  It is easy to carry with you anywhere in a pocket or a small case and that's important because a camera only counts if its with you. The outer casing is very sturdy (and attractive) and will protect your camera from bumps and falls.<br />The biggest improvements over my previous canon S230 are the additional megapixels- 4.0 and the 3x optical zoom.  Both these improvements are important to the quality of prints- especially to enlargements.  An optical zoom takes much crisper shots than a digital one and 3x enlargement is superior to the 2x in the S230 and other small digital cameras. The 4.0 megapixels also provides a sharper picture again especially for enlargements. I do reccommend purchasing at least a 256 Megabyte card to accommodate the extra data you'll be storing. And buy an extra battery so you don't run out of power unexpectedly.<br />This is a great camera and so easy to use that anyone can take great photos in no time. Once you buy this camera you'll use no other one.","Great have it with you always camera. Terrific for all types of shots by a novice, such as myself. Comes with easy to use software and accessories. Would get larger flash card (at least 128MB) and spare battery, and soft case.<br />Takes great photos. Distant zoomed shots beyond the range of the to optical zoom are the only weakness, as they are with all non-telephoto lens cameras.","great battery life, fast power on/off, fantastic size/weight, generally beautiful pics but...slow shutter speed (miss the great shots & if forced the pics aren't in focus) & very frequent red eye shots even with people with blue eyes & people with glasses.","This is a wonderful little camera that takes great pictures! I have taken 200 pictures so far and all of them have come out great! The only problems I have found with it is that it does get a little warm as you use it and also when using flash indoors the contrast is not as good as I would like it to be. Other than that I would highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a small easy to use digital camera.","I went to Italy for the first time in October. I took my new Sony trv39 digital camcorder and realy liked the movies I took. I found I really used the swivel lcd monitor that came on the Sony movie camera that allowed me to shoot pictures above the crowds at the various places I visited in Italy.<br />Just before I left on the trip, my sister talked me into taking her Canon A70 and am I ever glad I took her up on her offer. The camera is light weight, easy to carry anywhere and with 3.2 megapixels took some great photo's I couldn't get with the Sony that can take photo's but at only 1 megapixel.  I was wishing the A70 had the same type of swivel LCD monitor feature and now the A80 comes with it.<br />I ordered the A80 that has 4 megapixels and like the A70 is light and compact.  I took the A80 to my nieces birthday party at a restaurant and it took great pictures. I found I wanted to crop and enlarge some of the pictures and with the 4 megapixels there was no loss of clarity when I enlarged any of the pictures. I also like the stich assist mode and all the other camera select functions.  The camera uses ordinary, easy to find anywhere, AAA batteries which is a plus. I've taken about 100 pictures and I am so glad I bought this camera. The pictures are clear, the colors are true and the camera is simple to use. I think this is a camera that I can grow into as I become more experienced with it.<br />The one thing I noticed as a drawback is that it is a little delay in the pressing of the picture button before the shutter functions. After the first 10 shots I found I wasn't concerned with that delay.","This is actually my second digital camera. My first was an Olympus C-3020 zoom. I was very excited when i recieved that camera as a gift but as i began to use it i became very unhappy with it.  It is very bulky and doenst have audio capabilities like the S400. It also used 4 AA batteries which didnt last very long and added alot of weight to the already heavy camera. Needless to say i was very happy when it was stolen because i got the money from my insurance company which allowed me to purchase the Canon PowerShot S400.<br />I was immediatley satisfied with the PowerShot S400. I love the audio & video capabilities and the camera is very easy to use. Also, there is no comparison in the size of the S400 to that of the Olympus. I am able to take this camera everywhere because it is so small. Also the Rechargeable Lithium-ion battery is great and lasts very long, even when you use the LCD screen for playback very often. I did a lot of research before i purchased a new digital camera after my first one was stolen, and i couldnt find a smaller camera with all the options that were included in the S400.<br />I guarantee you will not be disappointed with this camera.","I spent 2 weeks searching the internet for reviews on digital cameras and came to the conclusion of spending more than I wanted but to get the best I could with the qualities I wanted - The things I like best are the picture quality that are much sharper than my 35mm, the size and construction- feels very solid, lots of manual features - if I needed any more I would not have gotten a point and shoot.  Video mode is just amazing- that such a small thing can make a video- although when trying to e-mail it- it took a long time and I have not tried to tweek that at all yet - one thing I noted today was that dates dont stamp out on pics but if you buy a certain Canon printer the manual notes the date of photo creation will print out - overall I love this little camera and it about as exciting as your first computer ~ i did learn in my reading reviews of the ofoto.com website for downloading, editing, and getting your photos printed by them and receive thru the mail - that works great -<br />I have a Nikon 35mm which has always taken beautiful photos but now ~ I must say - this Canon really beats it for sharpness and colors. If you are in a Christmas rush wondering which digital to get- just pick this up and save yourself the time of reading the reviews - this gets great ratings everywhere.","This camera got the highest point in image quality (to human eyes) among digital cameras PC Magazine tested in its Sep. 2, 2003 issue.  Here are things that I didn't know before my purchase.  Hope this helps.<br />Type I CF card:<br />The box came with SanDisk 32MB card, not with SimpleTech that Canon sells on their web site.  As compatibility seems to affect speed of write/read to/from the card, I was a bit concerned about buying SimpleTech.  My 512MB SimpleTech card has so far no discernable difference in performance.  (Sadly, I was actually expecting an improvement from SanDisk CF card based on review at [...]) Amazon's product description doesn't say SimpleTech CF card is Type I or II.  It's Type I that fits with S400.<br />CF card capacity:<br />My S400 says 512MB card can hold 247 pictures at highest resolution and Superfine setting.  (Someone wrote life was too short to bother with settings for lower quality images.  I agree.)  Its manual says 256MB should hold 123 images, as you can imagine.  256MB may be good enough, depending on your usage pattern.<br />CF card reader:<br />I also purchased a CF (only) card reader from SimpleTech (UCF-100).  Windows 2000 says CF card has FAT format as storage media.  There shouldn't be compatibility issues with your PC, in theory.  The software that comes with S400 recognizes CF card reader as a camera.  CF card reader's package says it can transfer data up to 1.5MB per second.  This can roughly mean, for S400, a picture a second.  Actual speed feels slightly slower than that.  (I used my clock to measure time.  Can't be too accurate.)  However, it seems to be three to four times faster than transferring image data from S400 directly.  When you have a lot of pictures on S400 to transfer, this speed advantage can justify having a CF card reader.<br />Leather case PSC-50:<br />I feel S400 needs a case as a protection though I didn't feel a need for my 35 mm point and shoot cameras from Canon and Olympus in the past.  This may be from its relative weight.  Because S400 doesn't come with a case of any sort, unless you know an alternative, buying this one can be a way to have one less thing to worry about in your life.<br />Enjoy!!","First I want to say the camera is made very well, the metal finish does not show smudges or finger prints. The size is great, very compact and light. The battery charges fairly quickly and seems to last. The camera is very simple to use.<br />As with most digital cameras you will need to upgrade the 32 Meg. CF card that is included if you want to hold more than 20-40 images before up-loading.<br />As for image quality in the auto mode, the red eye reduction does not work most of the time. The flash although very bright in the foreground does not seem to illuminate the background and leaves it pixilated (a common problem with small flashes in digital cameras when photographing indoors). The contrast, brightness, and colors seem to be true.<br />I purchased this camera as a quick point and shoot compact and an alternative to dragging around my 8 pound Nikon D1.<br />If you are looking for a small compact and you do not need National Geographic quality images, this camera would be a good choice.","Dear Amazon,<br />I never thought I'd be writing something like this, but here I am; I'm in love with a digital camera.<br />After the 24 hours to read the instruction book, master the features, and install the software, I was finally ready to take this bad-boy out and take some real shots.<br />Flash:  Indoor pictures with the main flash are a little overexposed and leave someone looking like they need to hit a tanning booth, stat (or just leave North Dakota...whichever).  For outside shots, however, you can get some absolutely great shots in the light or dark.  The flash is a little blinding, which should be mentioned to the people you are filming.<br />Red eye:  I've messed around a little bit with this and haven't had too much success.  Even with the digital zoom and the red-eye eliminator, eyes still look a little iffy.  This is one of my 2 complaints about this camera.<br />Digital Zoom: It can go up to 11X (3X on video record), but if you move at all, the picture will be absolutely horrible.  Something I discovered with the 'no-flash' feature that can be mentioned here as well is if the person you are taking a picture of moves suddenly, you have a 50-50 chance of good picture/bad picture.<br />Mosaic:  Awesome feature, although for the life of me I can't figure out why I like the picture of my living room so much.<br />Video:  My favorite feature BY FAR!  Great quality, only goes up to 3X zoom, but you can re-enact your favorite moments of 'The Blair Witch Project' rather seamlessly (you may wish to keep a hanky around for the snot-bubble scene).<br />I am constantly amazed at this camera and how easy it was to hook up to my XP machine (just throw the USB cable in to the machine and the camera).  Definitely worth the money I paid and more so!","This Canon is very easy to use like all the canons out there.  I love the menu system, how quickly the camera starts up, its size, how it feels in my hands, even the little sound effects it makes.  Browsing the images is also easy to do, fast, and gives useful information.<br />All the professional reviews say the camera takes fantastic pictures.  My own personal opinion is that it takes fantastic pictures some times, and other times not so great.  Often the colors are too saturated in my opinion.  Many indoor pictures and flash pictures just look wrong, the wrong colors usually.<br />The camera has just a few manual options.  One that's missing is one that allows me to specify spot focusing.  Instead, it figures out how to focus itself (and displays one or more green boxes in the LDC where it actually focused) and if it picks the wrong place(s), you have to release the button and try again.  Sometimes you just can't convince it to focus on what you want.  And ... of course, you need to realize all this is going on and pay attention or else you might end up with a bunch of duds.<br />I still think this camera is probably one of the best quality small cameras you can buy.  We needed something to offset the bulk of the EOS 10D that we bought.  Once we tried that camera there was no looking back: you press the button, it takes the picture, no delay.  You HOLD the button and it takes 9 shots without stopping, 3.3 fps, 6 megapixels each.  But it is too big to carry everywhere...","I did quite a bit of research before purchasing. I wanted a camera that produces high quality images, is very compact and easy to use.<br />I have a Sony digital camcorder. Naturally, I was initially inclined to buy a Sony. Besides, Sony cameras (of the same price range) seem to have more features and more pixels than Canon cameras. But when I went to a store to check the cameras out, the Sony cameras reminded me of the (fairly new) Sony digital camcorder I have: the menu is so clumsy and illogical that sometimes it drives me nuts!<br />In contrast, the Canon cameras struck me as extremely user friendly. Aside from the S400's size, metal body and its pleasing exterior, I couldn't believe how easy it was to navigate the controls. Everything is logically and intuitively laid out. For every menu choice one makes, the LCD screen displays the name of that function in addition to the icon. (One does not need to memorize what icon means what--one can read it on the LCD screen.)<br />I chose the S400 above the other Canons, because I decided that the S400 offers just enough manual controls as a point-n-shoot camera. I figured that if I wanted full control, I'd buy a Sony DSC717; if I needed a camera for extreme high image quality, I'd use my Nikon SLR's. For most everyday use, including printing up to 8x11, 4mega pixels is more than sufficient.<br />There are several things that I am disappointed with (aside from the 32mb memory and lack of a pouch):<br />1. Flash pictures tend to be over exposed. Or else the picture is very dark. One can use the manual control to adjust the exposure compensation, but for spontaneous shots, that seems rather cumbersome.<br />2. The red-eye reduction function doesn't seem to work very well on my set.<br />3. When I installed the software on my  computer (Windows Me), the computer freezes at the end of the installation process. The software seems to work fine, but the freeze bugs me. I tried re-install a couple of times but the same thing happened.<br />I believe that if you have Windows XP, you can simply plug the camera in and the computer will just recognize it as a removable harddisk. I have NOT tried this out yet though.<br />An alternative to installing software is the USB cf card reader (I bought one made by SimpleTech for $16) which plugs in to my Windows Me computer and is immediately recognized as an additional device. The downside to that is that one has to remove the cf card from the camera and insert it into the reader. I am always afraid I'd bend one of those little pins through which the cf card connects to the various devices.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this camera.","This modern day little gizmo have brought the word perfection to our dictionary.  It has the utmost incredible resolution that can blow you away.  S400 is very dynamic and user-friendly.  I have no problem working with this camera.  Not only does take pictures, but it can record motions just like any other camcorder.  Honestly, you can't find anything that can compare the quality and dynamic duo it provides.  I have no problem using it.","I've tested every version of the compact Canon Elph over the years and was alway a bit disappointed compared to the competition.  This version, with a 4 MB CCD, closes the gap.  Not only is the CCD larger than on past models, but the optical design is a step up.  The main benefactor is wide angle performance.  Test images show marked improvement at the widest angle setting compared to the older 3.2 MB Elph.  If you need the convenience of a tiny digital camera but require excellent image quality, give the S400 a look.","I recently travelled to China with a small group, each of whom had a digital camera.  My Canon was by far the most compact and easiest to use, and had the most useful features.  The only drawback was the relatively short battery life--it's usually only good for about 75 images or less, if you use the LCD screen most of the time.  The metal case makes it relatively rugged [good enough to carry in your pocket].  My wife has a Nikon Coolpix 4000 and this camera is very comparable.  I would readily recommend it for amateur travel photography.","This is a wonderful camera.  I am disabled and have trouble lifting anything heavy, but this camera is so light I have no trouble at all.  The picture quality is amazing and it has a nice appearance too.  The only thing I don't like about it is the case that Canon provides as an option to go with it.  It doesn't give you a place to store additional batteries, and since it doesn't allow for regular batteries, this is important.  Overall, it's the best I've ever personally used.","I love my camera, didn't buy it at Amazon however, I suggest you do this is a great price.  The size is great I carry it around just because it is so small.  It slips right into a nifty little pouch in my favorite purse.  For close up photos the clarity is great.  Equally great is the zoom lens.  I can't say enough words for this little powerhouse of a camera.  If point and shoot is what you are looking for get this camera.  Good Video with sound too!","I've had my S400 for a few weeks now and love it. I've used it in all sorts of different situations (outside with glare from water, inside with low light, flash, no flash, etc.). The only pics that have turned out were user error. I've used both Fuji and Kodak digi cameras and the Canon is in a different league than the others. I was a little concerned that the camera would be too small, but after using it, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a camera they can take anywhere. Which is exactly what I do. Buy this camera!","This is my 3rd digital camera, having owned two bulkier Olympus models previously. I was looking for a smaller camera that would be easier to carry. After much research I chose this Canon S400, and it's just about perfect. The display is clear and easy to use. The included rechargeable battery and charger are easy to use, very small, and the battery charges fairly quickly after the initial charge. I took it with on a trip to DisneyWorld, where I took about 50 pictures daily. It fit nicely into a small pocket of my waistbag. I purchased with it two 256MB Sandisk CF cards, they have worked flawlessly thus far. Hooking the camera up to my iMac was no problem, I hooked up the included USB cable and iPhoto instantly recognized the camera; the pictures were uploaded in no time. The only thing I'd really like is a decent case to protect it in my bag. The Canon case that can be purchased separately is rather chintzy. I currently keep it in a neoprene eyeglass zip case that I picked up at a sporting goods store.","Had a 2 year old Kodak DC280(?) 2MP that took excellent photos. I'm a point and shoot guy but I shoot a lot of pix's of the kids. Bought a Cannon G3 and sent it back as the photos were not as good as my old Kodak. I have had the S400 for about 6 months (3000 shots) and the photos are fantastic. If your looking for something simple in the point and shoot category but with some manual adjustments AND you want something small to carry around with you all of the time, just buy this. Oh did I tell you about the movies. Fantastic! Although they are like the old ones on 8 mm and kinda jumpy due to the low frame rate, the look is rather nostalgic and interesting. Lets face it most of the shots you need are with a still camera and for the few times when your out you have the capability to do short (3 min.) films, this is your baby. I parked a 2 GB CF card in her and at max resolution I can get 978 shots. Come to papa.","I love this little camera. I also have the elph APS camera.  Easy to use on Auto Mode and good Macro settings.  Even has a 3 minute movie option.  Easy to load photos to PC and share.  Good battery life.  Light and easy to carry!  CANNOT SAY ENOUGH about this great little camera!!","Canon packed a lot of technology in this little camera. undoubtfully the best digital point and shoot you can get for this kind of money. the metal case is nice and it doesn't show fingerprints like previous models with stainless case. beautiful and sleek.","Greatest thing since sliced bread.  Easy to use, amazing amount of features considering how small it is, and the video with sound capability is a nice bonus.  Leaving my camcorder at home from now on.  If you really intend to use this a lot (and why else would you buy it?), you should consider getting a spare battery and a large memory card or two as accessories.","After owning countless \"regular\" cameras, including a 10 lb. 35 mm Nikon that gave me neck pain just carrying it (and 2 lenses) around, 2 or 3 Olympus \"point and shoots\" and various other mediocre small handbag-size cameras, I finally was \"born again\" and discovered the world of digital (about the same time I realized AOL was yesterday's news when it took half my life to download photos).  So, I did some research, thought about what was realistic for my life style, and decided to go with this baby.<br />What a delight!  Very, very small and perfect for stashing in your pocket, briefcase, or handbag.  It takes good (not breathtaking) pictures that I suspect could be improved if I spent more time reading the manual. If you've never owned a digital before, this is an ideal model for a first time user.  First thing, get a memory card with a minimum of 128 mb so  you can play around without having to worry about downloading or erasing constantly.  Also, you will need to recharge the battery a lot if you are using the camera regularly.","I love this camera.  It is small enough to take anywhere and takes amazing point and shoot pictures.<br />The settings are easy to navigate through, and if you want to do a little more than just point and shoot, you can.<br />I enjoy the video and black and white settings.<br />I am glad I purchased this camera!","I purchased this camera a few days ago and have been very pleased thus far. The print image quality is outstanding. The camera, even though it is tiny, has a very \"sturdy\" feel. After weeks of research, the decision was between this camera and the Canon S45. (I had included the Canon S50, but had read reviews by many professionals stating that the 5 megapixel cameras are just not necessary. Except for those who intend to print large.) The S400 does not have the manual features of the S45. If you intend to do more fine arts work, then you should take that into consideration. But if you want a great (so far), small point and shoot then this may be the camera for you.<br />I am giving 4 stars because of the high price and the lack of manual features, other than those points, it is a 5 star camera.<br />Update: January 26, 2004...LOVE the camera. Have had no problems. Very happy with my purchase.","I will purposefuly keep this review nice and short.  I own this camera, and after 1000's of shots I can only say this - it is simpy FANTASTIC!  Yes, FANTASTIC!  I have NEVER had a problem with this camera!  The pictures I take are amazing (not due to my own merits), and when I went to print them (at a local store), I was BLOWN away!  I have NEVER seen such good quality photos from ANY 35mm camera before.  The menus are easy to use and understand, and even the movie feature is neat (which I so didn't care about, I didn't know it had it when I bought it).  This camera has been perfectly compatible with BOTH my Mac OS X (direct plug into iPhoto) and my PC.  Also, the battery life is SUPER.  I was in Europe for several weeks, and never got the low battery light.  I got nervous towards the end, and bought a converter, so I could charge, but may have made it without it.  Of course, the charger is European current (220v) compatible, so all you need is a converter for the plug.  PLUS, I have dropped the camera several times, once in a Russian sub in Seattle, and it went far ... and it seemed to have taken it like a man.  So, it's pretty durable to boot!<br />The only complain, is that it doesn't zoom enough.  But, I have learned to work around it.<br />Be sure to buy an extra storage card (256 MEG +), because you will want to take the highest quality photos you can.  If you need smaller ones, doctor them up later, but take at highest quality and size first.  Don't worry the camera is just as fast to take large photos, as it is small ones.  The small photos look great, but the highest quality ones are AMAZING!<br />I can't think of a camera being any better, other than one that is smaller ... but I am being too ungrateful now, so I will stop.  I stick this camera in my pants pocket, and it never bothers me (much).  =)","I bought two S400 cameras last week, and they are absolutely superb.  Image quality is wonderful, it processes shots very quickly, controls are well laid out and easy to use, form factor is brilliant (small, compact, yet full-featured), battery lasts a long time, and the exterior is very robust.  Maybe the only thing I'd want is a bit more zoom, and perhaps it could have come with a slightly larger CF card (32MB is a bit small for 4MP); I ended up buying a 128MB card to use with it, and will probably splurge for a 512MB if I take it on vacation.","This is my first digital camera and I love everything what this little Elph has to offer.  It takes superb pictures and easy to operate.  It's small enough to fix in my shirt pocket so I can carry it around with me when I'm on the road.  I don't want to carry a brick!  Did I mention it can record good quality movie clips too?  Don't let the small size fools you.  The S400 is packed with features and does a great job!  The S400 won't disappoint you!  Canon makes great cameras!!!","The metal body is really v good - feels durable and strong but light weight and no fignerprints ever! Pictures come out v clear (as expected from a Canon) and the battery is light weight too. Not too many manual controls though, and if you compare the manuals of S400 vs S45, you will see what I mean. (man many more pages in S45). But for point and click types, this is the best. (and now at a v great price too! @ amazon/other websites).","I used to have a Powershot S110, but recently upgraded to the S400. They have really worked out a lot of the irritating little quirks that I had on the S110. It's easy to get to movie mode, and the scrolling buttons when viewing photos are now 4-way instead of 2-way. Menu navigation is easier, and even deleting photos takes less steps. I was concerned about the casing not being as durable as the ones on the S110, and wasn't sure why they went differently with the S400, but the brushed finish just makes it look that way. The rounded corners actually make it nicer to sit in your pocket. The flash is more powerful, just everything. Obviously you pay more for all the upgrades....so if you don't really need 4.0 megapixels, then maybe consider the new SD100. But, the images and their new DIGIC chip are top notch. I just ordered the underwater housing for the S400, so I can't wait to try it out!","I have owned the last two generations of the Powershot family. Not only does this one have more pixels, but it is even more precisely engineered, more compact and with a better user interface. No complaints and with 1 GB flashcard, can take 800+ shots at full resolution.","definitely one of my best birthday gifts ever...<br />i love my elph aps camera but wanted to upgrade to a compact digital... the s400 was a no-brainer, canon makes great cameras.<br />this is a great camera for everyday use, especially for traveling.  all the controls are teeny tiny, but once you get the hang of them taking pictures/movies becomes a piece of cake,<br />picture quality is great, however i wish there was a higher resolution for shooting movie clips.<br />the only downer is that i had to spend approx. an extra $200 to maintain the camera!  the battery life is somewhat short - downloading to the computer pretty much drains the entire battery, the camera doesn't come with a case (since when did canon get so cheap? my elph came with a case, which now sells separately for about $15), and the lcd screen is on the outside so a case is a must to protect this.<br />i definitely recommend getting the adapter kit (about $60), this saves battery life and is a must when downloading to your hard drive. the only weird thing is the cable connects to the camera bottom, so the camera is at an awkward angle when the side is connected to the usb port and the bottom is connected to the adapter... you sort of have to lean it on its side or risk having it fall on the lcd screen or lens.<br />also recommend getting the accessory pack (about $80).  this comes with a nice carrying bag, a camera case and an extra battery.<br />lastly, i recommend getting a larger memory card (got the 256 mb flash card for about $60). the 32 mb that comes with the camera is nothing.<br />i probably spent big $$$ overall on the camera, but the quality & ease of use make up for this.","an excellent point and shoot camera which produces superb images with minimal effort.  the DIGIC processor or ISAPS does seem to make a difference compared with powershot s40.  do not purchase if you are expecting a lot of manual functions.  read the manual to get the most out of this camera.","I have had lots of digital Canons and have found them all to be high quality and quite durable. The PowerShot S400 is no exception, though it is not a perfect choice, in my opinion.<br />It has great resolution (enough to make great 11\" x 14\" enlargements) and an adequate zoom (3X optical and a less useful 3.6X digital zoom). The 3 full minutes of video (with sound) it can shoot also make it handy as a crude camcorder in a pinch.<br />It is however, not a digital Elph (as its S400 designation might suggest) and therefore it is not as svelte. It is also hampered by having only the Canon proprietary battery & charger for power (you cannot imagine when traveling how helpful the disposable battery option can be!) and by a too-small memory card which needs to be immediately upgraded if the camera is to prove useful. Lastly, the price is a bit high for the specs, in my opinion. Nonetheless, if someone were to give you this camera as a gift, I'm sure you would be most satisfied.","This camera is a gem for those of us who like to take a lot of snapshots, don't want to lug around a big camera and still expect full features and excellent picture quality.<br />Look and feel are superior.  The menu and features are easy to master after only a brief tutorial with the users manual (which is relatively easy to use).<br />Different flash settings are great and easy to use.<br />My only wish is that the battery was not proprietary.  The rechargeable is fine, but if you run out of juice while on the road, you cannot use standard batteries to get you going again - you need to recharge or have a relatively expensive backup charged and ready to go.","I bought this because my wife wanted a small camera. I wanted one with more features but went with this one anyway. The small size is makes this camera so handy to take any where. You really can keep it in your pocket.<br />It takes great pictures and is easy to use. We have been very happy with it. The only two quibbles are the lack of a battery level indicator and the limited accuracy of the viewfinder. Neither are a great problem.<br />I've taken some nice sunset pictures using the manual mode but for most situations the auto mode does a great job. I'd recommend this to anyone.","The image quality is mostly good.  The battery is proprietary and wimpy and can be a dog to autofocus in difficult lighting.  I sell digital cameras and we do lots of prints in store.  Prints tend to look much better than similiar cameras like the sony p10, but the Sony is a lot faster on its feet. Personally, however, I wouldn't buy it.  Too boring. Too small, which guarantees less zoom, but 3x is pretty standard.  Canon's menue operation is annoying compared to say a kodak, which all seem to be quite decent now, especially the four megapixel model that is priced a hundred dollars less than the elf and should produce similiar image quality with more zoon flexibility.","This camera recieved great reviews from PC magazine as well recenlty while they compared it to a bunch of other ditigal cameras.  This happens to be the worlds smallest 4Megapixel camera.  Its heavier than it looks, but its hardly noticeable in your pocket.  I purchased a little camera pouch with a shoulder strap that makes the camera vanish behind your arm.  The camera seems very delicate, so I get worried when others handle it.  The LCD screen doesnt come with any protection so you have to be carefull not to scratch it.  The s400 has plenty of features like movie mode up to 3 minutes.  It also takes great panoramic shots.  As a matter of fact, it is possible (and easy) to take 360 degrees of pictures and stitch them together with the bundled software.  There are many features for advanced users, but it is easitly figured out by the thickest consumers.  The buttons, however, are small so they may pose a difficulty for folk with large hands or clumsy fingers.  the 3x optical zoom is great.  The 11x digital zoom is harldy used but handy.  The various flash options, focusing options, and ISO speeds can confuse people.  Im still learning how to take the best pictures depending on the light source.  Of course, there is always the Automatic option if you want the camera to decide for you.  Overall, it may be a bit pricey after you purchase a decent CF card.  The 32 MB card that comes with it is harldy enough room for the size of the pictures the 2400 can take when the resolution and quality are maxed out.  Go buy a 256MB card.  The cards can be developed at a walgreens or the data can be moved to the computer and then to a CD.  The CDs can be taken to be developed as well.  Lastly, the software included is pretty good if you like to edit, print, or arrange your pics.  Always, nomatter how great the camera, it still takes a good photographer to capture a good photo.","I purchased this camera after reading a number of positive reviews. I was not dissappointed. This camera takes an excellent photo and is very easy to use. The battery life is very good and it comes with a little outlet mounted charger.<br />The video features are very good for a camera this small. This is one of the first digital cameras where I have seen the video features worth using. You can capture short motion clips and they are usually reasonable small enough the email to people. They also don't require a special codec to be viewed.","I've never written a review, but I have to weigh in on this beauty.  I bought this camera just before my recent trip to Italy, replacing a somewhat larger 3MP Toshiba that I've owned for a few years.  I wanted a highly portable camera that took great pictures and was resilient.  This is it.  If you don't have the camera with you when you need it, you can't get that great shot.  I kept the camera in my pocket wherever I went, and I ended up with a boatload of really fabulous shots.  Very few clunkers.  Super easy to use.  Color and clarity both excellent, dramatically better than my prior camera.  Backlight adjustment effective.  LCD viewer is small but extremely crisp.  Shots are quick, including shots in succession.  I'm a big guy, but I didn't feel clumsy handling this tiny camera.  I haven't invested a lot of time reading the instruction book, but what I needed I was able to find intuitively.  Software is functional and pretty easy to use for what I need -- downloading the shots to my computer, sorting through them, and emailing compressed versions to friends and family.  Bought a 256MB memory card, which should handle 125+ shots at maximum size and quality.  I picked this over the Minolta Dimage because the latter topped out at 3MP, and over the small Camedia because I didn't feel I needed to go to 5MP and didn't want the somewhat larger size.","I owned this camera for a month now, and though not the smallest, (minolta dimage with 3.2 MP is thinner and has great picture quality also though less resolution), was great in terms of startup speed, shot to shot speed, and picture quality. It is in my opinion, comparable to the Sony P10 in most aspects, except, the sony is longer but shorter in height, thickness about the same, Canon is boxier, but fits in small bags or pockets. Sony P10 is also nice an cute. Sony is better in terms of being 5 MP, canon, only 4 MP for the same price. Canon can stitch pictures together right on the camera, Sony cant. Canon has orientation sensor, Sony no.Compact flash for Canon is a better deal in terms of price per memory,memory sticks are about double the price, but the I opted for the Sony because the Canon lacks the presence of any kind of low battery warning. It only tells you a few seconds before it dies , and then, oops! Sony and the minolta both have battery warning, the Sony can even tell you how many minutes are remaining on your battery life if you get the DSCV1. Sorry, but if I need to take a once in a life time shot, and the battery dies out, I dont think a spare battery nearby will help unless I can change it in less than a second. Otherwise, great camera, highly recommend.","if you're looking for a higher resolution point and shoot camera that will give you fantastic pictures shot after shot, consider the s400!<br />pros:<br />- excellent resolution - best of the ultra-compact four megapixel class i've looked at<br />- 3x optical zoom lens<br />- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail<br />- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours<br />- features \"cerabrite,\" a metal/ceramic mix that is more smudge proof than other materials<br />- allows control over cameras internal processing algorithms - saturation, tone, sharpness<br />- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)<br />- the LCD monitor (1.5\") is bright and has an anti-reflective coating - gives good live preview and review even in well lit situations<br />- shooting priority play mode (a half-press of the shutter release always returns to shooting)<br />- fast shot-to-shot times<br />- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera<br />- voice annotation feature<br />- invervalometer (time lapse capability)<br />- AF assist lamp works well<br />- USB connectivity<br />- good battery life, although i would recommend carrying a spare since canon's batteries are proprietary<br />- ultracompact: 3.4 x 2.2 x 1.1 in, weighing only 7.8oz<br />cons:<br />- average macro performance<br />- nine-point AiAF not available in non-auto exposure modes<br />- average flash performance<br />- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery compartment<br />- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom<br />- very small mode dial<br />- moderately underexposed flash shots<br />- very few manual controls - this is okay if all you want is a point and shoot<br />- RAW format not supported<br />- the supplied 32MB CF card is inadequate - be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for at least a 256MB card<br />- proprietary battery - again, a few more bucks for a spare<br />hope this helps you in your purchase.  enjoy!","I own many Canon cameras because I play 35mm camera since I was very young with Canon. In fact, I would like to say that it's a perfect camera, which I got in past three years. I want to give it 5 stars, but I gave it 4 stars based on following reason.<br />Wonderful small size, but battery needs to imporve more. It's same with S110, S230 and S330. You need a extra Battery, and it's better to turn off the LCD. It will make you to take more pictures.<br />Flash is still weak, but enough for outdoor with sunshine. Please turn on lights if you want to take indoor pictures.<br />3X room = Good, but not necessary. In fact, for small lens, you can not make good picture when you take long range shoot to compare with SLR cameras. I would like to say. 2X room is enough for such style camera.<br />Based on the price, I suggest that you can wait for some months after the price goes down... Otherwise, I suggest to buy S230 during period. Even it isn't so good like this one, but for the small camera. It is perfect with the good price and all functions!!!","Has good features, but it gets warm/hot if it is operated for  more than 5 minutes. I exchanged it for another piece but that also had the same problem. I returned it.","Amazing picture graphics, and the zooming is great! But if you are to buy this camera, be sure to get a cover case for it, otherwise, it is easily scratched. The battery life is amazing, and overall, it is worth its money!","This little thing beats all the (ultra) compact ones out there.<br />Don't believe me? Try it yourself!<br />First I had a Canon A40. My second cam was a Canon S40. The S400 is my third digicam, and I won't sell it for a few years (at least Canon makes a newer and better from this series).<br />What's the difference comparing to my previous digicams? The main: it's smaller and lighter. The second: it is faster. The third: it takes clearer pics like the other two. Also, it records 3 minute videos at 320x160. The manual settings are too few, but I don't miss them. I rarely used 'em on my S40 before. Not a big thing. I have ISO and white balance manual settings on my S400.<br />Belive it or not, the battery of the S400 lasts longer than the one in my S40, though it's smaller and lighter.<br />Reviewing pictures is a pleasure. VERY FAST! Compare it to Sony-P9 and you never buy a Sony after that. Compare low-light shots to any high-end ultra compact cam (eg. Minolta F100). You will choose Canon for that purpose also.<br />What's wrong with it then? There is no battery indicator. Not a big thing, you can live without it.<br />Once you tried this smart beauty, you'll never let it go!<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","This little thing beats all the (ultra) compact ones out there.<br />Don't believe me?

I recommend this camera for anyone who has an older 35mm camera to replace.  I also recommend this camera if this is your first time buying a digital camera.","All the reviews available really say it all. I can only say positive things about this little wonder. I have been using digital cameras only since 1994 and I can say this is the best so far. The size is great even for big hands like mine and it is very easy to use. Low light conditions require extra light, but when the light is sufficient, pictures are far better than I ever got with my Nikon film camera years ago. It is my second camera to exceed film quality. The last one was a Canon also. The investment in digital is well worth it since you have zero expense after camera, extra cards, and card reader are purchased. Bottom line: knockout quality in design, construction quality, and picture quality. This camera is a work of art that could be showcased.","Replaced my Nikon 775 (2.0 megapixel) because I wanted higher megapixels and a microphone.  Athough the S400 takes larger pictures than my Nikon, I preper the picture quality of the Nikon on outdoor pictures.  The Nikon does a better job on high contrast photos (ie light sky with dark ground).  I've only been using the S400 for a month, so maybe I need more experience with the manual settings.  I do like the audio and increased video capturing time on the S400 over the Nikon.  However, the S400 does no alow for zooming in or out while recording.  It also does not change the apature setting while recording, which is a problem when panning scenes with high contrast(ie sunsets).<br />Overall, it is a very portable camera that is good for general point and shoot pictures, but I will continue to look for a better portable camera for outdoor/lanscape photos.","I carried this camera in my pocket for a 3 week holday in the UK, and was thrilled with the results when I got home. Pictures are very sharp, and color is excellent (perhaps a little dark on the default setting, but this is adjustable). The camera is principally automatic point-and-shoot, with some manual controls/overrides for more advanced situations. The number of features is amazing for its size. The user interface design is excellent. The silver paint on the case scratched too easily by coins and keys in the same pocket. The macro capability make this a great ideal camera for shooting closeups of small flowers, insects, jewelry. The shooting/display switch feels/looks a little fragile, but I have had no problems so far. Overall, an outstanding little camera.","I own and have been happy with a Canon ELPH film camera.  What I loved about the ELPH was its compact size.  It really is small enough to carry in your pocket.  Even better, I got some of the best photos I'd ever taken using the ELPH, mainly because I carried it with me much more often and as a result, ended up taking pictures I would have missed had the camera been sitting at home.<br />For me, it was out of the question to sacrifice the small size when I made the move to a digital camera.  Fortunately, the PS400 is extremely compact and produces photos that are much better than the ELPH was capable of doing.<br />A major advantage of a digital camera is being able to immediately see the picture that you have just taken.  This allows you to re-take the shot if someone closed their eyes, or if it's poorly composed, or the flash needs to be adjusted. The PS400 is set to display the image for a few seconds after you take the picture, but you can also switch the camera into view mode and look at it more carefully if you need to.<br />Another big advantage of a digital camera is that you can edit the image after you have downloaded it to your PC.  This makes it possible for an amateur photographer to do what can only be done in a darkroom when you use film.  The download process itself is very fast and easy to do, whether you use the USB cable provided with the camera, or a Compact Flash card reader (which is quicker and will not deplete the camera's battery).  Once the image is on your PC, you can make all sorts of adjustments, using the provided software, or image editing software of your own choice.<br />You may be thinking that you won't want to do much image editing, and it is true that the camera takes pictures that are ready to go without any editing.  However, you will probably find that you are taking a lot more pictures than you ever did with a film camera.  Unlike a film camera, where you take a full roll of pictures and then wait to see the results, you get immediate feedback with a digital camera.  If you like it, it stays on the Compact Flash card until you download it.  If you don't like it, you can delete it and take another one.  Having the ability to shoot large numbers of pictures at no added cost, and experimenting with lighting and composition allows you to improve as a photographer.  I would never have used an entire roll of film trying to get the best possible picture of one subject, but I have found myself re-shooting the same subject from a variety of angles and with different lighting with the PS400. It's fast, it's free, and you can get immediate feedback on what works and what doesn't.<br />The camera can be connected to a TV monitor to allow showing pictures in a slide show.  I haven't used the video mode yet, which to me is a nice extra, but not something I had to have.<br />I have been pleasantly surprised with the camera's performance in low-light situations, always an issue with point-and-shoot cameras.  I have had far fewer pictures with red-eye than I ever had with any other small point-and-shoot cameras. Even shots that were poorly exposed have been quickly fixed using the digital imaging software.<br />The multi-zone focus system works extremely well and I have not yet had a picture that was out of focus.  The viewfinder tends to give a smaller image than you are actually shooting, so I generally use the LCD screen instead.  This can be problematic for outdoor shots, because the LCD screen is difficult to view in direct sunlight.  However, it has not been troublesome enough to detract from my enjoyment of using this camera.<br />Despite its tiny size, the camera is easy to use, even for someone with large hands.  The buttons are actually more substantial than the controls on my ELPH, and the menu system is reasonably well-organized.<br />I haven't had a battery run out on me yet, though I did buy an extra as back-up. The battery charges very quickly and the charging device is small and compact, with an AC plug that folds into the charger itself when not in use.  You can fit the camera, the charger, the PC cable, and the A/V cables, in a very small camera bag, and still have plenty of room for an extra battery, extra Compact Flash cards, and even the user's manual.<br />The camera comes with a 32MB Compact Flash card, which is more generous than what Canon provided with previous PowerShot models, but still not large enough (it will give you about 15 or 16 images at the highest resolution and largest size).  Since each image is about 2MB, you need a card that is at least 256MB. You will also want a case for the camera, since it is not included.  I have found that Canon's PSC-50 case works well with the PS400.  It provides protection but does not make the camera too bulky to fit in your pocket.<br />I know that some users have complained about the ArcSoft software that comes with the camera, but I have found it to be more intuitive to use than comparable editing software I've used in the past (including some of ArcSoft's previous products, which were not very good at all).  I feel that it strikes a reasonable balance between ease-of-use and a more robust set of features, and is well-suited to its target audience.  The Photo Record software that allows you to create photo albums is excellent.<br />I love this camera.  It is changing the way that I take pictures, and what I do with them after I've taken them.  I know that nothing is perfect, but this camera comes close.","I have been using a Olympus C-2020 for about three years now.  I do enjoy the manual controls, but I didn't like the large size and protruding lens.  I found myself leaving the camera at home when I wanted to take it, it was too big to fit in a jacket or pants pocket.  Then came the Canon S400.  The size of this camera is great and the build quality is top notch (nice metal casing), it fits in my pants pocket and I can now take it out more often for those events.  Picture quality is fantastic and the movie feature is great (has sound and its clear).  There are no real manual controls, but I can do with out them.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera and would recommend it to anyone.","Can't explain how easy the Canon S400 camera is. I didn't care too much for the software it came with but then again, others might see it pretty useful.  I've used other cameras such as the S100/S110, S200, S400, Sony dsc-p1, Sony cybershot dsc-f717, olympus c-5050.  Of all these, the S400 seems the most versatile with size, quality and capturing shots.<br />Pros<br />-Size being compact is a big plus!  Who wants to yank out a huge camera for a quick snapshot?  If you look at this camera closely, the battery + compact flash memory takes up about 30% of the camera space.  You'll be wondering how the heck they fit  all that in there?<br />-Quick shots with quick focus.  Of all the cameras I've used, this has got to be the best camera to 'capture' with.  The reason I'm saying this is because I've missed so many opportunities of capturing a shot due to a delay. (long focus/range)<br />-Ease of use.  Once you spend a good 30-60 min reviewing the manual and functionalities, you will be zoomin on the interface.  For example, changing the type of photo (sephia/b&w) setting took 4-5 presses of a button.  The Olympus C-5050 took over 9 presses of a difficult interface just to change the photo settings<br />-Nice indoor/outdoor shots.  I normally do not have trouble taking pictures outdoors. The problem usually relates to indoor shots.  The flash on this baby is pretty powerful!<br />-Price - Like I said, you can spend double the money and you will probably get more manual features to play around with. Aperture, shutter, +/- fine tuning.  Why spend the extra money on features you probably won't even use? (...)<br />Con<br />-Zoom  Every digital camera out there that has zoom capabilities, does not impress me.  Of course coming from the s400, you'll be wondering how they fit all that in such a compact size!  In any case, the zoom has improved since the s100/s110 days so this should be more of a 'pro' than a con<br />If you want a digital camera that is still considered to be high rez for most consumers (4 megapixel is more than enough), a camera that is easy to use, affordable, acts quickly (takes quick shots), compact and reliable. If you're looking for a cheaper camera, you can consider the s230 (3mp)","I was very pleased with the Canon S400.  I was deciding between a Canon A70 and the S400, and though the S400 lacks true manual control, the size and convenience is what pushed me to buy it.<br />The 4.0 MP resolution delivers very clear pictures, I have been very pleased so far with almost every single picture I've taken.  The speed is also commendable, from starting up to time between shots.  The auto features are all more than sufficient, with several options (including long shutter) despite the lack of true manual control.  I found it always did the job for me.<br />What really impressed me though, was simply the size and convenience.  There is so much power in this camera with 3x optical zoom, and it can still fit into just about any pocket!  This made it perfect for those spontaneous shots that you simply can't foresee.<br />I certainly got more than my money's worth, and I strongly recommend this camera to anyone interested in delving into digital photography or simply upgrading a camera.  I have no doubts this will keep me happily going for a while.","We are delighted with the Canon PS S400. It's light, portable, easy-to-use (we're distinctly casual photographers), and produces really excellent results. The video output has proven extremely useful on numerous occasions -- we have a Canon ZR-10 digital video camera but the S400 satisfies our needs most of the time, plus it's light and pocket-sized. The one slight issue we've noticed is that pictures seem to have more red-eye than our prior (non-digital) cameras. Still, the tools Canon provides, as well as those available on Mac and PC platforms, adequately overcome that limitation. For the price, this is an outstanding, feature-packed, and perfectly-sized buy.","Only one word to describe this camera:<br />WOW!<br />small, efficient, good battery life, easy-to-use...great resolution, good quality of photos in low light...<br />BUY THIS CAMERA!","Overall, its a very nice camera. It takes very nice pictures.<br />But for what it does, I don't think it deserves the price tag.<br />What is missing is:<br />1. Manual controls. You have some very limited control, but you<br />  cannot set up e.g., shutter speed (in fact, you can set it<br />  to high value, so why wouldn't cannot let you set it up all<br />  the way? strange design).<br />2. Small lens. The lens is small and does not seem to be of very<br />  high accurracy, especially at the wide angle spectrum. It is<br />  also hard to focus (perhaps since the camera is small).<br />3. Quality. I have two large flat screens in my work. I have no<br />  bad pixels on them. When CANON says it would not care for<br />  bad pixels if they are less than 0.01%, it means I think two<br />  things: a) this is not the highest quality flat screen that<br />  they could manufacture, and b) that you cannot expect a<br />  really great support. In addition to my bad pixel on the<br />  screen I have a bad pixel on my CCD. Canon's response? No<br />  response. Unfortunately, I'm in the UK right now, and<br />  doubt that my US service would help me.<br />Conclusion: a nice camera, a nice toy, looks like you can get<br /> much better bang for your buck buying some others.","This little Canon is ideal for somebody who likes to let the camera do the work most of the time, but occasionally likes to be a little more creative.<br />It does a great job left to its own devices, with clever metering and focusing. The manual functions don't stretch to full manual control of aperture and shutter control (aperture priority would've been nice, to avoid - light permitting - the extreme differential focus effect you tend to get on close-ups,), but you do get control over metering modes, focussing modes, ISO, EV and various flash modes, as well as a `long shutter' mode that lets you det up to a 15 second exposure and invokes an excellent noise reduction system.<br />I very much like the way you can adjust most of these directly from a button. It encourages you to be creative. Even when you do have to delve into a menu, it only takes a second. Canon's control system is one of the simplest I've seen, and I've had and used many digital cameras. This is a delight to use.<br />It's nice to hold too, and has a big fat shutter button that you can't miss, even with big fingers. It reacts almost instantly if you pre-focus.<br />The display is not the biggest around, but it's fast and clear, and even fairly usable in sunlight. All the indicators are clear and easy to see. The optical viewfinder is pretty good too, for such a small camera, despite the lack of parallax-correction marks.<br />The zoom control is a little bit hit-and-miss though, and you find yourself going beyond the point you intended before it reacts properly.<br />The pictures it takes are the most important thing though, and it's nice to see that the lens is up to the challenge of the 4.0 megapixel CCD. That high resolution is great because you can crop images quite a lot and still print them or view them at a  decent size. The images the Canon takes look at the same time crisp and natural, with little of that `processed' look I've seen from other digital cameras. If anything, the images start out a little flat, but a tweak of brightness and contrast brings them up to scratch. I'd rather this than get images that can't be tweaked in a photo editor without making them worse.<br />Battery life seems quite good. The battery didn't last so long the first charge, but now keeps me going for a few days, even though I use the screen all the time and often review photos. There's no battery-level display until the battery gets low, which is slightly unnerving but doesn't really matter. A spare is a good idea.<br />You can have fun with this camera too. By taking panoramas and stitching them together with the supplied software (works much better than I expected), or by setting the camera up to make different sounds for different functions. You can even record your own sounds using the camera's microphone. Once you start delving into all the things this camera can do, you wonder how on earth they pack it all inside.<br />What don't I like? Well, to be honest, there's nothing worth mentioning other than the slightly clumsy zoom action. That's how good it is. I've changed cameras a lot over the last few years; it'll take something truly amazing to get me to swap this though.","This camera is a joy to use.  It is small enough to carry everywhere.  It's about the size of a pack of playing cards.  Image quality is wonderful.  The prints that come straight out of the camera on my Epson 960 inkjet printer are stunning.  The white balance adjustment works well and the metering is very accurate. It is a good idea to buy an extra battery as there is no battery meter so you really don't know when you will run out of juice.  The battery is small and carrying an extra battery is easy.  The optional case is very handy.  The camera comes with a wrist strap which is a safe and unobtrusive way to carry this little wonder when you are out and about shooting.<br />I had been looking for a small camera to take with me everywhere with excellent image quality and now I have it.  Canon really did a beautiful job.  The camera also feels great in the hand.","- No battery indicator until the battery almost run out - missed the pictures of most important moment :(<br />- Small video screen (max 320x240)<br />- Easy to get scratched","After extensive research on the web ...I chose to upgrade my Canon S20 to a Canon S400.  In someways, this was a step down.  Unfortunately, the S400 does not support verticle alignment of it's panoramic \"stitch assist\" mode as they do on the S40, S45, S50 and other higher priced models.  I found this feature on the S20 to be very useful in capturing more image (greater resolution and consistant panning) when stitching photos together to make a panoramic photo.  Also, the S400 does not support the higher resolution movie mode of 640 x 320, as some digital cameras support.  Hopefully, Canon will address these feature shortfalls with a firmware upgrade in the near future.  As mentioned in a number of reviews, the S400's flash is miniscule and thus is somewhat inadequate to light wide distant shots.<br />Canon has improved the intelligence of the powershot digital line.  Specifically in the S400 the Digic processing makes for fast picture taking and viewing.  The size of the S400 is grand.  It does fit in a pocket and powers up so quickly, you may never miss another shot with this camera (keeping in mind to charge your battery and have enough flash memory for the moment!!!).<br />The bottom line... the Canon S400 is compact, sturdy, and fast.  If you are looking for a very small 4 megapixel camera with nice even colors, low levels of distortion, a basic movie capture mode, fast memory writing and reading, the S400 is a current top pick.  However, if you are looking for lots of manual control, vertical \"photo stitching,\" and more pixels try the S50.<br />One note if considering the S45 or S50 cameras, play with the navigation buttons before purchasing the unit;  I have found the navigation to be somewhat clumsy in-which it is easy to hit \"enter\" when trying to navigate \"up\" or \"down,\" or hit \"up\" when trying to \"enter.\"","This is the third digital camera that I've owned.  I was looking for a camera that was durable, compact, and produced good photos.  This camera has far exceeded my expectations.  My previous camera (Canon G2) did a great job but since I travel frequently I wanted a camera that was more compact and easier to carry.  I \"test-drove\" the latest cameras from Canon, Casio, Kodak, Konica, Nikon, Olympus, Samsung and Sony. This camera blew all the others out of the water by a mile.  My highest recommendation!  Fits nicely on my belt, in my compact Targus camera bag, next to my Blackberry and Samsung V205 cellphone.  WOW, talk about handy and easy to use!!!

Fits nicely on my belt, in my compact Targus camera bag, next to my Blackberry and Samsung V205 cellphone.  WOW, talk about handy and easy to use!!!  You need not look any further that the Canon S440 Elph.","It was a pleasant experience buying this camera (till now). Red-eye reduction really works and the resolution is fantastic, If you are looking for big pictures with better quality this is the one to go, although the movie mode is'nt really interesting, the quality was not upto the mark. after all i did'nt buy this camera to take movies.","I like this little digital camera. It does everything a point and shoot digital camera should do and more. For me, a point and shoot camera should be small and light so that it can conveniently go with me everywhere. That's the power of any point and shoot camera actually. It goes with you in your daily life and subsequently you get shots that you could not get with other larger cameras either because it would be too conspicous, or too inconvient to carry with you.<br />The S400 camera is barely larger or heavier than a pak of cigarettes and even fits in a shirt pocket with relative ease.<br />I originally had an S50 but ended up getting rid of it because it was too big and heavy and the manual controls on it were cumbersome to use. In the end, the manual controls on the S50 were not worth having to carry around such a brick-like camera.  The S50 often ended up staying at home or in the car and I missed out on shots because I did not have the camera with me.<br />The images out of the S400 suprisingly enough, look even better to me than those out of the S50. I can't really explain why this is considering that the S50 is a full 1 megapixel higher than the S400.<br />I don't miss having the full manual controls that the S50 has at all. When I had the S50, I found that I hardly ever used the manual controls anyway because they are a bit cumbersome. I actually longed for more ease and simpleness, which frees one up to take pictures more spontaneously.  So the small size and convenience of the S400 more than outweighs the lack of full manual controls for me.  And the S400 does have manual mode where you can dial in some settings manually, just not f-stop and shutter speed. Further, you can often achieve the same effects as if you had full manual controls just by knowing how to set the S400. For example, if I want to shoot an outdoor portrait with a shallow depth of field (so the background will be blurry), I would set the camera's ISO to 50 and then meter off of something fairly dark (like the shade) while holding down the shutter down halfway to lock the exposure and recompose to the subject to take the picture.<br />To conclude, I am happy with this camera because it does everything a small point and shoot digital camera should do, yet it is quite small, light, feels sturdy (metal case) and has very pleasant ergonomics both with regard to the layout of the controls as well as to the on screen menu functions.","I got an S400 last week.  This is my second digital camera.  My first was also a Canon, A200 Powershot.  What I love with this camera is it's battery life.  Quick charging and goes a long way.  I took about 300 images before I had to recharge.  My old one was an AA battery kind.  Never buy ones using AA.  Life will be short.  Times when you are about to take the most important pics, you're dead already.<br />Very handy, pocket size.  I was able to carry it everywhere I go.  Clearly the best!","*** UPDATED ON 7/21/03 ***<br />I have changed my rating of the Canon S400 from 4 to 5 stars.  No  problems have arisen in over three months of use.  I have also experimented with some of the manual controls (macro mode and shutter length), with excellent results.<br />My original conclusion stands; this camera's combination of size, speed, and quality is unrivaled in the digicam point-and-shoot market.<br />I have nothing but praise for Canon on producing such a fine product (which is increasingly rare these days).<br />My original review follows below.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />I purchased the s400 less than a week ago and put it through the paces at a wedding last weekend.  I did wide shots,telephoto'd shots, indoor/outdoor, and even some videos.  It worked flawlessly.  Everything behaved as I expected, and the pictures I took came out well.<br />I recieved a lot of compliments on the camera, with size, startup time, and image quality being the things people commented on the most.  Although I considered all of these things when I decided to purhase the s400, hearing this from other digital camera owners really solidified my conclusions and convinced me that I made the right choice.<br />The bottom line on this camera is that it is very small and takes excellent pictures.  From what I have seen so far, I hardly think anyone could go too far wrong with the S400.<br />The only drawback is the price, hence the four star rating, but IF this camera holds up for the next few months without throwing any kind of a techno-fit, I'll push my rating up to five stars.","This is my first digital camera and I am very happy with it. It is a very stylish camera on the outside but the image quality is another plus factor. I have seen other big name brands with the same 4 MP but the quality just doesn't equal this little beauty. It is worth every penny in my book. The only thing I can complain about is the red eye reduction. But it can be corrected with the right software. Despite that, I can't help but give it very high marks.","I have owned this camera for about a month and love it. The con's people talk about don't seem like they are real to me. The flash is more than adequate for a normal use. I had a Nikon 775 and the best thing that ever happened with that camera is I dropped in and it died. It went back to service twice and never got fixed right. The S400 has a great macro mode, focus lock, auto exposure lock, long shutter mode... I really like the auto focus mode telling me where the camera focused. The Nikon chronically focused on the background instead of the subject even in portrait mode. Very frustrating. Also, the plastic case on the Nikon was not rugged enough. The Canon has a very solid case that does not flex. The battery life is great and I did by an extra battery for about $35. The Nikon battery life was much worse. The shutter delay and startup delay on the Canon is very short compared to the Nikon. Canon starts up in about 2 seconds vs. the Nikon which is over 8. The Canon also switches very fast between shoot and review mode. Also, the slide show through the video output is much faster than the Nikon. The 775 would draw the picture painfully slow on the screen.<br />I highly recommend this camera!","I've been using my Powershot S400 for nearly 6 months now, and have taken well over 1,000 pictures with it. I had previous owned a Minolta S404, and I have been much happier with the Powershot for the following reasons:<br />1. The autofocus mechanism is much more reliable than the Minolta S404 in my experience. This probably has something to do with the autofocus assist lamp. Even in bright outdoor scenes, the Powershot seems to do a better job.<br />2. Less noise in low light situation than the Minolta S404. None of the flash photos that I've taken with this camera have shown signficant color noise problems like what I saw in the Minolta.<br />3. Very short time between frames. When you turn off the LCD preview, you can shoot images back to back in under 2 seconds. The Minolta would pause nearly 4-5 seconds in most cases.<br />4. It is actually compact enough to be easily portable. Don't fool yourself into thinking that one of the medium sized cameras (Minolta S404, Canon G3/G4/G5) will give you all the control you loved about your old 35mm SLR camera. They don't come close. To make matters worse, they are also no more portable than a full-size SLR. So in one sense, they are the worst of both worlds: too bulky to fit in a pocket, but not geeky enough to make real photo geeks happy. The Powershot is a good compromise in that you give up some manual features and interchangeable lenses, but you have a camera that will literally fit in your pocket.","It is my first digital camera, I have had it for just one week, and it is incredible.  Simple to use, great picture quality, and well made.  Hard to believe I can carry a 4 megapixel camera in my pocket!  I am very pleased with it.<br />I gave it only 4 stars because of the cost:  ..., plus you should buy a larger capacity Flash card which puts it over the ... dollar mark.<br />However if you want a tiny camera, with great power, this is the it.","One of the most important reason why I purchased the S400 is because of its size.<br />I've own other digital cameras before and have also traveled with them. After awhile, I would not want to carry the digital cameras because they were bulky and inconvenient. I found myself wasted a lot of money on cameras that I rarely use.<br />The S400 solved that problem right away. I just put this tiny camera in my pants and off I go. My hands are not weighted down by any unnecessary bulk.<br />Moreover, the picture quality is very good. The controls are also very intuitive. It has just enough manual modes that would make me happy. I'm pleasantly surprise how powerful the flash is compared to my other digital cameras. So powerful that I had to adjust the exposure level... I also love the long battery life.<br />The only complaints I have are:<br />1. Auto White Balance doesn't work well under certain conditions. For example in-door with light bulb lighting, the picture is very yellow. I hope Canon would fix this problem with a firmware udpate.<br />2. Unable to delete selected pictures from the Camera. You can only either \"delete one at a time\" or \"delete everything\". Somewhat annoying.","You obviously need to do a lot more researching on digital cameras and what the MP rating actually means for a camera.<br />Firstly, I highly doubt a camcorder's image quality is going to compare anywhere near a dedicated digital camera...<br />With that said..  How about taking a nice 2272x1704 res picture with your Sony Camcorder?  No?  Oh, I forgot..a 1.5MP camera probably couldnt even match half that resolution.<br />Some people do actually enjoy being able to print out an 8x10\" picture with no loss in quality.<br />Use your comcorder and stick to what it does best...record video.  If you want a truly high-quality and professional camera, then keep the Canon S400 and appreciate its color depth, resolution capabilities, and features.","The Canon Powershot S400 is my second digital camera. The first was a 1.2 MP Olympus that was just way too big to carry around. I chose the Canon based on three factors: Size, Image Quality, and Ease of Use.<br />Size-- Size was my biggest concern. It's so tiny!! :) The camera is about the same size as a deck of playing cards. Nevertheless, the LCD screen is of a usable size and the buttons aren't so tiny that you need to use a fingernail to depress them. The viewfinder is a bit small, but atypically, shows a fairly true representation of what your shot will look like. I found the LCD screen to be a much better way of taking pictures.<br />Image Quality-- Wow! I was so pleased! None of my images have needed major color correction. The white balance is right on track. This little camera gets it right even in difficult color situations like bright sunlight. Flesh tones come out nice and natural and whatever Canon has done to eliminate red eye really works. I'd highly recommend this camera to people picky about image quality.  The camera allows you to set the resolution of your photo. I've taken most of mine on \"fine\", but there's also a \"superfine\" resolution. I find that on the superfine, I get 14 shots. I average about 27 on fine. This brings me to my only issue with this camera-- What's up with the 32 MB card?? If you're spending this amount of money on a camera, it ought to come with a bigger card. I went out and bought a 256 MB one almost instantly.<br />Ease of Use-- Ease of use is the category that kept me from giving this camera five stars. It's very easy to learn the basic functions. Taking pictures, zooming in, zooming out, etc. The menus for the more complex functions are a bit less intuitive. They present you with useless options like changing the LCD's splash screen first and make you dig for important things like changing the resolution of the images. If you read the book, you'll get everything after a few rounds of shots, but you do need to read the book.<br />Overall, I am VERY pleased with my camera and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.","I was on the market for a new camera--to upgrade from a 2 MP Olympus we bought a year ago.  I wanted the camera to be small, so I narrowed the choice down to the Canon S400 and the Pentax Optio S.  I ordered both (from companies that offered no-penalty returns) and reviewed them for several days.  After side-by-side testing, I'm going with the S400.  Here's why:<br />1) Controls: the controls on the Canon are better and require less digging into internal menus to do what you want to do.  Very important to me.  The Pentax has some but not as many external options--you have to dig more.  Some examples: Movie mode, panoramic mode.  Also, the little Pentax 4-way-plus-\"okay\" (center push) joystick is pretty small, and although the average user can learn to use it quickly, it is still not desirable.<br />2) Screen quality: Much better on the Canon--brighter, sharper, etc.  Pentax screen is a bit darker and slightly pixely.<br />3) Focus/shooting: With the Pentax, when you press the button to focus, it freezes the frame for a second, where as the Canon doesn't freeze the frame--it allows you to see your subject at all times.  This was slightly annoying at first but became unbearable when I attempted to snap pics of my 1-year old daughter who was crawling!  Also, the Pentax takes longer to focus for most shots.<br />4) Movie mode: Canon's higher quality mode was much better--a sharper, cleaner, brighter movie.  Sound quality is a little better, but not lots.<br />5) Battery door: The Pentax's door is super cheesy, just like all the reviews say, although this is not a major concern for me.<br />6) Overall construction: I think this Canon will take a bit of a beating--the Pentax feels a bit [weak] in comparison.<br />7) Battery charger: This is a small item, but I like the fact that the Canon charger is a little unit with a plug on it--so you don't need any extra cords to plug it in--it just plugs straight into the wall.<br />8) Picture quality: Canon's 9-point focusing system works really well.  The pictures are clean and crisp.  The Pentax takes a bit long to focus at times, and I got a few blurry pics--sometimes it focuses on the wrong thing.  I didn't notice a major difference with the quality between the 3.2 MP and 4.0 MP, but I'm sure if I blew up an 8x12 bigger I'd notice the difference.<br />9) Panorama: I think Canon does the Panorama thing slightly better, although the Pentax does it well, too.<br />Here's what's better about the Pentax:<br />1) Size--super small and light.  Absolutely amazing.  Although, to be fair to Canon, the S400 is virtually the same size as the S200, which is impressive.<br />2) Great battery life.  Can't say it is much better than Canon's, but it is good.<br />3) Super short lag time between photos in review mode (and slightly longer but still short in photo mode)--slightly shorter than Canon's, but I can handle that.<br />4) Colors seem more natural.  In the automatic mode with the Canon, the colors are a bit too bright, almost unreal, BUT you can use the manual mode with the Canon and choose a \"neutral\" setting to deal with the color issue.<br />5) The Pentax has slightly more manual control, like manual focus, for instance.<br />In summary: If you want super small, go with the Pentax.  If you want solid and super high, durable quality, go with the Canon.  The Canon runs about $$$ more (you can find it for less, though), but I think it is worth it.  Read the other reviews on Amazon (and elsewhere) as well, but I haven't heard any major complaints about the S400.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.","We currently own the S230 and the Olympus 4040.<br />  This morning I did a shoot-off between the Olympus 4040 (4MP w/gorgeous F2.0 lens) and my new S400 (4MP F2.8), using a tripod.  Previously I had stopped using the S230 to take my rose garden pictures as the resolution and focus just could not compare to the 4040.  But I was surprised to see the S400's pictures were slightly BETTER than the 4040.  The Olympus' famous jagged diagonals resulted in a softer image than the Canon's.<br />  Usually I would expect to give up Image Quality to get the small body size of this camera - but this tradeoff does not exist in the S400!","I travel a ton, and wanted a very portable camera with high resolution.  I originally bought the Konica KZ-400 (3.2 megapixels), but found the focusing to be problematic, among other things.  Swaped it out for the Canon S230 but then Canon introduced this model, so I swaped again for the S400 (didn't even use the S230).<br />In short, I couldn't be happier.  This thing looks great, is super portable, and takes wonderful pictures, many of which I've printed on 8x10s.  I mostly use the automatic setting, which does a great job, but more serious photographers will appreciate the manual controls (white balance, ISO speed, etc.).<br />With 4 megapixels and the features this camera offers, I doubt this model will be outdated anytime soon.  It is priced at the high end among its peer group, but I can't see anyone saving enough money to justify passing this one up.  And don't just take my word for it, look at the other reviews.","If you are amateur and want to spend less than 500 dollars for an almost pro digital camera that you can carry everywhere this is a good choice for an investment for the next 2 years. Visibly smaller than previous S200 and S300 models, this small cam is a traveller's delight. Works with the same battery, memory card, and soft case as previous models. I sold my S300 model that I bought in 2001, added $100 and bought this S400. I am not sorry. I am gonna do the same move 2 years from now on. It is definitely an improvment in image quality and size and in movie quality. Of course it is not perfect, but it performs well for its size. I definitely recommend it. If they would sell it for around 350-400, I think it would be a huge hit on the market. For people who want to be pro and still go small size I recommend S50 model, which is a little larger thou. Enjoy your new cam and travel light!","I bought this camera and I have not looked back since.  I had the Canon PS S330.  I enjoyed every moment with it.  When I first learned of the new S400, I had to have it.  This little powerhouse has really lived up to the reviews that I have read online.  One of the best features is the ease to making great pictures.  For a beginner like myself, the only real next step is to go Digital SLR - which to be honest would take a lot of saving on my part.  They are very pricey.  Good luck and enjoy your new purchase. - I do reccommend an extra battery, and at least a 128mb CF card.  Preferably a 256mb.","I did months of research before buying the S400.  I purchased it primarily because of its size and the fact that we own a Canon IXUS already and it is a very good camera.  We took the digital camera on a recent trip to Russia and the Czech Republic and took over 1000 pictures with it.  It performed flawlessly and actually took some pictures better than the Nikon 808 we had with us.  This is the first digital camera I have owned and it was well worth the wait. I highly recommend it to anyone considering a digital camera.","This is the perfect camera for what I wanted.  It is small enough to fit in my pocket, and it takes excellent pictures.  I've had it for a month now, no big complaints.  Occasionally i get a few blurry pictures, but that is mostly just user error.  You just have to get used to the camera.  Buy a large cf card, i got a 512mb which works great.  Enjoy!","I am very impressed with the features, easy of use, cost, quality, and size of this camera.  I have been waiting for digital cameras to get good enough and cheap enough to replace my film camera.  I have found it in the Cannon S400.  The wife loves it, we hardly ever took our regular camera with us anywhere, but this little thing takes wonderfully clear pictures and it fits in your pocket. Same size as a pack of cigarettes, just a little thicker.  You will definitely want a 128MB memory card- mine holds about 78 pics at highest quality. Only two complaints- it doesn't come with a case, and it uses special Cannon batteries - which are a little on the expensive side.  Goodnews it only takes 130 minutes for a full recharge.  would definitely buy again.  Best on the market for the price..","Many people say this is a \"point and shoot\" camera, and that's fine. They do, however, neglect to tell you that, especially for the tiniest 4.0 MP camera, this tiny camera has plenty of manual features to keep you happy with it once you've graduated from point and shoot-dom. The shutter, while not fully adjustable to be left open for any amount of time, can be kept open for up to 15 seconds and with an adjustable ISO up to 400 I've taken shots of stars I can't even see. It even lowers the noise on shots longer than 1.3 seconds. The aperture is the only qualm I have about the camera, as it's not adjustable as the editorial review said, yet I'm sure Canon will offer that in a firmware upgrade eventually. With custom white balances and special color modes rounding out this little giant, how could anyone go wrong? This is my first digital camera and it could possibly be my last!","i am in love of this litle thing. is faster, and small and pictures are wonderful","After buying this little gem, I've left my Nikon and Rollei at home. Arguably, there are other cameras out there with higher resolutions and extensive manual controls but NONE of them can beat this elegant 4-megapixel little pocket camera in terms of ease of use and picture quality. Especially if you've got kids! You want to catch those \"Kodak Moments\" but you won't if your fiddling around with a camera that's too big to lug around and too complicated to operate. This Canon S400 is the ultimate family \"point and shoot.\"","I recently purchased this camera from Amazon.com and I am very impressed.  This is my very first camera that I've owned so I'm still reading the manual but so far it has worked very well.  The photo quality is amazing.  The only thing that I think could be better is the battery life.  I charge mine about once a day but it charges completely in only 2 hours.  I have been very pleased.","PROS:  Great bright high quality pictures with massive resolution and zoom!<br />CONS:  Maybe I havent set it up right (just got it), but to autofocus and then take an exposure it takes a whole 1-2 seconds.","I am a casual photo enthusiast who enjoys taking pictures of my friends and family wherever I go. Both photographic quality and portability are of paramount concerns and I think I found my holy grail with Canon S400.<br />Pros:<br />- Extremely portable, yet very rugged<br />- Beautiful design with excellent overall ergonomics<br />- Typically excellent photo quality in all-auto mode with no redeye<br />- Very fast -- startup time, image processing and acquisition, menu response<br />- Long battery life<br />- Uses widely popular (and inexpensive) CompactFlash Type 1 memory cards<br />- 4 megapixel resolution (2272x1704)<br />- 3X optical zoom/11X max with digital<br />- Useful movie mode with audio (3 minutes at 320x240 or 160x120)<br />Cons:<br />- Minimal manual controls (e.g., no manual focus)<br />- Cheap A/V/digital output cover<br />- Movie mode limited to 3 minutes (and no 640x480 mode may irk some)<br />- Proprietary battery<br />- Some barrel distortion when taking wide angle shots<br />While S400 has some shortcomings, mainly lack of manual focus, exposure, and shutter speed. And some may be bothered by its use of proprietary lithium ion battery, although given its compact size, I think Canon engineers had to implement proprietary battery. On the plus side, the battery lasts a long time, capable of taking several hundred shots before running out of juice (and takes only a couple of hours to recharge).<br />I've managed to fill entire 512MB memory card (32MB is included) on a single battery charge.<br />Did I mention how beautiful this camera is? The photos do not do this camera a justice. At 3.4\" by 2.2\" by 1.1\", the S400 is no larger than most compact cell phones. Inch by inch, it's only a tad larger than my tiny Sony Ericsson T68i cell phone and smaller than (although a bit thicker) my Apple iPod MP3 player.<br />The ergonomics are consistently excellent. Although there are some learning curves (particularly given rich feature set), once mastered (comprehensive manuals make it easy), most will appreciate elegant menu layout and ideal number of buttons and layout.<br />But beautiful design means nothing if it does not accomplish its main functions -- taking beautiful pictures. In full auto setting, which is what majority people might use, the pictures were consistently satisfying, although overriding the white balance to match the lighting condition improved the quality significantly in many shots.<br />This is a great camera.","This is my second Canon P&S and like it's predecessor it is an excellent machine, perhaps too cute to keep easily but it does everything it says on the box and does it well.<br />My only grumble (apart from the tacky chromed lens ring) is with \"Image Gateway\" service Canon offers with the camera. Hiden away within the long text of the users agreement is a clause tantamount to Canons unlimited right to use images uploaded there, so use at your own risk.<br />Great camera sad about the service","Pros:<br />1) Compact Size<br />2) 4.0 Megapixel Camera!<br />3) 3x Optical Zoom, 3.6x Digital Zoom<br />4) CompactFlash media with High Speed CompactFlash support.<br />5) Improved Movie Record Mode (up to 3 minutes with High Speed CompactFlash card)<br />6) 9 point AiAF system (Artificial Intelligence AutoFocus) (S200 has 3 point AiAF system)<br />7) DIGIC processor (specialized processor made by Canon specifically for digital cameras... supposedly improves camera photo quality)<br />8) iSAPS (Intelligent Scene Analysis based on Photographic Space) for improved camera focus and white balancing.<br />9) Direct printing to DPOF (Digital Print Order Format) compatible printers.<br />10) Accepts the original Lithium-Ion batteries of the S110 and S300 cameras.<br />11) Adjustable ISO settings from 50 to 400<br />12) Self-Timer from 2 or 10 secs<br />13) Continuous Shooting mode<br />14) Stainless Steel Casing.<br />15) Built-in speaker<br />16) FUNC button like S45/S50 PowerShots for easier navigation through camera options especially in manual mode.<br />17) More rounded body gives a slightly sleeker look to the S400.<br />Cons:<br />1) Short Battery Life but seemed better than S230<br />2) Flash is weak especially in nighttime settings with no additional lighting and at 3x zoom.<br />3) Additional Batteries from Canon are Expensive. J&R sells non-Canon brands for as low as $...<br />4) Tripod mounting now on far left side of camera (you are looking at the back of the camera<br />5) Minimal Accessories available for the camera<br />My Opinion:...I brought 3 different camera with me. The S230, S45, and the S400 up to Boston while I do a bit of sightseeing between interviews. The reasons why I brought 3 of my camera was to see which camera will have the higest quality of picture.<br />I took photos of the Cambridge area, the Northern docks, and of Fenway with all three cameras... and of close up and group photos with my friends in the area. The fastest camera to start up was the S400. In fairly close up photos and group photos in daylight or good lighting situations, there wasn't a discernable amount of difference between the three cameras especially after printing out the photos on a photo-quality inkjet printer. I noted differences in distance shooting (landscaping photos) and low light situations. Landscape shots of the Boston Harbor captured better details especially with objects in the far background with the S400 and S45. Distant shots of Fenway captured sharper details on the S400 and S45 as well. Nighttime shots were best captured on the S45... although not by a great deal over the S230 and S400. The range of manual controls were without a doubt better on the S45 and that allowed me to take better twilight landscape photos than the other two digital cameras. The surprise was that the S400 seemed the fastest to display the picture in the LCD after the shutter button is pressed and the continuous shot modes were also considerable faster to me than the S230 and S45.","This little Canon is a dream. Enough manual features to allow your creative side to experiement and keep it interesting. Personally though, I mostly plan to use the S400 in auto mode for most pics though, as the shots are unbelievable for such a small camera in all settings. My former camera was a Fujii FinePix 6800 which is also a fine piece of electrical engineering, however, I prefer the 4.0 megapixel CCD as oppose to an interpolated system delivering 6.0 resolution derived from 3.0. The S400 is also much smaller, and feels more solid in the hand. Another plus is the unit is great at battery conservation, unlike some systems that drain the juice forcing you to not use the LCD. A real neat feature worthy of mention is the \"Mini Movie\" with sound feature which allows for two resolution settings and 3 minutes of capture. The only drawback with this little guy is the rubber cover for the AV and USB ports which in time will probably need to be replaced due to wear. I wish Canon designed a door type device for this purpose, but then again, rough users would probably break the door off. For this enigma, I suggest a CF card reader, especially if you do not use the AV ports like me. I just upload the files, and convert them to whatever format needed to play in whatever device I want, and burn them on optical media of choice, so I can leave the cover in place. None the less this is a camera I highly recommend for all users. The set-up is basically brainless for computer geeks, and simple for newbies. The S400 itself in usage is similar, in that newbies will take great shots in auto mode, and when they progress they will find the manual settings fun to play with. One of the useful manual features is the \"Stitch Assist Mode\" combined with the easy to use included software, \"PhotoStitch\" anyone can shoot awesome panoramic shots. Another neat feature, although fairly benign, is the \"My Camera\" mode which you can alter audio effects to make the camera sound like it has a mechanical shutter. You can even create your own sounds and personal pics to upload with the supplied software to replace factory effects. Lots of stuff in this \"Little Guy\" to keep you amused. Plus it takes superb pictures!<br />PS Digital cameras of this size are a real pain to find proper sized camera bags, so here are two that I purchased for different uses.  The first is a Tamrac Digital Series model #5690 that has a velcro strip along with a clip fastener in front for secure carrying. It also has a small zippered pouch in front that can hold a spare battery and two CF cards in their case.  The second is Lowepro model D-Res 8S with a zippered opening. This is a more fitted case which has an acessory pouch within the bag itself that can hold one spare battery, and one CF card. You could probably squeeze another CF card in, but the fit will be a little tight.  Both bags come with shoulder straps, belt straps, and are made of ballistic nylon that is well padded.  Your Elf will not roll or shake in these cases. The Canon PSC300 cloth pouch is okay if you like the purple dinosaur color, and don't mind the lint it collects.","Canon's S400 is the second 4 MegaPixel compact digicam from a major manufacturer on the market (I consider Minolta's F100 the first).  Overall, the S400 is a winner for anyone looking for a basic point-and-shoot digital camera with a few added picture modes.  While the overall build quality of the S400 is slightly inferior to Canon's 3MP S230 camera... the bevy of features compensates for this.<br />On the plus side is the 4 MegaPixel photo capture, 3x OPTICAL Zoom (which is way more important than what level of digital zoom it has), built-in speaker and microphone, 9 point AutoFocus system, improved user interface with the new FUNC button, DIGIC image processor which speeds up photo capture and improves photo quality, improved battery life over the older Canon digital ELPH even the S230 camera, up to 3 minutes of movie capture in various resolutions, and voice annotations on photos.  All of this in a camera that fits into your shirt pocket.  You also have a few manual settings if you desire with manual exposure control, white balance (with several preset values), some photo effects (sepia shots, B&W, motion blur), and long shutter settings to name several user adjustable settings.<br />On the minus side, battery life is somewhat short (150-170 in my use on a full charge), the flash is weak especially for low light and nighttime shots, you often will get red eye in your flash shots even with the red eye reduction (although it is greatly reduced), the off-center tripod hole makes it more difficult to have stitched photos, the limited manual controls versus other cameras in this price range, and the price of the camera.<br />Overall, this a great compact digital camera best for vacationing and those who need an easy to carry camera with little operating hassle.  If you desire more manual features and professional level features, look at Canon's S45 4MP digital camera with is the same price as the S400.","I've owned four cameras in the ELPH series now - the S100, the S110, the S230 and now the S400. I've liked them all but the S400 is simply sensational!! Yes, some may nit and pic about some things but mostly they aren't reading the manual - it is not bigger than the S230, the usa.canon.com website lists it as 1mm deeper but show it to be the exact same size in inches!? Yes, they reduced the movie mode resolution (while lengthening the movie time) but who uses it much anyway and even at that it works just fine. I took a 2 minute sequence today of a mama Killdeer doing her wounded bird schtick and it looks fantastic on my computer monitor screen! Spring for an extra battery, a bigger CF card and the leather case for the old ELPH Jr APS camera and you have an unbeatable combination with no excuse for not having it in your pocket at all times to get that photo op that is always coming up to be missed because you hate carrying that bulky, heavy other digicam!! Hopefully next year they'll do it all over again in a 4X zoom, 5 megapixel same size upgrade - I'll be the first in line to buy it, the S400 ELPH series is one of the greatest, everyday, real world, practical cameras to ever exist. Buy it and take 10,000 pictures this year like I did last year with my S230. That's $2800 worth of film and processing in a film camera using a camera that only cost me ... for the camera, an extra battery and two 128mb CF cards - if you're a careful internet shopper like me!","I opened the box, loaded the battery & CF card, and started shooting pictures. The basic controls were easy to figure out in seconds. Some day soon I will read the manual to learn the advanced controls. 3x zoom is very useful. No red-eye. Automatic exposure control works well. A picture of large room was well lit and all parts of the room were easy to see. No dark areas. Like most digital cameras, you have to hold the button down and wait for the shutter and flash to fire. This makes action shots difficult. Cycle time is better than my previous two digital cameras. The only real down side is the proprietary battery. In the past I have purchased and loaded AA or AAA batteries anywhere. Now I have to recharge or carry a spare battery.<br />The bottom line is: I use a digital camera for convenience. I purchased a Canon Digital Elph because its size makes it easy to carry. Therefore, I am more likely to have it with me when I want to take a picture. I purchased the S400 because I was disapointed in the 2x zoom of the S230 and 4 Mega Pixels gives me more cropping/quality options. I'm very happy with my choice.","Everything I want it to do without alot of extra gimmicks. All my photos look like prizewinners. Four megapixels seem to do the job just fine and there isn't the usual waiting time between clicks.","My First digital camera was S100 from Canon, upgraded to S200 and S230 (3.2 megapixel) This is my Fourth Digital Camera which is the best, the smallest powerful 4 megapixel around... There are other good digital camera but most of them are big and ugly... This one is perfect. Can Record 3 minute movie..., 3X optical zoom plus 8X digital Zoom. Never buy Sony Digital camera (Sony Camcorder is good but not the digital camera)... Canon is better and more powerful... Most of my friends have canon, only one person have Sony... and that will tell the difference...  :)","Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, it does!. I bought the Canon S230 (3.2mp) in January and have already upgraded to the S400. This camera has been in stock for several weeks at online stores I probably can't mention here. I've had mine for a week now. Overall this is a great camera, it's the same size as the S230, very carryable, high quality, improved optics and zoom (3x optical instead of 2x) and the extra megapixels come in handy. There are a few minor points to pick at.<br />1). Certain parts of the camera are now plastic instead of metal as on the S230 (from what I can tell, the zoom ring around the power button, the chrome ring around the lens, and the edges of the lens). The main body of the camera is still metal, however it's a new finish (Cerabrite) which has an odd plasticky look to it. Overall the construction quality doesn't feel quite as nice as the S230, notably the feel of the buttons when pressed, however it's nothing to be alarmed about.<br />2). For some reason Canon removed the 640x480 movie mode option. I never used the movie mode extensively, but this might matter to some users.<br />3). While some people might like it, (I think it's tacky) Canon has added the following useless features: Camera startup sound, shutter sound, camera display theme and startup image. There are cheesy sounds like a bird chirp, or a wolf howl, startup images like a Canon logo, picture of sunset, bird, etc. Due to the addition of these features the camera now has a tiny speaker. One benefit of the speaker/sounds is that Canon has added a self-timer sound which I think is useful.<br />Some other nice additions/changes include the ability to edit the length of movie clips on the camera, a closer focusing distance in the macro setting, and the ablility to record a sound bye of up to 60 seconds to a picture (also useable as a simple voice recorder for recording memos, thoughts, etc) which will play back via the tiny speaker. The microphone has been moved from the front of the camera to the top, this could be good or bad depending, it may record less wind noise in windy situations (especially if facing into the wind), however it may also no longer pick up quieter sounds due to the repositioning.<br />At a minimum I would reccommend the use of a 128mb card, preferrably 256mb or larger. At less than $$$ I would suggest an external memory card reader to be used for transfering photos instead of the Canon software which seems buggy at times. As far an extra battery goes, some people won't live without an extra. With the price of the battery, I'd pass. Canon says the camera is good for 190 photos with the LCD on (400+ with LCD off). I've never taken more than 50 pictures in a day and have always had an opportunity to recharge the battery during some down time in the evening.<br />To sum things up, if you're looking for a high quality high megapixel camera that's easily carryable, and hardly noticed in most pockets, this is it!. The combination of size, quality and features of this camera are unmatched!. If you don't require 4 megapixels or want to save $$$ I'd highly reccommend the S230 which I have also reviewed.","Beautiful photos! Easy to use and well made. Very compact and excellent battery life. Highly recommended.","This is a very nice camera that is slightly larger than the S230, but includes a higher zoom(3X compared to 2X in the S230) capability and higher still photo resolution(4MP compared to 3 MP in the S230).  I was surprised to find that Canon eliminated the hi resolution(640 X 480) video capability in the S400 though.  I found the hi-res video mode in the S230 to be very useful.  But, the highest resolution(320 X 200) offered by the S400 is too grainy to be very useful.","I bought the S-400 to upgrade from the S-200 that I have been using since it was made available. I love the S-200, as it is both durable and handy. It has also become a great value with recent price reductions. On the other hand, I wanted to get the most recent tech advances in the smallest package, so the S-400 was the clear choice.<br />Here are my initial impressions, and some of the improvements / differences between the 200 and the 400. First of all, Canon has paid close attention to the nits and picks of users of the earlier cameras in the ELPH line. Aside from the addition of cutting edge developments, there have been subtle changes that greatly increase it's ease of use. This is an incredible camera built into a compressed case. Except for being ever so slightly thicker than the S-200, it is the same  cigarette pack size.<br />It has a 4 mega pixel sensor, and it is quick and accurate. Color saturation and contrast are outstanding. The lens is very sharp from edge to edge (I tested at various light levels from macro mode (1.5\") to infinity focus, and it consistantly produced remarkably fine images). 8x10 prints are outstanding. Period. At long shutter speeds (up to 15 sec), the sensor is remarkably free from \"noise\". In fact, it does better than many SLR style digicams in all areas of picture quality.<br />The 3x optical zoom is a welcome addition. Now you can take a proper head an shoulders portrait without invoking the relatively lossy digital zoom, or suffering from the effects of distorted facial features caused by getting too close with a too short lens. When you need it though, the digital zoom offers up to 11x total zoom power, and returns pretty good results as digital zooms go. The 400 retains the special effects lineup of the 200, and they work very well. The tonal range of the black & white option is a real treat. The final result isn't exactly Panatomic X quality, but it is really good, and your darkroom for artistic dodging and burning is contained entirely on your hard drive.<br />The case is still steel, but has a ceramic coating that is supposed to be even more scratch resistant. It is also much \"whiter\", and offers MUCH better contrast when you read the various control labels. While the contols are similar, they are also marked with larger and bolder lettering. All in all, a big improvrment. The michrophone was moved from the front to the top of the case. I think the front makes more sense, but it works very well on top. Canon also included a tiny (but effective) speaker in the 400. You can now select or create sounds for all camera functions (even a \"real\" shutter sound), as well as make voice notes for each photo taken if desired. Most sound functions are individualy adjustable for volume, and several sound \"themes\" are included. Techno-tinkerers might enjoy customizing the photo displayed upon startup. Movie preview also has sound now.<br />On the subject of movies, the 400 makes a little tradeoff. The max resolution is no longer 640x480, it is 320x240 (which is fast becoming standard for movies from still cameras). On the other hand, it is not limited to 10 seconds anymore. You can now make clips up to 3 minutes each. Computer playback looks very good. TV playback isn't bad at all. As a pocket sized way to film Junior taking his first bike ride without training wheels, it can't be beat.<br />The shutter button and zoom ring are a little larger, and now feel just right. The 400 has also incorporated the mode selector wheel used on other high end Canon cameras. This is long overdue, as it makes using all of the many features and modes a real joy.<br />Red eye appears to be better than before, but I don't expect much from such a close coupled flash / lens combo, and who really cares, as it is corrected with a click of the mouse before you print a photo. A few MAJOR improvements are the 9 zone Ai AF, and new (yellow) focus assist. If you were not careful, the 200 could return slightly out of focus shots, and in low light, the focus assist sometimes didn't. That has been fixed. The 9 zone intelligent AF really does an amazing job, and the new focus assist achieves lock under a much wider range of difficulty than the old system.<br />The built in flash has a generous range for a tiny camera, and the coverage is very even. Shooting a blank wall within the range of the flash shows no \"hot spots\". The metering options are still program, center weighted, or spot, but the program mode seems to have been given a big boost. The 200 does very well, but the 400 is on par with the SLR class for getting it right the first time.<br />Exposure bracketing is +/- 2 EV, slow synchro flash is still there to boost background brightness when needed, the panoramic stitch mode is still a treat, and, in general, this is nothing less than a James Bond version of a full featured, top quality 4+ megapixel digital camera. The only tradeoff is that a full sized camera with similar features might offer a larger lens aperture. That can extend your non flash low light level by an F stop or so, but it does no good if the camera is sitting at home, rather than in your pocket. If it is in your budget, get this camera. Not only will you take more quality pictures over time, but you won't be burdened by feeling like a conspicuous tourist while doing it.<br />One last note. Buy a high speed (24x) 256 meg memory card. The speed alows for quicker second shots (the 400 can do 2.5 FPS in continuous mode), and the 256 meg size gives you a full 128 shots at the highest resolution, many hundreds of pics at the low res setting.","I have waited a while for a digital camera with the right set of features and size - this is it.  It is so compact you can put it in a trouser pocket, takes great photos and is very easy to use.<br />I added the Canon PSC-50 leather case and 512MB SimpleTech CF card (as sold by Canon)."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot S50","amazon_reviews":["Great little camera.","I loved this camera, until I forgot it in the back seat of a Chicago cab.

Image quality was stunning !!! and I have several 16x20 wall pictures to prove it.  It has everything that a professional photographer could ask for in a \"Point and Shoot\" camera. Manual operation allows the operator to dial in the exact exposure that the light meter may miss ( by the way, the light meter is more accurate than on my Pro-Canon 5D, 20D and 10D !!!!). It also shoots in RAW giving me a two f/stop exposure advantage over JPEG. Although the Exposure Compensation option is somewhat pointless, you can use it. I don't see the need for exposure compensation since an under/over metered shot may be different every time you shoot. Shooting in manual makes exposure compensation unnecessary. More important is the flash compensation, I can dial in flash power from full to 2/3 to 1/3. nice for correct fill flash. Most important to me, in this camera, is Manual, RAW and image quality.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this camera is that stupid door that you have to slide over to extend the lens.

When you slide it one way, it turns the camera on and then you slide it back to turn it off. I bought this camera about 3 years ago and several months ago, when I closed the lens cover after snapping some pictures, I felt it go past the stop point it usually did. Then I noticed the lens cover had become loose. It is even looser now and the camera is still working but I have to be very careful with it. I am afraid it is only a matter of time before it stops working thanks to the loose lens cover. Local camera shops send out digital cameras to be repaired and Canon will not even look at it for less than $150 since it is out of warranty. I will eventually buy a new digital camera and then maybe I will take the chance of looking at this thing myself by taking it apart. It could be just some little thing that could be tightened up, but taking it apart could also ruin the camera for all I know.","The S50 was my first foray into digital photography, and after reading reviews online, I bought one 2.5 years ago.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />1.) Nonproprietary memory (uses CF cards).  Newer Canons use SD cards mostly (I believe).<br />2.) Flexibility: sized slightly larger than a compact (and quite a bit heaver), but full functioned.  I was coming from a 35mm SLR and wanted to have some control over my shots without shelling out a few thousand for a digital SLR (at that time).<br />3.) Good optics.  Don't remember which review I read that tested the optical characteristics of the camera[...] but it was among the best of the time.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />1.) Bulk: It's a bit heavy and too bulky for a pocket.<br />2.) Proprietary battery.  Life is decent, however.  I can usually get a full day's shooting on one battery.  I have a backup \"just in case\" that I have only had to use on really heavy shooting days (over 150 shots or so).<br /><br />It's survived a number of trips with me around the world and I love the thing.  It got me into digital photography and I'm back in the market for another (probably) Canon compact for my wife.  Eventually, I'll dive into a digital SLR....<br /><br />5/5 to Canon!","i have taken this camera to czech republic, china, costa rica (humidity!) and many other places. i have screwed up and dropped it twice on concrete surfaces. it still works!! the picture quality is great for what i use it for and can make high resolution photos to be blown up to 8 by 11 prints (depending on where you get it done will determine final quality). the camera is a bit on the heavy side but it has so many options that you can control, it feels like its as close as you can get to a dslr without spending a ridiculous amount of money. i transition between this and my canon eos rebel slr when traveling and have no complaints with either one.","I use a Canon film SLR but bought this digital camera for everyday use. The camera in itself is great, in both quality and flexibility. However, the battery never lasts for more than about 30 shots, it does not matter whether the display is on or off. True, it recharges relatively fast but my regular camara has batteries that last forever. I am thinking seriously of selling this one just because I am tired of seeing the dreadful red symbol.","I have not one complaint about this camera.  This was my first digital camera.  I have had it for 3 years now.  It still works like brand new.  I can take excellent quality pictures, quick download and even take great video that I have made all sorts of home videos using.  I have never once had a problem with it and I use it almost 3-4 times a week taking several pictures or video at a time.","Canon PowerShot S50 is a nice little digital camera with 5 megapixel and 3X optical zoom. It has a load of exposure features from fully automatic to fully manual. It takes high quality pictures in JPG or RAW format with normal, fine or superfine resolutions. The only drawback is the focusing being a little slow. It is also sluggish under low light conditions. The rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery doesn't last long (never got it to go longer than 100 shots under normal shooting conditions with the LCD screen on) but can be recharged within an hour. Overall, a nice little camera to have around.","I've been using this camera for about a year and half and it works great.  Picture quality is excellent.  My only complaint is the size and weight.  The screen could also be a little larger.","I've been using this camera for the past 2 years..no compliants at all..glad that I  bought this.<br /><br />clarity is good and print are good. I recommend this to all.","I adore this camera for the following reasons:<br /><br />1. It has a DURABLE metal casing.  I have dropped this camera numerous times on the concrete (including the first time I took it out of the package) and usually carry it jammed in my purse with my keys, mechanical pencils, you name it.  I've also taken pictures in the rain, which I don't recommend, but it's held up so far!  Mine is horribly scratched and dinged but absolutely no problems yet.  I do recommend an LCD protector.<br /><br />2. Sharp, clear pictures.  I've submitted pictures to galleries and miscellaneous publications; they've never had problems with resolution as long as it hasn't been much over 8x10 (but it's advertised to be ok up to 10x11).<br /><br />3. Intuitive controls. Lots of buttons & dials, but you'll pick it up quick or you can just ignore them all, and point & shoot on \"auto\".  You'll still get great pictures.<br /><br />3. Value.  At this point in time, this almost-professional quality MSRP $500 camera can be found online (NEW) at around $220. If you're looking for a Point & shoot that has some extended capabilities and isn't a clunky EOS SLR, this is pretty portable.<br /><br />A few cons:<br /><br />1.  Weight.  It is relatively heavy compared to other point-and-shoots.  I always use the strap to keep from dropping it, which I've done more than a few times.  It's not as small as the S500s which is a bummer.<br /><br />2. Manual capabilities occasionally tough to find.  As an amateur photographer, I like to use \"auto\" a lot but when I do use the manual focus/etc. it's not always easy to figure out where the appropriate menus are.<br /><br />3. Tiny viewscreen.  Nothing like getting home and realizing that the pictures that initially seemed so sharp and clear on the screen are blurred and out of focus in real size.  But this happens with most (if not all) little digital cameras.<br /><br />4. Night resolution.  Blah.  Has a \"night\" mode which is servicable but not that great.<br /><br />I love this camera and will definitely buy another Canon after all is said and done. In 1 1/2 years, my camera has been around the US/international scene and has taken 5400+ pictures.  It has held up like a champ!  I totally recommend the S50, even for photography amateurs. My s50 pictures are all posted on the web.","This is the best camera I have ever seen.  It takes amazing photos and you can also take video clips. I highly recommend this camera.  I love it!","I have now had my Canon S50 for over a year, and taken hundreds of photos. I am a serious amateur photographer, and I got it because it was the _only_ all-manual (somewhat) pocketable digital camera when I got it. The flexibility of this camera is crucial! And I love the 'intervalometer' which allows me to make time-lapse movies of things such as beautiful sunsets.<br /><br />The bads:<br /><br />The markings on the selector wheel have completely rubbed off. I have to look on-screen to guess what mode I am in.<br /><br />To push the selector SET button in without pushing left or right requires just the right touch. I much prefer separate select button as on some other models.<br /><br />The lens cover also requires a certain touch to close it properly, since it doesn't stay in its track perfectly. This is easily learned, unlike the selector button.<br /><br />Special-purpose battery is expensive! Why not use AAs?<br /><br />Only focuses up to 10cm.  Macros are not that macro.<br /><br />Focusing close in low light is virtually impossible, even with manual focus.<br /><br />To have a shutter sound a second after releasing the shutter button is worthless. It makes taking pictures from a moving vehicle very hard to time.<br /><br />Some more GOODS:  It is surprisingly sensitive, and takes excellent night shots of things like christmas lights, or shots from indoor lighting even without a tripod.<br /><br />Sound annotation and movies are very handy!<br /><br />The flash is very flexible, with 1st or 2nd curtain, variable brightness.<br /><br />The digital zoom (from 3x to 12x) is quite good.<br /><br />It is pretty solid.  Dropped it onto bricks from 4 feet and just a dent.<br /><br />Not much distortion or chromatic aberation in the lens. Photos look great at poster size.","I have been carrying around dearest Canon Powershot S50 since September of 2003, after tearing myself from an elderly Minolta camera my Father owned about thirty years ago. Prior to purchasing the digital camera, I did a hefty amount of research to ensure myself that I was indeed purchasing a product that would last. After comparing countless cameras to one another through the Internet and shopping centers, I settled on the Powershot S50.<br /><br />The camera (overall) is incredibly easy to operate, and provides the user with an immense amount of features to explore and expand upon. I quickly learned how to decide on a specific shooting mode for each shot, without much fuss. I also found it very simple to become comfortable and confident while shooting manually with the S50.<br /><br />This digital camera produces vibrant colors and crisp images with almost every photograph or snapshot taken. The automatic white balance (with or without setting it yourself) compliments each shot, and allows for flexibility. There is rarely a need to adjust anything more than the brightness and contrast of a photograph in Photoshop, which is not the case for many other digital cameras. S50 is also capable of functioning well without a flash in a low-lit environment!<br /><br />The body of the S50 is a perfect size, sturdy, and survived (with only one small scratch) a dreadful fall on the kitchen ceramic tile. Also, the LED screen placed on the backside of the camera allows the user to see what exactly they are photographing.<br /><br />There is no need to worry in regards to loading S50s software on a Mac, or PC. Both are \"user-friendly\" and will not be found troublesome!<br /><br />Aside from all of the upsides to purchasing the camera, there are, of course, minor (but worth mentioning) issues I was and am not satisfied with. I have not experienced anything negative with the sliding lens cover as other reviewers have, but can agree with its (occasionally) slow reaction time. I have missed a shot I desired to capture on more than one occasion because S50 did not react quickly enough.<br /><br />Along with this, I have and continue to struggle with the usage of the flash. Photographs either appear too bright or not bright enough. I have yet to settle upon middle ground with S50. However, Photoshop and other photography programs can easily adjust this issue if needed (along with the commonly complained about red eye). The battery life is also an issue to struggle with. It is best to carry another with you, as the camera will not specifically indicate when it will be out of battery power.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera to anyone in need of a reliable buy, as well as a larger memory card (mine being 256MB). You will have a point-and-shoot camera as well as a semi-pro manual camera combined into one, with a terribly affordable price for all of its functions.","I've used my friend's and mine now for 2 years.  They are great.  We took one backpacking in South America for 2 months and it survived and never gave us any problems.  It's great for landscape and taking pictures of friends, etc.  But with the limited zoom (applies to all compact cameras) you won't be taking any super wildlife shots from a distance.  If you want something more powerful, you're going to have to get something more bulky/heavy/fragile.<br /><br />This is the best thing on the market (as of 6 months ago or so when I looked at everything) for power/sturdiness in a compact camera.  I love mine.","This is a go anywhere, take nearly anything kind of camera. I have had the S50 for a year now and continue to be amazed at what great quality snaps it takes; and an added bonus with 3-minute movies with great sound too! It does have a superpower flash, but you can turn it down and you can turn it off. Outdoor, daylight shots are unbelievable with this camera!<br /><br />I did have to get used to its macro handling, as I like getting in there close and shooting the wordage off a dime if I need to. Macro shooting did takes some practice and extra finessing to get down, but overall this camera is a true winner.<br /><br />I am a Canon die hard and have used many cameras in the Canon family, from the AE1 and the Rebel, and A1s to SureShots and now this little PowerShot. This little one is by far my favorite ... the best little camera ever!","I purchased this camera when it first came out.  I have enjoyed every single aspect of it.  Matter of fact, even after a year or so, I'm still exploring the different features of the camera.  I went to Egypt and used the vidoe mode on the camera.  I was very pleased because I know now that I no longer need to carry the camera and a video recorder.<br /><br />The pictures are beautiful.  The digital zoom images are clear and crisps, and the auto mode makes it possible for even the most untrained eye of beginners to use.  I would highly recommend this product.","I was given this camera as a gift, and the only other Canon product I owned was the horrible Canon EOS IX.  Happily, after playing around with it, I loved this camera.<br /><br />Pluses:<br />1. Optics are crisp and sharp.<br />2. Image quality is great.  5MP is more than any point and shoot casual photographer will ever need.<br />3. Manual mode is a great addition.  You can shoot in aperture priority, shutter priority and full manual exposure modes.  Pretty nice when you want to get a long exposure for a nifty waterfall shot or to add a sense of motion to a sports/action shot.<br />4. Nice finish that doesn't wear away easily like most point and shoot cameras in this class.<br />5. Great auto-focusing and manual-focus controls.<br />6. 3 minute movie mode.  Lots of cameras in this class cap it at 1 minute.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />1. The little sliding door on the front to turn the camera on and off can become flimsy if this camera is used often.  I've had 2 friends that have had to get this part of their camera repaired.<br />2. Great when it came out, but there are many smaller 5MP cameras on the market now.  This camera definitely feels bulky, but you can't hold this against the camera.  When this came out, it was the smallest 5MP out there.<br />3. The flash is WAAAAAY TOO POWERFUL.  I hate using this camera at night because the pictures always tend to be washed out.  You can use photoshop and apply a adjust exposure filter and the images turn out looking great.  But that's an extra step.  I'm confused as to how Canon overlooked this.  I know 4 people with this camera, and this is everyone's major gripe.<br /><br />Overall, from my experience, my guy friends tend to like this camera.  Most of the women I know don't as it feels a bit too big to them.  If you can get this camera used, I'd definitely recommend it as it'll serve you well for a couple of years.","I received this camera for Christmas and used it very extensively while travelling through Asia, Australia, New Zealand, etc. for over 4 months in all kind of weather conditions. Unfortunately it didn't cope too well with the damp weather in NZ, or maybe I handled it a bit roughly, but it stopped working (and no camera shop would even look at it - sending it to Canon from abroad wasn't an option so I missed out on lots of pictures for about 1 month of travelling). Apparently the problem was with the CF chamber (one pin got bent by just slotting in the card) and Canon UK charged me €200 for the repair after my return to Ireland.<br /><br />Anyway, in summary:<br /><br />Good points:<br /><br />- great quality pictures<br /><br />- easy to use<br /><br />- good movieclips with audio (although limited to 3 mins - why?)<br /><br />- CF cards are easy to find, relatively cheap (especially in Asia) and compact<br /><br />- the battery life, compared to other compact digicamera, is excellent (especially compared to the Canon Elph 400, which my travel companion had), but it'd be wise to get a spare battery and keep it charged when taking a lot of pictures in one session<br /><br />- the sofware supplied is quite good<br /><br />- the lens is bigger than in most compact digicamera, resulting in better focus and details<br /><br />Bad points:<br /><br />- the camera is heavy for its size and a bit bulky<br /><br />- the sliding door on the front is a bit flimsy and sometimes doesn't slot in at the first attempt; also it takes a while to activate the camera<br /><br />- the silver-coloured buttons look very worn out (although my camera was used a lot in its first 4 months), but at least the black body stays black (the Delph silver case doesn't stay silver for long!)<br /><br />- the flash is a bit too strong (hence red eyes and bleached out photos in the dark or semi-darkness), even at the lowest setting<br /><br />- the LCD screen is ok, but it scratches easily (there seems to be a hard plastic cover over it to protect it which can be good)<br /><br />Overall, it's a good camera for its price, but I will probably choose a lighter version with the same size lens when upgrading","I have a lot of experience with a wide range of fully manual SLRs and digital SLRs, and this camera stacks up nicely.  As an architecture student, I bought the S50 to have a quick alternative for shooting models, sites and other miscellaneous scenography to use in large scale presentation format. After 7 months, I have been very pleased.<br />A few things:<br />The good:<br />-RAW format (nice to have that versatility)<br />-color balance is nice<br />-easy acces to menus<br />-loads of manual functions<br />-light adjustments are right on<br />-nice lcd, crisp and bright<br />-overall great consistent pictures, and it's easy to be really creative (making you feel like a better photographer than you actually are)<br />The not so good (but no so bad either):<br />-there is too much discrepancy between the area that is seen in the viewfinder and what the sensors see. (You always get more than what you see)<br />-the 5-way toggle selector button has got to go!<br />-a little bit too brick-like<br />-noisy zoom<br />I would recommend this to semi-serious light-heavy shooters. (but get a spare battery, 2 for a full day of shooting with lcd on)","Sometimes I travel to places where more likely than not, I will not have the opportunity to revisit.  That is why I like this camera.  The quality of the pictures are quite good (often, bracketing and having a big memory card helps this further) and the durable metal body and small size makes it ideal for traveling.<br />My only major gripe is the battery indicator.  The camera doesn't give you a good indication of how much more battery power is left.  A second battery is almost a necessary convenience.<br />Obviously, the pictures taken from this are not as good as the SLR's, but often those cameras do not fit so easily in your pocket.  Having easier access to a camera makes it easier for me to take spur of the moment pictures.  In addition, the s50 does have some remarkable manual features.  Some are a bit gimmicky, but the basic manual features, even a manual focus (kind of a pain to get used to at first) are available.<br />All in all, I do love this camera for what it is.","Before purchasing a digital camera, sit-down and consider your needs.<br />1. Are you just getting started out in digital photography?  This particular camera has a lot of bells and whistles but if you don't take the time to learn the features then it may be a bit of an overkill. The manual has a nice layout, but for the amateur photographer, its not going to be enough explain the functions in detail.<br />2. How portbable do you want the camera to be?<br />This is a medium sized camera. Not quite small and light enough where you feel comfortable slipping it into your pocket and heading on out. But at the same time, not a big contraption that is bulky and difficult to manage.<br />Recommendations:<br />1. Buy a bigger memory Card - With a 5 megapixel camera, I highly recommend getting at least a 256mb memory card.<br />2. Buy a USB 2.0 Memory Card Reader - While the camera comes with a cable that connects to your computer for downloading images, the USB 2.0 Reader is lightning fast. For example, suppose that a download may take 5 minutes with the supplied cable, that same download will only take 45 seconds with USB 2.0. If you plan on taking a lot of digital pictures, then this item is recommended. Just be sure to check if you computer is USB 2.0 compatible.<br />3. Buy an extra battery - More than likely that one supplied with the camera will not be enough if you plan on taking a lot of pictures during a trip. At least with the back-up, you can snap away without having to worry if you have enough battery power.<br />4. Consider buying image editing software- This will give you more control over the finished product. You will be able to crop images, brighten them, sharpen them, take out the red-eye, etc...Again, if you are not familiar with such software, it may take some time to learn.<br />Conclusion: This camera takes awesome pictures for the most part. At 5 megapixels, the images come out clear and detailed. There is a bit of a red-eye problem, and the flash is not very powerful. This camera offers a lot of features, but unless you are willing to sit there and learn what each function does, you may not need it. Portability was an important factor for me while wanting to preserve camera performance, and so I purchased this camera. If I could do it again, I probably would have bought 2 cameras instead. One really small camera like the Canon SD10, so that I can take it anywhere, and then purchase one bigger camera like the Canon G3. I figured that this camera is in between and compromised. Now I kind of regret it. So take your time and think about what kind of settings you will use the camera in and what functions you really need.","Let me begin by saying I own a Digital SLR and Canon Powershot S50. What would I be doing posting a 5 star review on the S50 then you ask? It's very clear! The S50 is an all around great camera for traveling, parties, awards ceremonies & anything where a purse sized powerful beauty is needed. The zoom's not that long and red eye is frequent, but when it comes to color reproduction this product shines! Perfect for outside shots with crystal clarity. I love the scene modes & being able to customize my shots. I recommend this camera for its great price and overall nice n' sharp image captures.","I'm an old SLR user from way back, and always KNEW it took a big lense to get a great image on film.  This little take-along has such a teentsy lense I figured I'd be sacrificing clarity for the convenience of a snapshot camera I could carry in my jeans pocket.  No way - this little package makes 8x10's as crisp and clear as my old 5-pound Pentax K2.  The color is saturated and with the $89 Canon i560s printer I bought at the same time, I get glossy prints with perfect color balance and saturation - and so easy.  You don't even need to turn on the PC to print - the camera menu drives the printer via the included USB cable.  You can even crop and rotate!<br />I especially love being able to show pictures and video clips on the TV.  I carry that adapter cord in my mini zipper case because a large TV screen beats 4x6 glossies any day.<br />Warnings/issues:<br />1) The LCD screen on the back is fragile.  It scratches very easily.  It's also too dim to see in bright sunlight, so changing to the brighter LCD output setting has to be done BEFORE you get in full sun.  Catch-22.<br />3) Buy a LARGE and high-speed compact flash card.  I shoot everything in high resolution so I can blow up whatever shot I like the looks of.  At 2Mb per image, it's very easy to fill a card up.  I usually shoot with a 512Mb Viking which writes each shot to card in about 1.5 seconds, and can store hundreds of shots.  I just cleaned that card off, with 185 shots and assorted movies!  Also, I just ordered a much faster Sandisk Ultra-II with 256Mb of space.  It should be interesting to see how much faster it writes.  Transfer to the PC via USB 1.0 cable won't speed up though - the USB 1.0 limits you on any card regardless of the card's read speed.  Also, a spare card isn't a luxury - if your one and only card dies, you have no camera.  Amazon.com has the best price on the web for that 256 Ultra-II card, by the way.<br />Two complaints:<br />1) They should've put a little timer symbol by the button that opens the menu that includes the self-timer function.  It's so commonly used, it should have its own button.<br />2) Same thing for red-eye.  To turn it on/off I have to go into the menu.  A button next time, OK Canon?<br />Would I buy this S-50 again?  Yes.  In a New York minute!","I bought this camera for my recent trip to China. For the past four months, I've been continuously shooting pictures. I've carried the camera with me literally every moment of every day and I have probably taken about 5000 pictures with it so far. Prior to this, I was not a frequent picture taker. Additionally, this is my first digital camera.<br />Overall, I am extremely satisfied. The camera takes beautifully detailed and rich images. On the superfine, large setting, it is possible to make large prints (12 x 12) with no noticible deterioration in picture quality. I previously shot on Fine, large but noticed some deterioration in quality on a similarly sized print, so I switched to the higher quality setting.<br />The main weaknesses of this camera are the shutter delay, the focusing and the zoom. Between the shutter delay and the time required for auto-focusing, you can end up with a shot that is different from the one you composed.<br />The zoom is a source of frustration for me. It just isn't sufficient to get the pictures you want (composed the way you want) when a subject is further than 10 feet or so away.<br />I think both of these issues are endemic to this class of camera, so this doesn't detract from my appreciation of the camera.<br />This camera has many options and really serves as a learning tool. It's simple enough to be used by a total novice as a pure point and click camera, but also offers enough control to start to learn about more sophisticated ways of taking photos. There's aperture priority, shutter priority and full manual settings.<br />Other pluses to this camera are the fact that it is fairly small and non-descript. Many people are surprised to discover that it is a digital. That's good in my mind, because it makes it less stealable.<br />Before I bought this camera I was a very vapid and infrequent photographer. Now I'm really into taking photos and interested in the process of taking photos. I feel like after using this camera for a few years I will be ready to move up to an SLR.<br />I recommend this camera without reservation, however you should be aware that I am not an experienced photographer, nor do I have experience with any other digital cameras.","this camera is awesome.  some good solid features:<br />1)looks niiiiiiice<br />2)feels like its built solid, and it is<br />3)takes awesome pictures (most of the time...more on this later)<br />4)5 mp!!!!<br />5)uses compact flash memory as opposed to secure digital (sd costs more than cf)<br />6)3 minute video clips!!!<br />it does however have its problems:<br />1)flash is too bright, be very wary when you use it<br />2)settings could be better when the camera is set on auto (sometimes the pictures get overexposed, or the focus isnt perfect)<br />3)short battery life and the included memory card (32 mb) is too small.  invest in a spare battery and a card thats at least 128 mb.  this'll add at least another $50 (depending on whether you get generic or brand name and how much extra memory you get)  :\\<br />4)pretty bulky for a digicam...gets annoying sometimes<br />5)the 5 mp pictures are pretty big and a pain to send online, unless you have software that can resize the photos. (or you can choose to take pictures at a lower resolution, but i don't choose to do so)<br />overall, as my title says, i love my camera.  the pictures it takes are incredible (much more so in manual than in auto mode).  and the details in the pictures is amazing.  however, you won't need such a high resolution unless you plan on makin some huge printouts, so don't waste your money unnecessarily just cuz you can get more detail that you don't need.  i have also found the manual features to be really simple to use, and it's been awesome for me as i have been learning about photography recently.  hmmm...i think thats all the major points for me.  the only other thing is the complaints i've heard about the sliding panel....i personally don't have any problems with it, but lots of people do, so i would beware of that too.","I purchased this camera from Amazon this spring and couldn't be happier with it.  It was my first digital, but the 2nd digital Canon in our household (husb has Canon S110 Elf - another great *LITTLE* camera!).  This 5 mp camera is loaded with features and creates stunningly crisp images.  It will take me a long time to ever use / figure out how to use them all.<br />I have 3 complaints, but they are all minor:<br />First, I don't care for the slide-lens-door-open-to-turn-on-camera feature.  I agree with another reviewer, it seems like it could break eventually.<br />Second, the video only shoots at 15 frames per second.  This information was not easy to find - in fact, it wasn't until we shot the video that we were able to know fps on this one.  It's great that it will shoot for 3 full minutes, compared to our other Canon's 15 seconds, but I'd take less time and more fps.<br />Third, you can't zoom while shooting video.  Again, a very, very minor complaint.<br />All in all, I'd buy another one in a second.  It would be nice eventually to see them put the fold-away lcd panel on this model like the G5 has, but maybe one day.  At Amazon's great price, you just can't beat this camera!  (Also, it's so compact - quite a change from my old clunky slr with 20-105 zoom lens on!)<br />Highly recommended!","I'd been waiting for the five megapixel version of the elph to come out, but after a bit of research I have some advice; buy the four megapixel version instead.  Canon's been having problems putting five megapixels on such a small sensor like the ones used on the S50 and S500 (they use the same sensor).  Check out the online review at dcresource(dotcom).  Why buy a five megapixel when you get better image quality and smaller file sizes with the 4MP version of the same camera?  I ended up buying a brand spankin' new S45 on closeout from Amazon for 2/3 of what these sell for.<br />I decided to get the S45 instead of the S400 so I could have a camera that I would grow into and one that allows shooting in RAW mode.  I haven't been disappointed, I love my camera.<br />Let the members of the upgrade of the month club have their new 5MP toy, and be waiting to take their \"old\" camera off their hands, or buy a new one at a fire sale price.","This product is light, compact and easy to use.  It is great for active people and easily tucks into a pocket, purse or diaper bag.  I prefer the viewfinder over the screen display but love that it has both.  Recommend buying another battery (not much warning) and definately another card because of the file sizes (I got a 512 MB). Don't forget a card reader if you need one.<br />At this point, I have not used the enclosed software.  I bought the camera immediately before an unexpected trip and am using another program just because I already knew it.<br />Two of my friends have already bought the same camera.  My last digital was an early Nikon Coolpix which always seemed to have trouble.  This Canon has run smoothly since Day 1 and has taken about 1400 pictures in the last 6-7 months.  The camera is easy enough for a 4 year old to take a picture and has plenty of options for a non-professional adult photographer.","Overall, I am satisfied with the quality of the pictures taken outdoors.  The landscape shots turned out beautiful.  If you want to shoot quick photos, this camera is great for the price.<br />However, there are a few drawbacks with this camera as stated below.<br />1. Sliding Lens Cover Pops Open.<br />2. Too much red-eye in flash photography.<br />3. Pictures look grainy and blurry in low-lighting and in macro shots.","As an avid amateur photographer, I love my Canon EOS SLR, but wanted to buy a digital camera for traveling and family snapshots.<br />Since a digital SLR body was out of my price range, i researched maybe 15 compact digitals before settling on the S50. I'm thrilled with my purchase and would recommend this camera even to folks who, like me, are used to higher-end SLRs.<br />The S50 offers an incredible array of features and options in an improbably small package. I've had it for about six weeks and have yet to take advantage of all the bells and whistles. Although the camera offers options galore, its controls are pretty intuitive. And despite its myriad features, you can use it right out of the box in its \"Auto\" mode.<br />Its color fidelity is stunning -- even with magentas, which some digital cameras don't capture well. Its automatic white balance is also superb; it produces none of those ugly casts you get with cheaper digital cameras. If you prefer to set the white balance yourself, though, this camera gives you plenty of flexibility.<br />I've had very good results with the focus. The couple of blurry pics I've gotten were probably my fault because I didn't give the camera enough time to focus. The focus lock seems pretty quick - comparable to that on my SLR.<br />There are a couple of areas in which this camera doesn't perform as well as my SLR (an unfair comparison, but worth mentioning). One is the slight, occasional shutter delay. This can be annoying but it's not the end of the world for travel and family shots. If you're big into anything that involves split-second action, though, I'd recommend you stick to an SLR.<br />I must also echo other reviewers' comments on the flimsiness of the lens cover. I contemplated returning the camera because of this but was so impressed with the quality of the pictures that I instead resolved to handle the cover with kid gloves. It's helpful to note that you don't have to use the lens cover at all, if you're worried about it... the camera powers down automatically after a while, and you can wake it up again by depressing the shutter. (Of course, this option leaves the lens exposed to dust and scratches...)<br />That said, the S50 offers a couple of huge advantages over film cameras. One is its performance in low-light settings. I've been amazed at the S50's ability to capture pictures indoors, without a flash.  No funky purple ghosting, either!<br />And I love the LED screen that's built into the back of the camera. It has pretty good resolution so you can tell what's in focus, and you can adjust its brightness depending on whether you're shooting indoors or out. It's great to be able to compose your shot without having to mush your glasses against a tiny viewfinder, and it's even better to be able to review your photos at the end of the day.<br />The software that comes with the camera is easy to install and intuitive to use (on a Mac, anyway - can't vouch for the PC version!). The 32mb memory card that comes with the camera, on the other hand, is inadequate... I'd recommend buying a card with at least 128mb of storage.  An extra battery couldn't hurt, either!<br />On the whole, I think this is one of the best compact digital cameras on the market today, and certainly in its price range. I'd expected to compromise some image quality in moving from film to digital, but am surprised and delighted to find that's not the case. If I had my choice to make over, I'd buy this camera again.","I have been meaning to give this camera a fair review since I bought it last spring, so I spent some time trying all of the features and testing its limitations. While this and most similar digital cameras take some very clear shots, there are too many cases where digital distortion and blurred photos are the result of the current state of digital camera technology. I bought this camera over some less expensive models in hopes to take advantage of the many manual features the camera has to offer. Most highly of these, I looked forward to manual focus. As far as I'm concerned, this feature is just not worth the frustration of using. The same goes for some of the other manual settings available on the camera. It's much easier to get a great picture using the manual controls on the standard 35mm camera. While I'm very happy with this camera for it's quality in construction and ease of general use, I don't reccommend this camera for those who are interested in the manual features. If you find a comparible digital camera without the manual settings, I would choose that one instead. If you want control over your pictures, either buy a digital camera over $1000 or stick to the trusty 35mm for the time being. You could always get a cheaper digital camera on the side for quick picture taking.","I did extensive research before buying my S50.  Canon has wonderful picture quality and the S50 is GREAT.  Other reviewers are correct, the sliding door is a little less than perfect.  Don't let that keep you from purchasing it.<br />Picture quality is superb.  Auto mode works great and the manual settings are numerous.  I have been more than pleased with the quality.<br />You do need to purchase a larger CF card, but that is common with digital cameras.<br />What are you waiting for??  this is a lot of camera for the $400 price range.  BUY IT!!","I was going to buy the Sony 3MP digital camera for my first digital camera purchase. My friends liked theirs. Instead, I let the Wolf (Ritz) camera store salesman talk me into the Canon S50.<br />I'm so glad I bought the Canon! The picture quality is far superior to the Sony and even the 8X10 pictures I have printed are exquisite!<br />I have taken pictures ranging from the deep blue of the Pacific Ocean at Cabo San Lucas to closeups of people indoors and out and the quality is excellent - better than my 35 mm film camera.<br />The camera is light and portable and easy to use. On the Auto setting, it really is point-and-click.<br />I have to confess, I haven't read the two inch thick instruction manual yet though I am looking forward to learning more about its features. In the meantime - I am getting great shots and enjoying the camera!<br />I strongly recommend the 256K memory card and an extra battery.","The picture quality and feature set of this camera is fantastic for the price.  I've used it with its underwater case for taking fantastic scuba diving pictures during a Carribean vacation.  There are lots of great features such as automatic mode for simple point&shoot and for the intermediate photographer using manual settings.  Three additional nice modes include: panorama, short video, and rapid shoot (taking multiple shots in rapid succession).  The included software is great for managing pictures and powerful to help enhance any picture.<br />A couple of drawbacks: (1) the sliding lens cover can pop off and (2) battery does not last very long.<br />A few suggestions: (1) use hi-speed compact flash card (at least 128MB to get about 50 hi-res pictures), (2) definitely invest in an extra battery, (3) when using underwater, make sure to wipe interior lens of underwater case with anti-fog solution before each undertewater outing.","I've been mixed on how to review the Canon S50. I bought it after much thought vs the Canon G5 or the newer Olympus cameras, and overall I'm relatively pleased, but I did have my share of problems with it. First of all, the reviews stating that the mechanical door is somewhat flimsy are absolutely correct. It's nice not to have to worry about accidentally turning on the camera, but my first S50 had a malfunctioning sliding door (it wouldn't open completely), and I had to exchange it for another one, which has worked fine.<br />Second, the exposure settings and picture resolution out of the box are not optimal considering the 5 megapixel CCD sensor, which is one of the major selling points of the camera. My shots were consistently underexposed, and the low resolution settings seemed more designed to fit on the woefully small included compactflash card than to provide good shots. It was easy to change the settings through the extensive menu, but with a point and shoot one expects good pictures without having to tinker with the settings.<br />On the plus side, the camera is very feature-rich, and the image quality is good once the settings are tweaked. Also, the small size makes it easy to carry around, which is the main reason I chose it over the larger G5.<br />A major draw is the ability to save images in the RAW format, which many other manufacturers lack. The RAW format can be thought of as the name suggests - a \"raw\" image without any noticeable compression that might degrade quality. In comparison, a JPEG is considered a \"lossy\" format, in which one sacrifices some detail in order to have a smaller file size. Once I bought a 512MB compactflash, I saved all my images as RAW files and adjusted them on the computer.<br />The included Arcsoft and Canon software are not really very good, and you'll get much better mileage from Adobe Photoshop/ Photoshop Elements or Paint Shop Pro.<br />To summarize,<br />Pros:<br />Small size<br />Good picture quality once default settings are changed<br />RAW image format capability<br />Feature-rich<br />Cons:<br />Mechanical sliding door can give problems<br />Out-of-the-box image settings less than optimal<br />Slow shutter speed<br />Inadequate Compactflash card included<br />Need to open battery door to get at Compactflash card<br />So-so included software","I love my Canon Rebel Digital but sometimes it's just to large to carry so I purchased the Canon S50 as my \"fun\" camera.  I wanted another camera that used the Compact Flash media and after a lot of research, I decided upon the S50.  It's a lot of value in a small package.  You cannot go wrong with this camera especially at the Amazon price.  What made the deal even better was Amazon's service.  I placed my order on Sunday using the free shipping expecting to wait a week or more to receive the camera.  Imagine my surprise when it was deliverd on Thursday...just 4 days wait.  Great job Amazon!","I own a 10D which I absolutely love  and was getting tired of using my old Olympus Epic (a GREAT film camera) and was looking for a good digital point and shoot.  My two major candidates were the S400 and the S50.  I was unfortunately disappointed in the S400's ability to focus reliably and produce good sharp well saturated pictures while the S50 performed like a champ.<br />If you follow the photography boards at all you realize that this is a fairly common dilemma - the S400 vs the S50.  The S50 offers excellent manual controls while the S400 is significantly smaller without any manual control whatsoever other than exposure compensation.  I LOVED the look of the S400, but unfortunately it was too small for my large hands and I either couldn't hold it steady or the darn thing wouldn't focus properly even though I set the focus mode on just the center focus square would should have given me substantially more focus control.<br />This camera is simply beautiful, but for me it just wasn't producing the excellent results I've gotten with the S50.  The S50 offers considerably more user controls than does the S400.  I could have lived without all the manual controls since I own the 10D and since this camera was primarily for my wife.  But I couldn't live without reliable focusing.<br />Several have pointed out that since the S400 is so small it will always be with you whereas the S50 would be less likely to be carried along because of its increased size.  I'm not sure that I buy this argument since I wouldn't carry either camera in my pocket.  I'm well aware of the glowing reports re the S400 and I sincerely wish it had worked out for me since I love the form and size factor, but at the end of the day picture quality was WAY more important to me than absolute smallness and the S50 just performed better for me.  ON the form and size factor alone the S400 gets the nod, but on the more important function front the S50 just worked better for me.<br />I am a huge fan of the Canon cameras and I would advise anyone looking for a camera, whether a point and shoot or a DSLR to carefully consider the Canon line since, in my opinion, it is currently the state of the art.","I'm new to digital photography. This camera was fairly intuitive to master. The accompanying software is excellent and makes downloads to the computer painless.<br />It takes stunningly good photos, and that's the important thing. The video quality, however, is yucko. Don't buy the camera thinking that you'll take great short clips as part of the package. You won't.<br />Why didn't I give it 5 stars?<br />1)  It is slow on the draw when you snap a pic. Just a little too long for it to capture the scene so that you can move on to another pic.<br />2)  The sliding door on the front is, so far, sturdy but it sure feels wobbly and breakable. I don't care for it.<br />3)  The all-in-one function button in the back is sensitive to the slightest pressure in the wrong direction, especially if you make a selection and then press straight down (the dreaded middle position). Ugh, what an awful idea.<br />4)  Forget the memory card that comes with the camera. Canon, just put the higher-capacity card in the camera. We all know that disk space costs practically nothing, and the card you give us is pathetic (it seems all camera manufacturers do this, and I wish they would just stop the cutesy games on this matter).<br />Bottom line to potential buyers: If I had to do it over again, I'd get the same camera. Others here have mentioned all the good points, and I agree with them.","Excellent camera. Have used it for about three months now. Bunch of cool features. I prefer this to the G5 and G3 because of buttons at wrong places in those. I am sure quality G5 pictures are much better. This camera suits use by all members of the family better.","I was scouting for a dicital camera for a few weeks, did some research and asked some friends.  After thorough thinking, I decided to get the S50 or the IXUS 400.. both are good and came highly recommended.  I went for the S50 because of the 5 Mega Pixel plus its just the right size (not too small like the s400).  Resolution is good and it is easy to use.  Quality of the pictures are superb and the price is perfect.  Canon is known for quality so I went for it.  Thought of Sony but when I tried it, it was not really good.<br />If you want to spend just $400 for a good camera, go for the S50.","I've had my Canon S50 for about three months now, and I am still discovering new features that make it even more endearing.","Bought in late november 2003 for a trip to las vegas as my nikon coolpix 775 was getting slow and at 2 MP, a great camer for my wife to use.  Dell had a good deal at the time, $500 with $100 in discounts and free shipping, no tax.  then around mid-january i checked and the price was $400 with almost $75 in coupons, netting around $325. i was pretty pissed so i called dell and complained, and they issued a reference number.  i couldnt believe it - around 3 weeks later i was closing my dell premium account and it had a $100 credit on it.  impressed.  camera continues to give great battery life.","I think I've found the perfect digital camera. Check out the positives and negatives with the PowerShot S50.<br />Positives: (where do I begin?)<br />* Made of solid, sturdy metal. Feels like a real camera not a cheap plastic toy like other digital cameras.<br />* Has features galore!!! Has standard features plus some pretty nice extras such as:<br />-customizable flash-can change the strength of the flash, helping to prevent washed out pictures which is common with most digital cameras when you use the flash.<br />-flips landscapes pictures that would normally appear sideways. the camera lets you flip these pictures rightside up so you won't have to do it on your computer.<br />-can take panoramic pictures.<br />-the camera is customizable! What does this mean? This camera lets you customize the startup screen. You have an option between clear blue water, evening skyline or a sitting bird. You can change the startup sound, your options include a default theme, science fiction and animal sounds(dog barking or bird chirping). These sounds are designed to presumably match the startup screens but they can be mix and matched. The shutter also has various sounds you can choose from. All these sounds can, of course, be turned off.<br />-this list goes on and on. Check this camera out to see everything.<br />* Superb true true-to-life daytime and night pictures.<br />* Pictures come out crisp and sharp with or without the flash, in brightly lit or darky lit areas.<br />* What you see is what you get. What you see on the LCD screen is usually how the pictures will appear on your computer monitor or when you print them out. The LCD, when you press lightly on the shutter button, will show you actually how the picture will appear once viewed on screen or on paper. So if your LCD has a bright contrast and you are in a dark room, when you press the shutter button lightly, the LCD will adjust itself to the actual lighting of the room. There will be no deception and you won't have to wonder why the pictures look lighter on the LCD than on the computer screen or in print.<br />* Can record mini movies with sound.<br />* Uses compact flash card.<br />* Unbeatable price.<br />There is much, much more that I can add on to this list but you will have get this camera and see for yourself.<br />Negatives:<br />* Joystick navigator takes some getting used to. Very hard to maneuver through the menus resulting in accidently going to the wrong options.<br />* There is no power button. You have to shut the lens' lid to turn off the camera. This makes me nervous. I'm always scared that this will somehow damage the lens.<br />* The macro setting isn't the best. Sometimes the macro pictures can appear blurry.<br />* Uses the very expensive NB-2L rechargable battery as opposed to inexpensive, more common rechargables such as NiMHs or other types. Plus NB-2Ls can only be used with PowerShot S30, S40, S50 cameras and Elura 40mc camcorders.<br />Get the Canon PowerShot S50 if you want superior quality in a small package.","I spent quite a bit of time searching the internet for the perfect digitial camera.  I was unsure about making the switch to digital and was also skeptical about spending that much money on something I may or may not use.  I got the camera so that it could go with my fiance and I to New Orleans, as well as be used in our private life.  So, being a novice I needed something simple to use, with a long battery life and that came with many features.  Also, I needed something that would take crystal clear images.  This camera has truly done all of that and more.  During one week of constant photo taking (over 250 photos), I only changed the battery twice.  I was even able to shoot a short video!  The camera is versatile in that it's a sophisticated as you need it be.  If you don't know a thing about foacl length and proper light, it's a perfect point-and-shoot.  If you're a camera wiz, there are plenty of features to let you get just the right shot.  I've had the camera now for six months and I'm still discovering new features.  It's nearly impossible to take a bad shot with this camera.  I will say, however, that some of the camera's modes take a very steady hand to take, so you might need a tripod.  Considering how many features are on this camera, the price is wonderful.  Especially when compared to similar cameras on the market.  So, whether you're a novice or a camera pro looking to switch to digital, the Canon should be your first choice.  One thing, the memory that comes with the camera is no where near enough.  I bought a 256MB card that I have yet to fill.  Other than that, it's the perfect camera.","The S50 is for any type of photographer, whether amateur or professional. You have to read the user's guide carefully, it will answer all your questions. You can change settings or modes with the touch of a button. You have complete control of what you need, to get that perfect shot. Just read that user's guide. Do get a larger CF card and extra battery. Once you get to know the camera you will never go back to film (or any other digital camera).","It's simple. This is the best digital camera I've ever owned, with the best image quality that I have seen. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants 5MPs and the manual controls. As always, Canon has made another top-performing model. It was highly recommended at CNET, and has been a top product of 2003 in many magazines and camera-related websites. You can't go wrong with this camera. With the price just under 400 dollars, it's the best deal around! Make no mistake, Canon is the best at digital cameras! 10 stars if amazon had that!!","This Camera is a top premium buy! I am 100% satisfied after having used the camera for six months!<br />The images are of the greatest quality allowing for wonderful printouts.<br />You will need a larger memory card - I recommend 256mb and a spare battery might be good even though I have managed fairly well with only one! But This is not something negative cause the supreme quality of the camera compensates for all of this!<br />Buy it!!!<br />And, of course Amazon.com never lets you down! Count on amazon for good priceing, fast shipment and reliability!","A friend of mine recently bought an S50 and brought it over to our home when he visited.  We played around with them and our own cameras and made some comparisons.  First a few comments about F&F (features and feel).  The S50 has a very solid, well made feel to it, especially considering the very reasonable price - you can get it for well under the $600 retail pricetag.  Second, this guy has many features you won't get without spending quite a bit more money.  For example, the integration of the exposure mode controls are very logical and functional, with a very usable manual exposure mode and wide exposure compensation.  The included software has an image stitching capability for assembling panoramas and it works fine.  The autofocus system works well and has some interesting options for shooting difficult subjects, such as when the object of interest is off-center.<br />The image processor is called DiG!C and supposedly enhances the image quality beyond what you'd expect from a 5 MB CCD.  We compared images from the S50 to our Olympus C-50 and our Sony F707.  The S50 did quite well, in some cases looking slightly sharper than the C-50, but in general falling short of the F707.  Note that the F707 retailed for over $1000 and has a large Zeiss lens which I expect is a significant contributing factor.  One more thing - the C50 is easy to use - I picked up on most of the controls intuitively.","This camera is very easy to use, and has many great features. I love it and I will never go back to film.","I never took the idea of digital photography seriously until I visited with a friend and saw some of his amazing photographs. Since then, I felt the need to try my hand at it. The old saying goes that it's not the camera, but the photographer that makes the pictures - but when you're starting from scratch, and especially in digital, you'll want something you can grow into.<br />After doing a lot of homework I decided that the S50 was the camera for me. My biggest concerns when deciding on a camera were it's megapixels, features, and portability. 5MP is enough to do enlargements up to a reasonable size with cropping, and even though I haven't made prints as large as I possibly could, I like having the option for when I will eventually need it. The detail in the pictures really stands out when you have them displayed at full size on your computer. All the camera's settings and modes are top notch and as a photographic novice I found it very easy to use all the advanced features without having read the manual. And as far as portability goes, handling it at the store made me appreciate the solid construction that went into it. It fits well in pockets too, though not as well as other cameras.<br />So, why not the flip screen on the A80? The S50 felt much more well built to me. Why not the full fledged features on the G5? The S50 is small enough that I'm willing to take it with me wherever I go, rather than \"when I'm in the mood.\" Why not a comparable Nikon or such? Again, I felt like I got everything I needed in one package with the S50.<br />Do I have any regrets? Not really, though now that I've \"grown into\" the camera, I wish the aperture range was not so limited on full telephoto, but you won't get much out of any of the prosumer cameras in that respect. On camera flash is bad in every way. And I carry a spare battery with me when I'm out - factor that into the cost of your purchase; the battery life is decent, but not great. On the whole, I'm more than satisfied with the camera, but do your research before you settle down on any camera that you feel is right for you.","Here is the skinny; I would classify myself as an intermediate/pro photographer as an owner of 3 digital cameras and 5 SLRs. I have come to the conclusion after about 9 months with the S50 that it will give you the greatest bang for your buck. Whether you need it for its manual (semi-pro) functions or as just a point and shoot, this is just the camera. It is small and portable, yet very powerful and filled with functions that the average user will never need. It is very durable and has excellent optics, as you will eventually see from your first set of prints. This camera has been out for a while now and you will be able to purchase it at a very reasonable price. You simply cannot buy a comparable camera that even comes close.<br />Read on for more detail.<br />The LCD screen is very bright and easy to see, even in direct sunlight. In my experience with other digital cameras, I would recommend that you apply a screen protector. I have had them replaced on my other cameras due to scratches. They do not make them for cameras, however you can cut one out of any after market PDA screen protector. It does an excellent job protecting your screen from scratches and fingerprints. A must have when you start taking this camera wherever you go; and you will after you fall in love with it as most S50 users have.<br />This camera takes great photo-quality pictures. The reason that I got this camera is because of the 5MP resolution. You will not need that resolution for your average 4x6 or 5x7 print; however it's nice to be able to take a picture at the highest resolution and know that you have flexibility in editing and cropping or even getting a photo-quality 8x10 or 11x14 if you ever need it. Besides, we all have 100+ Gb drives with CD burners, so whenever you want you could burn your photos on a CD/DVD for storage. However, this high resolution comes with a price. It is a necessity that you purchase a high capacity CF card. This all depends on how many photos you take per session. A 512MB card will take a little over 200 photos and ranges from $70-$100.<br />There are those who think that you need a camera with a 4X optical zoom as opposed to the S50s 3X. The 3X vs. 4X zoom is just another selling point. DO NOT PASS THIS CAMERA UP BECAUSE OF THIS! In my professional opinion, that makes little difference to the final product, the print. Keep in mind that the more zoom you use, the more light and stability you need in holding the camera. In other words, you will likely need a tripod to take a decent picture, not to mention better lighting. Bottom line is that the 3X is ample for a camera in this class.<br />My last recommendation is for an after market high-capacity battery. I purchased an 800mAh Lithium-ion for about $35 and it is a vast improvement over the factory supplied one. I used to lug them both with me, but I stopped doing that since I have never had the other one discharge on me before the day is over.<br />One feature that this camera needs is hour/minute indicator of how much battery time is left. The only indicator is a two-minute warning that the battery is almost empty. So if Canon is listening, please put this in the next firmware update. My other gripe with this camera is the lens cover/door. It is flimsy and does not always close as smoothly as it is supposed to.","The Canon S50 has lots of strengths:  crisp, sharp color, excellent automatic focus and exposure settings, sharp optics and snazzy design.  And a few annoying weaknesses; major redeye problems, an optical viewfinder which only shows 82% of the picture, one second shutter delay and a tiny multi-function switch.  It's very durable; I dented mine dropping it from an overhead train compartment in Japan.  The 32 meg compact flash card included only holds ten pictures at the highest setting but you can buy a 128 meg on the internet for $35.  The very compact battery charger charges Canon's proprietary battery in 80 minutes and works on 110/220 volts.  You can buy a clone battery on the net for $5.95.  I recommend substituting a neck strap for the provided wrist strap. Included software is okay but I like ACDSee better.<br />On balance, an excellent value at Amazon's price. Highly recommended.","For those of you wanting to take a (giant) leap over the average point-and-shooter (and even if you do not) this camera is your final destination.  I agonizingly researched numerous digital cameras for months and results always seem to conclude that the Canon S50 is highly rated and was a consistent editor's pick.<br />I am a die-hard Olympus fan with their lens construction, which utilized \"ED\" extra dispersion glass.  My old (now bulky) IS-1 point-and-shooter gave me stunning photos which actually once exceeded a professional wedding photographer's pictures at a cousin-in-law's wedding.  I can safely say that I can easily match those vivid results with the S50.  The features bundled with this camera are immense.  I have yet to get through them all and the journey can only get better.<br />In researching other \"user\" reviews I discovered complaints about the flimsy lens cover/slider door and an LCD screen that scratches easily.  I appreciated that advice and I now exercise caution in the operation of the slider door with no problems so far.  The door seems durable enough to last for the years of use.  As far as the LCD screen damage, as a Pocket PC owner I wisely purchased a package of ten plastic screen protectors to eliminate stylus damage.  I cut one sheet down to size and rubbed it onto the S50's LCD screen.  It works and looks very good and they are easily removable thanks to the use of a light adhesive.  You can purchase them at any local computer products retailer.<br />The battery life is fair and upon the cameras initial use, the built-in memory battery needed to charge off of the removable one, so your first run will drain the battery fast.  After that you should see your performance increase according to your camera's operational settings.  I will however, purchase a spare battery or two as well as the AC and DC adapters.  External card reading and writing devices are a must to conserve power and again, my Pocket PC and laptop are invaluable for this as you can view and edit CompactFlash cards with ease.<br />That said, the world is my oyster and I continue to see the quantum leaping advantages to digital photography.  I'll miss my old IS-1, but not it's bulk and film waste.","The Canon PowerShot S50 is a terrific small digital camera.  It packs in an amazing array of features, starting with the generous maximum 5 megapixel image size (you can make them smaller to conserve space on the CompactFlash card).  Several modes are available to you such as Sports (high shutter-speed and high resolution shots), Portrait, Night, etc.  You can put it in complete Idiot Mode (okay, Automatic mode) and let it select your shutter speed and aperture, or you can pick one or the other and let the camera pick the missing one, or you can go full into Manual mode and pick both.  There's even a Movie mode, complete with sound!<br />This small camera fits in a purse easily (okay, not a small purse), and doesn't get in the way if you're shouldering it in a case (not included).  That means the optical zoom is limited to 3x.  And unfortuately, the S50, like all the PowerShot S family, starts out at 11mm, which is a very wide-angle value.  Even at 3X you will only come in to 55mm, often not as close as you'd expect. There is a digital zoom, but so what?  Crop your picture in software later rather than play with that silly feature.  But getting back to the range, I found it insufficient for shooting<br />across a large (but crowded) room.  If you work closer in this won't be a problem.<br />I agree the sliding door that covers the lens (and turns on the camera) seems flimsy.  That's because it can cause problems.  My 3YO niece got ahold of mine and ripped the door off.  I was able to reattach it but now it's like a loose tooth, just waiting to fall off again.  Even under warranty, my choice was to send it back to Canon for 12 weeks or live with it.  I couldn't live without the camera, so I kept it, loose sliding door and all.  I've just learned not to lend it to people who can't baby it; a good push and that door is off the camera again.<br />Then I bought a Canon Digital Rebel, which is an even better camera, but not the same type as the S50 at all.  The latter can fit into a generous shirt pocket; the Digital Rebel is a big ol' digital SLR (single-lens reflex camera, a through-the-lens viewfinder, typically with interchangeable lenses).<br />One of the S50's limitations is a slow shutter response.  I can't tell you how many shots I've missed using it; I frame it lovingly, I see the perfect moment, I shoot... but no score.  The people have moved on, the sun has set, the universe suffers heat-death, and finally the shutter clicks.  If you want a fast shutter then you must have a digital SLR, as almost all the compact-style digital cameras such as this one have the delayed shutter issue.  Another note of annoyance on the PowerShot S family: they come with a wrist strap but no shoulder strap.  I don't know what use a wrist strip is for a camera; if I'm not using it then I want my hands free.  I bought a generic shoulder strap but it wasn't a great fit.  At least Canon should offer one as an extra-cost accessory.<br />I still give this camera 4 stars for putting so many features in such a small package.  The pictures are reasonably good, and at this size you can crop plenty out and still print good 4x6 inch images.  The PowerShot S50 comes with software, but you'll probably want to buy your own image editing package.  The one provided is fairly limited.  Useful software includes PhotoStitch, which allows you to make your own panaramic style images from a series of linked shots.  The included CompactFlash card is also too small for typical use, so plan on buying a bigger card.","I was concerned with two things regarding digital cameras: print quality and low light shots.  This camera could not have performed any better for either criteria.  I have stared at the shots developed on Shutterfly and I honestly cannot tell they're digital.  I also tested many different dark shots and it passed with flying colors.  The automatic setup picks it up well, but the camera also has a ton of manual overrides in case you want to increase the exposure, etc.<br />Only reason it's not 5 out 5 stars is that I worry that the sliding plastic door will break off before I'm through with the camera, and the software is not as user-friendly as Olympus.<br />Overall, though, I am incredibly pleased with this camera!","I have just bought S50 after contemplating for over 2 years over the benefit of digital photography over film photography. I am extremly happy with the results of the photographs - i got them printed at a local retail photography store. Few drawbacks that I noticed right out of the box -<br />1. Flimsy lens cover -- need to be very careful in closing otherwise one might end up scrathing the body<br />2. 4-way controller difficult to operate for SET (or Enter) operation<br />3. Too much Red-eye during flash photography<br />4. Slower response during Continous drive mode -- (may be better when compared to other digital cameras but I am comparing with my Nikon N70/80/90 film cameras)<br />5. Add another $300 or more to your budget for high speed 512 MB CF card, camera cover, extra battery<br />6. Scratches on Black body are quite noticable<br />7. Tendency to slip - as with all metal body cameras<br />But don't get disapponted by all these negative points - I just want everyone to be aware of these...overall a great camera in it's league ...even my 3 yr old can shoot great pictures!!!","I have used many different film cameras Including a Canon body with EF lenses.  This camera takes excellent pictures and has all of the functions of my $500 Canon body I bought 10 years ago.  After reading some of the poor reviews on this site I was nervous about purchasing the camera, however after receiving it and taking some pictures, it is all Canon promises and more.  I do get some out of focus pictures now and then but that is primarily due the the camera not being able to obtain an autofocus lock.  Nothing inherently wrong with the camera and I always can override the autofocus with the manual and the pictures then come out excellently.<br />I would recommend this camera for anyone who wants to be able to have the flexibility and quality to take very good pictures in a small format camera.  The only downside is the fact I can not put my EF lenses on this fine little camera.","I never thought the day would arrive that I would abandon my Canon Rebel 35mm camera for a \"digital....ugh..camera\" but the Canon S50 has made me a true believer.  I finally got fustrated trying to scan in all my 35 mm prints in order to \"preserve my memories\".  Very time consumming, and I was never quit satisfied with the quality.  So, after a lot of soul searching, and a lot of on-line reseacher reading countless reviews, I finally took a leap of faith and purchased the Canon S50.  I couldn't be happier.  This is an excellent camera for the serious amature, allowing for point and shoot capability or multiple features that allow one to adjust various settings.  I've had the camera for over 5 month now and don't have any regrets.  The quailty of the pics is VERY VERY CLOSE to 35 mm and I've enlarged prints to 20 x 30 with excellet results.  I strongly recommend buying an extra battery and 512 MB Compact Flash Card.  Also, [...] offers a tremendous service which allows one to utilize your new digital camerea to the fullest.  Buy this camera and I highly doubt you'll be disappointed!","I have owned the Powershot S50 since May 2003 and have been absolutely pleased with it.<br />Pros:<br />1)Great Pictures= I always use full quality and when developed they look just like 35mm<br />2)Small form factor<br />3)Looks cheap(thieves arent interested)<br />4)Many features(too many for me an amateur photographer but i'm learning)<br />Cons:<br />1)Had to replace LCD screen after 2 months of use (for some reason it cracked while in case and no history of dropping; Fortunately Canon replaced it free of charge, I just had to pay for shipping to the factory not from)<br />2)The little markers(stickers) on the function wheel seem to be peeling off. (I have no auto sticker and others are fading could be due to  my sweaty palms)<br />In summary I have enjoyed using this camera every minute. I would recommend it to anybody. The LCD screen didnt bother me b/c they fixed it within a week and a half. Enjoy!!","I use a Canon G3 as my creative camera and got this for my carry-everywhere camera.  What I like is that its modes and menus are almost identical to the G3s, and while the lens won't zoom as much as the larger camera's, the extra megapixel makes up for it in cropping.<br />Picture quality is terrific and the ability to choose how much, or how little automation in a camera this size is refreshing.  Highly recommended.","I've had this camera for more than six months, and after taking more 2,500 photos with this little gem, here is my 2 cents worth. It took me about a full month to get used to all its nuances. But if you are interested simply in \"point and click,?a few hours should do the trick. The  \"auto?setting is more than enough for typical use. You won't regret this purchase.<br />NEGATIVES: (mostly minor):<br />1) Battery meter. You only get a 2-minute warning, and then the camera shuts off. The battery life is pretty short if you use the LCD screen. The battery lasts about 2-4 hours depending the degree of use. (It takes about 1-1.5 hours to recharge).<br />2) Lens cover feels a little flimsy. Enough to cast a slight doubt about its durability. Although I have had no problems with this whatsoever so far.<br />3) It is not the smallest size in its class. In fact, it feels somewhat heavy, if you are used to ultra-small products. If you put the camera in your pants pocket, you definitely feel its weight.<br />4) There is no way to attach a camera filter to the lens. I had to improvise by manually holding a filter to the lens while I shoot. And the range of exposure time can be a bit wider.  I occasionally need exposure times of a few minutes or longer, and that is not allowed with the S50.<br />5) The auto focus can get \"fooled?in low light situations. You just have to be patient and work with it a little to get it right. Usually a repeat shot is all that is required. (If the subject is far away, I use~ manual focus and set it at infinite?)<br />POSITIVES:<br />1) Picture quality ?this camera takes amazing, breath-taking pictures. I have never seen a camera like this which produces such professional quality photos so consistently! The color balance is simply spectacular. (For color balance, I use \"vibrant?setting). The \"auto?setting does its job admirably most of the time. I use the Canon printer i860, and the 8 x 10s will knock your socks off. Guaranteed. (With a 256 mb card and at \"superfine? setting, you will get 99 photos).<br />2) Quality of product ?this may sound like a non-PC comment and a gross overgeneralization, but I love the fact that this product is not made in China. Many Chinese products that I have had simply broke down after a little use, and I always felt like I was getting ripped off. The camera is a Japanese product and the battery is a Korean product, so both are A-OK in my book.<br />3) Movie making ability ?Although not the highest resolution (and the limit is 3 min), the ability to make a movie is a nice touch. I have used this occasionally, and it is very useful at times!<br />Good luck and have fun","After MUCH research, I bought this camera.  I was interested in picture quality above all else, and many of the reviews I read use this as a benchmark to which to compare other cameras. Sure enough, the pictures that I've gotten look amazing both on the computer and printed out.  My other concern was size... I never use my very fancy 35mm because it is just too big to carry around.  While this camera is not the smallest in its class, it is the smallest one at that resolution to offer so much manual control. I don't care how small a camera is... if I can't fine tune the settings to get the picture that I want, it's not worth carrying it.  Some of the other cameras in the same class don't even allow you to control the flash, and very few offer full manual control, while this camera offers everything you can think of and more (not to mention a variety of automatic settings for quick snapshots).  So, if you want HIGH quality pictures and know that you can't get this consistently without getting to know your f-stops and shutter speeds, but you also want a camera that fits in your pocket, you can't go wrong with this camera.","This was my first new digital camera in the last three years. In that time, the feature set and usability of a moderately-priced digital camera have improved dramatically.<br />Just take the issue of reviewing your photos. On my old Olympus 3040, you had to switch the camera dial to \"Review Mode\" to look at the pictures you just took. If you wanted to take a picture while reviewing, you had to switch it back quickly, hope you flipped it to the right shooting mode dial setting, and shoot. With the Canon, you enter review mode by flicking a spring-loaded switch. Review mode can always be instantly cancelled by pointing at a subject and pushing the shutter release halfway down. You're instantly back in the right shooting mode. It sounds like such a simple thing, but it makes the camera much easier to use.<br />That's just one of the nice things about the S50. It also has orientation detection (it knows if you held the camera vertically or horizontally when shooting), multiple focus points, and quick startup and shutdown (just open or close the front panel).<br />Since it's in a small body, there are some sacrifices. The lens is not very fast; expect to use the flash or a tripod when there's not a lot of light. The flash is also underpowered, having difficulty lighting a scene after about 12 feet. MacOS X's iPhoto doesn't seem to support the automatic image rotation or RAW files.<br />However, the image quality, convenience, and the many little features done right make this a great camera for casual use in many situations.","The camera takes great pictures. It helped me give up some of my \"issues\" with digital versus film. I have yet to print any photos, but they look GREAT on-screen and on-line (my main reason for using digital). Love the quality, love the compact size and the light weight. Good zoom capabilities. The only thing I don't like about the camera is the lens cover. I feel like it could come off each time I open or close the cover (in fact, the one we looked at in the store had it's cover broken -- almost didn't buy it because of that). I compared several different types of digital cameras before purchasing and this one was the best for the price.","Superior quality, you will not be disappointed. Words cannot describe this camera, its worth the extra money for a great quality camera","I have been a dedicated film camera user for several years and a skeptic of digital photography. Until now.<br /><br />I chose the Canon S50 after about two months of research into contemporary cameras. I relied upon a digital photography portal called \"Digital Photography Review\" to compare different models, and then used Amazon to compare prices. If you are making the move to digital, it is wise to factor in the price of image editing software (I use --and highly recommend--Adobe Photoshop Elements), an upgraded memory card, and an additional battery. The S50 does not come with a case, so add that to the list as well.<br /><br />There has been some fair criticism leveled at digital camera manufacturers for their emphasis on mega pixels. I cannot argue with this; however, having 5-mega pixels over 4 (at a slight price premium) does give you the flexibility to later crop images to your liking, yet, retain good resolution. One of the common complaints against the S50 (over the slightly less expensive 4-mega pixel S45) is the issue of purple fringing at wide angles. My own experience has been that, even at the widest angle, color distortions are virtually non-existent in this camera. The image quality is excellent and skin tones are very good even when using a flash. The flash is a tiny band at the top right (when you face the lens) but, despite its small size, it is very effective for indoor pictures. The camera is quite small for all it can do. The number of manual controls is astounding; I have a feeling this camera offers much more creative freedom than my previous one, a film SLR from the mid-eighties, which came with three detachable lenses, a separate flash unit, and a large carrying case that, when filled with all equipment, weighed about 8 pounds!<br /><br />Digital cameras generally have one drawback--shutter delay, and this is one area that the S50 does not perform well. I have seen shutter delay to vary between almost no delay to little more than a full second. Of course, I have not used other digital cameras, so I cannot tell how this compares. Another weakness is the flimsy lens cover: you have to be careful when closing the cover. I also managed to scratch the LCD screen within a few days of receiving the camera, although this does not affect the images in any way. A protective case would have helped (why doesn't Canon include one!). The included compact flash memory card has a capacity of only 32MB. I would recommend buying a much larger card (such as a 512MB card) that can store a very large number of images (several thousand at lower resolutions). With a large card, the battery inevitably runs out out before the card is full. Buy a spare!<br /><br />Overall, I enthusiastically recommend the S50, especially if you are making the move away from film cameras. The S50 has irreversibly drawn me away from film cameras, even though I did not think that was possible just a year ago. Perhaps it will also transform your perspective.","Pros: 5MP, Autofocus, fast start, compact but many functions.<br />Cons: redeyes, not easy to use for manual control, Lens door design kill this camera, i feel that it can come off at any point. heyyy and this is usb1.0<br />i feel that if you want to just point and shot camera than get the canon s400 or casio z4, and if you want professional camera get the canon 300D or 10D, although i am still happy with it, but i feel like 350.00-450.00 is too much for this camera. it doesn't even come with case and what is 32mb compact flash? this is a 5megapix camera ...<br />the reason i gave it 3 stars because the lens door, all around this camera is solid except the lens door. paying high price for a camera you will want a solid camera that can last for a long period of time. as for this canon s50 i'm afraid the door will come off one day.","After buying an Olympus 4.0 MP camera and using that for 2 days I learned that it was far from the quality I wanted.  Very poor images for a camera that is on the higher end.  Since it was not a researched buy I decided to do my research and found that the Canon S50 had nothing but great reviews.  The reviews were right!  This camera is about as perfect as you can get.  I realized that I wanted a point and shoot camera but also one that would allow good 8x10 pictures, which it does very well.  8x10 prints are flawless.  If you are thinking about spending a few hundred dollars on a digital camera, spend the extra $100 or so and upgrade to the S50 to get 5 MP.  You will be much happier in the long run and will not have to go buy \"another\" camera when one day you are disappointed because you want to blow up a picture and the resolution is too low...<br />Colors are great, very little if any noise, and no bad pictures.  In auto mode I have yet to see a picture come out bad.  The real benefit to this camera is the manual adjustments that can be made.  You will not find that on similar cameras.  This is almost equal to the manual capabilities of a good SLR but you do not have the lense options.  The only down side that I see to this camera is that you will have to read the manual to figure out how to best use all of the preset modes or how to make the manual adjustments.  But, like I said, it auto mode it takes perfect pictures every time.<br />Also, buy at least the 256 MB high speed compact flash cards.  One, they should work a little quicker.  Two, take EVERY picture at the highest resolution and you will have room for just over 100 pictures.  That way you can always reduce resolution later for smaller files.  Also, long day trips with a lot of pic's.... buy another flash card and battery.  The batter actually lasts a long time, especially if you don't use the display constantly, but you can run it down and I am sure you don't want to miss pic's.<br />Happy shopping!","This camera does exactly what it was designed to do, and it does it well--it takes great pictures from a pretty small and rugged camera body.  The camera is built like a tank, and while not as small as the digital Elph, for example, it easily slips into a coat pocket or whatnot.<br />The picture quality is excellent--the 3X zoom lens on the camera is quite capable of taking very good quality pictures.  Colors are well-saturated and focus is crisp.  This is a dandy little performer--great for taking snapshots and action shots in places or situations where a larger camera might simply be too much trouble.  The pictures this camera is capable of taking will not disappoint.<br />The S50 is a bit more complicated to master than the average small point-and-shoot digital simply because it features a lot of options--unlike many small cameras, this one provides a lot of flexibility for settings.  Don't want the flexibility?  No problem--set it on automatic mode for auto-everything, or \"program\" mode for auto-most things.  I find that I do almost all my shooting in program mode.  However, it is occasionally very nice to be able to play with apature or speed settings to achive desired effects.<br />Battery life is good, especially if you go easy on using the rear LCD.  One accessory most users will want is a spare battery--for trips this is necessary since the camera uses only a proprietary battery.  The good news--the supplied charger can fully charge a battery in about an hour.<br />At 5 Megapixels, this camera is capable of producing good-sized blow up pictures, and you can shoot in RAW mode too; not many small cameras offer this feature.  I did a lot of research before selecting the S50 as my \"point and shoot\" pocket camera, and I've been uniformly pleased.","This is a very versatile camera the combines quality with fairly small size.  The auto setting does a good job for those who prefer to leave the work up to the camera.  For those who like more control, there are plenty of features that allow for that.  The quality of the photos made using the highest resolution is excellent.  It is very portable because of the size- it will easily fit in a purse or pocket.  The lens is covered when not in use, thus eliminating the need for a lens cap.  The advanced features do require reading the manual and practice, but are fairly easy to use after that.  Photos are easily transferred to computer by USB interface.","I had been working on my wife to purchase a digital camera for about 2 years.  So, in that amount of time, I had been doing research and digging to find the best camera.  Also in that time, things have changed considerably.<br />When my wife and I finally decided to buy a camera, I asked her what she wanted.  Two things where placed before me to find in a good digital camera.  These things were small size (so when we visit over seas, it is easily concealable) and great point and shoot capabilities.<br />With these things in mind, I also wanted something that is going to provide great photos for at least 3 years to come, the ability to take micro-drives, the ability to use AA batteries and lots of manual control.<br />The PS S50 lived up to 90% of all of these things.  It can be set to fully manual for creative control, it is 5.0 megapixels and at superfine compression, is enough to provide me with 8x11 size photos (which I will never use (like I would never have used 640KB of memory 'hehe')), it is fully compatible with CompactFlash type 2 (i.e. microdrives), it can be used in fully automatic mode with 9 auto-focus and auto-exposure zones and takes great photos plus, it's only 4.5in x 2.25in x 1.75in!<br />The one item it didn't match was that it didn't take AA batteries.  This is a big disappointment to me because I had just purchase a number of very high quality rechargeable NiMH batteries for our wireless keyboards and mice.  This is the sole reason I gave it 4/5 stars.  It's that give of deal to me that I can't go to the store and purchase some emergency batteries if something happens to my set.  However, I couldn't find anything that compared to it in another brand and would take the batteries, so, here I am.<br />But, I was able to find a third party extended life battery and that extends the life about another 1/3 to half.  The proprietary rechargeable batteries are becoming the thing, and there are few digital cameras that still take AA's.<br />The fully automatic photos are amazing in bright light and the newly designed flash fills the room with enough light to make it seem light day-time!  But the camera does have some issues with the focusing in lower light situations.  At these times, a tripod almost becomes a necessity to get crisp clear photos.  Which brings me to the fact, yes, it does have a metal tripod mount on it.  Great for many Christmas photos!  Or pictures of you pets (poor sad pets).<br />So, moral of the story, great camera, stupid battery, fits in your pocket, and if you look in the right place, you can find it for $400 right now, plus a third party extended battery for less money than a Canon normal battery.  Defiantly worth the money, plus, it lets me try my hand at creative photography (it ain't good folks).<br />P.S. It comes with a 32MB Flash card which is a joke if you ask me.  You're going to need to purchase some additional digital film.","The S50 is a very solid camera, and its exterior styling shows.  This is not a camera you see Asian girls in shiny tight mini's and high heel flip flops would carry on their wrists.  It looks almost utilitarian, a no-nonsense type of imaging product.  The best thing about the S50 is its picture quality.  Unfortunately the flash is on the weak side, and the picture color spectrum is \"flat\" as is usual with Canon's cameras.  I think the Minolta Dimage F300, also made in Japan, is a better choice: excellent picture quality (particulary for printouts), cheaper price, 2 AA batteries, stronger flash, and better styling - especially if you are an Asian girl in high heels.","Great camera if your going to get a digital camera, why not pay a little more to get all the features.  Fast shutter speeds,  3min movie maker,  and any other feature you'll find on any other camera.  Start up is fast,  from off to taking a picture about five seconds.  But the main reason you should get this camera, quality of images. Excellent.  Easy to use if you know some about cameras, if your looking for a point amd shoot camera this one maybe too complicated for you.  Not to mention slighty heavier than other compact cameras, but if you want quality over ease of use, then this is a great camera to buy.  No down sides to this camera.","Some things that I really love about this little camera: It's very small and fairly light, but also has a solid feel. The lens is fully protected by the design, which is easy to work with. It uses compact flash cards, which are easily available and will fit in the 10D I plan on getting sometime in the next year. It's got tons of features: it can act as a point and shoot, as well as allowing an impressive amount of manual manipulation.<br />The setting to allow B&W, sepia, vivid, and others is particularly cool, as well as the night-shot setting. The flash has three settings, one of which is off, which is a great thing.<br />Because it's so small and light, I take it nearly everywhere with me. You will obviously want to get a bigger flash card than the camera comes with, but once you have that you can shoot and shoot, and discard the garbage shots, and never have to worry about film again.<br />My only issue with the camera is that I've had a lot of trouble installing the software, and canon's tech support has proven to be absolutely USELESS. Most people will likely have no problems at all. Highly recommended.","This is a very good, almost a great camera. Actually I would give it 41/2 stars. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that, as a compact, it just can't include all of the features a larger camera can give you. (Things like screw on lenses, a diaopter, a flip viewer, a  more powerful flash, remote shutter trip etc.)<br />Picture quality, color, sharpness, etc. is excellent under almost all conditions. Use the i950 Canon printer (so much faster and simpler than the Epson) and their Photo Paper Pro and the printing experience is simple and produces amazing pictures. Not being a pro, I use the Microsoft Digital Image Pro 9 for a photo editor, which is vastly improved over previous versions. The camera feels like a brick,really well put together. It has all the features and options you need in a compact camera. I find that the white engraving on the feature wheel on top of the camera has started to rub out, so I need to look in the viewer to see how to change settings. If you use a tripod you'll have to remove the camera to change the battery or the memory card. Be prepared to spend another $100 for a  compact flash card upgrade. The file sizes on the \"fine\" setting run about 2.5 megs per photo so it's not hard to fill up a 256 meg card. My previous cameras were all in the Nikon Coolpix series up to the 5000 and this little camera beats them hands down. It turns out picture after picture that you can print without a single tweek on the editor. Thats more than I can say for the Nikon.","Very nice camera with a few shortcomings. Very annoying that there is no battery meter, so get a spare battery to keep with you if you plan to be taking lots of photos. The lens cover binds a little and seems flimsy but has held up so far. Be sure to upgrade the capacity with a larger Compact Flash card, the card that comes with the camera has limited space. It takes a while to get used to the shutter action. It can take a full second for shutter to open after the button is pressed, this can play havoc with action shots. In spite of the list above, the quality of images is outstanding. The camera sometimes overexposes images in bright light, but this is easy to compensate for. Overall an excellent camera.","Just a quick review of this camera to hit on one main point.  Yes, as in the other reviews, the picture quality is fantastic! The ease of use, the style, the boot up time ... everything is first rate!  But the thing that impressed me the most, is the little, if any, amount of work that needs to be done to these pic's via Photoshop or any other photo enhancing program.  This being my 5th digital camera, I have to say honestly, the other 4 definitely needed some touch-up in Photoshop to make them look better for printing.  Even my Olympus C-4000 zoom, which takes great pic's also, needed some color adjustments and lightening in most photo's.  As for this Canon S50 camera, I've imported them directly into either Photoshop 7 or the software that came with the camera ... and printed them directly in Exif format with no adjustments at all and they print out fantastic!<br />So if you're looking for a camera that takes great pictures WITHOUT having to touch them up in a photo editing program, you will absolutely LOVE this camera!","In my opinion, the Powershot S50 is nearly perfect in many ways. The picture quality is exceptional, among the best that I have ever seen from any digital camera.<br />The \"Auto,\" \"Program,\" and various scene modes allow the camera to be used as a point and shoot camera, with amazing exposure choices.<br />In addition, there is a full manual mode that can be easily set using convenient menus.<br />The only problem I have had (and I will likely be able to correct this as I learn more about the camera) is that the flash in the \"Auto\" mode tends to wash out some of the contrast in portraits.","this is a full-featured 5MP compact camera that will work for a wide range of users.  i compared this with the sony DSC-P10 and the minolta DiMAGE F100 and concluded that this had the best feature set in its class.<br />the S50 is essentially a 'shrunk' PowerShot G5.  there are some differences: the G5 has a flip-out LCD which is very cool and quite practical, a 4x zoom lens, and a flash attachment.  otherwise, the S50 provides almost the same level of manual control as the G5 in a smaller package.  if you want point and shoot capability but want the flexibility to be more creative when you want, this camera should be on your short list.<br />pros:<br />- excellent resolution from a small lens - 5MP power!<br />- 3x optical zoom, 4x digital<br />- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail<br />- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours<br />- allows control over cameras internal processing algorithms - saturation, tone, sharpness<br />- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)<br />- compact and lightweight, considering this camera's capabilities (4.4 x 2.3 x 1.7 in, 11.1 oz)<br />- excellent build quality - solid 'brick like' feel - no creaks or rattles and a good positive feel to external controls<br />- nice metallic black finish - i definitely prefer this to the silver finish of other compact cameras<br />- the LCD monitor is also big (1.8\") for this class of camera - gives good live preview and review even in well lit situations<br />- shooting priority play mode (a half-press of the shutter release always returns to shooting)<br />- excellent range of manual controls<br />- fast shot-to-shot times<br />- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera<br />- the manual focus has magnified loupe and ruler readout<br />- flexible continuous shooting modes (buffer after processing)<br />- RAW file format maintains 12-bits of data<br />- ability to turn JPEG shot into RAW during record review<br />- Compact Flash Type I/II and official Microdrive support<br />- voice annotation feature<br />- invervalometer (time lapse capability)<br />- AF assist lamp works well<br />- USB connectivity<br />cons:<br />- average macro performance<br />- vignetting at wide angle and maximum aperture<br />- nine-point AiAF not available in P, TV, AV, M or C exposure modes<br />- average flash performance<br />- the four-way jog dial is not easy to use - pressing \"SET\" takes practice<br />- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery/CF compartment<br />- lens slow at telephoto (F4.9)<br />- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom<br />- limited apertures at telephoto<br />- zoom controller does not have enough steps / multiple zoom speed<br />- some barrel distortion at wide angle<br />this is a fantastic camera - highly recommended.  enjoy!","I recently bought a Canon S50 (5.3 Mega Pixel). It is a great camera for outdoor point-and-shoot use. However for close ups, i think a Sony DSC-F717 is much better. The close-up picture clarity with the Sony is amazing.

Plus I have heard lots of Sony customers returning Cameras, due to manufacturig defects.<br />Anyways here are some photografs using Canon S50 [...]<br />They are from Stevens Canyon Hiking Trail in California. I would like to ask the readers to give me some feedback about the clarity/quality of photografs.[]","I love the picture quality + camera features - no concerns there.  I do have an issue with quality of construction - sliding door can come out of alignment if moved in a certain way.  It does not appear to affect operation + it aligns itself back.","This camera has everything an amateur photographer could need. Lots of features that are similar to my Canon rebel G SLR camera, which makes it easy to use right out of the box. The pictures are very clear and stunning, and can be blown up quite large.<br />The only complaint would be night-time shots, but most digital cameras can't handle night time shots very well.","only downside is slightly bigger size. takes GREAT pix. Might be overkill for a newbie to photography, but if you know what an F-stop is or when to use shutter or aperature priority and want great quality this is the compact digital for you.","Finally decided to get S50.  Am I happy with the decision I made!<br />Since, My brother owns S45, I didn't want to get the same one.  Just paid a few more dollars for 1 extra Megapixel.<br />We did comparison tests on my bigscreen Sony Digital TV.  Crispy sharp.  They both perform just about the same except when you zoom the picture to the max, you can tell, then, what an extra megapixel means.  Otherwise, aside from the body color( which I'm trilled with since it's diff from all the other dig. cameras) and more pixels, they are about the same.<br />It took me a good 2 months to do research before I went with this one.  I'm a 100% happy camper.  Still trying to find out all these features that come with the little one.  The best in the market!","Super Camera takes Super Pictures.  Easy to use. Second Digital camera,but it is the best.","I bought this about a month ago as a replacement for an old<br />Kodak DC 215 (1.4MP).  I held off buying a new camera for a long time, waiting till digital camera technology evolved to SLR quality.  I finally thought this was it, and made the plunge,<br />and am not disappointed.<br />The photo-quality is astonishing even in<br />auto mode (I havent experimented much yet with the manual settings), and the camera is exceptionally quick.  I am able to reshoot within a second even at high resolution. The camera excels in outdoor/sunshine where minute details (blades of grass, each strand of hair) can be made out.  Colors are brilliant and true.<br />Battery is OK and lasts enough for 3 to 4 photo rounds (enough to fill up my 256MB card) and Canon did a great job in writing intuitive software.  It is also a great toy given the amount of manual control it gives, at the same time fitting in a pocket easily.<br />TIPS:<br />Initially some shots came fuzzy, but the trick is to let the autofocus do its job fully (half-press the button).  Flash is also a bit weak, but there may be some manual settings that would strengthen this.<br />Buy a huge memory card. You will be using this camera a lot.","Pros: fast; sturdy; intuitive; built-in mic for movie mode; sliding lens cover means no lens cap to lose<br />Cons: very poor macro mode; disappointing auto-focus<br />My first real camera was a Canon EOS Rebel.  It was supposed to be a great camera, but I found that its auto-focus never focused quite right.  Close, but never as good as I could do manually.<br />I recently bought the Canon PowerShot S50 for my 7-year-old son, who has demonstrated a real gift for photography.  It's a great match for him because it's small (so it fits his hands well), it's easy to use, and it's very well constructed.  Unfortunately, like my old EOS Rebel, this Canon's auto-focus system is weak.  When it happens to focus just right, the pictures are great, and you really get 5MP worth of resolution.  But that's all too rare.  My Nikon Coolpix 990 (without question the best camera I've ever owned) is only 3MP, but in real-life shooting situations it gets better resolution than this 5MP Canon does.  Keep this in mind: getting the wrong focus (or shaking the camera) by just 1 pixel in each direction reduces the effective resolution by 4x.  So getting the focus perfect is *critical* for the 5MP to matter.  Even minor errors send you into sub-megapixel territory.<br />Also, if you care about macro mode, look elsewhere.  It's really quite bad compared to other digitals.  It can't get nearly as close as the Coolpix 990, and again, it has trouble fosusing.<br />On the positive side, the exposure is generally good, the color is accurate, and the movie mode is surprisingly good.  There's a bit of \"Max Headroom\" effect because it's only 15 fps, but it's so easy to use that we actually *take* movies now, whereas our old camcorder just gathers dust because it's too bulky to lug around, and dealing with tape is such a hassle.<br />Overall, a nice product with much to recommend it, but check out the focusing issue yourself before you buy.  Maybe it's just me.  But my next camera will be a Nikon.","This little camera is one of the very best out on the market.  Not one feature has disappointed us and even offers more than we thought.

The S50 does this and more!<br />The Good:<br />1. Made in Japan (not China as some other Japanese cameras ie Minolta).<br />2. Metal case, and it feels like it is well made (heavy). Buttons give a solid feel.<br />3. Turns on quick - 4 seconds.<br />4. Small size. This will easily fit into your shirt pocket. The S50 has the features of a G3 and the compactness of the S400. The best of both worlds. No other 5MP camera comes close to this size, with the exception of the Minolta F300.<br />5. Extreme manual control: 10 aperature settings (most digital camaras have 2), 45 shutter settings! You will not find a camera with more control at this price.<br />6. Lens can zoom in macro mode. Others such as Minolta S414 cannot.<br />7. Fast Canon lens - great pictures in low light and little to no blooming (purple fringe). In my opinion, Canon makes the best digital camera lens. The Casio QV3000EX has a Canon lens, and it takes great pictures. The lens makes or breaks a camera, don't compromise here.<br />8. Will NOT turn on when in your pocket. It's just plain annoying that manufacturers continue to make knobs that turn at the slightest touch. The dial on the S50 gives a solid and metal sounding click.<br />9. Battery charger is small an unobtrusive. Fits into the smallest of camera bags.<br />The Bad:<br />1. You pay a price for Canon. But you get what you pay for. You can get a cheaper digital camera, but you will not get one that has perhaps the best lens, great auto focus, and exreme manual control, and - in the end great pictures. Take a look at the sample pictures at Canon's site. Compare them to similar cameras. You will wonder why you thought of buying another brand. Also consider the S400 for a more limited point and shoot, or the G3 for professional/traditional SLR look and feel.<br />2. Uses a proprietary battery. To be honest, I'd rather use AA Ni-MH batteries. But with the Canon system, you probably get bettery power management since they can monitor the battery state better than if it is generic rechargables. In the end it's probably a wash. Buy a second battery.","This is my first digital camera.  I had been shooting with SLRs and rangefinders.  The camera astounded me.  It is small and light yet well built.  It is easy to turn on and off using the front lens cover that is built in.  The images are exceptional.  I made 8x10s on an Epson printer with no manipulation that I think are better than images from film from a lab.  The Auto White Balance is great and the controls are intuitive to me.  The LCD is high resolution.  The wrist strap is a great way to carry the camera safely while keeping it ready to take pictures quickly.  The \"Set\" control can be a bit awkward but is not a major disadvantage.  No camera is perfect.  This camera gives you 5MP in a small and light package with very sharp images right out of the camera.  It's also a lot of fun.  I don't want to go back to film.  Canon is the leader in digital photography in my opinion.","This is my fourth digital camera. After owning two intro models (Olympus D490 and D460) I went in the pursuit of speed. Speed being defined on four dimensions: (1) bootup/startup time, (2) delay between depressing shutter button and digital capture, (3) lag between consecutive shots, (4) lens apeture (for low light conditions). Before the Powershot S50 I was (and still am) using an Olympus C3040, which is the main comparitor for this review. In this price range last year the C3040 was one of the fastest cameras out there due to a 32Mb RAM buffer built into the camera and its F1.8 lens.<br />My sense is that the Powershot S50 and all of its competitors have excellent features - many modes, manual overrides, etc. For the most part, just reading the specs is enough for getting a sense of these features.<br />What is purely experiential - what requires owning and experiencing - is how fast the camera is (on the above four dimensions). The S50 is pretty fast. Bootup about 3 seconds. Delay between pressing shutter button and capture about 1 second. Lag between consecutive shoots about 1 second (I took consecutive shoots using the same fixed composition, flash off, new batteries, repeatedly pressing shutter button very quickly). These speeds are all slightly slower than the C3040. Boot is almost the same, shutter delay almost identical, and S50 was a touch slower between consecutive shoots (after the 6th or 7th shot the S50 was lagging behind). Apeture the Canon has a slower lens (F2.8 vs F1.8). Overall the S50 is a fast camera.<br />Obviously in the S50's favor is form factor (which is one reason why the lens is smaller, leading to a less fast lens (higher F-stop). It is a much smaller package than the C3040, which means that I'll be carrying it around more often.","Pros: Compact size, 5 megapixel resolution, ease of use, lots of creative photography options, Solid all metal compact body, Quality Canon lens, quality, enlargeable images, sturdy, macro capability.<br />Cons: No provision for add-on lenses or filters, Expensive, 5MP is probably overkill for most users, Underwater housing does not allow full control, not as sharp as most 4 MP cameras, 4-way Navigation Button & Proprietary Battery, Some photos had red eye, doesn't come with carrying case.<br />Summary: This compact Canon digital camera really impressed me in the week I've had mine so far. I've been looking and playing with the Sony DSC-P9 for some time but took a chance with the S50 sight unseen, with a few recommendations, and my expectations have been well exceded. Excellent image quality and easy to learn interface with ample effect, memory, and capture options are not compromised by the camera's size (slightly chunkier than the Sony, but still slips into a pocket easily). Crisp and bright image replay on the rear color LCD monitor. Easy downloads to PC with USB and unimposing Canon software, and fairly quick battery recharge too. This is a really great compact digital camera for those looking for great images in different conditions without a bulky, intrusive large body reflex. The movie capture is better than on previous Canon models, though still slightly choppy at 12 frames per second (not that making movies is your first choice in features for selecting pocket cameras). Nonetheless, after looking around I believe this is the best deal for quality/function/money versus size in the compact digital camera market.A+","Digital point and shoot cameras should not be looked at as a replacement to film cameras, the quality just isn't good enough for anything important or for images that you need to enlarge. But, for the convenience of being able to email your snapshots or upload them to a webpage or online auction quickly and easily, nothing beats a digital cam. The image quality of this Canon is acceptable if you understand that you will not be able to match 35mm film quality. The color saturation on the images is surprisingly good however you will notice some milky haze around some of the edges and background if you look closely. This is common (and expected) for low and mid range digital cameras such as this one.<br />My main complaint about this camera is that it is too bulky. In fact, it was so bulky and heavy that I ended up selling it to a friend and going with the Canon s400 instead.  For me, the real power in a point and shoot camera is size and convenience. The more convenient it is to lug, the more you will have it with you to capture life's precious moments.  And the s50 should most certainly be considered a point and shoot camera because it's manual controls are strange to operate and I eventually found myself not wanting to bother with them because of the way they are implemented on this camera.<br />For instance,  being able to shoot at a wide aperture on the s50 is of limited usefulness because the zoom lens doesn't maintain the wide aperture when you zoom in even just a little. So during the times I used my s50 and wanted a shallow depth of field, ie. when i was doing portraits, the f-stop automatically changed itself from f2.8 to f4.0 or f5.0 when I zoomed in to frame the shot.  I thought to myself, I  might as well have been shooting with the smaller and more convenient s400! Also, you might be tempted to think that flash exposure compensation is a godsend, like I initially did. But in practice, dialing down the flash on this camera yields dingy looking images in lower light. I was dissappointed.<br />Also, the image quality was cetainly acceptable and I have no complaint there, however the image processing time and shutter lag was definitely noticeable, especially indoors in mid to low light levels.<br />The s50 is just too big to carry around everywhere and subsequently, I did miss taking certain photos because the camera was back in the car or at home. I does not fit well in a shirt pants pocket and it weighs down a jacket pocket. When I wanted to slip it into my my film camera bag, it took up too much space and was unwieldy. My recommendation if you must have manual controls in a digital camera is to either step up to the Canon G3 or equivalent, or go to a digital SLR.  Otherwise, for a carry-around-everywhere camera, the smaller Canon ELPH series would be best.<br />I never really used the tiny viewfinder and don't recommend that you do either. Why? It's very tiny and not convenient, and it only shows a portion of the image frame. Also, it does not show any information such as shutter speed or f-stop. You are much better of using the LCD screen and doing so will give you a \"what you see is what you get\" image on the camera.","Tried (and by that i mean bought, used, and returned) quite a few cameras before finally deciding on this one. Has the best mix of features and performance of all the ones i tried (Canon G3, Nikon 4300, Nikon 4500, Canon S45). Would definitely recommend this camera, it has great AF (especially with the AF light) and takes amazing photos. Colors a brilliant, and everything is sharp and beautiful. Buy this camera, and also a second battery!","INTRO:<br />I've had this camera now for 2 weeks and absolutely love it. I already have a Sony F707, and was looking for a camera to take around that still had the 5 mp output, but a smaller form factor. When it came down to it, it was either this camera or the Olympus C50Z and I'm glad I decided on the S50. You just can't beat the Canon for features and design. Plus, the C50Z supposidly doesn't have a mic for video.<br />PROS:<br />From what the reviews have said, this is just a scaled down version of the Canon G3, but with 5 mp output vs. 4 with the G3.<br />It's got a very solid construction and I love the brushed metallic look of the body. It's not quite pocket sized - I tried lugging it around in my pocket for a day...a little bulky for that, but i'd say it's a great compromise for those that want more features than what the digital Elph series offers.<br />Speaking of which, it's got a great bundle of features. Images are bright and very real to life. From what I can tell, it's very similar in general shooting modes as my Sony. I leave the camera glued to Program AE, as I seem to get the best quality and still have the ability to adjust the different modes on the camera.  The continuous shooting mode is excellent and the intervalometer (time lapse photo shooting) is definitely a nice new feature. Further the stich assist and video modes with sound make it a better buy over the C50Z.<br />Also, the camera is very fast - from taking it out of the bag to turning it on, it's a little less than 4 seconds and it's ready to shoot.<br />Further, the camera uses non-memory lithium ion - I have yet to drain the battery fully from a days worth of shooting.  I almost never turn off the view finder and the battery's held up like a champ.  It also uses standard compact flash, which I picked up at Amazon (256mb Viking) [at a good price]after rebates. Just can't beat that...<br />COULD IMPROVE ON:<br />The only thing with the construction that got me a little concered was the slide door for the lens. If you moved it a certain way, it can move up and down. Still, the overall construction is very solid.<br />The macro is pretty average. It says in the guide that you can get as close as 5 cm or thereabouts, but the closest I could get in focus was about 3 inches. I guess it's the size of the optics.<br />Also, why only the black? I really like the brushed stainless look of the S45, but you can't get that flavor with the S50. From what I've heard, it's only available in Europe. I guess it's a marketing thing, but still... Don't get me wrong, I like the black, but it'd be nice to have the choice and black tends to show dust quite easily.<br />And while I like that it uses standard compact flash, I've noticed it's a little slower in tranfers and reading than Sony Memory stick.<br />Anyway, these are negligible issues and overall, Canon has really outdone themselves again."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot SD100 (Digital IXUS II / IXY Digital 30)","amazon_reviews":["a little too simplistic","This camera was pretty good for the money.  Although, the battery will not hold a charge and will probably have to be replaced.","This is now my sixth year of using this camera. It still functions beautifully albeit the numerous external scratches from being thrown around inside my bags. The only thing I wish it had was a bigger preview screen, but I view photos on my computer anyway so that's still not a big deal. Since I'm not a professional photographer I never felt the need to upgrade to a higher megapixel camera. I just wanted to leave a review expressing my appreciation for this product for not breaking down and/or apart on me over the past six years. SIX YEARS!","my mom had this camera when it was pretty much brand new then she gave it to me i have had it about 3-5 years i cant remember. but it was good until i took it out a few days ago i hadn't used it since the summer and it was january hen i turned it on the screen was discolored and blurry when i took a shot it was in blue and red but i blame it on old age i think its time to get a new one so if you plan on being able to use it for 5-7 years dont count on it it was excelent for the first four year!","I have had my Canon Powershot SD100 for over 4 years and have never been unhappy with it.

The size is perfect to toss in a purse or bag, and the camera is durable enough that you don't have to worry about it when you do!  Working the camera is easy - it's simple to navigate and extremely user friendly.  I had some issues with the CCD a while back, but I called Canon and they fixed it for FREE (they even paid for shipping).  I don't doubt that I will continue to use this camera until it is unusable (which will no doubt be quite some time), and then I'll buy another Canon!  I am thoroughly impressed.  I would recommend purchasing a larger SD card to go this one, as the one that's included is pretty small.  My 1GB card is perfect.","This was my first digital camera. It was perfect for the first year I had it - easily portable and navigable, decent battery life, movie and instant B+W options; it was the source of digital goodness. After the first year, when my concerns became focused on the quality of the photos I began to get increasingly disappointed. The zoom and flash limited the quality of photographs I was able to take. I kept getting blurry pictures, or the flash caused over-exposure or was too weak to make out anything in the distance. Forget about shots of buildings in twilight.<br /><br />I upgraded to a Digital Rebel for my first trip to Costa Rica and have satisfied most of the needs I was not receiving with the Elph.

The Elph has become my purse camera, indispensable for recording the scene of a traffic incident for insurance or catching the idiosyncrasies of life when the hulking Rebel is at home. It's not perfect but it is my sturdy, reliable recording device on the fly and I'm glad I still have one around. Overall a fantastic beginners camera, although limited by it's small pixel size. Because pixels have gotten so much more advanced, this would be a great gift for a young, budding photographer. It can handle travel, drops, and being roughed up quite well.","This camera is very nice.  I will go down on the pro's and con's.<br /><br />Pro's:<br /><br />1.  Very small.  It is with ease that you can put this camera into your pocket, or even into your glove dept of your car (and just how many things can you put in a glove dept these days?!!)  And the size really makes it easy for handling when taking pictures.<br /><br />2.  The digital rear view is very nice.  You get a clear vivid view of what it is that you are taking a picture of.  This is a fantastic feature, considering that many other camera's do not have a good view in the rear view... which sort of really goes against having the picture view in the rear of the camera in the first place!  Bright and easy to see.<br /><br />3.  For a 3.2 mpixel camrea, these pictures are pretty good quality.  I really like them, but would consider this a lower end camera... don't try to take shots of stuff far away.  This camera is for use close up.. like under 5 feet in distance for any definition.<br /><br />4.  Easy to use downloading from camera.  You can use the software they give you with this camera... or just skip it and use the windows XP software that automatically detects the camera, and loads the windows software that will work with your camera.  This is really nice that Canon and Bill Gates talked to each other and they shared information on drivers and software.  This does NOT alaways happen BTW.  Kudo's for Canon.<br /><br />Con's:<br /><br />1.  Battery life.  The battery is horrendous.  After six months, the battery rarely last over 15 - 20 minutes.  This is pretty bad.  I mean, this battery is easily the poorest quality of any battery in any device I have ever used.  And Canon should be ashamed for issuing the darn battery with this type of quality.  With Canon, you expect better quality.<br /><br />2.  Starter Camera.  This camera is really not for use for anything other than really close pictures.  Which is sorta what I said in the Pro section, and it is a pro for that reason.. but with the small zoom, I expected to get more than five feet or so for definition... perhaps I was over optimistic...<br /><br />3.  Outershell of camera.  After a couple of months, the color of the case of the camera sorta rubbed off.  It looks very dull, and old... I have had other cameras that are considerably older than this camera, but look a heck of a lot newer than this camera.  What did they put on the outer shell of this camera?  I do not know, but Canon should not use whatever it was again.  My camera looks like it is 50 years old.<br /><br />Overall:  A very good starter camera.  I would not get this again, but I would get it for someone who is just taking fun photos.  Perhaps get it for a youngster, or someone who might not really care that they can't get super good pictures.<br /><br />Have fun!!","a little too simplistic","This camera was pretty good for the money.

But what I found out was it can do much more than that. Manual mode is easy and effective. See some of my photos in customer images.","A great pocket size travel camera. Fun to use when on vacation or out with friends. I like that the camera is metal and durable. Easy to use menu and option knob. Get a spare battery, it's common sense. Very limited zoom and annoying 2 second delay when you press the button. I wish the memory card wasn't in with the batteries under the slide plate.

This little jewel is now my carry around camera.  And I just love it.<br /><br />Canon software for it's point and shoots is the best on the market (of software tha comes with camera).<br /><br />If you need \"better software\", get Photoshop ELements for about $100.  This is also best of breed.<br /><br />This thing is sooooo small and cute.  And it's easy to use.  Pictures are GREAT.

Very easy to get used to in all respects and a tough little cookie!","This camera is extremely stylish and compact.  Great for snapshots and other pictures of friends and things like that, but if you plan on taking lots of pictures of sporting events or nature, go with a camera with better optical zoom.

(5 stars are a bit stale and corny and hard to believe) But I can guarantee that you would love this 3.2 mp from digital cameras heaven. Trust me","Very easy to use. good quality pics for a 3.2MP camera. Great size.  Canon should include a bigger memory card than the measly 16MB supplied...which are not that expensive. would highly recommend.","THIS CAMERA ROCKS.<br />I average about 100 photos a day plus a few videos 7 days a week. This camera has been totally abused, Its been dropped almost 10 times, somtimes from about 6 feet landing on tile and concrete surfaces. Ive spilled beer all over it 3 times so its been soaking wet and all i do is dry it off and its fine. It been in the rain, the snow, the heat, the humidity, and below zero tempertures. The lense has 3 dents in it, one from a metal cup being thrown at it by an angry photo subject where the lense was smashed in about 1/4 of an inch on an angle, and all i did (the next morning while sober) was just click out the lense and it worked FINE hahah. A few of my friends have digital cameras that broke just from them bumping into a table with the camera in their pocket. This little Canon can take anything and I recommend it to ANYONE who brings their camera with them wherever they go. Its small and compact, sturdy, takes excellant photos (excepcially of hot chicks) in all conditions, great options, fun options like sounds and custome start up images, easy to use menu, and fits well in my hand. The lanyard is also of great design and makes the camera even more secure. IF this camera EVER breaks I will instantly buy a new one as I believ it is the only camera that can take the abuse I give it.<br />BUY THIS CAMERA!","I've had the camera for a good week or so.  Been playin around with it and it takes some great pictures.  I was looking for a camera I can take when I go on trips and stuff that would fit into my pocket with ease.  I didn't want any more embarassing comments from people like a \"Is that a camera in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?\"  This guy slips into the pocket with ease and is not bulky at all.  The camera was a little heavier than I expected, but thats no big deal.<br />Picture quality has been good thus far.  Not great, but I didnt want to drop another hundy for just 1 MP improvement.  I bought a 512 MB SD card off Amazon for $75 (after rebate), so I don't have any problem fitting pictures on here.  Just splerge a little and you'll never have to worry about filling up the card.  I also bought a genuine Canon battery off of Ebay for a backup, but havent found battery power to be a problem as of yet.  The zoom does the trick for what I need.  If you are just taking pictures of friends, random hot chicks, etc this is fine.  Yeah, 3x optical would be nice, but this will suffice.  I really didn't intend to rhyme there, sorry.<br />Here is my story on the durability of the camera.  So, my first outing with the camera.  A baseball game between two big crosstown rivals.  Tailgating in the lot before the game, pretty intoxicated.  Took a bunch of pictures already, turned out great.  Then the incident occurred.  Someone is standing a good 200 feet away throwing a softball back and forth with another guy I am with.  Random people are walking by left and right and an errant throw approaches my group.  I attempt to protect some bystanders from taking a head shot with the ball.  I throw my hand up in the air to block the ball, however, my blurred judgement threw up the hand with the camera in it.  Next thing I know, my new camera is airborne.  It flies about 8 feet high and 10 feet away from me, crashing into the side of a truck and then hitting the concrete full force.  It was like taking the camera and just whipping it against the ground.  I thought, \"well, it was nice having a digital camera for a few days.  This one is gone\"  Upon picking up the camera, I was pleasantly surprised.  The battery holder on the bottom fell off and the battery went flying.  After 3 minutes of searching under cars, the battery was found.  I popped it back in, snapped the cover back on, and the moment of truth came.  I hit the power button, and boom, it turns on like nothing ever happened.  All my old pictures are still there and I took many pictures the rest of the day.  All turned out great.  Two scrapes on the bottom is all of the lasting damage.  Gives my camera a little personality.  Matches the scrapes on my cell phone from similar instances.  So, this camera is definitely durable, will be able to take a few shots.  Also, if you drink too much and become a little clumsy with your possesions, this is the right camera for you.<br />Overall, a great camera, defintely worth the price for me ($209).  I bought a somewhat cheaper one knowing that I might do something stupid and lose it or break it quickly.  That did occur, and it still works, so a plus for me.  Takes good pictures and is very easy to use and take around with you.  Overall, this is a great camera for the amateur photographer, who likes to travel but not be bogged down with a huge camera.  Take pictures of your friends and family and you will be happy.  And of course, if you are a twenty something, obnoxious, can't control your drinking kind of guy, I give this my 100% recommendation.","A terrific little camera for the price.  I bought the SD100 based on my experience with the APS elph II.  It too is small, easy to use, and takes great pictures.  We love vacationing at theme parks and have found that it's easier to get around without having camera bags, backpacks etc... getting in the way.  I carry the SD100 on my belt with the optional leather case and hardly know it's there.  I use it at work too, and it's small enough to keep with me all the time.  Even the best camera is useless if you don't have it with you.  Connection to a computer is simple with the included USB cable, and with my Windows XP machine I didn't even bother installing the software.  Just plug it in, turn it on, download your pictures.  I'm also a big fan of the stainless steel shell.<br />Two drawbacks are the limited optical zoom and the size of the screen.  The screen is great for composing photos even in bright sun, but viewing them directly from the camera is much better when you connect to a TV with the included cable.  The optical zoom is what it is, but to get something longer you'll most likely need a larger camera.  I'm also glad I bought an extra, larger SD disk.  The included 16 MB is fine if you have a handy place to download pictures but having space for lots of pictures is one of the great advantages of digital photography.","The Canon SD100 is now an obsolete model which makes it an excellent bargain if you can find one discounted.<br />A sub-compact that seems to have been chiseled from solid steel, this will be a second digital camera to complement a more sophisticated (but larger) Olympus. Measuring only 3.3x2.2x0.9 inches this really does fit into a pocket.<br />The Canon is a true 3.2 megapixel camera with 2x optical zoom. Pictures can only be recorded in JPG format with the standard  sizes and compression you'd expect on a camera this size. The omission of a RAW or TIF seems an oversight but this is a 'point and shoot'after all.<br />The camera has an automatic and manual mode. Automatic gives the photograher no control over the camera other than flash, image resolution and macro. Switching over to manual extends the control to exposure compensation (+/-2 in 1/3 stop intervals), white balance, ISO rating and digital effects (sepia, B&W, Vivid, Low Sharpening and Normal). In addition Manual mode lets you focus the camera to infinity for landscape shots.<br />Start-up and shut down times are very respectable and switching over to image review seems near instant.<br />The LCD panel on the rear of the camera is bright and clear, it also seems to match about 100% of the actual image recorded. The viewfinder has a center mark but is really too small to use practically. If the battery was low on juice, turning off the LCD would save power but shooting would be fiddly.<br />As well as images, the little SD100 can record short movies with sound in Quicktime format and you can add voice memos to shots. Recording sound memos takes a series of menu button presses to record the sound bite and an equal number of thumb presses to play it again - more of novelty than practical use.<br />The camera 'mounts' to the PC with the supplied USB cable and supplied Twain driver and software. The software doesn't seem as intuitive as it could be. I'd like to just see the camera as a drive under Windows and drag and drop the files I want. The supplied software allows you to review thumbnails on the camera but view 'full size' requires a download to the PC. A secondary SD card reader might be a future accessory.<br />Included with the software package are photo/video editing packages from Arcsoft as well as applications to create photo albums for printing.<br />No software included for creating on-line photo albums though - seems Canon only offer this for European customers!<br />Lack of battery indicator is the only other gripe, but since the camera is on its first charge and has now taken over 50 shots with/without flash, I see no reason to doubt the manufacturers claim of upto 180 images with LCD monititor turned on.<br />The Canon S100 series case, a snip for under $10, is nice touch to a well finished quality feel camera.<br />The newer SD110 is basically the same camera with a direct to print button and 32MB SD card. Does that justify the extra dollars - that's up to you","Pros:<br />1. Compact and easy to stick into a purse when going to a party.<br />2. Good for point and shoot. Not recommend for professional photographers (or even semi-professional ones).<br />3. Easy to use.<br />4. There is a meter telling how many more \"pictures\" I can take (I really like this function - I will then just switch to take smaller size of pictures if the memory is low and I don't have a laptop with me to download pictures right away).<br />5. The zoom is relatively sufficient if using only for the event like party or get together but insufficient for the travelers who travel the world.<br />Cons:<br />1. There are some finger-prints on body of the camera even I clean the camera everytime I use it. They make the camera look dirty and old.<br />2. Battery dies relatively quick and there is no battery meter telling that the battery is dying unless it is about to die. The brandnew battery that I have goes for ~100 pictures (using LCD mornitor) when fully charged.<br />3. 16 MB SD card that comes with the camera is useless, have to buy higher capacity SD cards.<br />4. No date and time stamp on the pictures unless they are printed onto papers. I find this annoying since I hardly print pictures and normally save them electronically.<br />5. Even the red eye reduction mode is turned on, there may still be red-eyes.<br />As a result, I use this one for small events and buy another camera (with higher zoom capacity and more manual functions - trading with price and bulkiness of the camera, of course) to use when I travel.","I owened this camera for over six months now and I must say the picture quality is not all that.I owened previously, the S110 and that camera rocks.The SD100 night pictures have these glare circles on the pictures.You could take a nice picture and have this ugly circle  your face or somewhere in the frame.I don't know the cause,I called canon they said to use manual setting,but then why should I have to? the S110 never needed it...I exchanged the camera for another one thinking it's a manufacturer's defect, same thing. I had my graduation pictures with blotches on them from this.I'm trying to get rid of this camera I hate it...","I work in an Electronics store, so I get to see all of the new cameras. The powershot100 really caught my attention due to it's small size and reasonable price, not to mention it's capability of doing video, still shots and sound play back all for around $299.99<br />This camera takes great pictures, with reasonable shots in poor lighting conditions.<br />I really don't have anything bad to say about the camera. It's one of the better camera's canon put out in the 3.2 megapixel genre. I have recommendend and sold this camera to many customers, with sucessful results.","I usually go out at nite and like to take picture of friends and I, and this camera does the job.  In dim light it really comes through.  The battery life is pretty not 3 -4 nights for me, and the picture quality is really good.  The Optical zoom isnt all that but if your looking for high quality everyday pictures this is it.<br />Great camera to capture those moments..","We just bought this camera a little over a month ago, and we love it.  We took it to New York and got some great pictures - but the biggest advantage of it on that trip, was the size.  I do reccommend buying a larger memory card - the one that comes with it will only hold about 16 pictures.  We're still finding new advantages to having this camera each time that we use it.  I highly reccomend it.","If it weren't for the bad pixels I would have given a higher rating.  Probably 4 or 5 stars.  It just burns me that they can ship a camera with bad pixels in the center of the view.  You should also be aware of the waranty repair process.  In north america they have one warranty location.  Colorado. So you will have to ship the camera to them wait 2-3 weeks and then wait to get it shipped back (they pay for return).  Luckily I noticed the defect before the 1 year waranty was up.  However now I have several hundred pictures with bad pixels in them.","Most Canon digital cameras still use the CompactFlash memory card.  CompactFlash is much thicker and larger than the Secure Digital card used in the SD100 (this model).  It's cheaper per-megabyte, but is slower and draws more power.  Canon is doing a good thing by using the increasingly dominant SD format in this dimunitive digital camera.<br />Function-wise this camera is a good point-and-shoot replacement.  You won't find many manual controls (beyond the usual exposure comp, white balance, flash control, and a few other common controls), but it's a good \"pick up and snap away\" camera.  2X optical zoom is rather inadequate for any semi-serious photographers who travel a lot, but ok if you just carry this to events and parties.<br />Picture quality is much better than my first-generation S100 digital elph camera from a couple years ago.  I still find the exposure a bit on the underside and the color tone a bit on the cold side.  If you want top-notch picture quality, consider the 4-MP Canon S400 which has excellent image quality and color balance.<br />In summary, this is a very capable digital camera in a great form factor.  It's light and easy to carry, and does a fine job as long as you don't do serious photogrpahy with it.","I started with a Canon A60.  Happy with it and upgraeded to the A70.  Both became too heavy and slow.  Got rid of that and tried the Canon SD100 and it has everything you could need, except a decent sized SD card to start.  I recommend getting the bigger SD card right away so you don't get this great camera and don't use the capabilities.  It takes great pictures and you have to have a SD card capable of handling it!  It's worth the investment.  Great camera.","If you are looking for a camera to replace a traditional film camera, the SD-100 is it.  I'm an avarage user and this is what I've found:<br />PRO:<br />1. Small size. Easy to carry in a pocket or purse.<br />2. Decent Zoom<br />3. Burst mode for taking a series of quick pictures.<br />3. Movie mode...WITH SOUND!<br />4. Intuitive controls<br />5. Supplied Cannon software makes transferring photo's a breeze.<br />CON:<br />1. Expect to buy a memory card.  The 16MB supplied with the camera is useless.<br />2. Red-eye.  Even with the red eye reduction turned on, you still get some red eye.  It's mildly annoying, but you can fix it on the computer easily.<br />3.  Mysterious small halo.  Must be a function of the lens.  occasionaly you will get this small halo in a picture. Doesn't happen often.<br />4. A second battery is highly reccomended.<br />The only people who will complain about this camera are high-end photographers.  They'll whine about everything.  \"Zoom is tiny\" \"Aperature control\" \"Lack of filter\". Crybabies the whole lot of them.<br />If you are a normal person, you'll love this camera.  Point, shoot, done.","I really like this camera. But if someone knows how to use it as a webcam, please help, I really appreciate it.<br />I have a Creative webcam NX Pro but the image quality is really poor (even at highest quality setting) and the rate is slow (I use USB1.1).","This is a really good product so far.  i bought this item because of the sd functionality.  I have a Sharp zaurus pda with a sd slot and wi-fi so transferring pics and movies to my computer is accomplished by putting the sd card in my pda and wirelessly transferring directly into the folder on the hard drive which i want.<br />I had a sony digital mavica and the picture quality was really starting to bother me, so i was very satisfied with the image quality.<br />Another great thing about this camera is the video out jack.  I am using it for a super high resolution web cam for gnomemeeting in linux now.<br />The only thing i didn't like is that it only comes with a 10M sd card.  This is ok for some pictures but will eat up the movie time.  However i am glad i didn't have to pay an extra $200 on the camera price for a 512M.","If you are looking for a reasonably priced digital camera with great quality photos, then look no further. This camera is awesome. I bought it about a month ago, and am a college student, constantly taking pictures of my friends, the beach here (I go to school in Santa Barbara), and anything else that strikes my fancy, and this camera does the trick. Not only is it small and light (and oh so easy to stow away in a backpack or a purse), but its incredibly easy to use, and is just a great piece of machinery. When deciding to purchase this camera, I looked at close to a hundred different cameras, ranging in mega-pixel quantity, price, size, and the likes. This one seemed to be the best \"bang for my buck\" and was a perfect purchase. I honestly can't speak highly enough of the camera-- the slow exposure option is great for night shots out on the water, or the starry sky up in the hills, or anything of the sort. So just click \"add to cart\" because this is defnitley the camera you want!","best camera for the price<br />the zoom is just enough for most people<br />only complain is the small memory card it comes with<br />need to buy atleast a 256sd card(will hold 150 pics at highest setting)","great little camera<br />the zoom is just enough for most people<br />need to buy extra memory<br />can't beat at this price","Ok everyone will give you the specs and the good and the bad about this camera.  They are a bunch of winnies.  I purchased this camera 1.5 years ago went to vietnam with it (it survived a rough trip).  Shipped it many times to places when I needed it.  The biggest one of all...I went fishing and fell in the lagoon with this camera soaked it to the bone.  I thought it was toast.  I would not turn on after that big spill.  Two months later I was going to toss it.  I thought I wonder if this thing would work?  I put in the battery and the darn thing works!  It works!  Im telling you when I came out of the water you could see water draining from the viewfinder.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone and any canon products since then I have bought the A 70 and could not be happier with both of them.  This is one though hombre of a camera.","I won this camera at a Christmas office building raffle!<br />It's a great camera; I love it. It takes great pictures for such an easy-to-use camera. I could go into depth about it, but why? I have nothing negative to say about this little package. Well, it didn't come with a case, so I had to buy that separately from Canon, but that was the only \"bad\" thing.<br />I've been taking photos since this little PowerShot landed in my hands, and I am very impressed with the pictures. I have not needed to color-correct in Photoshop, as I would normally do with other hobbyist/consumer cameras I've used or owned. If you're looking for a semi-pro or pro camera, no, this isn't for you, but if you're a CONSUMER who likes to take pictures of family, friends, your dog, your car, your feet, or whatever...then yes, this is a very good buy for the price. I took a very nice picture of an Arizona sunset on Christmas day with this little unit, and although I'm no photographer, the picture turned out great.","Pros:<br />- Sharp images at 3.2MP<br />- Very fast (~1 sec) recycle speed<br />- Aluminum casing is scratch resistant and durable<br />- Quality optical zoom<br />- Fast refresh on LCD (not choppy like some Olympus models)<br />Cons:<br />- Slow shutter speeds at low light may cause blurring, but ISO mode is selectable to help compensate<br />- Red Eye is nearly unavoidable, even with the red eye option turned on, but since the photos are digital it is easily resolved later<br />- 2X optical zoom is far too low, a 3X or higher would be good<br />- Battery life is small, but a larger battery is available<br />Overall, I have been very pleased with the SD100 and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality camera who doesn't want to spend more than $300.  The sharpness and recycle speed alone make this a great buy.  Honestly, the image color and quality is fantastic, and is by far the best feature of this camera (as it should be).","I have owned a Canon S100 for 2 years and liked it.  This smaller version corrects all the problems of the earlier design.  It's lighter, a touch smaller, easier to use, more features (with literally bells and whistles), takes better pictures (no blue cast).  The battery charger is smaller (easier to travel with), etc. etc.  I picked it up at Best Buy for 269.99, as they price matched their online price.  The only downside is the SD cards are more expensive than CF cards and the zoom is only 2X  instead of 3X on the S100.  A small price to pay for the size and convenience of the better camera.  Highly recommended if you like a small camera with all the features that is easy to use.","For those of you experiencing SD card problems, please go to the Canon website for a fix.  Enter you camera serial # and you will be downloaded a firmware update for your camera if needed.","this cannon camera is very good. i used to have a kodak camera but it kept on breaking down.so this christmas i got a new one! i was very satisfied with its quality, and compatibility. it has programs like zoom browser, video impression, and photo impression. with these programs(you can almost do anything with the pictures). in conclusion this camera is yet the best one i've ever owned and i also like the video recording feature its VERY! fun (if u know what i mean)! HAHAHA and its also very light and small. it fits almost anywhere. it is good for trips. by car and plane cause of its small size. and theres so many more things to write about but i dont have the time and dedication to do it so. if your still reading this your reading your wasting your time and GO buy it NOW!","Although of its tiny size, the sd100 is promising gadget. With the proper 3.2 MP and eye catching designe, it will surely be a fascinating first digital camera. Too bad it those not follow the 3x optical trend. The only dislike I have till now is its lack of shutter speed limitations. If you are planning to buy this camera, I would highly recommend buying an extra battery pack. Another recommendation is buying a neck strap, since the camera is lightweight and small. If you are looking for the perfect point and shoot camera that is simple and easy to use, then the sd100 is the oen for you.","My Canon SD100 has the same problem as the customer from Washington DC and the customer from Santa Margarita of California.  I have lost many precious photos because the camera would suddenly stop me from reading the previous photos on camera due to \"Corrupt Data\".  When that happens, I can not re-format my SD memory card.  I have to borrow another SD digital camera to re-format my SD memory card before I can use the SD memory card again.<br />The camera flash is also too strong when the target person or object is within 4 feet of the camera.  Too bad the auto flash does not correct itself with the distance of the target object.<br />Another drawback with this camera is the battery pack.  I have to take out the battery pack out of the camera every time I want to charge it, which is every other day.  I would much prefer just stick a cord/charger into the camera and charge the battery pack indirectly that way.  This would reduce the wear and tear of the battery/memory card door.  Hopefully, the next generation will have this feature.<br />Even though I'm not a professional photographer, I still wish there are more manual options with this camera, such as aparture and focus.  I wish I could control the focus so some photos can have more depth and better focus.<br />Even with the above shortcomings, I still like this camera for its compact size, sleek design, hard case, good photo quality, and price ($260 as of 11/03).  If the SD memory card problem can be fixed, I would recommend this camera to most of my friends.","i have read a few reviews about the canon sd100 digital elph. I have one of my own and i wanted to explain to those people that are saying the memory cards have a defect etc.... i dont know about all the problems but i dont know about the little memory card error message  some people have came across. before bashing this beautiful and very exceptional camera, make sure you insert the card correctly. i had the same problem with the error message when i first turned on the camera.. i opended up the little lid and realized i didnt insert the memory card correctly. until you hear a click, then that means the card is correctly in place..... thank you","1day owner.  Only complaint is weak photo modifying software bundled with camera.  Not even a red eye fixer.","I bought this camera not too long ago.  Took it to New York for vacation.  I must say the auto feature works well with the flash.  If you do not use the flash, the color is off.  I did a test inside my house with incandescent lighting and it looked awful in automatic mode with no flash.  If you put it in manual mode and change the lighting to incandescent, it works but the whole point of me buying this camera was to point and shoot; not having to make it a manual type set up.  Sharpness is okay.  I guess I need to buy a bigger, better digital camera.  Maybe a 6 mega-pixel camera.  I would buy this for simple shooting but nothing else.","After a long research, I decided to purchase the Canon IXUS II (or SD100 in some countries) as my first digital camera. As a background, I am generally a point-and-shoot person with aspirations to take up photograpgy as a more serious hobby. I've been using it extensively for about two months now, and here's what I think are the good and bad points of the camera:<br />GOOD POINTS<br />1. Amazing picture quality for OUTDOOR shots - Pictures are sharp and crystal clear. The photos produced are exactly like what I saw with my own eyes.<br />2. Small, slim and solid - Can fit in my pocket easily. Now I can take it everywhere and ready to take a snapshot whenever I feel like it. It opens a whole new possibilities.<br />3. Relatively easy to use - The buttons layout are spot on, everything important is within reach of your thumb or index finger. On-screen menus are logical and easy to use. For advance features, I still need to read the manual though.<br />4. Movie quality is generally good. All movies I took plays well (with good sound) on the camera's LCD and and also on my 29\" TV. The sound playback on the camera is quite loud and can be heard even in noisy areas.<br />5. Fast operation - fast starting up time and time between shots, you wont notice any delays. Transferring images to PC is also relatively fast.<br />6. Battery life is okay, I managed to took 68 shots (plus a hell lot of picture playback on LCD and on TV) before the battery died.<br />7. Great LCD display. Sharp images and good colour reproduction. Can be seen easily in bright sunlight.<br />BAD POINTS<br />1. Average (on the borderline of poor) INDOOR picture quality. Every photo I took that uses the flash turns out ugly. The photos have this unnatural yellow glow (from the flash) on the subject, and the background becomes very dark, even though the room was evenly lit in real life. The best that I could do is to use Manual, and set the Exposure to -1 2/3, White Balance to Tungsten, and set the Effects to Neutral, and ISO to 50. That manages to turn my indoor pictures from ugly to bearable. The other alternative is to take indoor shots with flash off, as suprisingly it produces good pictures. But you need to use a tripod to get sharp images, which isn't always convenient. I'm really dissapointed with the indoor performance of this camera. None of the glowing reviews I read in my research highlighted this problem.<br />2. Low battery indicator only shown on screen when the battery is on the verge of dying. If you don't have a spare battery and you are outside, your camera would be useless until you get back and recharge the battery.<br />3. Need to take out the battery to recharge.<br />4. Only 2x optical zoom.<br />5. Movies has a limit of 30 seconds per clip. You can fill up the whole memory card with movies, but it has to be in a series of 30s clips. You can't take one long continous movie shot.<br />6. Once you downloaded your movie shots to PC, and you deleted the movie from your camera, you cant upload the movie back to your camera. You can upload still images back to your camera, but not movies.<br />7. The bundled Canon software is not the best, nor is it the easiest to use.<br />Conclusion: A great all round compact camera that is easy to use, and takes excellent outdoor shots. If you can live with average indoor shots, then buy this. Otherwise, I would recommend Sony Cybershot as it can take much much better indoor shots compared to this camera. I give this camera 2.5 stars.","I bought this delightful little camera in the Netherlands whilst on holiday there.  I had done a fair amount of research into the choice of camera, and so knew pretty much what I wanted. When I saw it advertised I had a look at it and after I had had it demonstrated to me and I had handled it myself. I bought it. Once I was back in South Africa I realised that although all the blurb on the box was in English, and even though I had spoken English to the dealer, all the Handbooks and Manuals are in Dutch! I can manage the basic use as it is a very simple to manage camera, but for the downloading etc etc I would like to have more information and help available. Where and how can I obtain English manuals?","Had this two days and so far LOVE it! First the size is not as small as the Pentax Optio S but it was small enough to fit in my pocket no problem. Default settings out of the box with 16MB SD card allowed me 19 clear shots in a room that only had my TV and one 25 watt flourescent light on (no adjustments whatsoever) or 16 shots and a short 20 sec video. SO GET A BIGGER SD card (I got an OEM 128MB sd card which works fine and cheaper than Canon's branded one)! Manual is easy to understand and controls are easy to manipulate, well spaced and LCD display is crisp. I was first considering the A70 since I wanted a good 3 MP below $300 but found the A70 too heavy and bulky to fit in my pocket. The 2x zoom is not great but I figure to be using this mostly for indoor shots that I can move closer to anyway. And from all the test shots I have done objects about 20-30 feet away still very clear and crisp even when zooming in from a distance and then zooming into the object itself. So far though it does what I want it to do, is small, has a solid feel and great pictures! The movie resolution in default is also fluid and clear and sound is clean too. I have yet to change any settings on this and out of the box I LOVE it!!!!Easy to use, good picture quality, small size, great looks, cheap price... what more could I want?!! Oh and the fingerprints are not an issue either cause they wipe off easily off the stainless steel body. 5 stars!!!!","The SD100 is the newest itineration of the digital Elph series, but certainly it is not the most up-to-date digicam around. The original digital Elph was the S100 (I still have that one), and quite a few Sxxx models have been issued between the time that one came out and now.<br />This one gets the SD designation to denote its use of a Secure Data memory card, which is a very small card with a tiny lever that prevents the card's data from being accidently erased or overwritten. Frankly, I think it's much ado about nothing; I've never had a problem erasing my files by accident and I resent the fact that I needed a new card reader to accommodate this slight alteration. Of note, however, almost all SD cams will accept MultiMediaCards (MMCs) happily.<br />Anyway, in true Canon style, the optics here are good and the body is well constructed and attractive. The controls are fairly intuitive and (proprietary) battery use is above average.<br />The resolution is a more than adequate 3.2 megapixels.<br />The Achilles Heel of the SD100 however is the far too short (2X) optical zoom, the same power found on the original S100 nearly 5 years ago. You are much less likely to find a use for 3.2 megapixels (versus 2 megapixels) than you would be to find many photo opps where you'd wish you had a more competent zoom.<br />All things considered, in this price range and assuming compactness appeals to the Elph buyer, I'd say the Pentax Optio and the Minolta Dimage are both better cameras than the Canon SD100.","This is a nifty little gadget; light in weight; fits comfortably in hand; slick in style.<br />The 2X optical zoom is weak; but for a casual leisure photograph it does the job. The 3.2 MP gives a sharp image.<br />On the whole I do not have any problems with it. Except the one issue I had in formatting the memory stick. Well in my experimentation I went ahead and formatted the memory with an expectation that there will be a warning to the nature of \"Are you Sure you wish to format Memory\".  Well to my utter despair I was served no such warning and have lost a few memorable pictures. I was told that a friend had similar issues with an earlier version. I am surprised that Cannon has not corrected this on this newer version.","Previuosly I have used Sony Cybershot P3, p2 and Pextax Optio S. I decided to buy this one as Canon has a good name in camera products. The picture quality is the best so far for me. The optical zoom is limited but enough for an amateur like me. The problem is the movie mode as the camera will not adjust itself to white balance or light exposure. For example, if you first started your recording in an indoor environment such as your room and then proceed to record the view of outside your window(bright sunny day), the camera would not be able to cope with the bright light as it has been set for the light exposure of the room. The screen would just be flat white. It's a major setback as all my previuos camera would adjust the white balance. Other than that, the camera doesn't have a battery indicator. It only appears when the battery is almost depleted. Not helpful enough. Other than that, the size is awesome, compact, but not as small as the Pentax optio s.","I orignially had an Olympus C700 but I needed a camera that I could take with me on hikes.  After much research, I found the Canon SD100.  Now there is a model above it but you pay $100 dollars more.  I wanted a camera that would be able to take decent photos of the wilderness that I was exploring and be VERY portable.  There are some things I found out and you can explore as well:<br />The manual features are memorized.  I had some trouble with the Olympus resetting every time I shut it off.  The Canon takes all photos in max resolution minimum compression.<br />The ISO settings are not true.  As stated in another review, they seem to be one step up.  Therefore, ISO 50 is actually ISO 100 and so forth.<br />True view photos are seen thru the rear window.  Although I don't like to see the photos I am about to take thru the digital window in the back (battery conservation) I have found that what you see is what you get when you use the window in the back.  It has been taking some getting use to.<br />Hope this helps you out.  I am happy with the SD100 and I will soon be posting many pictures on my website.  Great luck shopping and as always, Amazon rules.","the sd100 delivers a stylish, ultracompact camera but with only 2x optical zoom and very limited manual controls.<br />pros:<br />- very good resolution, especially for a 3MP ultra-compact.<br />- good color response.<br />- good reliable metering.<br />- no color cast when using flash.<br />- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)<br />- 9-point AiAF.<br />- the LCD monitor (1.5\") is bright and has an anti-reflective coating - gives good live preview and review even in well lit situations.<br />- shooting priority play mode (a half-press of the shutter release always returns to shooting).<br />- fast shot-to-shot times.<br />- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera.<br />- as with most canon digicams, the sd100 feels solid.<br />- USB connectivity.<br />- good battery life, although i would recommend carrying a spare since canon's batteries are proprietary.<br />- ultracompact: 3.3 x 2.2 x 0.9 in, weighing only 6.5 oz.<br />- has continuous shooting function, which you don't normally find in ultra-compacts.<br />- 15 second night exposure ability.<br />- long movie clips possible at VGA mode (up to 3 minutes including audio).<br />cons:<br />- limited 2x optical zoom.<br />- very few manual controls - no aperture priority, no shutter priority, no manual focus (this is okay if all you want is a point and shoot).<br />- average macro performance.<br />- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery compartment or replace the SD card.<br />- very small mode dial.<br />- the supplied 16MB SD card is inadequate - be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for at least a 256MB card.<br />- proprietary battery - again, a few more bucks for a spare.<br />- case tends to show fingerprints.<br />the sd100's mission in life is to take nice pics with as small and light a footprint as possible.  on the nice picture category, it delivers.  however, there are at least two other cameras that are smaller, have better optical zoom (3x vs the canon's 2x) and have a wider feature set: the pentax optio s and casio ex-z3.  as much as i like canon digicams, i would recommend these two over the sd100.<br />i hope this helps you with your buying decision.  peace.","You can take truly amazing pictures with this little pocket size camera.

It had been an extremely reliable camera and I was fortunate to not have encountered the problems some of the reviewers here have with the zoom lens retraction.<br /><br />Of course, the resolution of 2 Mega Pixels is pathetic by today's standards. In all other respects, this is an outstanding camera. The pictures taken with this camera are sharp and the colors are vibrant and natural.<br /><br />I am thinking of replacing this one with a very compact Canon PowerShot SD770IS 10 Mega Pixel Camera, which as of today can be had for about the same price. It has very favorable reviews, so you might want to look into that too.","We got the Canon Powershot A60 when it just came out, atleast 2 years ago. Now after many droppings on cement, the picture is messed up, but that's my 13 year old self's fault. I hope my dad gets a newer Canon soon. It may seem dated and bulky compared to newer and more expensive models, but this is jam packed with features. And it was really expensive when we got it. We got our use out of it, though. It's a really nice camera, but I've dropped it too many times before. (ATLEAST 8) And now the screen is sometimes messed up, I know I said that before, but I just want to let you know it's my fault (Not the brand's)... anyways you can have sepia, black & white and other cool effects... if you don't want to spend the money on the newest thing on the market, buy this, you'll love it too!<br /><br />I LOVE THIS CAMERA<br /><br />It has video, a decent microphone, different types of flashes, tons of settings, great zoom, and lighting settings. (AND MORE)<br /><br />Get this camera today, you won't be disappointed, (and I would know, my aunt is a world renouned photographer...)","I love this camera.  I have so much fun with it and the pictures are great.  It is easy to use and the movie feature with sound is a blast!  I bought a 3.2 megapixel for my daughter and she loves it as well!!!","When I wanted to buy a 2 mp digital camera, everyone was telling me no 4 or 5 mp is better. My arguement was that I mainly intend to email photographs for which anycase I have to reduce the file size to about 100 kb each, then why pay extra to get a 5 mp camera? Also, expectation was that I would print 4 x 6 or a max of 8 x10 inch sizes. For this 2 mp should be just about fine. I saved nearly 100 dollars over the price of a 4 mp A80.<br /><br />I have now had the A60 for 9 months and have no regrets. Have mainly been emailing photos to family and friends. I did print a few 5 x 7 pictures, and the quality has been great.<br /><br />Initially did try various shooting modes, but, now the only modes I really use are the Auto, the Night Shot and the Fast Action ones.<br /><br />I particularly like the 'stitch' utility which was a part of the CD. Have been able to piece together some wonderful landscapes, and one semi-circular rainbow.<br /><br />Initially used standard AA batteries, but, found that too be expensive. Often needed one set of batteries for 40 to 50 photographs. Now switched to NiMh rechargeables and they have been giving good performance.<br /><br />Another advantage is that one can attach standard telephoto and wide lenses. Did attach a wide angle lens. It worked great outdoors. However, the photos taken indoors with the flash on had a problem as the lens obstructed the flash. With a telephoto lens attached there is no problem.<br /><br />The camera has been quite sturdy as well. It has usually been flung in the back-pack and taken one small fall without any problems.<br /><br />Then only thing I am not too happy about is the lag. It is just too difficult to get a moving object in the frame because of the delay.<br /><br />Overall, I am quite happy with the purchase. Probably will upgrade to one with 6 mp (I am begining to think I should print posters of some of the outdoor photos), 10x optical zoom (with image stabilization) when that becomes available for less than $350!","I have had this camera for less than a year, and I love it! I bought it because I own a Canon film camera, and I love the brand. I was thrilled with the investment. The camera is easy to use, and fits in my pocket. It takes great pictures too! I love the fact that it can also take movie clips. It's a great camera that anyone could use easily. The only bad thing about it is that I wish it had more zoom. However, this camera is great for taking pictures at any occasion.","Taken on its own merits this is a fine little camera, particularly useful for its fully manual mode, although the only reason you might buy it over the Powershot A70 and A85 models is because, like me, you're poor, either because you don't earn very much money or because you spend all the money you earn without thought of the consequences. The A70 and A85 are identical in terms of features and offer higher resolutions. The A60 is, however, a very good camera. In no particular order...<br /><br />The image quality is sharp and clear, indeed too sharp at times, and a 2MP image fills up a 21\" monitor. To a great extent the 'megapixel race' is a matter of pride and face; the only people who would benefit from a higher resolution are the awful, awful people who post on Photo.net, who will buy a top-notch Nikon digital SLR instead, because (a) it's their livelihood and (b) it impresses clients and models. It's a different world.<br /><br />For the rest of us, the only major bursa in the A60s photographic trochanter is the digital sharpening filter which the camera applies to the image, and if you take a photograph of - for example - a sharp-edged cathedral against a blue sky, the cathedral ends up with an oddly sharp 'aura' around it. Thankfully you can turn this off by selecting 'low sharpening' as a special effect.<br /><br />The close-up macro mode autofocuses very well - you can't really use the screen to focus, unless you use 'zone focus' with the manual mode - and although I never expected to use macro, I find myself frequently photographing lots of bugs, fingers, nails, stones, flecks of spittle etc up close. Probably not a selling point for most people, but it's fun.<br /><br />In 35mm film terms, the zoom lens goes from roughly 35mm to roughly 50mm, i.e. from wide-angle to neutral. It's not particularly useful, and I keep it at its widest setting. The aperture at 35mm is f2.8, which is average for a film camera, and at 50mm is f4.8, which is not great, although the CCD seems more sensitive than film (you can set the ISO speed from 50-400, although I leave it on 50, and it's definitely more sensitive than ISO 50 film). The maximum shutter speed is 15 seconds. Up to about 10 seconds the visible parts of the images are noise-free, although if you subsequently brighten them with Photoshop they don't look very good at all.<br /><br />The Powershots use ordinary AA batteries and widely-available compact flash cards, rather than odd lithium cells and obscure 'memory sticks'. If you take about twenty shots a day and spend a few minutes on each one, looking through the screen and juggling your tripod, four 2350 rechargable batteries last for about a week.<br /><br />As for filters and accessory lenses, bah. There are wide-angle and telephoto add-on lenses, which require an adaptor, which has to be bought seperately. You will not purchase these, not ever, and they might as well not exist. Sadly Canon do not offer an M42 screw-mount adaptor.<br /><br />As for lag time, I can sense confusion in the other reviews. When you lightly press the shutter, the camera focuses and sets the exposure; when you press the shutter slightly more, it takes the picture after a delay of a fraction of a second. If it was a long exposure it then takes some time chuntering away, processing the image. If you therefore keep your finger on the shutter button, there is very little delay.","Have used digital cameras since 1992, and high-end SLRs earlier. This one a personal purchase with 512MB flash-card.<br /><br />Lenses-fantastic, with Nikon/Olympus close. Human/machine interface great- feels like a solid, quality camera. The boot-up computer bits good (contrast, some Nikons terrible). Great that can get optical zoom lense mount standard for A-series. Pictures- from great to average. Works with Windows and better with OSX.<br /><br />2MB great for photos, but more for poster- maybe and A85/90 etc.<br /><br />Overall, very happy, and transitioned from 35mm film to digital effortlessly. A G6 the next buy!","I've had this camera for a year and it's still a wonderful, sturdy point-and-shoot that's small enough to keep with me at all times. Key features:<br /><br />2.0 MEGAPIXELS<br />This camera was a gift and had I bought one myself, I probably would have upgraded to at least 4 MP. Turns out 2 is just fine. I've printed photos as large as 8 x 10 with no pixelating. Resolution is wonderful. Color is accurate and resolution is quite impressive for this price range.<br /><br />MACRO<br />The macro feature works amazingly well. For anyone needing sharp close-up photos, this camera delivers (perfect for Ebay sellers!!)<br /><br />USER-FRIENDLY<br />The interface is fairly intuitive, which makes this a good choice for those who would otherwise be uncomfortable with a digital camera. The viewfinder is bright and large enough to see what you're aiming at. Canon kept buttons to a minimum and its menu is easy enough to figure out without even reading the directions. I have family and friends who've spent twice the amount on a fancier camera, but they use it less because it's so confusing.<br /><br />LAG-TIME<br />This is one of the A60's biggest drawbacks. The lagtime on my camera can be as long as two seconds, which makes it hard to capture \"the moment.\" Within that time, the subject can close his/her eyes, move out of the frame, etc.<br /><br />VIDEO FEATURE<br />Shoots decent video, but of course, video's a memory hog, so be sure to have a bigger card (256MB minimum) or you'll be out of space quickly. Sound from 10 feet away is surprisingly good.<br /><br />SOFTWARE<br />The software is okay. I'm a Mac user and when I first got this, I used the Canon softare to view photos. Now that I'm using OSX, I exclusively use iPhoto, which is a profound improvement. Excellent organizational options, easy uploading for prints, and, true to Apple's nature, very user friendly.<br /><br />RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES<br />Digital cameras eat batteries. Though rechargeables are expensive, they are money savers in the end and they give the environment a break to boot. Well worth the added expense. Be sure to buy eight rechargeables. The camera takes four, and you'll always have four charging.","If you are looking for an amazing camera this is it!  After much thought and endless hours of research, I took the plunge and decided to buy this camera.  I have not been the least bit dissapointed.  It is fairly simple to use and the pictures look amazing.<br /><br />I have had this camera for six months now.  I take it everywhere.  My friends and family are completely sick of this camera.  There is a video mode on this camera which is wonderful!  Just point and shoot.  I take it out on our annual birthday dinners with the girls from work.  Which is something that you cannot do woth a camcorder.  This little bitty camera fits in my purse.<br /><br />Over the summer family was here from out of town and my uncle and cousin had both purchased the more expensive A70 model.  They didn't even know that they were using my camera.  They couldn't tell a difference between the a60 and the a70.  My uncle just used his usb cable and downloaded the pictures from my camera right onto his laptop.  They were equivilant to the photos he had taken with his more expensive model.<br /><br />Bottom line if you are looking for a digital camera buy this one now.  I have been amazed.  If you use yours half as much as I use mine, you will get your moneys worth.  The money you will save on film and developing alone will pay for this camera.<br /><br />Get it NOW.","I got this camera for christmas and it has been great for me. Let me tell you, my dad got a $900 Nikon digital that has been crapping out on him lately, and my Canon takes just as good pictures. It has plenty of good settings of which you can experiment and do fun things. Let me list out what I like about this camera...<br /><br />-Cheap!<br /><br />-Capable of shooting video (which is very fun)<br /><br />-Quick and easy for snap shots<br /><br />-Takes quality pictures<br /><br />-batteries keep going...and going... and going...<br /><br />-pictures aren't HUGE files on computer<br /><br />-small and convenient<br /><br />-the list goes on...<br /><br />The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because there is always something better in the technology realm. But trust me, this camera is great for just a fun little camera, I have had absolutely no problems. And best of all, it's a great deal!!! Check it out!","I thought I died and went to photo heaven.<br /><br />After messing around with an Agfa Ephoto 307 for the last 5 years, what a pleasant surprise. And all that for a 124 Bucks.<br /><br />Now that is what I call a HelluvaBang.:-)<br /><br />After having replaced my POS Epson printer for the Canon i560 and was pleasntly surprised, I decided to purchase the A 60.<br /><br />More features than I will ever need.<br /><br />Of course, it helps to buy a bigger flash card (128mb cards are dirt cheap and will hold 400+ pictures, you need more, buy another card).<br /><br />Also rechargable batteries and a flash card reader, that still keeps you below 200 bucks.<br /><br />And customer service is great, friendly and knowledgable too.<br /><br />The only thing I ask of Canon, don't change owners or CUSTOMER SERVICE and you'll get my business for all things Canon.<br /><br />What a sweet little camera, thank you.","I bought this as a camera to keep in my car to have available when I go geocaching.  My main camera is (was) a Kodak LS443, and I wanted to leave that camera home for my wife to use for the normal kid shots.<br /><br />I haven't printed any pictures from the camera, but I've been very happy with the pictures it's taken.  The pictures actually look a lot better than my 4MP Kodak.<br /><br />I was used to the washed out images I got when using the Kodak's flash.  This isn't a problem with the Canon's.<br /><br />Since my Kodak recently died, I'm thinking about replacing it with the Canon A95 in this same family line.","Well, I have had my camera now for 12 months and still have not encountered any probs yet. I am so impressed with the funtionality and picture results from this little wonder. I thought about upgrading to a newer one , but I am actually very satisfied with the resolution compared to other 3 and 4 megapixel cameras. Some camera's will have bugs just like cars and other mechanical items. The error 18 comes up (I researched this) from the zoom lens not fuctioning because it is physically broken (being dropped onto a hard surface) this camera as well as any electronic product must be handled with care (hand strap). As far as grainy or dark pics, get to know the camera, the flash range is only 8 feet like most other built in flashes. Learn to use the other features to compensate for non optimal shooting situations, practice, practice, practice. Oh, and a can of compressed air works well to remove dust from the lcd screen and the lens, use periodically as you would on any camera for best results and satisfaction.","Love the camera, small and for the price take it any where. The down load to the computer was a snap.  The video worked just fine. Best buy.","I bought this camera to go on a 2-week vacation in Europe ( England and Switzerland ). I am extremely pleased with it's performance, especially the photo quality. I took 400 pictures using a 256 MB card, and only changed batteries once, even with my teenage daughters constantly reviewing their own work and having to display their photo's proudly to others. ( I used the eye viewer to save battery life )It worked perfectly every time, I was especially pleased with the natural lighting inside, especially in large areas such as churches. I  turned the flash off for most of these and they looked beautiful. When I got home I was impressed with the print quality produced by my new Canon i560 printer, even at 8x10 the photo's look totally  \"professional\". I am very pleased with the A60 and would highly recommend it for family snaps","This is my first digital camera. I did a lot of research and found this to have the best combination of features and control.<br /><br />This I bought in order to supplement my 35mm for quick travel photos and online auction product photos as well as giving my wife something she doesn't have to think about using.<br /><br />This is a tiny camera that you can take anywhere and get pictures instantly.<br /><br />It feels substantial in hand. It's stout and seems solid unlike cheap point and shoots.<br /><br />All the controls seem well positioned.<br /><br />It's simple to use just as a point and shoot, you can even overide its automatic exposure controls. It can display settings to overide like aperrature and shutter speed etc.<br /><br />It doesn't require film that has to be developed so it saves money (providing you have a computer). My wife wastes more pictures with film cameras so I REALLY save money. If you take pictures you don't like you simple delete them from memory.<br /><br />Speaking of memory you can get film cards that hold 100s of images. My 128mb card holds around 170ish. The card supplied with the camera holds around 40 or 50.<br /><br />I prefer composing my shots on the LCD screen. They say the batteries will wear out faster if you use that but I don't care, it's easier to see what I'm composing.<br /><br />Transfering images from camera to computer is very easy. The Included software makes it virtually automatic.<br /><br />One of the big issues that I wrestled with was how much digital resolution would be enough and what is too little.<br /><br />I also thought that cameras at this size where just glorified point-and-shoots. To some extent it's true but there's more use potential with these little digitals.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of the telephoto lenses on these little cameras. They're ment to give versatility but there's a tradeoff in image quality. How much? Maybe it's negligible but  I'd rather have a better quality lense that doesn't move than one that's more of a gimick.  Telephoto images from low quality lenses magnify the limits of the camera.<br /><br />I actually like the focal lengths of this camera. Suits me better for general photography. I usually keep it set on one focal length anyways which is just 105mm.<br /><br />Too my surprize 2 megapixels is fine! It's actually recommended but it does depend on what exactly you're looking for in term of print output size, if you're going to print. If not then you don't even need 2 megapixels just get 1 megapixel. If you limit yourself to online email, ebay and 5x7 prints it's perfect. You could go as much as 8x10 with some quality eduction. I'm told at that size, 8x10 that 3 megapixels would be better. I haven't and don't intend too so in my case it's overkill.<br /><br />Digital photo quality printers are giving people the need to print 8x10s. So again, if you want to go that size and really want a better image you could go to the A70@ 3 megapixels or the A80 is a 4 megapixels and frankly I'm not sure why. At that size not only are you limited by pixels but by the quality of the lens. I shoot all of my photos that may or may not be enlarged with a Nikon F3 35mm. I prefer taking pictures the old fashion way. Using different film, good lenses and controlling exposures manually. If I really wanted to take really great digital images then something at the higher end is in order with finer lenses but this little A 60 is in a different category with its own strengths.<br /><br />2 things that stand out that I don't like but have adapted too are the shutter lag and the USB cover. The time between when you push the shutter button and when the camera fires. So don't expect to catch exactly what you see in an instant thanks to the shutter lag.<br /><br />The rubber cover for the USB connection cord doesn't seem like something that's designed for a lot of use without having to be replaced down the road. It just doesn't seem like something that will survive rrepeated opening and closing. But so far so good after a year of use here.<br /><br />Overall I'm greatly surprized at the quality of this camera. It's a much better first digital camera than I expected and I use it often!","this was my first digital camera, and i've since graduated to a canon 10d.  the range of features really made it attractive to someone who takes the majority of shots at night or in low-light conditions.  while there are automatic settings to handle those conidition, it's a great way to learn how to get the best shot possible.  while start-up time is somewhat slow and consequitive shots can be slow, that's something you'll deal with on all digitals.  overall, i'm happy with the range of features and the versatility of the camera and would recommend it for any entry-level user.","The Canon A60 takes amazing pictures for an amazing price.  2MP is all you need if you plan on printing your photos on 4x6 paper, like most people do.  4MP is luxurious, but most people just keep the camera set on 2MP resolution anyway.<br /><br />I was excited to get creative with all the manual features on this camera.  I've only had this camera for a few hours, but there's so much room to go pro with it.  Manual focus, ISO, aperture are just a few of the things you can play with to take some really amazing pictures.  Even the point and shoot pictures are amazing.  The color is extremely vivid.<br /><br />One feature that I am very fond of is the Auto Focus system.  The camera automatically tries to figure out what you are focusing on, and enclosed that area with a box.  If the box doesn't appear where you want it to, then you know that you need to move or change the zoom if you want your pictures to come out clear and crisp.  It is a very intelligent feature.<br /><br />I give this camera 5 stars because, as this being my first digicam and I am only a beginner, it has a lot to offer.  And the price.  I'll admit the price is what made me buy this camera.  I'm going away to college, so naturally I have no money; this camera will be perfect on campus.","I have had the Canon Powershot A60 for about 11 months now, and have taken more than 6000 pictures. This camera has given me no problems at all. I have yet to have an E18 error, even after I dropped it from more than one metre onto hard cobblestone. The A60 was my first digital camera, and it was great to learn on, but if you get past the beginner stage upgrading would be recomended.<br />I came to this website before I bought the A60, and read all the good and bad things about this camera. So far the only bad thing I have come across is the ocassional soft focusing, but this is not a problem unless you want professional quality photographs.<br />BOTTEM LINE: This is an AWESOME digital camera for beginners.","I bought a canon power shot A60 from this seller and all I have to say is this company is the best company I have bought anything from I ordered the camera on 7 pm sunday night and I reseived it on Tuesday morning. That was really fast. I wish they would of sent it without needing signing for it. But I know its more secure. I just think there great ++++++++++++++++","I got this as a Chirstmas gift last year and it's been working well to me. It looks nice for both men and women. However, the CF card coming with the camara is too small and I needed to buy a 128 M to replace the 16 M one.","I bought a Canon Elph 2 years ago and have been pretty pleased with it.  The Canon cameras seem to keep getting better and better.  I just bought the PowerShot A60 as a group present for my friend leaving to teach in Korea for 3 years.  It was so nice being able to use the camera right out of the box and using it at the party instead of having to let the battery charge for a few hours.  The portrait feature works great and the shutter speed feature worked well too.  My friend went to the local electronic store where they tried to get him to buy a camera with a lot of mega pixels, but 2MP is sufficient.  The zoom capacity is definitely more important then having 3 or 4 MP if you are just making 4x6 & 5x7 prints.  I highly recommend this camera and you can't beat the price.","You can take this camera right from the box, set it on auto, and take great pictures. Like to experiment... Set it up for partial, or FULL manual control.  You even get decent video with sound!  For 90% of folks, 2 MP is plenty, especially when they are QUALITY MP's like this camera has.<br />Picture processing is quick, and pictures look great, with little noise.  Nice plus is it takes cheap AA batteries (get a charger) and uses Compact Flash cards... Easy to get and cheap!  This camera is so feature rich, you will learn something new every time you use it.<br />Yes, the shutter lag at times is very long (especially in low light even with AF assist), and the flash indoors is at times  weak, but the positives FAR outweigh the negatives.  You have so much control, you can manually make many of these issues, non-issues.  I took 1600+ shots the first week I owned it because of all the options you have to play with. For the price here at Amazon, w/free shipping, Buy 2!","Overall, I am very impressed with the camera, but I have one big warning.  I managed to accidentally delete all the pictures on the compact flash card.  You could say, \"nothing is foolproof, given a sufficiently talented fool\" and you'd be right, but I still think better security would help here.  In my other digital camera, when I attempt to clear the memory card, it prompts me by saying something like, \"you are about to delete all your pictures.  Are you sure you want to do this?\"  You then hit the \"yes\" button or the \"no\" button.  In this case, in fiddling around with the camera, I came upon the \"format card\" command (which clears out all the pictures)and hit the button before I realized what I had done.  Goodbye to 70+ pictures!  Shame on me, to be sure, but there was no prompt to confirm that I really wanted to do this.  I also think it speaks to the controls being a bit toooo complicated that I managed to pull off this manuver.  Bottom line, I should have been more careful, but Canon could also help make sure that I didn't pay so dearly for such a mistake.","I purchased this camera for my dad for Father's Day.  I did a lot of background research before settling on this model.  This camera received rave reviews from pros and casual users alike.  I needed a camera that would be very simple to use, yet had enough features that one can grow into them once they became more familiar with digital photography.  Also the price on this camera was very reasonable (around $150 dollars) so you couldn't really go wrong.  In addition, this camera uses compactflash memory card (the most widely used with the highest storage capacity of all the cards out there) and uses common AA batteries rather than a proprietary one, which could be a headache to replace.<br />My dad is relatively averse to new technology, so I knew I needed to get a camera that does not need loads of adjustments to use.  When I took this camera out of its box, I was surprised at how nice it felt in my hand. It has overall sturdy construction with pleasing silver finish.  Also the zoom is easy to use and layout of the controls is very intuitive.  Let me say it took me only about 15-20 minutes to give my dad a crash lesson on how to use this equipment and that's saying a lot.  I did not teach him the advanced controls of course, but he was happy with the user-friendly controls.  I did not have to read the entire manual (quite thick by the way) to learn the general controls, which is a big plus.<br />Now the reason for the 4 stars.  First of all, if you are new to digital photography, make sure you buy a set of rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries (over 2000mA would be preferable; higher rating means it will last longer, the range is from around 1500mA to 2400mA for AA batteries).  This camera comes with regular AAs which won't last more than 50 shots.  Also the battery door was flimsy and somewhat tricky to operate.  The accessories panel on the left side of the camera is rubber and also looks flimsy.  Lastly, I had to purchase the camera case from Canon separately, and I strongly believe you need this to protect the camera.  So two flimsy doors and missing case gives this camera 4 stars, but those are minor details to many.<br />If you are looking for good entry-level camera out there don't hesitate and settle on the Canon A60.  It has crisp pics, great controls, and bargain price.  Don't get carried away by all those 5-megapixel jargon..... it doesn't always reflect the overall quality of the camera.","Forget about high megapixel and high-priced cameras.  This camera has all you could want and I could not be happier with it.  I make incredible 5x7 prints that put film camera prints to shame.  The A60 can be a simple point and shoot camera or let you take manual control of aperture, shutter, ISO, white balance, etc if you want to.  It uses CF memory which is very cheap (256 mb card holds 247 pictures at the highest resolution and costs around $40.00).  It also uses AA batteries which are cheap and available everywhere.  Get NiMH rechargeables for longer life.  I have had a few digital cameras over the years and the A60 is the best and also the cheapest.  Go figure.  I think this camera is being discontinued as higher megapixel cameras are becoming more popular.  Don't be fooled by the hype.  This camera does it all at a great price.","This is an excellent camera to get started with digital photography. 2.0MP is enought to print clear 5 X 7 prints (maybe larger... I haven't tried yet). The camera's battery life is good using quality brand AA batteries (standard alkaline or rechargable). There are several shooting modes; including a long-exposure mode such that you can take pictures at night if you have a tripod. However, the automatic shooting mode is good enough that you can use it for 99% of your pictures, thus you won't have to fiddle with settings if you're timid or not as knowledgeable about photography. It will take good pictures day or night, inside or out. The only disappointing feature is the limited optical zoom. Regardless, if you're a bit familiar with Photoshop or similar software, you can crop and edit your photos if the framing or the zoom wasn't quite what you wanted when you took the picture. I highly recommmend getting a 256MB (or greater) high-speed CF memory card. I upgraded my camera with a 45X 256MB CF card (Transcend USA); which allows me to take over 400 photos and/or *lots* of continuous video (thanks to the speed of the new CF card). Connects to Macs easily and works well with iPhoto. I'm looking forward to purchasing another product from Canon when I have the money to do so!","having had this camera for about 3 months now for the money, especially in the UK. It is a bargin. I think that this particular model is now discontiuned which explains that in the UK it's price has gone up by 25%.","I'm going to buy this camera I used a camera like this for a few months, I can say that this device is amazing the zoom is ok.<br />The sound of the video is really clear. It's easy to use the menu. I have an 1 GigaByte Flash card. But does it support 1 gb card ?<br />  Send the answer to :  felipecf@superig.com.br<br /> Thank you.","i bought this camera a few months ago and i love it!! it is great quality, takes great pictures and is very dependable. ive dropped the camera a bunch of times and it doesnt break.. and its supercute","This camera replaced a Kodak DC280 that I left behind on a bus. Its a good size and fits easily into my hand. The A60 uses AA batteries that are easy to obtain (both alkaline and rechargable). The quality of the photographs is excellent, sharp and with no noticable distortion. The numerous features are fun to play with.<br />However, the controls are a bit complicated. Perhaps that is because there are so many features, but it took me a while to find my way around and it still does not seem nearly as intuititive as the Kodak was. There is also a slight delay between when the shutter is pressed and when the picture is actually taken. Finally, the optical viewfinder is not accurate, the only way to make sure of the framing is to use the LCD. These are minor gripes. Overall I am very happy with this camera.","Just one sentence: excellent camera, top quality, no problems.<br />2Mb pixels is definitely enough in my opinion.","This camera has given me no problems. The software that comes with it is great as well. I highly recommend it! My friends from work have to buy for themselves too after seeing how this little machine works. It gives good video (3 mins with awesome sound) unlike other expensive cameras that does not really capture good sound.","Since there are already plenty of positive reviews, I will focus on the few lacks of this camera.<br />- Impossible to record the \"date picture taken\" on the image.<br />(Trying to pass for professional camera? :) Many simplier models have this useful feature).<br />- Zoom lever is not most conveniently located. It would be easier if it was on the back of the camera.<br />- Navigation buttons look strange being round instead of arrow shaped. This is changed in Power Shot A80.<br />- Power on/off button is easy to be accidentally activated. Sliding type would greatly decrease the chances.<br />-Every time the camera is turned on, a lot of energy is used to mechanically extend the telescopic lenses. If they were fixed with attachable cap, battery performance could be improved; size, however, would definitely suffer. Reliability of lenses moving motors is naturally limited, which possibly could be the the cause for the famous Error 18.<br />-Ergonomics.  \"Set\" button, could be better positioned somewhere near the side navigation buttons - on the right, as set up on most cameras.<br />-Camera also doesn't come with sufficient memory card and reliable battery/charger, requiring spending additional money on accessories. This is, however, what keeps the price at its level.<br />-Side rubber cover can break if used repeatedly over a long period of time. Design could be more reliable if the cover would open freely.<br />-Very important issue - batteries have to be removed every time they need to be charged, which places great strain on the plastic battery cover that would eventually break with extensive use. Cameras that enable batteries to be charged without removing them, greatly exceed the durability in the long period of use.<br />-Plastic tripod thread, less durable compared to metal ones.<br />Despite all the listed cons, this is a very modern camera with superior image quality and outstanding set of features and controls. I am very pleased with PowerShot A60 so far and would not hesitate to recommend it to many photo enthusiasts.","Since there are already plenty of positive reviews, I will focus on the few lacks of this camera.<br />- Impossible to record the \"date picture taken\" on the image.<br />(Tribute to being a pro-camera?

If you're looking for a good inexpensive digital camera...this is it!!","I am very happy with this camera being my first digital camera. It's easy to use and the aperture function is very good if you can't use the flash (just keep the camera very steady!). I have one recommendation, get the rechargeable batteries that canon recommends only! I purchased the monster rechargeable batteries and when the batteries have no more juice, it just shuts off with no warning. When I use regular batteries, there is a low battery indicator that comes on but not when I use the rechargeable batteries. I have yet to purchase the canon batteries but I would think that it would be compatible.","This camera is a great buy!  I am very fussy about quality and I found myself very pleased with this camera. I was pleasantly surprised. A super camera at a very good price!!","The biggest problem I have with this otherwise perfect camera is its relatively low resolution LCD screen.  It isn't bad in general, but problem comes when sometimes the camera's auto-focus doesn't work properly, which is the nature of being \"auto.\"  You take a picture, and it looks ok on the LCD.  But when you come home and transfer the picture to your computer, you find out it's out of focus!  If I had waited a bit longer, I would have opted for the A75, not for the 3M pixel sensor but for the higher resolution LCD.  Another minor problem is the \"low battery\" indicator.  Once it starts blinking, you can get only three or four more photos before the batteries actually die.  Wish it can give more advance notice.","This camera is totally cool! Till now, its working really good. Im liking the features and everything, except ...<br />-The batteries: I took 3 pics WITH flash, then the \"Low Battery\" indicator appeared.<br />-The flash: If you don't use flash when taking pics, their quality would be average.<br />-Shaking: Try to keep your hand still when taking pics, otherwise, you'll get the blurriest pics EVER. Even with flash.<br />Im searching for rechargeable batteries, but i cant find any now. And im totally broke. So im gonna wait a while.<br />Hoping this review would help!","The quality and sharpness of pictures produced by this camer is great. The thing that really blows me away is the number of manual options this thing lets you have control over. Check out this gallery at [...] to see what this camera is capable of. This is a simple camera to use and will take great pictures if you want it simple and leave it in auto mode, but thanks to all the manual features this camera is great for the beginner or the aspiring amateur photographer. Great camera. Loses a star cause i dont find it comfortable to hold. Hands down the most comfortable camer to hold in one hand is the Nikon 2100/3100.","Keep in mind that I am a newbie photographer.  When I started out with this camera I knew nothing about aperture sizes and shutter speeds.  The best thing about this camera is that if you know absolutely ZERO about taking pictures just switch to \"auto\" mode and snap away.  If you want to take pictures at night and want full control of the cameras aperture and shutter speed switch to \"M\" and it's all you.  I compared this cam against the Nikon 2100 and Sony DPS-72.  The Nikon didn't have an AF illuminator which makes it hard to focus under dark conditions and had a horrible menu system.  The Canon has a 5 point auto focus sytem which basically makes the camera bulletproof against taking a bad picture.  The Sony, like all Sony products, overemphasizes reds and doesn't fit in your hand like the A60 does.  With the Canon all you need is one hand to hold the camera.  Another great thing about this camera is the battery consumption.  With the LCD off this thing can take pictures all day long!! Literally!!  Many will say this camera can be a bit \"soft\" in detail but I disagree.  In full manual mode pictures can be razor sharp if you adjust your aperture and shutter speed accordingly.  Did I mention this camera \"feels\" like a real machine and not a toy?  That's also something no other camera under $200 can boast.  Now for the negatives.  Red eye can be a problem but amost all cameras have problem with red eye.  It's not really a biggie considering you can easily fix red eye in software.  Also because it's a 2 Megapixel camera printed images are only sharp up til 5 x 7 inch image size.  But the 3.2 Megapixel A70 is $100 more which is what the memory card, tripod, and battery/case kit add up to.  If you're going to be printing 8 x 10's go with the A70.  The accesories I recommend are the Canon battery/charger/case kit, and extra 128MB flash card which should hold about 120 pictures at the highest quality setting, and a tripod.  This camera also has a \"stitch-assist\" mode that lets you take panorama pictures and meld them together very easily.  It's nice to have the tripod for stitch assist because you don't want the height to change between frames.  Happy shooting!!!","Those of us who do what we think of as \"serious\" photography often find ourselves caught up in the quest for more and more megapixels. Is 4 enough? 5? 12? Certainly if you're trying to produce exhibition-quality 8x10s and 11x14s you need as many pixels as you can stuff into a camera. But 90% of what I photograph never makes it to print; most of it goes on the web. And for the 72 dpi images that your web browser likes to display, 2MP is more than enough.<br />There are a lot of 2MP cameras out there, as it's a perfect size for web, email and the 4x6 prints that are a standard for familay snapshots. It's a very competitive area pricewise, too. The A60 caught my for a number of reasons, not the least of which was my previous good expreience with my Canon G2:<br />1. It takes AA batteries. Dedicated rechargeables are expensive, and there's no assurance you'll be able to get replacements a few years down the line. But rechargeable AAs are common and inexpensive.<br />2. Manual controls. The A60 has nearly the same range of manual controls as my G2 or the newer G5. About the only thing it doesn't have is provision for off-camera flash.<br />3. Video. It'll take video clips in a choice of resolutions<br />4. Availability of underwater housing. You can get an underwater housing for almost all the Canons (the exception being, oddly enough, the semi-pro G series). I'm not a diver, but I do like to take cameras out kayaking and hiking in all sorts of weather. Until now I've used a Nikonos or *very* carefull taken my digital camera out of its protective case to take a few quick shots.<br />5. Image quality. Canon has consistently been one of the top names for digital image quality, along with Nikon, Fuji and (to a lesser extent) Minolta.<br />6. Ergonomics: It fits the hand nicely, with all the controls right where you need them. The viewfinder is sharp and clear.<br />6. Price. All this comes at a price that is amazingly low when compared to the competition.<br />In summary: An excellent value with excellent image quality and excellent ergonomics that will handle all the imaging needs of most people. You really can't go wrong buying one.","I just love this camera.  I've had it for 3 weeks now and it has been wonderful.  The prints I've had made were good, they compare to my older 35mm.  I mostly just send pics electronically to grandparents and take pictures for scrapbooking. I love how versatile the camera is for it's price. The video is actually better than I thought it would be.  I am on my second set of batteries now (go rechargeable!!) but I have taken hundreds of pictures and about 20 videos in that time.  If anyone is looking for a good inexpensive digital camera for scrapbooking and friends, this is a good choice.","I'm writing this review maybe 20 minutes into owning and operating my A60, to provide some very out-of-box feedback for anyone looking for a \"first impression\" of the camera. And yes, this review is definately for casual photographers and starters.<br />-2 megapixels? Not a problem. I've already snapped quite a few pictures, and I'm pretty pleased with the quality. As stated, our family's other digital is 3megs, and there's not much difference. I'm keeping it in highest resolution (1600x1200 Superfine), and at this resolution a 64 meg card will hold 61 pictures- which is more than I'm going to need at one time. Not to mention the camera itself comes with a spare 16meg card if you haven't gotten one for it. On our refridgerator we have word magnets (not much larger print than the text you're reading). I took a picture from across my kitchen and was able to read them off the image (note that this was in max quality). Unless you want to blow up portions of images or print off wall-size posters... this camera seems to have enough quality for most applications. If you're comparing cameras and the difference between numbers can save you some money, go with this one.<br />-Software: With a few exceptions, it can be said that digital imaging devices tend to come with horrible software. For someone like me who has a little knowledge of photo editing, most all image programs perform the one necessary task- getting images off the camera and onto the computer. I personally probably won't even try the onboard software since I already have a means to edit and share my photos. If you really haven't ever edited photos before, then using the prepackaged software might be your only choice. And if you're a very casual user, the onboard software is probably going to do everything you need it to do. But if you have any software at all that you enjoy using for editing photos, it probably has an Import feature to get your pictures for you. Stick to that.<br />-Overall saisfaction: All I was looking for was a replacement for the countless instant cameras I've gone through with my fiancee. What I got was a smart little camera that's more than worth what you pay. The assortment of features also makes it obvious that there's plenty of room to grow if you ever want to learn the finer arts of adjusting your pictures. With the excellent price, relatively simple startup, and overall quality, this camera is definately perfect for a beginner- while still having a little room for the more advanced photographer.","If you're reading this review, you're probably like me, a novice user buying his first digicam. And like me, after having read and re-read reviews of several dozen cameras, this camera keeps showing up your short list.  Still, there's so many options out there you keep obsessing about making the right choice. I finally decided to take the plunge and order this camera, and I'm amazed how correct my choice was.<br />Here were my main areas of concern while I was trying to decide on whether to buy this camera (they'll probably sound familiar) and how my actual experience stacked up against my concerns:<br />1. \"Low\" resolution of 2 Megapixels:<br />Unless you plan to blow your shots up to poster-size, 2MP is ideal. Don't get caught up in the \"my MP is bigger than yours\" race, as another reviewer said 2MP is the sweet spot for photos. Just leave the camera at its max settings and it's perfect, the file size is reasonable yet you'll still get every amazing detail. For example, I took a shot of my cat and you can see every hair and every whisker, even a little bit of \"sleepy stuff\" in the corner of her eye since she had just woken up from her nap.  And this was just the third shot I took after removing it from the box. Yes, it's that good.<br />2. \"Not enough zoom\":<br />I'll admit, this was a huge issue for me. I was bound and determined that i wanted a camera with a higher zoom capability, like one of the Olympus 10x models. But actually having gotten a chance to use it, i've found the zoom capability, while nice, isn't the holy grail I thought it would be. Certainly not enough to spend a couple hundred dollars more to get.<br />3. Size -<br />The photos make the camera look tiny. I thought it might be better to get a bigger camera with big Tonka-toy buttons and that it would be easier to handle. Don't worry, the camera feels great in my hands, and i'm over six feet with big stubby fingers. I'm sure it will fit your hands just fine as well.<br />4. Other competing models in the Canon line:<br />This was another problem area. The A-series and G-series cameras all seem so good, that i wanted badly to get one of the more fully-featured (and expensive) models like the A80 or G5 to make sure i wasn't missing out on anything. And looking back now, most of the features I thought would make a huge difference don't seem to matter now. What seems important to you now when you're trying to make a buying decision probably won't be when you're actually out there using the camera. Out in the field, you'll want something which is relatively straight-forward and not tediously complex, but flexible enough to change a setting if absolutely necessary.  This camera offers exactly that.<br />Trust me, when you're out in a picture taking environment, you're not going to be telling yourself (or wanting to tell your photo subjects), \"hold on for a couple minutes while I put on the wide-angle lens.\"<br />5. Controls and the learning curve:<br />For a novice, the controls look a bit intimidating.  And they can be, if you don't read the manual at all or spend any time going through the settings.  But thankfully, the camera controls are well set-up, intuitive, and easy to learn.  Yes, you can start shooting straight out of the box, but if you spend as little as 15-30 minutes reading how to operate the controls before you begin, it'll be well-worth your time.  That won't be enough to learn everything the camera can do, but is enough to get you started on the right foot, and will put you weeks or months ahead of the game.  I spent about 20 minutes learning about my camera after I got it, and my first pictures already looked better than the ones my father takes with his Canon G5 that he's owned nearly a year but never bothered to read the manual for.<br />THE BAD:<br />Shutter lag is perhaps my biggest gripe.  Depressing the shutter fire button half-way focuses the camera, then depressing it the rest of the way fires the shutter.  There's a brief but noticeable lag between depressing the button and the photo being taken, perhaps a half-second or so.  Not a huge issue, but sometimes annoying, and can definitely get frustrating if you're trying to get just the right shot of a non-cooperative subject.  Like with my cat, I'd wait for the exact moment when she was looking at me, I'd press the button, and the lag meant that she was no longer looking at the camera when the photo actually gets captured.  I'm sure it would be more of the same if you were trying to take photos of an infant or child.  Not a deal-breaker, but it can make for some frustration.<br />Inserting batteries in the dark can be a pain, unless you have memorized the pattern for which batteries go in which direction.  Again, not a huge issue, but can be frustrating.<br />CONCLUSION:<br />If you're trying to decide between the A60 and either another manufacturer's offering or another Canon A-series,  get this camera.  This is a better camera than the competing Nikon, etc. and if you're thinking you'll need the additional features or MP of a more expensive model, you likely won't. If you did, you'd know that already and wouldn't be looking at this camera. So save your money and get this instead, it will MORE than meet and surpass your needs.  You'll be very happy you did.  I already have my Dad thinking she should switch cameras with me, and considering his costs about triple what mine did, that tells you that this little gem is a winner.","I think Canon are about to phase out this camera, but that makes it cheap.<br />I am a long-time Canon SLR user, yes my SLR is 24 years old, I am still putting my foot in the water as far as digicams are concerned. I am also, unfortunately, on a very tight budget, and this is my third digital camera. I wanted to use the camera to get pics for my website, so I would reduce them to 800x600 anyway, so I figure a 2MB should be OK. The main reason for getting a 3MB camera is that you can crop the results. I was a bit worried about the long time it takes to take a picture (according to the serious reviews), but in fact I did not find this to be a problem. I am not into action photography, but for those of you who are, the A70 is faster.<br />Pros:<br />Full of features (P, Tv, Av, M etc, etc), even has an output to the TV. The manual does not explain these features, so I tended to stick with program mode.<br />Not too small and the controls are nice, it does take 4 batteries, but that is OK with me.<br />Five zone focussing system, impressed by that.<br />AF assist meaning that you can focus in the dark, loved that<br />Good colour rendition, nice that. Exposure was perfect.<br />View finder zooms, this is important for composing an image in full sun because the LCD monitor is hard to see with the sun behind you.<br />Good battery life, I got 175 shots with alkalines, the current rechargeable NI-MH batteries will give you at least twice that.<br />Lens is covered up when camera switch off, important to keep the dust out.<br />Takes nice indoor flash pics, as long as the autofocus system grabs hold of the subject you get fantastic shots, if it does not be prepared for an out of focus shot. On average 4 out of five flash shots were very good.<br />Uses compact flash memory which is cheap (you need a 64 or 128 MB card)<br />A 64MB card will take 60 pics in superfine and 120 in fine mode at 1600x1200<br />Can stitch pictures together to get a panorama shot.<br />As a SLR user there was a reassuring 'click' when it takes a picture.<br />There are wide-angle and zoom accessories, I like landscape photography.<br />Cons:<br />Images could not pick up the detail of difficult subjects like a leafless tree in winter or berries on a bush or tiles on a roof. This was using ISO 50 and superfine mode on a sunny winter day.<br />Lens only goes to F8 which means that using shutter speed priority a bit difficult.<br />Cannot focus easily on a bush (probably the same on most AF cameras).<br />I knew the image processing software was [bad], but I use Thumbs Plus software, so I do not care.<br />For the money, you get a lot of bang for the buck. I was pleased at the indoor shots using flash, my dad came out great and so did the books in my bookcase (these were stunning, better than my SLR). But, I was quite disappointed at the lack of detail in some difficult outdoor subjects, and this is where the rubber hits the road. Unfortunately, I cannot compare it to other digicams (Olympus C-350, Sony DSC-P72), so I do not know whether the lack of detail is due to the lens or the sensor, I suspect the former.<br />The bottom line for me is that this cheap digicam produces better pictures for my website than my SLR, because by the time I have converted film or slides to jpg files, I lose so much quality, that I am better off with a cheap digicam.<br />Overall, it is amazing value for money and Amazon was the cheapest, but you know that anyway.<br />Digital cameras do not do miracles, you still need good lighting to get good results. ...","This is my second digital camera that I own. The first one was Powershot A100 which was great which died after 3 years of usage. A60 is truely an excellent camera for its price range, and whats more, it can use additional lens though I'm still saving to buy one \"quite expensive even for third party lens\". The image is crystal clear with slight saturation if taken with night shot. However, as I'm colour blind, you guys cant take my words seriously. The buttons is placed perfectly unless you have small hands. Yes, it is big but I find it is much easier to handle especially to take a stable shot without flash \"I have big hands\".<br />I used 2000 nimh rechargeble battery and would you believe that it lasted till about 890 shots with LCD on. !!!!! Oh my that is great as compared to my old A100 which only lasted till 200 shots with LCD on.<br />Thats all!!!","After receiving and returning 2 other digital cameras from Vivitar, I did my homework for a couple of months and finally decided on the Canon A60. Wow, am I ever glad I did! What a terrific camera. Many of the somewhat dissatisfied reviews I have read have been mostly unfounded. Many problems owners have with the camera can be easily solved or answered by reading the instruction book! Take the time to do this! For the price, this digital camera packs a bundle of great features and it's a great camera to grow with. The auto setting gives terrific results and as one grows and expands their photographic expertise, there are plenty of manual controls to experiment and fiddle around with. This is a marvelous choice for a beginning digital camera user which gives near professional results! Remember, do your homework before you buy ... don't pass this one up ... and read the manual!!!","This is an excellent camera.  I have the Powershot A60 and have worked a bit with the A70.  The only difference on these cameras is that the A70 has more megapixels, other than that they are THE SAME.  The cameras offer various features, each with several different ways to manipulate the camera, including shutter speed and aperture.  For the beginner, it offers a few preset options that allow a quick switch to the desired need of the user.  The manual is very clear and easy to apply.  I would recommend this camera to someone wanting a point and click camera, as well as a more advanced person desiring some control of the camera.<br /><br />This camera has optional shutter speeds of up to 15 seconds, which I like to use with streams and other pictures involving water.  The speed has its highest shutter speed at 1/2000 of a second, which I haven't yet had success with, but will have fun playing with (it needs to be really bright for this).  I haven't yet played with the aperture, but it seems like it will be fun to play with as well.<br /><br />If you are wondering if you need 3 MP (A70), consider what you want to do with the pictures.  I would recommend a 3 MP if you want to do some cropping or want to blow up pictures greater than 5x7.  I simply use my A60 just for 4x6 and looking at pictures on my computer, which it does an excellent job of.<br /><br />I would recommend getting either a 128 or a 256 Mb compactflash card (cards used in these cameras) in addition to this camera (runs between $40 and $70), because the camera only comes with a 16 Mb card, which holds about 15-20 pictures.  I personally prefer Lexar's 12x or higher cards.  Get rechargable batteries!!!  Amazon's prices seems to be the cheapest for both cameras and compactflash cards (or within a couple bucks of other places).<br /><br />I would highly recommend either the Powershot A60 or A70 to anyone that wants a digital camera because of the versatility offered.<br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />Update:<br />I have now had my Powershot A60 for over two years, and it is still functioning despite the serious abuse I have dealt to it. The camera has been dropped numerous times and has also taken a tumble down a 20 foot rocky steep hill (I thought it was a goner after that one). It has endured backpacking, rock climbing, and general outdoor adventures with me, and although its casing shows many scraps, dents, and scratches, the camera's functionality is beyond all of my expectations. The only problems that have developed is that the LCD seems to be dying slowly and about 20% of in-door poorly lit shots turn out grainy and have horizontal lines (all of which occurred after that major tumble, so I expect that is the cause); that is, 80% of in-door shots still look great. At the prices you can find this camera at around the internet, it is an awesome intro and general use digital camera, and with the low price, you can even pick one up for your kid (since it is now so cheap -- look elsewhere than Amazon). Anyways, I am looking to pick up a second one of these for the inevitable event that I completely destroy this sturdy camera.<br /><br />Also, in its 2 years of use, I can honestly say that I have not found a single time where I truly needed more than my 2 MP to get a great shot. I have taken this camera to the Canadian Rockies, to the Western Caribean, and all over the western US, and of all of the pictures I have, I don't see a true need for a higher megapixel than 3 MP (mine is 2 MP) or zoom (3x), unless you need a camera for your profession.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Second update (July 17th, 2006)<br /><br />Still going strong. It's been dropped again onto asphalt and still works. There are occasional pictures that have lines across them, but I think this is due to the number of times its been dropped (and most pictures are still perfectly clear).<br /><br />----------------------------<br />Last Update (Dec 14th, 2006)<br /><br />Well, I dropped it one too many times. I've gotten another camera. I definitely was happy to purchase another Canon (A530).","I needed camera within 300$ with possibility of manual control, resolution enough to print 10x15cm, 3x zoom, video with sound recording. After my 2-month investigation I've chosen Canon A60.<br />This camera provides all of this. CompactFalsh memory card is very reliable, fast and most cheeper comparing with other flash memory standarts. Personally I don't like Fuji/Olympus xD cards, because they are motiveless expensive and readable only by the camera (unlike CompactFlash which can be inserted in virtually any cardreader).<br />This camera is reliable, it has elaborate design, not bad LCD display. All pictures I store in maximum resolution and minimal compression. It is nice that this camera \"super fine\" compression quality  (minimal compression) produce no visible JPEG artifacts, almost like TIFF.<br />Weaknesses of this camera: The quality of pictures not good enough. Sunny pictures are really good.  But I think any camera in this price-range will have similar color noise. Only ISO 50 and 100  are suitable, other modes produce noisy pictures. I never use AUTO mode. Instead I predefined P-mode with my favorite settings or Av-mode. Along the edges pictures sometimes are a little bit blackouted. But this drawback is typical for compact camera designs. Quality of video mode is average (both video and sound suck). And as already was mentioned, the battery life indicator is absolutely stupid. After it becomes blinking you can take only 2-3 pictures. There is no way to forecast and plan recharge. Canon, what happened?! May first cell phone had much more informative indicator for the same type of acc batteries. Shame on you!<br />It upset me to learn that you cannot upload any files on this camera, unlike Sony and many other cameras. Software (for me as software developer) is not perfect too: it is good-looking but not very handy and intuitive. At least for windows user. I admit it is more friendly to Mac users. I think software is not a strong point of Canon. Its a pity, seems like they are trying to save on software.<br />Summary. This is not bad camera for my 270$ spent on it. I like that it has manual controls (although I rare use this feature) and use of CompactFlash memory. For point-and-shoot men and others who dosn't consider these as advantages I recommend to consider other brands. Sony P72 and newer clones may fit you better.","Just got back from my holidays and I took this with me. What a delightful surprise. I downloaded my pictures two days ago and they are all bright and crisp with great colours. For a beginner, this is a great little camera at a decent price that will meet all your expectations. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a digital camera to start with.","I began buying this camera when it came down in price for the company I work for. We take on average 75-100 photos per day and not only ease of use, but battery life is important. This product has a great battery life from the users I have spoken with and am glad I got this instead of continuing with the A300.<br />As for the E18 error messages, folks, I've researched this on Google and all I can find are customers complaining about this error message. Go to Canon Support site and look it up. It just means you have too much pressure on the lens. Which of course means now I'm part of the google search! hee hee..","I received this camera as a gift for Christmas and I couldn't have asked for a better camera. This one is great. I wasn't to sure I was going to be able to use it because it looked a little too high-tech for me. After messing with it for a few hours I got the hang of it. It's also very helpful to read the booklet it comes with. It came with a 16mb memory card but that should be replaced becuase 16mb isn't too much storage Overall it's a great camera and i suggest it for beginners and people with experience.","I received this camera as a gift, and couldn't have picked a better one.  I don't know much about cameras, but it is very easy to use and takes great pictures.  My fiance is more technical with it and knows the different settings it has for the different pictures you can take, and it works really well.  He's taken some great shots of people & things in the dark, lit up, or from a distance, using the different lighting and speed settings on the camera.  Very user-friendly and easy to learn!","I purchased the Canon A60 for my son to use while he travelled on a 6 month visit to America. All went really well with the camera and we were very pleased with the quality of the photos and the performance of the camera. That was until he arrived back in Australia. Two days later we got the E18 error message. The lens would not retract and the camera is inoperable. To make matters worse when I checked the warranty, Canon offer only a limited warranty that is only effective in the country of purchase. This limited warranty was not obvious to us on purchase. We now have to mail the camera back to the US to have it fixed. Not only are we left without our camera but we will also have the expense of the postage. This error is well documented on the internet and seems to be a common fault with this camera.","I baught last years version of this camera the A40, in December 2002. I love it. These cameras are easy to use for beginners and let you take control with manual features if you want. the included softwarwe is good, downloading pictures to your PC could not be much easier. The camera's size is not as small as other competing models but it fits in your hands well and is easier for me to handle than some of the smaller ones I tried out at stores.<br />This years model (the A60) has a lower price and bigger memory card than The model I got last year (A40) so to me its more of a good thing for less.<br />That aside there are some things that I recomend you buy to go with this camera. First is rechargable batteries. You get more time out of them than alkilyne batteries and they are cheaper in the long run. Buy two sets if you plan to take a lot of pics.<br />Second is a larger capicity memory card, 16Mb will not hold that many photos at high res. I reecomend a 128Mb card or 256Mb card.<br />Also get a nice camera bag to keep your camera, batteris and memory cards in. I got a bag that hold my battery charger too, nice if you go away for more than a few days the charger is handy if needed.","I recently bought this product and I can't say enough about it! I really think that the zoom lense really makes up for the lower mega pixels! I know that I tried out a few with higher mega pixels and I think that this camera has a better picture. Trust me I think  you'll love it too!!!!!!!!1","One of these days,  I'll be just as good with Aperture Priority-shooting on this digital camera as I am with my Canon SLR,  but there's no need to hurry.  In all-automatic mode, this A60 is great!!! The Canon lens is superb.  Pictures I took of my Siberian husky on the lawn showed in excellent detail my dog's blue eyes, whiskers and fur, plus the green strands of grass of the lawn.  The metering-, flash and other electronic systems are superb.  Indoors inside the house, and indoors at a restaurant... the camera performed very well with perfectly (flash-)illuminated and focused pictures. It was also easy to review pictures taken and deleting those I didn't care for.  Using the USB to copy files onto the hard drive was straightforward.<br />I bought 8 NIMH-rechargeable batteries plus charger as well as an AC-adapter. ( I shouldn't have bought the AC-adapter;  the rechargeable long-life NIMH batteries are sufficient.) I also bought a Simpletech 128MB CF card since the CF card that came with the camera was good only for a handful of shots. The 128MB-CF card will go a long way since I've started taking 1-megapixel pictures.  [ 1MP pictures are easier to send via email]  I've also used the picture \"editor\" software for cropping and to reduce red-eye; learning how to do these things was easy.<br />I am extremely pleased and I highly recommend the Canon A60. Picture-quality is superb;  the menu system is straightforward and user-friendly. The more-commonly used options are easy to remember and use and result in high-quality pictures.  Moreover, there is more to the camera (macro-photography, movies, \"stitching\" for panoramic shots) to challenge one's creative photography cravings. [ But do remember: it is necessary and most useful to read the well-written manual. ]","If you go to a store where these are on display and put one in your hands, you will be forced to buy it; it feels that good.<br />When you have had it 2 weeks, you will love it more.<br />After 20 years or so, you'll still prefer it.","Really the best in these category!<br />I have one and according to my imaginary i will have 7500 photos taken by this one in 2004 November.<br />Thanks to CANON!","I read many reviews before picking up this camera, only recently (after owning it for months) have I read one that talks about the lag time between the time you press the button all the way down until the picture is captured.  It's longer than normal and it will affect your shots.  But at least I know what causes the lag, charging the flash unit.  If lighting is enough where flash is not needed, no lag.  Fresh batteries don't make a difference.<br />Other than that, I am satisfied with the quality.  For the price, you get what you pay for:  only stores pics in compressed (not raw) format, no aperature bracketing, etc.<br />The movie mode is much cooler than I thought it would be though, love to take mini-movies of the kids (2 and 5 yrs) and show them (over and over).<br />So: outdoor pics and movies *yeah*<br />indoor usage *boo* - keep shopping.  Better yet, do what I should have - get to the photo store and wrap your hands around some cameras!  Don't listen to me, make your own choice.","After asking around about what essential specs to get on a camera, I came down to a list of the following:<br />- Minimum of 2 million pixels,<br />- At least 3 * optical zoom,<br />- Perferably made by one of the long-time camera makers (For better lens quality).<br />To that, I added a few requirements of my own:<br />- Should look good, (Hey. I'm a sucker for appearance when it comes to technology)<br />- Some settings I can play around with, (I want to be able to influence diaphragma settings, flash usage, shutter times, etc)<br />- It should have the feel of a regular camera (I want to FEEL I'm using a camera, rather than some light-weight plastic box)<br />- It should be afordable.<br />After all of these, and reading some reviews and recommendations from friends, I decided I wanted a Canon. While looking at a number of cameras, I finally decided on the A60.<br />I figured 2 million pixels would be enough, considering I don't intend on enhancing the pictures at all. Just regular size pictures would do perfectly fine for me. The camera also allows me to control the technical settings like the diaphragm, shutter time, etc. And it actually fellt like a real camera.<br />All in all, the camera filled all the criteria I mentioned above, so it seemed like an obvious choice.<br />The camera works like a charm. The quality of the pictures is absolutely brilliant, and the usb-cable supplied with it enables you to quickly download the pictures from the memory card onto your computer. I haven't tested the software to alter pictures yet, but I'm convinced it will do whatever it promises.<br />The only disadvantages I could find was that the 16 MB CF card is too limited for storage. And the accessories are expensive as hell. But, that does not affect the working of the camera, so I have no reason to complain really.<br />All in all, argueable the best camera for your money in it's price range.","WOW!! I read all of the reviews before we bought ours.  This is the best one on the market.  No doubt.  It works better than expected. It is so easy to operate. This is our first digital camera.  Buy a \"Zio\" compact flash card reader,(around $25) it will save on the frustration with the batteries getting sucked down too soon.","I had an Olympus 520z, the images where never sharp.  At low light, the background were all too dark.  I Tried shooting at our tennis game and it was horrible when taking pictures with action.  Before, I had a 1MP Olympus 460 that produces sharper and better pictures.  I used to think Olympus as the best of the point-and-shoots, but the 520z changed all this.<br /><br />  Next I got the Nikon 2100.  A lot better than the Oly520z.  Smaller and looks like really techie.  It is nice because of the size, really pocketsize although a little chunky. But still, I was not impressed on action photos. I do not know whether the size of the lenses has something to do with (Olympus has 2.8A max while Nikon has a 2.6A max) but both have very puny lenses which I suspect how much light can get in into it.<br /><br />  These cameras both use only 2 AA which what I wanted for portability.  But my conclusion is, there is no camera around that uses only 2 batteries to have enough flash power to make a great shots.<br /><br />So, I settled with the 4-battery Canon A60. Although I will not  compare the images taken with my Olympus C3040 (C3040 has a fast 1.8A lens), the results are far, far superior than Oly 520z and Nikon 2100.  For the money, it is the best at this level.  The features are more than I expected for this price.  The lens is bigger, flash is more powerful, movie has audio, etc.","I purchased this camera on a recent trip to Korea and took hundreds of pictures.  One of my friends accompanying me on this trip bought one shortly afterwards and another bought one upon our return to the US because they were so impressed.  Great camera for the money and for what I use it for.  It is nice and compact but not overly so.  The controls are easy to use and understand with very little familiarization needed.  This camera has many more options than most consumers will ever use, but for those of you who want to be creative, this definitely allows for it.  I particularly like the ability to \"stitch\" a panoramic scene together.  The packaged software does a great job of this and is extremely user friendly.<br />This came with a 16MB CF card which is kind of useless I think.  I bought a 256MB CF card at the same time I bought the camera and have been using it.  We took a short vacation and I was able to take several video clips and almost two hundred photos without downloading.  Most of these were at the highest resolution so I would recommend a higher capacity CF card.  I also use the rechargeable NMh batteries instead of alkalines.  I get more time out of these and are shorter in the long term than replacing alkalines all of the time.<br />So far I am very, very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone.  My friend who also bought this owns a top of the line EOS digital SLR that cost many $$$$ more and is very pleased and satisfied with this.  It takes great photos yet doesn't cost so much that your afraid to take it out and use it.","I already own the a60 canon digital camera, and I can tell, it is the best deal for that price.  Besides it's the only one I know (around that budget) that allow to synchronize the flash.  I'm a happy owner!!!","Canon has caught all of the competition off guard by introducing the A60 with a virtually identical feature set as its high line G-series cameras but at a fraction of the cost.  Use the A60 for 10-minutes and any other camera in its price range will simply appear ordinary.  Here is a guarantee:  Nikon, Olympus, and others will shortly scramble to introduce low-cost cameras with the same fully-manual feature set as the A60.<br />How well does it work?  I've owned mine for over a month and have nothing but excellent results.  My previous digicam (a Canon S10) was very good, but the A60 produces richer color photos and allows me to gain control over the critical features of the camera for special shooting conditions.  Most folks don't realize that 2-megapixel is a sweet-spot in digital camera performance:  it's the perfect resolution for printing up to 8x10 and the file sizes are small enough to allow rapid shooting without waiting for images to write to the Compactflash card.  And the Canon lens is superb.  Never underestimate the quality of the lens to make your photos great.  There are plenty of higher megapixel cameras with so-so lenses that produce poor photos in comparison to a lower megapixel model with quality optics.<br />Try the A60 and you'll keep it.  Of course, you can wait a few months for all the other manufacturers to introduce their full-featured low-cost cameras, but why reward them for napping?  Choose the A60 as a way of thanking Canon for being the first to give us pro-sumer features at an entry-level price.","I bought this camera a few weeks ago and I think it is one of the BEST purchases I have ever made!  It is a great price for all you get and it takes GREAT pictures.  It is very easy to learn how to opperate.  It takes little movies, which are great.  I have plugged it into the tv(with the connectors that COME WITH IT) to show friends and family pictures on the tv.  My fil just went on a hunting trip to Canada and took it with him and he took GREAT pictures and he has NO clue about digital anything! LOL!  It is SO nice to take pictures and see them and either keep them or get rid of them and develop only the ones you want.  If you want a great camera for a great price this is it!!  GREAT BUY!","This has to be the COOLEST CAMERA EVER! I was looking at a good quality digital camera and easy to grip. I started searching and researching cameras by looking at brands like Nikon, Cannon, Olympus, and Kodak. I needed a camera to take up snowboarding with me to capture so great snowboarding pictures. Then one day I stumbled across the Canon Powershot A60. I read some reviews and checked out the features. It had 3x optical zoom which was a big thing I was looking for and movie mode which can be up to 3 minutes! Eventually I bought the camera and some rechargable batteries since it uses batteries up pretty fast. This camera is the easiest camera to use especially if you are a begginer like me. I highly recomend this camera to anyone looking for a good high quality easy to use camera.","Original review on September 19, 2003:<br /><br />I bought this camera a few months ago, and I am REALLY happy with it.  It has lots of features for a cheap and compact camera, and so far, there have been no problems with it at all!<br /><br />I recently took it on a vacation with me for 2 weeks, and with a battery charger, a 128 MB CF card, and the camera, I was taking pictures the whole time.<br /><br />If you are planning to take pictures for fun, this is one of the best cameras out there, but if you want to use it professionally, you might be a little better off with a camera with more megapixels.<br /><br />***********************************<br /><br />Edit, as of August 16, 2005:<br /><br />I bought this camera in June 2003, just more than two years ago.  At that time, one person talked about some \"E18\" error but said that his camera still functioned with the error.  The rest of the reviews seemed excellent, so I bought the camera (I can't remember if I got it for $150 or $250).  My camera has been taking excellent pictures these past two years and I can't ask for more from a point-and-shoot for amateurs.  I just went on a an eight-day vacation earlier this month and, on the seventh day, I noticed that the LCD viewfinder turned purple when I titled my camera 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  Over the next two days, I took vertical pictures by rotating my camera clockwise and all was fine.<br /><br />However, when I returned home, I decided to read up about the problem.  The A60's reviews were full of people talking about \"that dreaded E18 error\".  One review for the A70 said that someone else received the purple LCD screen by tilting his camera, but he said that his pictures turned out either all-purple or had purple bands of color.  My pictures look great, but I don't want to, while on vacation, discover that either my pictures are all purple or my camera won't work because of E18.<br /><br />Consequently, I am looking for a new camera.  First, though, I'm going to do a little more research and wait for the prices to go down.  Hopefully, I'll purchase a new camera before my A60 stops working entirely.<br /><br />The bottom line: I've heard this error applies to almost ALL of Canon's cameras.  DO NOT BUY FROM CANON!  Go with Nikon or Olympus.<br /><br />Since I can't change the stars I gave this camera, my new rating is ONE (1) OUT OF FIVE (5) STARS.  The camera is excellent for only two years, so why waste money when you could buy a camera that could last ten years?","I've been having this camera for the last one month & i'm quite happy with the image quality. ONE MAJOR COMPLAIN --> I DID'NT FIND THE USB CABLE IN THE PACKAGE. I wrote to amazon and they gave me the contact details of canon. However since i was in a hurry to download the images i bought a CF reader. Apart from this the camera works fine.....no dreaded 'E18' error yet!.<br />If u want to get the best out of this camera then i suggest u read the manual and explore all the various functions however I got the best pictures in the auto mode. The metalic frame makes the cam look sturdy. The huge battery compartment (4 AA) works as a perfect grip for the cam however the 'zooming' lever could have been better off on the rear side. The 'stitching' feature is also great if you are shooting a panaromic shot. All-in-All this is an ideal digital camera for any amateur photographer who is just getting into the finer points of digital Photography.","Purchased camera in December, took pictures at my daughter's wedding, birthdays, trip to NY state, Niagra Falls and various outdoor scenes with waterfalls, scenic views, etc..<br />Used most of the various camera modes.  It takes excellant outdoor scenic/ panoramic views in bright and low light conditions. Indoor photo's so-so, red eye reduction does not appear to work, wedding pictures were a disappointment because of this.<br />Viewfinder is not very accurate, pictures tend to have much larger field of view than what appears in viewfinder, especially at top of picture, causes difficulty composing picture.<br />Zoom mechanism is not very smooth, somewhat jerky & diffciult to get just the right composition.","I had a chance to do a direct comparison between the Powershot A60 and Coolpix 2100 (Nikon), both with 2Megapixels. The Powershot has lots of fun toys and settings for SLR-friends, but makes dramaticaly poorer pictures... To the Powershot:<br /><br /> Pros:<br /> 1. Optional manual settings - just like a manual SLR (you can play with apature and shutter speed and see the results right away)<br /> 2. Great Panorama Helper (not present on the COolpix)<br /> 3. Quick at saving the picture to memory card<br /> 4. Because it has 4 batteries, you don't have to change them very often<br /><br /> Cons:<br /> 1. Picture quality could be better (straight lines look like zig zags) - recommend the Coolpix<br /> 2. Auto Focus option (which I thought was a reason to buy the camera) is useless<br /> 3. Size and wieght","This is an excellent piece in 2MP category. Main featrues include the 12 shooting modes and connection to TV (Good feature to explore the phots taken when you dont have a PC). the Movie feature is more than enough to serve the common and simple use.","I bought this camera to take on my vacation.  Initially I was going to buy the 3MP A70 but when that one wasn't going to arrive in time I went with the 2MP A60.<br />The A60 is a great little camera with better than expected results.  I use it at it's maximum resolution and it's worked fabulous.  Images come out sharp, better than my friend's SLR photos.  Color quality and contrast seem to depend on where you have the prints 'developed'.  I have two sets of the same images that were done by different places and they look almost like different photos.  The camera works great in most lights (from bright sunlight to restaurant dim) and when I enlarged them the images did not get grainy at all.  Plus there's that added bonus of deleting anything you don't like.  I think my developer nearly had a heart attack when I told him I wanted all 135 images b/c I had already deleted the garbage. The camera also will not take an out of focus image... it either requires you to zoom out or to move a few steps.  This can be a pain but it keeps you from getting blurry images.  Even action shots come out sharp.<br />The LCD screen is too small and in bright light (I was on a beach) it's totally useless.  Plus it deceptively makes your image seem farther away than it really is...a nice surprise when you get your prints back and they're MUCH closer. The only problem that -really- bothered me (which is why I give it 4 of 5 stars) was that there is a delay (enough for someone to walk in your frame or your subject to move) between when you press the shutter and when the camera actually captures the image.  Not a problem if you're taking photos of still things but can be a really issue when you're taking active shots.<br />One recommendation is to buy a larger compact flash than what's included with the camera, especially if you're like me and use the highest resolution.  I bought two 128MB Viking cards (1 was a back up) and have had no problems and LOTS of storage space (I think 1 card would give around 200 images).  It's well worth the extra money.","This little guy is a tough camera with a low price!  I've read a lot of reviews about people worrying about the plastic battery door seeming flimsy. It may \"seem\" flimsy, but it works great and lasted through many, many, many battery changes on my end without a single hint of becoming a future problem.<br />The Goods<br />-Excellent photo quality.  I've owned several digital cameras and this one by far has the best image quality.<br />-Low price.  I think it's the best camera on the market under $300!<br />-Great software, easy to install and use!<br />-Great battery power!<br />The Not So Good<br />-Video output is not the greatest.  Diehard video freaks will want a video cam instead.<br />-Display could be a tad larger.<br />-Accessories are pricey!<br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this camera.  The display is bright, crisp and clear and so are the photos.  What more could you ask for?","I bought a Canon A60 in stores almost a week ago. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. I think that it is a very good buy for the price, looks great, and is loaded with features. Only  things I dont like about it is how the LCD screen is hard to see under bright sun, and you dont get rechargable batteries with teh camera. I suggest buying rechargables to save yourself money in the long run and i also purchased a carrying case to prevent scratching or other minor damages. The camera comes with a 16mb card which is sufficicent for everyday use for most people. I highly recommend this camera for the average-joe who wants to own a good, cheap digital camera taht is stylish as well as functional","some people are worried about the door to the card compt, don't let it scare you away. this little guy packs a lot power for a greate price. best resolution over nikon by a long shot!!! this is a real battery saver. don't care so much for the video output but i would have bought a video camera if that was what i wanted anyway. gives the user a lot of freedom and choices for camera settings vs other brands. althoufg iso 50 setting is the best, iso 100 isn't to shabby, but 200 iso gets noisy.","actually what I want to know is if this camera has a battery charger so I don't have to deal with batteries. The batteries go out too quickly. Please advise.<br /><br /> Elsie","This was our first digital camera and I couldn't be happier.  The camera is small enough and light weight enough to fit in my pocket and was easy to use right out of the box.  I was taking pictures and emailing them the first day I received the camera. Once I installed the program onto my computer all I have to do is hook the camera up and the pictures are sent to my computer.  The family loved viewing the pictures we took when I hooked the camera up to the T.V.  The print quality is great and I would recommend this camera to anyone.  A great camera for a great price.","This is my first still digital camera. It was easy to operate straight out of the box.  You will need a bigger flash card -- the 16 mb that comes with it holds about 34 pictures and then you have to download or delete.  It takes about 1-2 seconds to process the picture so you end up telling people--  don't move!  and I'm hoping that changes when I put the bigger flashcard in.  It also uses AA batteries--fast!!!  But the pictures are of great quality, it's lots of fun e-mailing them, and it's a very sturdy little camera.  I am very satisfied.","To simplify my european vacation with my 12 and 10 year old daughters, I purchased TWO of the A60s, 256K CF cards, and never heard a complaint the whole time!  Their photos were awesome, and not much lesser quality than my G3. Bright LCD, and good DiGiC focus.  I recommend neck-length straps (Ritz Camera), but otherwise, over 450 photos were taken, with only one set of battery replacements each.  2100 MiAh NiH batteries didn't hold as long as I had hoped, and in general, felt the conventional batteries were fine.  Photo color, durability, and ergonomics were great. Remember, these were kids!  And criminals","This camera is my first digital camera. Very easy to operate, and the pictures are excellent quality. The only drawback to this camera is the shiny mount around the screen. This causes a glare in the sunlight. For the price, this camera is a good choice.","This camera is as good as I could have possibly hoped for for the price. Everything about the camera is wonderful. The battery life is kind of short, or at least the battery life of the batteries that came with the camera is. They ran out after 2 days, but the batteries I replaced them with are still going strong after twice that long. The image quality is great for snapshots and even amateur art photos, especially if you don't have the money for an a70 or another 3mp camera. My two favorite features are the macro and the short films.","Very nice camera. I have been using this for about 3 days now, and love it!<br />Easy to use, many features, and combined with a Canon printer I print awesome photos!<br />I highly recommend this model if your looking for a 2.0 megapixel unit. Only drawback is it goes through batteries if you operate it with the LCD constantly on, but this can be solved by purchasing rechargeable batteries.<br />5 stars!!!","Excellent, it's all you need. Just add a bag with it (it scartches eaily on the back), add a 128MB or 256MB card as recommended by Amazon, and get those 1850MH rechargable Kodak AAA, and you got a set for a little over $... It's so good, I got one for work, then after a couple of months use, another set for the family. I know everybdoy wants to look cool with 3.2, 4 or 5 meg pics, but if you are like us, and watch most of your pictures on a slide show on your Windows XP, or print them 4x6, then this is great. If you like the movie mode, the mic is great and the movie fun. Not super, but for $...bucks, you can't go wrong. Now if you like it fancy and cool, get the A70, but I know I like to upgrade and who knows, I might loose or break it, so this is lots of fun, super pics and low investement. Thanks Canon! (By the way, the lens is super and its a 2.8f, which is great!)","Easy to use, light weight, and great picture quality.<br />I bought the Cannon CP-100 printer and a 64MB memory card and I can now print all my pictures right at home.","This camera is the best! I love it.  It's very easy to work with.  You don't even need to read the manual to be able to operate this thing (But of course if you want to make your pictures to look more professional then you've got to read the manual).  So, it's a tiny camera, fits in my hand perfectly and not too heavy or too light.  It just gives the right balance in my hand.  The very cool part about this digital cam is that it has a video mode which you can record the scenes for almost 45sec with 16MB card and one cool thing i almost for get to mention, you could plug it in your tv and play the movie or pictures that you've just taken.  YOu could also adjust the sizes of your pictures and the quality of the pictures that you want before you take your pictures (when you adjust to the leastest size and quality, your capacity in your CF card would increases). And it works well with Microsoft XP, you just plugged in the USB thingie and woop! the program would just recognize your camera in seconds and then you just follow a couple of incredibly easy step by step and have them pictures saved on your comp. One more thing, the camera has a software called \"arcsoft\" that comes with it.  MS XP already had that software installed so you don't need to reinstall it again.  Pretty cool hah.","I bought this camera after doing a lot of research. Some of my friends have other Canon Cameras and I decide to buy one. First of all, the batteries do last longer than i did expect. I used the included Alkaline and played a lot with the camera, took around 70 Pics (128 Mb card) , a few video clips and the batteries lasted around 3 days. I also bought rechargable batteries and the are great. My suggestion is to buy the camera and a set of rechargeable batteries.<br />About the picture quality..if you are not a Pro...this is just what you need. Great resolution, great quality... a little difficult at the beginning to handle (pic modes etc) but you get used to it.","Hi, I'm the same person who wrote the May 2, 2003 (\"A Bumpy Road so far...\") review below.  I decided that Camera #2 definitely had blurry pictures, no matter what settings I used.  Perhaps a lens problem, I don't know.  So, I exchanged the camera again, and Camera #3 is perfect!  The pictures are incredibly sharp, even on my large computer monitor.  The batteries last for a long time.  Despite the minor difficulties I had with my purchase, I really do love my Canon A60!","Pro's<br />1. Excellent features like video out, AA batteries, movie w/sound etc.<br />2. Very competitively priced.<br />3. Nice build quality, good looking and easy to grip.<br />4. Lots of manual features like long shutter, aperture priority, shutter priority and full manual mode.<br />5. Uses cheap CF cards.<br />Con's<br />1. Its 2 inches thick not 1.3, advertised specs exclude the protrusions like battery compartment.<br />2. Not pocketable, very heavy with 4 AA batteries and thick.<br />3. AF assist on Canon's is just a gimmick, it doesn't help camera focus better.<br />4. Soft images, many of them out blurry/out of focus.<br />5. No charger or rechargebale batteries in the box.<br />If you want manual controls then the A60/A70 are the only ones. Otherwise there are some other good cameras like Nikon 2100/Sony P72/Olympus D-560/Fuji 310/Canon S200 etc to consider.","I just had a chance to test my friend's A60. After taking several pictures, here are what I came up with....<br />Goods:<br />- Fast start up time: less than 3 seconds. You are not gonna miss a quick shot. 3x optical zoom is also fast and quiet. The other nice thing is...it doesn't have a separated lense cap. This is what I hate about my Olympus C3040.<br />- Good picture quality: A60 produces properly exposed pictures and saturated colors in several different light conditions.<br />- Aperture and Shutter priority modes: you probably need this feature to take advanced shots.<br />- Great macro capability: you can take a picture of flowers as close as 2-3 inches. Focus is also fast. Compared to my minolta f100 and olympus c3040, I love A60's macro better.<br />- Improved night/indoor mode: this is what I don't see in canon s200 and the only reason I returned that little S200.<br />- Movie w/sound record: this camera records and playbacks movie with sound in AVI format at 15 frames/second. It runs pretty smooth.<br />- Lens adaptor: This camera can accept external wide-angle, tele, and filters.<br />- Use standard AA batteries: I think A-series is the only canon line that support AA batteries. If you don't wanna spend [money]for a second propietary battery, get A-series. Four fully charged batteries seem to last very long. I took about 100 pictures with LCD turn on, it's still full.<br />- Fast and easy USB connectivity: Compared to Olympus c3040 and Minolta F100, it takes very short for my windows xp to recognize this A60. In addition, you DON'T NEED a software at all.<br />- Feels: this camera is not too big or too small. It just comfortably fits in my hand. The body looks like metal and the handle is plastic. It's a good combination since you don't wanna touch a cold metal camera in winter.<br />- Low price<br />Bads:<br />- Ocassionally, purple fringe is visible in very high constrat shots.<br />- Poor auto white balance under tungsten light.<br />- No 1280 x 960 resolution. It has 1600 x 1200, 1024 x 768, and 640 x 480.<br />- Small LCD: could be 1.8\" instead of 1.5\".<br />- Rubber USB/AV port cap: with frequent uses, it can be broken soon.","Hi, I bought a Canon A60 in mid-April, and about 5 days into ownership I began experiencing the dreaded \"E18 message.\"  (Previously reported in other Canon digital cameras.) The customer service guy said \"it might mean you need a new battery or something is wrong with the electrical system.  Either return it to the store where you bought it, or send it in\".  Ugh!  He ws not very helpful.  Anyway, even with error E18, Camera #1 was taking fabulous photos.  But I took camera #1 back to the electronics store and exchanged it for camera #2, also a Canon A60.  This one doesn't give me error \"E18\", but so far, almost every picture looks blurry when displayed on my computer.  In particular, \"shiny\" areas like my subjects' eyes and teeth appear as double images.  I have tried cleaning the lens, adjusting the flash, and adjusting the resolution, to no avail.<br />I'm not sure if this is a camera problem or a software problem.  I favor camera problem, because the images from camera #1 still look great with the same software.<br />The software (ZoomBrowser EX) has another weird bug.  Every time I look at a single image, ie to adjust brightness, contrast, or saturation, there is a wide band on the right side that appears to be the actual left side of the image, in a greenish color.  However, in slide show mode, this is not evident.  Any ideas???<br />I might have to exchange camera #2, but I am still hoping to keep the A60, as the pictures from #1 were great.","I bought this for my sister, actually, this is also the first dgital camera I bought. I am so glad that I made the right choice. I thought it would be the same big size as Canon A40 before I received it from Amazon, but actually it is not, it is very small, although it is still a little bigger than Canon S200, I am already happy with that. The pictures are awesome, even in the movie mode, its quality is still excellent. This camera has AV output port, so you can transfer the photos/movies to a TV easily, I love this feature, because if you want to show the photos/movies to many people, you don't need a PC at all. 256MB memory card can take upto 740 seconds of movie. Campare to Nikon 2100, which is smaller than Canon A60, but Nikon does not have AV output port, and its movie cannot record any sound. This is the one if you want a 2MP digital camera.","I agree that the camera comes at a very attractive price, but on closer inspection, I don't think it is really worth the money.<br />Cons:<br />- Looks cheap and feels cheap<br />- LCD is not that clear compared to other dig. cameras under the same category<br />- Poor LCD light contrast<br />- Very limited features in general, especially in the manual mode<br />Pros:<br />- Rather light and small<br />- Cheap<br />Buy this if you want a camera that is portable enough to take with you to social events and parties. But definitely not recommended for taking panoramic or travel pictures. Even if you're a beginner in photography, consider spending an extra $100 for a way better camera with more features and flexibilities. You will grow out of this camera in a matter of weeks! A60 is cheap and easy to use, but it doesn't allow your creativity and imagination to go very far.","This is my first digital camera. I searched around reading reviews online. After holding camera at a local store, I was impressed. It is a great point and shoot camera, but also includes features found only in more expense models. It is easy to grip/hold on to. It is a great camera for an amatour or a intermediate photograher. Its a great. NO Awesome camera! The memory it uses, is low priced. I highly recommend it!","I have been using a Canon A20 for a little more than 1 year. It was a great camera. A60 is similar to A20 with new shape and enhanced functions.<br />After my A20 was taken by the sister of my wife, we were searching the web to find a replacement camera. After compared the features and sample pictures of several candidates: canon s230, canon a60, canon a300, nikon 2000, olympus c520. We found this one fits our needs the best.<br />S230 is a good camera, but too small to hold stable in hand.The picture quality of a300 is not good, even it has 3 mega pixels, due to its inferior lens.The nikon 2000 does not even record sound when taking video. C520 is OK but picture quality is so so.<br />So, if you just want to take some good picture of your family on a trip, A60 is one of the best choices.Make sure you grab a 256 M compact flash card before you leave the house.","I bought the Canon PowerShot A60 as a replacement for my two year old Fuji Film 4700 Zoom, and I am extremely impressed.  The camera at its highest resolution (1600x1200) takes gorgeous photos, with rich warm colors.  No pixilation and very little purple fringing appear on the images.  The camera itself includes some very advanced features for its price, all of which can be adjusted in manual mode.  However, most users will never touch these options, instead opting for the simple Auto mode, which automatically chooses the perfect settings.  The only downside to the camera itself is that instead of using metal, the casing is plastic, and therefore feels somewhat cheap.  Nonetheless, the build quality is generally good and the buttons and ports are conveniently located.  The camera is small, but is by no means one the smallest and lightest digital cameras on the market.<br />Along with the camera, the box includes an industry standard puny 16MB Compact Flash card, that should be immediately replaced, and four alkaline batteries.  The battery life is very good; the camera can operate for several days of heavy use without replacement.  Nonetheless, I recommend Ni-MH Rechargeable batteries, which provide an even longer life.  The included `Zoom Browser EX' software very easy to use and incorporates some fairly powerful features.<br />If you don't want to spend much money and want an easy to use digital camera with great image quality, look no further than the Canon PowerShot A60.  However, if you want a camera that can take larger photos and has more powerful features try the Canon S45, S50, or the Canon G3.  If you want a smaller camera you might want to consider the Canon S400 or the S200.","I have had this camera for about two weeks now. It is my first digital camera and I really like it. First, but not foremostly, it is a sharp looking camera. It records great photos. It has plenty of options for the lay cameraperson. And the only drawback to that is learning how to work those options. Like the previous reviewer stated, you can use it right out of the box.<br />I used a Canon digital camera for work this past winter and took good pictures in -25F temperatures. It was the first time I had used the camera and I got it going without the manual. This was a factor in choosing this new camera from Canon.<br />I haven't really used the software included with the camera as my computer had its own. But with the little of it I have used, it was very friendly.<br />I give it only 4 stars because I am sure with more use it will reveal some faults. Must remember that some faults are just operator error!","Ok I've been looking for a digital camera for about a year now, I'm cheap so I waited until I found a product that had what I want for the price I wanna pay. .... the 2 mega pixels is just fine for ANYONE taking pictures and printing them.. 2MP Cameras print out great 8x10 photos so if you dont need to print anything bigger than that save your money and stay with a 2 mega pixel. In less than 10 mins i had this thing out of the box and taking pictures. It has some advanced manual features that I probably will not use because Im not a professional. The control are eays to use, the LCD display is fast and looked just like tv looking at the screen, the compact size fits great in your hand and doesn't take up much room.. Amazingly the batterys last for an very acceptable amount of time. I have a set of hi cap recharagable batterys from radio shack and i've been using it for a week taking movies and pictures and its just now getting low on batterys.. This is my first digital camera and Im very satisfied that I made a good choice first time around.

You can do better.","I bought this camera in 2003, mostly to do underwater pictures (with a dedicated housing). It has served me very well. Best feature is its size, you can really have it on you at all times, like a phone camera, but much much better quality<br />Couple of hints:<br />- always use max resolution, so pack the newer, larger memory cards.<br />- in low lighting, use the bracketing or burst function: both take a bunch of pics after one push of the button, whereby the first one will be blurred (due to YOUR movement when pressing the button) and the second will be sharp. This brings much better results than using the flash, which is awful, like in other cameras of this size<br />- it can be slow at the start, so keep the autofocus on permanently. This may mean you run out of juice quite quickly, so pack an extra battery and re-charge in the evening<br />- the macro is very precise and sharp , get up close and use it!<br /><br />At the end, mine got flooded (my fault), and I find myself looking for a second-hand one, despite all the improvements in the technology since 2003...<br />Rene","A litttle heavy, takes pictures really slow, has a pretty long flash recharge time.  so it takes a while for the camera to get ready for your next shot, Battery life is short.  Doesnt zoom in as much as other digital cameras do in this category,  Try a camera where the lens actually telescopes away from the camera.","I bought this camera 2 years ago and have been GREAT ever since, very slick camera it is small enough to fit in your pocket without bothering you,I take it everywhere I go, the battery lasts enough to take a lot of pictures so no problems about that. LCD screen is big so you can preview your pics. The pictures are crisp clear, vivid colors, the auto mode adapts to every situation possible.<br /><br />Cons: not all the time but in ocassions i've some red eye pictures.<br /><br />My guess is you are buying this camera to take it with you and to take pictures at parties with your friends, etc. this is a great camera for that. If you want to take a lot of night scenery pictures then you might want to consider other one.","I have the Limited Japanese Black Version . As soon as I saw it, I knew that was the camera that I wanted. I love technology, and this struck my eyes and I was impulsive and just got it! I was pulling my hair out reading reviews and just going insane. So I said, you know what, just go for it! And I did. Im very happy with this camera. It does exactly what I need it to do, fit into my back pocket! I can take it anywhere, and it is not bulky like other film cameras or even DSLR's ! There are things about it that make me sad, and wish I bought a different camera. But, you never know if your going to like a camera until you try it out. So, I have had it for abuot 3 years, and for the most part I like it, but I still look at other camera, and, I still buy other camera. Because it is an addiction.<br /><br />Pro's: great size, very easy to take everywhere, fits in small purse, pockets, jackets, etc. Cool , sleek , stylish, Big LCD screen, bright, easy buttons , user friendly interface, produces up to an 8.5 x 11 print, great quality, sephia and negative color modes are useful and fun, has great accessories, great battery life, great macro feature<br /><br />con's: red eye reduction does seem to work, flash grabs light and dust with make these weird orb looking circles on pictures, buttons are small, front slide down lense cover doesnt lock, nighttime photos are horrible, unless you carry a tripod around with you 24/7, then you MIGHT get a good photo.. but chances are slim to none!<br /><br />all in all, its a nice camera to have to take \" fun photos \" if your on the go, and you just want something small its a good camera.<br /><br />I would recomend the DSC-T30 , its is a newer edition and they have fixed a lot of the problems that you find with the DSC-T1","I have used my T1 for more than 2 years now.  The pictures are great and the movies are wonderful, but it needs help with red eye reduction and blurry photos.  The camera does have a red eye reduction feature but it doesn't help much.  I tried using it a few times but it doesn't always work, and it adds alot more time to the process.  Most of the time I am able to correct this in iPhoto so this is a minor problem in my opinion.  The biggest problem is the blurry photos.  This model has no steady shot feature, and is limited to ISO 400, so if you are not careful your shots can all become useless.  Sometimes the image looks fine when reviewing it on the 2.5 inch lcd but when you load the images on to your computer they are blurry.  Like I said I have been using this camera for more than 2 years and it is still a great camera.  I carry it with me all the time and have taken over 6000 photos and movies with it.  I also own a Canon Digital Elph and I never use it because the Sony T1 takes such great photos and movies.  I plan to replace my Sony T1 with a new Sony T series camera and I do recommend the T1 to anyone looking.","I have had lots of complements on the pictures I have taken with this camera.  I even got fine night shots of the Mackinaw Bridge all lit up and without a tripod.  For those who can't take a good picture with it I suggest they read the manual and practice before counting on it.  I do think the color reproduction is a little better at 3 mega pix than 5 but not enough to say so.","I love this camera.  I bought this after the birth of my 1st child.  It works great.  We have captured so many precious moments with it.  Picutre/video quality is great.  We also purchased an extra memory card.  Best digital camera I have owned.  Easy to use and takes great pictures/videos.  Completely satisfied.","My wife always wanted small camera in her bag. and i havent found anything better than sony. i think this camera is great for snapshots and it has all features. i have sony camcorder with memory stick too so its card can be handy.<br /><br />and size matters...","I've purchased two DCS-T1's, one for me and one for my son, and find them to be a highly capable camera once you read the manual and learn how to use it properly.<br /><br />I've seen a number of reviews complain about the lack of a tripod socket built into the camera. That's true but Sony does make a case for the DSC-T1 that allows you to attach a tripod - it's the Sony AJK-THA and costs about $25-$30.","This is a great camera for someone who is always on the run... It fits almost anywhere, I take it with me everywhere. People are always very impressed with the camera, because after all it is a great product. In order to know how to operate this camera properly you MUST READ THE MANUAL!!! I actually downloaded the manual right here on Amazon, its much easier to read it.","This camera is so much fun.  It's great if you want to take shots like a pro but don't have the time.  Fits into my busy lifestyle but like to record special moments along the way.  So small and compact I can carry it anywhere and pull it out at a moments notice - it's ready to go! I love it!!!  I got mine free at: [...]","I'll give a non-technical/beginner photographer's take on this camera:<br /><br />about me/needs: I live in an urban environment (Chicago and NYC) and travel a lot. I was going on interviews across the country to schools and I wanted to be able to record my experiences. I wanted something small that would be powerful and be able to record video and pictures that were highquality.<br /><br />My experience with the T-1: I haven't used the newer models but what I found about the T-1 was it was extremely inituitive. Pretty much you just slide the front down and on the side, click it to picture and you're ready to go. The LCD display resolves well in both sunlight and at night. To change flash modes, you just fiddle with the controls. Extremely simple. Going to videocamera mode isn't hard, you just click the notch down for video recording.<br /><br />At night panaroma views- the camera doesn't resolve very well. If you use the flash, the background doesn't come out. If you don't use the flash, the light doesn't come in clearly. Everything is sorta muddled. It's extremely frustrating.<br /><br />What makes this camera shine is the videorecording capability. I've recorded videos at Coldplay concerts from half a stadium away- with the camera zoomed in. It's amazing. The sound comes in crisp clear and the resolution is sharp. I like how the camera is so small and you can get quality videos.<br /><br />Problems about the T-1: I didn't give it the full 5 stars because of the price and difficulty in getting clear pictures on the go. I spent over 500 to buy the t-1 two years ago. It's signficantly cheaper but still the newer models are at about the same price I bought the original for.<br /><br />I had difficulty getting clear-well resolved pictures and I did read the owner's manual. You have to hold the camera really still and brace your arms onto something stable to get non-shaky pictures. In the commercial with Aerosmith's lead singer, the girls are sitting at a restaurant and one of them whips out the camera and takes a picture of him walking by. It's true the camera is quick to respond but I doubt she was able to get a clear shot of the guy with her arm shaking like that.<br /><br />If you want a camera that has the wow factor. amazing video recording quality and solid picture capabilities (if you can keep the camera still), this t-1 is for you. you'll find it for middle 300's almost everywhere now and it's definitely a bargain. I'm much more a dabbler in photography and this was a great starter for me.","My brother has this camera, and brought it to Afghanastan with him (he worked on a helicopter).<br /><br />This slim, tiny camera kept him busy for hours during the year he was there. He took thousands of beautiful pictures and hours of video.<br /><br />He's an absolute amateur - but his pics and videos were incredible.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Whether you get this camera for free or buy it, I am certain you will enjoy it!","i had an old sony digital camera that was bulky and slow. after a while i got tired of it so i went back to disposables so i could take quick shots one after another without having to wait for it to load. this camera is very quick. less then a second between shots.<br /><br />the slide lens cover is awesome and perfect for the camera. just flip it open and click. this protects it and makes for a convenient way to turn the camera on. i find this extremely helpful when it comes to taking spontanious pictures. i carry this camera everywhere. i do recommend to get a protective film for the lcd screen as is for all other cameras, but more so for this 2.5\" screen. the screen itself is more then half the size of the camera.<br /><br />the only problem i have is that even though it takes great and fast day pictures, i would have liked it to take better night pictures. i tried focusing it on the full moon, but the contrasting night sky caused there to be no detail of the moon. plus, don't try to take night pictures while holding the camera in your hands.<br /><br />with that small detail mentioned, this camera is awesome for day to day pictures. i set the camera for 1 megapixel and with a 256 mb card, it holds 370 pictures. that is enough to go to disney land, 6 flags, and sea world. i can make the battery last for quite a long while. it is such a small start up time when flipping the slide cover that it is just as easy to shut it off as it is not to. fully charged you get well over an hour, closer to 2. that lasts forever if you turn it off every time you use it. for convenience, i recommend this camera to everyone.","DSC-T1 is excellent. all the features of my old bulky DSC-F717. perfect for traveling, compact for all occasions. great price compared to F-717. easy download to computer. some reviews described disappointments. read the operating instructions and practice a little. it's fun. no problems indoors. battery life is fine. turn off when not in use or get a spare and go all day. i bought the soft case too. all around nice shooter.","I bought this camera 2 months back and till date it is working excellent. I made few changes in settings for picture and i had least red eye / blurry image problems. I owned Sony DSC-W1 and then i bought T1 and both of them have been Super products. User interface is excellent and very convinient. Images gets transferred very quickly and it have lot of image modes. I would say more then any other Digi-cam available in this series.<br /><br />If you are really looking for long term Digi-cam then go for this one... Sony rocks..... !!!","I love this camera.  Everything about it, portable, ease of use, and clarity in images.  I recently though have had a problem, I was playing around with the camera and changed the original settings I had that worked very well.<br /><br />It would be great if someone has a good settings combination and can share it with me.  So if you have an optimal settings combination please email it to me at bsidman@aol.com and also post it on this website for all to share.  I am sure that would be greatly appreciated by every cybershot owner.<br /><br />Thank you very much!","My main camera is a Digital SLR, so comparing the T1 to it head-to-head would be pointless.  I did, however, get the T1 to replace my Pentax Optio S4, and the the T1 beats it in all categories.<br /><br />The T1 starts up quickly (maybe even faster than my Canon 10D), and using a Mem Stick Duo PRO, it is FAST shot-to-shot.  You will get considerable noise when shooting above ISO 200, so get some good noise removal software to go with it if you plan to shoot in less than the brightest light (Neat Image or Noise Ninja).  The noise is quite bothersome on screen if not removed, but hardly shows in smaller prints - unless severly scrutinized under a magnifying glass.<br /><br />As previously mentioned, the flash range is quite short, but I have been able to work around this by using a lower contrast setting (and higher flash setting at times), and simply boosting the brightness in Photoshop.  So far, so good - with noise removal software, of course.  The dynamic range is quite respactable for an ultracompact, so detail can still be salvaged using this method.<br /><br />The lens is a llttle slow (3.5 at the widest) so low light performance is average at best.  The lack of a tripod mount aggravates this, so be sure to steady your hand by leaning on a table, wall or other nearby object.<br /><br />If thise were you ONLY digicam, then you may be disappointed if the utmost image quality for larger prints is what you are looking for.  But as a companion to a huge, clunky DSLR it is perfect.  Take it for what it is, a small, fashionable, ULTRAcompact digicam.","I am among the last of my friends to have bought a digital camera as I held stubbornly onto my 35-mm Canon Rebel no matter how unwieldy my camera bag got. My wait turned out to be inadvertently wise, as I think the SONY DSC-T1 is really the digital camera made specifically for me. Granted the price seems steep, but the quality of the photos have truly been a relative shock to my traditionalist senses. On a recent trip to New York, it was sheer bliss to have such a high quality camera that I could carry in my shirt pocket all day, every day. The slim size and barely-there weight are ideal for ultimate portability. And there are a variety of settings that make for some great point-and-shoot pictures, whether it's using the 5M pixel camera at 3M pixel resolution, the amazing Smart Zoom feature, or the 5 MP mode, all produce excellent results. I also like the Photoshop-like extras such as the in-camera cropping of images, and in-camera image resizing for e-mail purposes. Although I barely use it, the movie mode is top-notch, easily comparable to the high quality digital-video tape camcorders I have tried in the past, 30 frames per second at 640x480 pixel size image.<br /><br />Whether using the static or movie settings, the quality of the imagery is easily comparable to the results I get with my traditional Canon Rebel. I am amazed at the color quality, saturation and preciseness in image detail, having now produced a number of 8x10\" photos suitable for framing. Reading the 100-page instruction book is essential to maximize the features of the camera, and allow time to practice before using it for special occasion shots. And you should buy a few high cost high speed 256MB or 512MB memory cards to avoid frustrating capacity issues. I will still use my hefty Canon Rebel 35-mm camera with the even 300-mm zoom lens attachment, as I am used to the shoulder camera bag when I travel to far-away places, but the SONY DSC-T1 will serve me in a pinch whether it's taking a picture of an unexpected sunset or being backstage at the Metropolitan Opera waiting for my favorite singer or even documenting a fender bender for insurance purposes. After all, the camera one can take everywhere is truly the best camera to have.","I purchased this camera a couple of months ago, and have taken numerous shots with this little fellow. An excellent picture quality on all shots, even when I am not in the proper shooting mode. There are a lot, and I mean A LOT, of extra features in the camera, some of which I still don't even know how to use. This is a great camera, and you can't go wrong with this one. Next time, I would want a little more optical zoom, but for the size of this, it is understandable. Also, maybe a little more than the 32 MB pro duo memory card to come with it. But all-in-all, I love this camera. I got it for a great price, and with the size, you cannot go wrong.","This is what having a regular camera used to be like.  You point, focus for a second and snap the shot.  It is very easy to use for beginners and if you want you can manually delve into some of the settings.  This is good for night, day, scene shots etc...  For the underwater scuba divers, sony also sells an underwater casing for it.  You do not have to use the dock to recharge or to download.  It makes things a little easier, but is not necessary.<br /><br />  I have only 1 gripe that kept it from getting a 5 rating in my book.  There is no place for a stand on this camera.  Some people will say big deal.  I you do not have the most steady hand or a surface on the right level for your picture it is hard to get a time elapse shot right.  Or if you want to get into the picture yourself you have to find a level surface for the camera to put it on.  This is just very inconvienent.<br /><br />  Other than that a great camera for all around everyday use, and small with lots of features.  Makes everyday photography fun again.","i got this and my other sony cybershot for christmas, i was going to vegas for new years and this is discreet, easy to use, i love it.","I got this camera about a month ago and I love it!  Its so easy to use.  BUT, you need to read the owners manual and keep it handy for reference.  I've not taken a bad picture with it.","People are nuts!I have no idea what they are talking about,  this is the best camera ever..It's so easy to use and is so durable and takes great pictures..It's light and compact and I love this camera..I find no problems with it..It's so great that even all my friends are buying it..I am a mother of 2 fiesty toddlers and I can get great pictures..The best part there is no couple second delay when shooting the picture and that's why I always get that smile..If you are a parent or just looking for a small camera this the best you can get..<br /><br />I would recommed this camera to everyone...","Always having had good experiences with Sony products, and having decided it was time to go digital, I was immediately drawn to this camera, but found it wasn't \"well rated\".  It took me a while to figure out that the reviews in consumer and even photo magazines may be putting (or not putting) a dollar value on features which the individual consumer may have more or less use for.  For me, perhaps more than for them, it's hard to see the display on many cameras.<br /><br />The large display on this camera makes it easier to see what image you're going to end up with, and this makes it far superior to any other five megapixel camera I considered.  Since everyone who has been in the vicinity since I began taking pictures with it has been impressed, I believe any photographer will appreciate this feature.<br /><br />The small, flat, size also makes it as convenient as, well, a camera phone, and you can't take pictures if your camera is too much of a nuisance to carry around.","I am one of the most skeptical people you will meet and I am also very neurotic, which means when it came to doing the research for a new digital camera I was extremely thourough.  The first thing I did was place a call to my geekiest friend who I knew I would recieve good advice from.  Knowing what I was looking for in a camera he instantly suggested the sony dsc t1.  I began to read approx. 150 reviews only to become very confused by all the horrible reviews I was reading.  I called my buddy back to ask what he thought about this and he told me to STOP reading user reviews, because most people who write a review never have anything good to say and he suggested i check out steves digcam online for a very thorough and informed review.  I did this and found that the camera got quite a wonderful review on this site, and I figured if I read anymore I wouldn't end up with a camera...just a headache!  I purchased the sony dsc t1(which also came highly recommonded from the salesman) and I could not be happier with my purchase.  Once you get past the cool level of the camera, based on size, sleekness and overall screaming of \"play with me\" by this camera you'll find it is much more than that.  It takes excellent pictures.  Is extremely easy to use, and like you'll read in most of the good reviews of this camera, the suggestion to READ THE MANUAL, is very beneficial.  All the naysayers out there seem to me, to have no idea how to use this camera, because I can't believe all the complaints people seem to have, with blur, and red eye, and blah blah blah.  The truth of the matter is that all cameras have idio syncracies and as the owner it is your job to figure them out and make the appropriate adjustments, and if you take the time to read this manual you'll find how easy it is to correct the problems you might find your having, and then you'll find what a joy this pocket size marvel is.  Last but not least, I am very much a beginner, but what I've learned quickly is that any program you use, be it photoshop, picture manager, and my recommended Picasa2 from google, the ease in which you can correct problems like red eye or sharpness, blurring etc.  are as easy to fix as one click away, so if your worried that your pictures dont look good when viewed on your beautifully massive lcd screen, DONT.  Thats not the way you or your friends are going to look at your pictures.  They'll see the pictures that you've taken time to correct(if you need to) on your computer, to which I promise can be absolutely stunning if you take a little time.  I guess what I'mn trying to say is BUY THIS CAMERA AND YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!","I bought the DSC-T1 as a replacement for my older and E:92.00 code plagued DSC-P50. My older Sony Cyber-shot lasted for years and I've had trust in Sony for all sorts of products. However like the other reviews state, this camera is NOT the best when it comes to indoors/flash pictures. They come out too dark, out of focus, and red eye redux will not work. I learned this the hard way at an indoor event. I tried Auto and manual settings but still I was only able to capture a few good shots. I was able to capture better pictures that night with my old DSC-P50. Another issue is battery life; it just doesn't cut it for an event that will go on for hours. Also I bought a 512mb card because the supplied one is worthless. But for outdoor pictures, MPEG at 640 Fine, being compact, features and the USB cradle, it gets a 5. But for everything else I give it a 3. I wish I had researched this better. The DSCP-100 would have been better for what I need. Note: Most vendors don't exchange digital cameras and those that do, charge a 15% restocking fee. So be aware of your final purchase.","I love it.  I wanted a tiny camera to tote everywhere for any moment.  It's quick and easy and you can edit right on it.  The zoom in great and you can zoom even more once the picture is taken.  I'm so impressed, it's exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I've found that I can't figure out is that it takes great pictures outside and not nearly as great inside.","I recently bought the Sony DSC-T1 after doing a lot of research on digital cameras. I chose the DSC-T1 because of what I was looking for in a digital camera; convenience, and portability. I wanted to be able to take pictures whenever I desired, and be sure I was able to as well. I can carry this camera everywhere I go. Although, this is not your typical tiny digital camera, the DSC-T1 requires more attention than one might want to give a point-and-shoot camera. I strongly recommend reading the manual in order to better understand the camera and all the different modes. Learning a little about photography wouldn't hurt either, since you're gonna be investing a few hundred dollars into the subject. Best of luck to everyone.","I bought this camera a little over a week ago.  Honestly I was a little afraid getting it because of all the negative feedback.  Since I had a week to try it out I too a chance and bought it.  Circuit city matched the sale price of Wolf Camera and I got it (...) which isn't bad when you think that the New York stores were almost as much and I got my camera that day without having to wait over a week.  I have not printed off any pictures yet, but they seem to be nice, clear and sharp.  What sold me on this camera first was the big Lcd and the thinness of the camera itself.  I had my choices limited down to two that being the P150 and the T1.  The T1 finally won out because of its size and big lcd.  Yes, the camera is a little weak on the flash, but the pictures aren't all that bad.  Yes, the memory sticks are a little high when comared to some others.  You don't have to buy the Sony brand which cost almost 30 dollars more.  I picked up a 512 MB (...).  The camera is very easy to use.  No, I haven't had a picture yet that came out blurry.  I don't know what these other people are talking about.  Yes, you have to be a little careful that your finger is not covering the lens, but hey you can see it if it is there.  The camera is fast to start up and ready to shoot.  The lcd is a little darker than your smaller ones, but not so much as to make a big difference.  Yes, the battery could last a little longer, but then I don't think I will take more than a 150 pictures a day, or use the camera for up to 90 minutes.<br />Overall if you are looking for a small good camera, this is it.  Sure there are others out there that are better for the price, but then they are much bigger and bulkier too.","I got this for my brother for Christmas and he couldn't be happier.  The camera is not much larger than a credit card and nearly as thin.  And unbelievably it has 5 megapixel digital resolution.  Essentially it has incredible features and resolution for a camera its size.  This is highly recommended for a simple point-and-shoot digital camera.","My first problem is the lack of a tripod mount. There is NO excuse for a $500.00 camera to lack this most basic part- even if it were a part of the USB cradle. While I am on the subject of USB- You cannot connect to your computer unless you sit it inside the cradle, or buy another special cable to plug directly into the camera. My final peeve with this camera is that it eats it's battery even when turned off. Charge the battery, put it in your bag, and 3 days later, the battery is at 50% capacity.<br /><br />On the + side, the display is wonderful, and picture quality is excellent as well. But unless you absolutely have to have the tiny size, you can do a LOT better.","I bought this camera for my wife while on our last motorcycle trip to Yellowstone.  She knows nothing about technology but this camera is so simple to use she took hundreds of pictures, some while we were moving, and they turned out fantastic.  She even took movie clips while were riding through the mountains and I must say they are really fun to watch.  I never dreamed that they could turn out so good from such a small camera.<br /><br />You will see some redeye when shooting indoors with flash, but any photo program you use can easily remove the redeye before you print them out.<br /><br />We love this camera also because it is easy to keep with you and get those shots you always missed before.<br /><br />Battery life is great.  Easily take pictures all day long and have battery life left.  Charges quickly and easily.<br /><br />Good luck and hope this helps.","I bought this camera for my wife as a Christmas present in Dec 2004.<br /><br />This camera is so cool. At first I was very unsure about the purchase of this camera with all the negative reviews. But once I got the camera and READ THE MANUAL, this camera takes pictures I can't believe! The pictures are crisp and clear! I was very scared about the reviews on blurry pictures... If you hold the button halfway before you shoot the camera auto focus kicks in!<br /><br />I don't understand all the negative reviews on this camera...It is all it is worked up to be and more!<br /><br />I'm very, very happy!!!!!!!","I was looking for a digital camera that was small enough for my wife to carry in her purse for vacations, travel, and for everyday photo opportunities. Purchased an additional 512 memory stick and with the exceptional battery life, we usually travel  without the cables and charger for weekend trips (3-5 days).  Image quality is excellent.  Simple to use, provided that you don't utilize all the features. Very powerful if you want to take the time to use all the features.  Overall it has exceeded the expectaions for small size and performance.","This is our 3rd sony camera and I love them all, but this one.. wow the pictures are so clear, the screen size is huge, and the compact size is amazing. I keep it in my purse all the time for those shots when your just at the playground with the kids and you'd have wished you had your camera, WELL I DO... all the time and use it almost everyday.  So easy to use, and such an amazing camera.  I would never buy anything but sony, ever.  You'll LOVE this camera, it truely is the best!","Judging from the extreme differences of reviews of this product, it makes me think we aren't talking about the same camera.  I bought this camera after doing EXTENSIVE research and I am ecstatic with my decision.  I compared this to the Canon Elph, Kodak, and Olympus models.  The DSC-T1 just had more features and the HUGE LCD was ultimately the deciding factor.  Blurry photos??  Red Eye??  I have taken pics while running, of subjects that are moving quickly, in every type of light imagineable at various distances and NOT ONE TRACE OF BLURRY PHOTOS OR RED EYE.  There must be some defected cameras going around because I CANNOT GET THIS CAMERA TO TAKE A BAD PICTURE.  The ONLY downside is the program mode, which doesn't offer much flexibility.  No big deal to me.  I am generally a point and shoot type of photographer anyway.  The movie mode is unbelievable.  With a 512MB duo card, you can get at least 20 minutes of video at the standard picture quality.  Looks FANTASTIC viewing in Windows media player.  The dock is a great tool to charge your camera at the same time you are viewing them either on your computer or TV.  YOU CAN CHARGE THE CAMERA WITHOUT THE DOCK WITH THE SUPPLIED POWER CORD.  But you shouldn't need to very often, the batter life is EPIC and has a counter in minutes of how much juice you have left. VERY COOL!  The more and more I use this camera the more I like it.  If something were to happen to this camera, I would instantly go out and buy another.  It breaks my heart to hear the negative reviews of this product.  Most of them contain statements that simply are not true.  I have been showing off this camera to my friends and family for 2 months now.  3 of which now own their own and are as happy with their purchase as I am.  That is best thing that could possibly be said about any product.","This camera rocks! The 2.5 in LCD display is amazing, the camera takes incredible pictures that are highly detailed. Everyone that says the photos are blurry, there is an easy way to prevent this from happening...keep your hands steady when taking a picture, its that simple. I have had no problem with red-eye thanks to the built in red eye reduction option. I love that i can record small movies with sound then easily upload them to my computer. This camera is very user friendly. If youve got the cash, pick this one up...no regrets from me.","This camera takes great pictures.  The only bad thing is sometimes it does show up with red eyes.  When i bought this camera I was worried about the quality of the pictures(because of all the bad reviews on Amazon).  When i first got it out and took some pictures they were blurry.  But when i read my manual ,and found out to take the pictures right, they couldn't get any better.  So to all you people that complain about the quality of the pictures, I suggest you sit down and read your manual","I have recently purchased this digital camera, and like many others, fell in love with it right away. Problems/issues that other reviewers have noted do come up. I have already found ways of resolving them, either in the manual, or simply by trial and error. Photography is a hobby that takes patience. Digital photography is no different.<br /><br />It seems like many had high expectations for this camera, given it's $500 price tag. I agree that the price is a little too high for what you are getting in the DSC-T1. Realize that this still is considered a simple point-and-shoot camera though.<br /><br />This is the perfect camera if you're looking to carry a digital camera everywhere you go. The picture quality is very good, and realize that different conditions while taking the pictures need different settings. If you're looking for a camera that will take perfect pics on the Auto-everything mode... good luck with that!<br /><br />Blurry pictures are usually a result of camera movement. Like other reviewers have said, because of the compact size of DCS-T1 it makes it more difficult to steady in your hand(s). Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of it. I also recommend that if the situation permits (time), you press the shutter button down halfway to allow the camera to focus and get a better read on the surrounding conditions, before pressing all the way. There is another reviewer who said that their blurry picture issue was resolved after a reset, which is worth a try too if you want. I have not had to reset my camera.<br /><br />The battery life is great. The AC adapter does connect directly to the camera, if needed. The Duo Memory stick is not too big of a problem simply because Sony includes the MS adapter, so the Duo will work in MS Pro slots just as easily. Definitely buy larger capacity MS Pro Duo sticks (most from SanDisk come with MS Pro adaptors). A tip for the LCD screen: cut to size and place a PDA screen protector over it for added protection against scratches.<br /><br />If you're frustrated with your DSC-T1, don't get discouraged so quickly. Keep using it, keep reading about it, and you'll find that it really is a great camera.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars. Not 5 stars because of the price.","This camera takes very nice pictures.  However pictures with flash are difficult.  Your subject has to be close, much closer than other cameras I have seen.  It has a feature to increase the flashwhich helps slightly but they usually come out dark.<br /><br />I have read the manual thoroughly and it is pretty good but I still do have questions.  One writer says that there is a tripod mount available.  I will look for it because it would come in handy for dark shots.  I have taken night pictures in Hong Kong which would be very nice if I could have held the camera steady enough.","I'm a die-hard Sony fan and have owned many Sony cameras, but I do not recommend this one: Far too many blurry pictures.","I was in the market of purchasing a digital camera about a month ago.  It was a hard decision it was between the Canon s500 and the Sony DSC-T1.  Well, it all boiled down to price and I wound up buying the Canon S500.  I got the camera and was impressed with the photos but wasn't impressed about the speed.  I have a 18month old and everytime I was ready to take a picture of him, he would turn his head when the camera would actually take the picture.  It was very slow and frustrating. I then decided to look at the T1 after the fact and found out the camera is very fast in taking pictures.  To make a long story short, I wound up selling my canon and buying the SONY.  It was the best decision I can make.  The picture quality is the same or better than the canon and it is SOO MUCH FASTER in taking pictures and transferring pictures.  I highly reccomend the camera.","Before you purchase this camera go somewhere where you can physically handle it. The size is VERY  small and the controls are close for anyone who has above medium sized hands. The memory format is not  the standard Sony memory stick, it is the new Duo which is a good format but not widely accepted ( remember the BetaMax).  We used a friends for as day and then opted for the DSC W1 which is more user friendly( the camera<br /><br />takes a great picture but you have to be very conscious of the mode and where those extra fingers are!). Again go somewhere where you can handle this unit.<br /><br /> Sony didn't quite get this one............","I bought this camera a couple of months ago, and I'm enjoying it very much. Fits perfectly on any pocket, take great shots and movies, it's very easy to use, and defintly have a WOW feature. For those who want a small amateur camera and yet powerful I recommed.<br /><br />Cons: In fact, when using the flash, you'll get red eyes even those people who aren't looking directly to the camera, but it can be easyly fixed turning on the red eye reduction feature.<br /><br />The flash have a very limited range.<br /><br />You can easyly slip a finger in the camera lens, so you must pay attention every time. Yet, when you ask someone to shot with this camera, you must warn him too.<br /><br />Some shot that I took indoor looked poor when it comes to color depth, but I can't really blame the camera because the light was poor.<br /><br />Pros: Very easy to use, even my father that never used a digital camera before took great photos.<br /><br />Very small and slim, yet with a huge lcd and amazing features.<br /><br />The movies are amazing, it looked perfect on tv (shooting on fine, with a memory stick PRO).<br /><br />Great shots, full of color and detail.<br /><br />Fast startup and fast recording.<br /><br />I never had problems with the focus, it worked fine all the time, even when using the macro (I use the camera on auto most of the time). Try to push the button half way down before take the picture, it'll force the camera to focus and lock on the subject. For those who had problems with it, I recomend to read the manual for tips about focusing.<br /><br />You don't need to use the cradle to charge the battery. You can directly connect the camera on the ac adaptor (you can find this information on the manual too).<br /><br />For those who are complaning about the tripod, I belive that you're not looking for a small amateur camera.","I got my T-11 in August and have been struggling with blurry pictures. It almost looks like the camera is taking a double exposure. I finally called Sony customer service and they recommended reseting camera. After the reboot the camera began taking amazing pictures and they are crystal clear Even if shot indoors at night. The procedure is simple and is the the service manual. It is the first thing in the trouble shooting section.  Just removed the battery and memory stick from camora and push the reset button (located back side lower right corner) in for 20 seconds with a tooth pick. Put memory stick and battery back in and turn it on. Then set time and start taking great pictures.","I spent about an hour and a half last night debating between the Sony T1 5 MP and the Canon Power Shot A95.<br /><br />I'm sure my friend and I drove the poor sales clerk crazy - but he was very patient and we examined each extensively.<br /><br />I walked into the store primarily considering three cameras -- the Nikon CoolPix 5200, the Cybershot DSCP 100, and the Canon A95.  Going in I'd done a lot of research and found the A95's reputation is outstanding.  But Sony's general reputation -- and especially on the Cybershot DSCP 100 -- is outstanding too.<br /><br />The store was out of the Nikon, and since it had been the camera I was least impressed with after reading the reviews, I didn't worry about it too much.  The DSCP 100 had all the right numbers and features, but didn't feel right to me for some reason.  Maybe the shape threw me off?  Honestly, I'm not sure.  But the vibe wasn't right and so I asked to see the A95.<br /><br />By this time, the clerk and I had started chatting, and he pulled out the T1.  Honestly, I had not come across the T1 in my research, so when the store clerk pulled out this little gem from behind the counter, I was blown away.<br /><br />The thing is tiny.  And oh-so-beautiful.  The LCD screen on the back is almost the same size as the screen on my Treo 600 -- on other words, huge.  The camera felt great in my hands.  And a Zeiss lens -- wow.  That's top quality there.  As soon as I touched it, I began lusting after this mystery camera.  But was it any good?<br /><br />But let me digress.  The A95 is solid.  Just pure solid.  Nice quality.  Good build.  Picture quality looks good.  Screen is ... well, small -- especially compared to the T1.  The A95 is physically a much larger camera -- though surprisingly, the weight felt about the same as the T1.  Controls seemed intuitive and it's got lots of settings to play around with, but that don't get in the way of taking a simple snap shot.<br /><br />But the T1 has the sex appeal.  So I kept going back to it.  Without reviews, I was flying a little blind, but the fit and finish felt good.  And, did I mention the sex appeal?<br /><br />But as I kept looking, practicality began creeping into the deliberations.  For instance, the T1 uses a Sony-proprietary battery and memory system.  The A95 uses AA batteries and SD memory.<br /><br />There's no way of easily protecting the T1's super-large (and super fragile) LCD screen.  The A95's LCD flips around so that the screen is protected by the camera body.<br /><br />The T1 has no view finder and no way to take pictures if you aren't using the LCD.  The A95 can be used with or without the LCD (which increases battery life).<br /><br />The T1 has a 3x optical zoom.  The A95 has a 3x optical zoom, coupled with a digital zoom.<br /><br />The T1 has no tripod mount.  The A95 does.<br /><br />\"Weighing\" in favor of the T1 are the A95's larger size, smaller screen, and the \"cool\" factor of the T1.<br /><br />As I played with both cameras (until the store just about closed), I noted a couple of other things about the T1 in the back of my mind.  It wasn't until I read many of the reviews here that these perceptions began to crystallize.<br /><br />Holding the T1 steady is a major issue.  (With the A95 I was able to take handheld low-light, no-flash pictures with minimal blurring.)  The flash on the T1 was ho-hum.  And despite the large LCD screen, telling which images were crisp and which were blurry was a major challenge with the T1.  Really, the only way to tell would be to download the images to your computer before deciding which pictures are keepers and which are deleters.<br /><br />In the end, I listened to my wallet and my brain.  I bought the A95.  I needed reliability and quality more than glamour and glitz.  The SD storage cards are about half the price as the Sony cards -- and that issue of the proprietary batteries is a big one.<br /><br />So far so good -- picture quality on the A95 looks good, although I can tell that I'm going to have to learn to use the different \"scene\" settings in order to get the best out of the camera.  Even so, the A95 is easy to use.  (It even fit perfectly in a cheap generic camera case!)  I'll have to post again as I get to know my new camera better.<br /><br />Hopefully you'll find this review of use.  In the end -- both cameras are keepers in my opinion.  Which one you pick is probably more a matter of personal preference than anything else.  Good luck to everyone in picking out the right camera!","The Sony T1 fits comfortably in any pocket, is easy to use, and takes terrific pictures.  The LCD screen can be described as \"monstrously huge\", but that's being a bit conservative.  That said, here are a few thoughts to get the most out of it:<br /><br />  1. When taking pictures, make sure to hold the shutter button down until the photo is done.  The camera is so small that any movement can make a shot blurry.<br /><br />  2. Use the optional strap; sooner or later this camera will slip out of your fingers.  Trust me on this one.<br /><br />  3. DEFINITELY buy a hard case (eBay was my source).  The LCD screen is huge, and it can't be protected by soft cases, which are the only kind that Sony makes.  BAD Sony!  NAUGHTY Sony!","I bought this camera when it first came to the states early last spring.  I love the size of the LCD, write speed and video capabilities.  There are two problems with this camera that I wanted to share just so everyone can make an informed decision.<br /><br />1) The LCD is impossible to see in dimly light setting, even with the background set to high. (i.e., bars, natural formations like caves, some unlit tourist sites at dusk) The only way to make out what you're shooting is to switch into night mode.  The problem here is that night mode with blur your picture without a tripod as the shutter is held open longer to bring in more light.  I ran into this problem over and over again and it was one of two times I ever cared that the camera doesn't have an optical viewfinder.<br /><br />2) While the huge LCD screen is wonderful for taking pictures, understand it is vulnerability for the camera.  While I was traveling in China, my LCD screen was damaged, rendering my camera 100% useless.  The cases Sony sells are crap, they do not actually protect the camera as none of them are a true hard case.  I mention how easily the screen can be damaged because Sony charges $450 to **TRY** to repair the LCD screen.  That is roughly the same cost as buying a new camera.  I have yet to find a private dealer that can or will repair it and believe me, I've looked.<br /><br />Basically, if you intend to do extensive traveling, this camera is a liability.  Without a viewfinder you have no backup plan and my find yourself as I did, in a beautiful foreign place with a non-functioning camera and no means to replace it.  If you are getting this to take out with your friends when you go out at night, again, opt of a camera with a viewfinder.  You cannot see the LCD in the dark.  If these things are not of concern for you, this camera is a wonderful little machine which produces beautiful images.","Love this camera, my husband says \"more than him\".  Does everything except wash the dishes.  Have had my camera since My 2004, still learing new ways in which to use the camera each day.<br /><br />Love putting videos together to make a film.  Everyone who sees my camera is totally impressed.  Dottie L Holland","I read every review on every site and in every magazine I could find before buying this camera. All of the professional reviewers said it took great pictures. The amature reviewers were a mixed lot, with some claiming it took poor pictures. I decided to go with the pros and purchase this item.<br /><br />I'm glad I did. First, it does take great pictures IF YOU READ THE MANUAL. Red Eye reduction is turned OFF by default, you have to turn it ON to get rid of red eye. The flash has 3 settings, and it is in the MIDDLE one by default. Turn up the flash to HIGH and it works great indoors. Hold the camera STEADY when you take the picture, regardless of light conditions, and you'll get very sharp photos. Memory Stick Pro Duo cards aren't that expensive, especially if you buy the Lexmar ones, and the price just was cut by Sony. The charger is very compact, and unless you plan on taking more than 180 photos on your trip, you don't even need to bring it with you. The view screen is very viewable at night, if you change the default NORMAL setting to HIGH. Finally, the complaint about the tripod is absurd: please don't tell you bought the smallest camera on the market so you can use a tripod to take photos: get a larger camera and use this for what it is designed for. A tripod with this is like using a sports car to pull a trailer. If you insist on a tripod mount, get the active sleeve case from Sony ($25 on Amazon), which adds a tripod mount to the camera.<br /><br />Pros: Crisp, sharp photos. Very compact design (size of a deck of cards). Bright, sharp, large view screen. Solid construction. Good manual.<br /><br />Cons: Expensive, but worth it. You have to read the manual to get the most out of it.","We love this camera.  It's small size, ease of use... the only problem is the Memory Stick Duo.  We bought a 256 mb stick and every so often (and more than we'd like for sure) the memory stick kicks back an error message and we can't take pictures anymore.  We have to power down then power up again to take another picture.  This has been happening more and more and we've only had the camera less than 2 months.  We've tried reformatting the stick several times to no avail.  Not sure what to do next.  But the problem with the memory aside, it's a fantastic camera.  Just hope there's a way around this problem.","I received this camera on Friday.  I had read ALL the review posted here and was a bit nervous about some of the concerns that have been mentioned.  The balance of positive reviews convinced me to give it a try and I am VERY happy I did. This is my 3rd digital camera so far, canon powershot, nikon coolpix and now the sony. The Sony is my favorite already!<br /><br />I took the camera to Las Vegas for a party weekend to try it out. My real concern with the camera was blurry images. The camera is VERY small and I worried that I would not be able to hold it still while shooting and get a lot of motion blur in pics. I didn't get a SINGLE blurry image all weekend.  It shot crystal clear shots consistently and under all conditions. I shot while dancing, running... all ways and never had an issue! You just have to find a comfortable way to hold the camera.<br /><br />The lens is easy to drop your finger in front of... but if you pay attention to what you are doing, this doesn't need to be a problem.<br /><br />The GIANT LCD display is probably my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE thing about this camera!!  It is SO clear and BIG!! You can see GREAT detail in every photo with it!  Serious PROPS on the designer of that element!<br /><br />I read complaints about the flash on it.  First, the color of the flash is GREAT!  I know of several digitals that when  you shoot semi-close, they turn everything yellow. This one is perfect.  There are settings for the strength of the flash as well that you can adjust.  It isn't ANY weaker than any other digital camera on the market!  You cannot expect to shoot super far away with the tiny flash that you get on a point and shoot digital. It is sufficient in strength for what the camera is intended for.  And, if you read the manual you will learn that there are wasy to change the metering of the camera for shooting far away in lower light situtations. Like any other electronic item you should spend a little time familiarizing yourself with all the settings before complaining about something you simply have not taken the time to understand.<br /><br />Red eye setting on camera works great as well!!  Not sure why others are having trouble with that. Maybe they have just not figured out how to turn the setting to ON.<br /><br />The interactive menu is really easy to figure out and work.  The pre-programmed settings are vast and very cool.  They have a setting for almost any codition and the AUTO program worked perfectly for all different lighting conditions.<br /><br />It has a very sturdy casing which is perfect for me...  Feels like it will stand the test of time. I had a problem with my Nikon Coolpix because the casing was such lightweight plastic and after a week had to tape battery door closed.  Very cheap and flimsy materials used on it.. but The sony FEELS very sturdy!<br /><br />The drop down lens cover is perfect. It drops and BAM, ready to shoot. Looking at the product photo's on Amazon of this camera you can't really tell how it works. I almost thought that it didn't have a lens cover and was very relieved when it arrived and found it does.<br /><br />I recommed the largest memory card you can afford for this baby!  5mp will fill a card in NO time.  Of course you don't have to shoot that big and get more on the card but it is great to have the option! Why buy a 5mp unless you are going to shoot em! ;)<br /><br />All in all I am REALLY pleased with this camera.  No challenge to speak of for me! Great price on Amazon for it as well!","I bought this camera a month or so ago and love it.  I was on vacation though and wanted to take some sunset pictures.  I was quite disappointed to realize it didn't have a screw for a tripod for darker shots.  Well, I work at a machine shop and designed one.<br />It works quite well and I'm selling them on ebay now. (...)<br />I use it and it works awesome.  Sony should have included this with there package.","well i got this camera as a gift from my mom and after it was great!!! this camera has really risen up to it's reputation and it has really left me fascinated by the wonedrs of sch a small thing . with this camera i can do various things like ( obiously ) take pics and shoot movies and many other things. this camera was good for me in my trip to new york , chile, sanfransisco, and it also held very handy on some other trips of mine. to wrap it up in simple and descrite words .....this camera rocks!!!!! now i know tis may be a kid talking but i know good merchindize when i experience one and this truthfuly good product is worth all the money and all the rage.","I have been holding off on buying a digital camera for some time now, but I could no longer resist the inevitable pull of technology.  So, after doing some research and going to a local Best Buy to play with some cameras, I settled on the Sony DSC.<br />I am very happy with my choice.  The camera is extremely easy to use.  I was surprised at how easy it is to take short movies -- one of my first videos turned out great and I emailed to a bunch of friends immediately.<br />A down point:  The camera does have an issue taking pictures in low light.  The flash is inadequate and night-time indoor pictures have a lot of blurriness.  Daytime photos, however, have turned out great with excellent sharpness.<br />The 32MB card it comes with is good for a few photos and a couple of short videos.  Definitely upgrade to a larger card at purchase.  I've been told that a 128 MB card holds 60 pics at 5MP, and 80 at 3:2 ratio.","The coolest camera you can own for the money! If you actually learn how to use the camera by reading the manual you will have killer photos. All the complaints about blury pictures are the result of people not taking the time to learn how to use this equipment...period.","Although this is a 5MP camera, it has a small lens and low power flash. This is the camera you put in your pocket rather than over your shoulder. If you can accept the trade-offs and want the ultimate in portability this unit is great. I wasn't interested in the video when I got it. I'm so impressed I want a bigger MS so I can do more. Picture quality is fair-good depending on lighting. It's not for art, it's for photos.","I read some of the negative reviews about this camera and I was reluctant to purchase it, even though I had read the good reviews.  When I went to the store to see and test the camera, I was amazed that the picture quality was so good - and I knew the people writing the bad reviews were somehow wrong.  I picked the camera up in the store, without reading any instruction manual, and took a picture in the store, which was then printed out for me on a HP 145. The picture was so clear... that sold me right then.  I knew then that all I had to do was read and work with the camera a little and I was set.  Have since taken the camera on vacation and I love it.  My pictures overall are 100% better than I have ever taken and the fun and ease of this camera is great...not to mentin the wow factor if you like new little cameras.","This camera is awesome!!! and the best thing is that is very easy to use and practical to carry it, the images are incredible even for night shots it has in its menu the option of night shot and the new fireworks that allows you to take pictures to those magnifiscent shows in the sky you will then see them in your camera even clearer than live!!.<br /><br /> It also has the beach mode that helps you to take pictures with a lot of sun and they will appear in the lcd screen as if you were in any place but in the beach, the snow mode is very useful too because in that case the image wont be that \"bright\" because of the snow it will appear like a beautiful postcard, forget about bad pictures in every weather, every place.<br /><br /> I also tested it taking pictures to a tv show and it looks like if you were taking a pic to a real person it erases the lines that usually are on the tv screen this a bonus thing huh!.<br /><br /> You may think that it uses a different memory stick because it is smaller but don't worry!! in the package it has an adaptor to make a normal memory stick so you can insert it in your computers (vaio users) or printers.<br /><br /> Also one of the things of why I bought this camera is because of the battery, forget about alkaline or rechargable AA batteries it includes a special one that lasts a lot!! so don't worry about this.<br /><br /> BUY THIS CAMERA IS THE BEST OPTION","You are reading this review because you are wanting the best compact camera on the market.<br /><br /> I wanted a Camera which fits in my shirt pocket (or my wife's handbag)- YES<br /><br /> I wanted high resolution pictures - 5MPs - YES<br /><br /> I wanted the biggest and clearest LCD Screen - YES<br /><br /> I wanted to take pictures from cold in under 3 secs - YES<br /><br /> I wanted to take high quality pictures - YES - 101 5MP photos from 256MB Card<br /><br /> I wanted to take great quality video - YES - 11mins from 256MB Card<br /><br /> I wanted quality fast zoom - YES, 3x with the bonus it is internal!<br /><br /> Does it have it's faults - YES - too easy to put a finger over the lens.<br /><br /> Battery life is very good but with it's fast startup you don't need to keep the camera on all the time even for those spur of the moment shots. Slide the camera cover down and you are ready to take that photo in few seconds. Coupled with my Canon i990 Printer it can provide a 6x4inch photo-quality print in under a minute (from taking photo)using the pictbridge direct printer connection.<br /><br /> If you use the video option then I recommend a Tripper 20GB Portable Storage System so you can transfer you precious photos/videos to hard drive in the field/on a beach/top of a mountain. Also have a spare battery as it does drain it faster.<br /><br /> It is a Camera designed to be used anytime, anywhere.","I have owned numerous digital cameras over the years, but the Sony T1 is the one I would pick if I could only have one.  It is compact, turns on easily, intuitively, and quickly.  Good battery life.  High picture quality (at least for a non-pro camera).  Slips into your pocket.  No annoying retracting/extending lens.  A great lens (Carl Zeiss is the kind used on Hasselblad cameras).  3x Optical zoom.  Very large LCD screen - and it is VISIBLE in daylight.  More features than most will ever use, but there if you need them.  The only shortcoming is the small flash - it's only good out to about 5-6 feet - but hey, if you're further away than that for a picture of a person, you're too far away!  This is a great everyday camera - I carry mine with me all the time, which makes it a camera that actually gets used, rather than just collecting dust in the closet.","I don't know what the one reviewer is complaining about when he says that the camera can't be directly plugged into the charger. Mine can and I usually leave the dock at home when I travel and just carry the charger with me. For storage I purchased a Timbuk2 soft case that is designed for the iPod and then if I'm really paranoid I put the whole assembly inside a small Pelican case. Anything that breaks this combo will probably kill me, so I'm not too concerned. The only complaint I have with the unit is the fact that it uses the Memory Stick Pro for storage, which is a smaller form factor memory stick that is incompatible with other Sony Memory Sticks. Save yourself some money and purchase the SanDisk Memory Stick Pro instead of the Sony. It works just as well. All in all this is a fantastic compact camera that produces great pictures, and the movie mode is lots of fun.","I bought this camera and I feel like a spy guy using it. It is not a toy but it rocks out loud dude. BUY BUY BUY!!! I would take sony over canon any time.","Sony you've done it again. You made and awsome amd expensive camera. This is highly recommended for all ages over 10. Go SONY.","This little jewel is fantastic! It is state of the art Sony design and takes excellent shots with the Zeiss lens! I was attracted to the small size but big features of this camera. It will fit easily in your pocket and the dock is small and easy to store if you travel. Sure, Sony only includes a 32meg memory stick but hey do you blame them? I bought the 256meg and it will take 100 pics at 5 megapixs. The 2.5 in display is fantastic for quick views. And the camera allows you to use fully auto features for ease of use or there are many custom features for those who so choose. The color is superb. I use Microsoft picture it software and never have to edit color. I would highly recommend this to someone looking for great features in an attractive sleek package.","could someone help me to obtain the best results as I am very unimpressed at this time. The manual is not helping me. I know that I am a very bad camera user so maybe this is not as friendly as they tell me. Have seen some great outdoor pictures but not mine. Leon  PLEASE IF SOMEONE HAS THE TIME FOR AN OLDEN PLEASE TELEPHONE ME 020 8977 2125 and ask for LEON.","I have owned this camera for three weeks now.  I have some spectacular pictures from the top of a mountain, from a motorcycling trip and some close-ups.  Every picture is crystal clear!!!  I've taken motion shots, still shots, and video using many different features of this camera...again all extremely clear.  My pictures have been taken in the dark and bright lights.  This camera has exceeded my expectations.  The compact design allows me to take this camera anywhere.  On the motorcycling trip I took video while traveling down the road at 60 miles an hour...while watching the video I felt like I was back on the bike!  I took pictures of objects moving in front of the bike....unbelievable!  Battery life and the memory are going strong.  I have printed out several pictures on glossy 8x10...they look professional and they're going up on my wall.  I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a small, easy to use, quality camera!!!","very easy to use point and shoot.  fast picture taking ability and does a good job auto-focusing.  with 256 mb card, can hold 140 pics at default settings (5mp, fine).  lcd screen is awesome and makes this camera a joy to use and review shots to ensure you got what you wanted.  couple minor annoyances...battery will fall out when you open compartment, no locking feature on front lense cover (sometimes it will open on its own in your purse/pocket), no included carrying case....to protect lcd screen while in pockets or purse from scratches.<br />quality of pictures is on par or better than my olympus c4000 at 1/4 th the size.<br />docking station is fast with usb 2.0 instead of 1.1 like most others.  recharges battery in under 3 hours.<br />this camera has impressed me....size, quality, and easy to use.<br />i recommend for those that want to carry a camera with them at all times without extra luggage.","I have had the Canon S400 4 mega pixel a new 5 mega pixel is either in stores or on the way! But my SISTER has the Sony cybershot and I have the Canon have ended or feud over which camera is best! CANON has won out! The Sony was one camera I wanted  but came to market too later. Its 5 mega pixel and LARGE LCD screen along with Sony name attracted me. I chose the Canon based on reviews and awards and BOY were they right.<br />The Sony weak points:<br />Large LCD screen is SO weak vivid wise and details compared to the canon. One would expect to see bright vivid crisp images on the larger LCD from Sony but you DON'T!<br />The Canon after taking images you can tell if the image is sharp and not fuzzy. Only playback the images on the smaller than the Sony LCD is just unreal. Sony offers a weak  non detailed image while the canon shows an explosive crisp image that cant be beat!<br />Too many images taken on the Sony come out fuzzy on my sister camera while very few come out fuzzy on the Canon S400. The Sony takes time to focus the image on the large LCD and even then you can tell even with zooming in on images  is still difficult.<br />The Canon is WAY better price wise, image quailty at 4 mega pixel, LCD screen abilities and I could not be happier. My sister feels bad she may have gotten the raw deal on the Sony which I am advising her to return.","This version of the Sony Cybershot is a very good product.<br />I'm the kind of guy who loves to take a zillion of photos wherever he is, but rather than ruining or bringin around the bulk of a Leica, I like to have a small good camera in my pocket.<br />This 5 meg camera meets all my requirements. Very good pictures, small bulk, long battery life. Plus it records movies and sounds with great precision.<br />I have no problem with the lid which I actually like very much. I keep the camera without any protection in the pocket of my jeans: the lid has never opened by itself, as it requires a certain amount of pressure. Plus it protects the lense in a very good fashion.<br />Dock, charger, etc are kind of bulky. But the dock is avoidable if you don't want to carry it around.<br />Flaw: red eye happens frequently in night photos. The lens seems a bit too close to the flash, and this could be the reason. The Red Eye Reducer (available as an option in the camera's software) gives no comfort against such issue.<br />Bottom Line:<br />I like this camera very much, fits my pocket as my cellphone, makes great pictures, is a 5 megapix, has good software going on.","I've owned many cameras.  Canon SLR, Olympus mini SLR, several point and shoot 35mm's, and a Minolta Dimage7 at 5.2 megapixels.  This is the only product I've felt moved to rate on the internet.  I have to say I like this camera better than any of them.  I bought it for an overseas vacation as I didn't want the weight of the Minolta around my neck.  This camera seemed to outperform everything around it in any situation.  The night and fireworks setting came in handy at the Eiffel tower at night (gorgeous color and clarity of shot), the closeup mode for the baby bird in the tree (every tiny aspect of the pinfeathers is there-amazing)and other things, the no flash setting for those great paintings in the museum.  I have to say one of the things that impresses me most is this camera's ability to capture correct color under a great variety of situations.  My Minolta had more trouble doing that.  The white balance selectors are much more accurate on the Sony and the setting for accurate capture with flash is very impressive.  True, red eye does appear now and then, but hey, I can put up with it.  This camera is fabulous.  Don't let anyone kid you.  GET ONE.  no, Sony didn't pay me.","It sems to me that if you actually read the manual you will have no problems at all with this camera. I love it's small size, light weight and sliding lens cover. Keep in a proper case and it will not POP open as some folks have mentioned. The hughe LCD screen is a marvel. I can actually take pictures without my glasses! That is a big plus for me. Buy it, try it, if you don't like it return it. I think you will keep it.","I own 6 Sony digital cameras - P50(2 MP), S75(3 MP), 77A(4 MP), V1(5 MP), T1(5 MP) & 828(8MP). To get over all the T1 technical limitations, here are my suggestions:<br />1. SWITCH off the sharpening tool. This reduces digital noise tremendously.<br />2. Go to [...] & get this Noise Reduction Software for free. It really really helps! For example, when I use ISO 800 for my V1 or 828, this software reduces the noise so significantly , it looked like I took it at ISO 100. Try it & see. Freeeee....!<br />3. All NIGHT photos should be taken at ISO 200 or 400 with the shapening tool off & fixed by the Neat-Image (as mentioned above).<br />Don't expect a Mini to do a Ferrari job. But a Mini can go places and do things a Ferrari can't do right?","I was really surprised to see all the negative reviews on this camera. The employee at the store recommended this camera to me and I've been very pleased with it. I will admit that there is a lot of redeye but I just go to my editing program and get rid of it. The pictures are crisp and I think the color is great!","First, i would say Sony has made terrific product. They have displyed how to make real ultra-compact and Mega-pixel cameras.<br />I would say this is \"Terminator\" of Digital cameras..:).<br />Ok now whoever says that<br />1] the lens cover is too huge or clumsy to use...well if you have to protect the lens from damage, u've gotto have sturdy lens cover. The big size gives added protection and also the good grip.<br />2] Night Pics are no good ---- Guys u NEED to read the manual and play with settings. I have taken pics in PITCH DARK room with flash (ofcourse) and subject being 10feet from camera...with VERY GOOD results. You have to keep one thing in mind, that hands should be very stable. Well even the best SLR's require that.<br />3] Memory Stick Duo =====  I dont understand why ppl make fuss about this. well i agree that they are little expensive, but considering the size for the memory..you have to agree there is no other format as small as the memory stick and SD.<br />how often do u really swap memory cards with other devices.<br />4] Daytime Pictures are Simply Beautiful. No doubt about those.<br />Again ...check your settings, whoever gets dark or grainy pics.<br />Here's a clue...try playing with EV setting. U'll see MAGIC.<br />5] Tripod Not required === Folks cmon...this is ultracompact camera...Its supposed to be used as Point and shoot. Its not for Photo Studios or for doing your Model portfolio. The purpose is to Point and Shoot and Be on ur way...and not being on the scene for 30mins fixing ur Tripod.<br />6] Sony should have provided a simple case. === yes i agree with this. Due to the delicate and precision electronics, they should have given minimal protection equipment with it. Anyways, i have heard that Apple IPOD case fits this easily.<br />7] Large Screen Display === This is THE MOST ATTRACTIVE feature of the camera. I think other companies should follow this standard. We DONT need a few finder now. Also those who said that the screen isnt bright in sunlight. I'll say check ur Eyes or check the Settings ....cuz mine just works fantastic.<br />8] Cradle issues === I personally didnt like the Cradle too. I would prefer a set of cables instead. but whoever said that cradle is too bulky....folks u need a workout...the cradle is as light as ur mouse and even smaller is size. If i'm tavelling, i wudnt mind carrying it along, cuz anyway i'll be using it when i get back to my hotel room. not when i'm outside.<br />well thats all i can think of right now.<br />Again i'll say play with ur settings especiall EV, Focus, ISO.<br />then u'll realise how COOL this camera is.","The best digital camera I have ever seen for it size.  It really is an engineering marvel, it's size, workmenship, ease of use, great pictures, fastest from off to ready of any digital camera and the BEST Screen on any camera.  A word to people looking for real reviews on this camera, I have read all the reviews here and I will say that the good things they say about this camera are true, but the bad things they say are mostly untrue.  You are buying this carmera for size and the large screen and for it's size it is the BEST camera out there PERIOD.  Seems like people either do not know how to operate a camera or are just trying to find any flaw they can on this product.  Lets see them build something better then this camera.  Now for all you cry babies out there complaining about this or that, you buy a camera this size for convience so you can put it in you pants or shirt pocket .  I have many great film and digital cameras that might take better pictures but who cares if you never take them with you because they are too heavy and large and you have to carry them at all times?  The T-1 is the one I have with me all the time so I never miss a shot.  Who cares if you have a camera that takes the most perfect picture in the world if you never take it with you because it is not convient to do so.  Honestly, how many of you have the best intentions of taking your camera to a theme park but at the last minute leave it in the car because you don't want to be stuck carring it it all day, not with this camera, you will have it on your person at all times.  The pictures that this camera takes for it's size are Astonishing.  RED EYE, who has a camera that you don't get red eye?  Though there are ways to help prevent it, learn how to use the camera.  POWER CORDS/DOCK STATION, you do not need the docking station to charge the camera, just the power cords, again learn how to use the camera.  SLIDING LID PROBLEM, I never had this problem sliding the camera into my pocket, must be the person that has the problem.  COLOR BALANCE, I just don't see what this person is talking about but you can adjust it, learn how to use the camera.  NO VIEW FINDER, I didn't think anyone used them anymore, I would glady not have one in order to have the 2 1/2 inch display which you can see under any lighting conditions.  FLASH PICTURE TOO DARK, I don't see this problem at all, there is a flash setting (normal, high, low) again learn how to use the camera.  NO TRIPOD MOUNT, how did you expect to have one on a camera so compact and dense with electronics, well since you should have a case to protect this camera anyway and Sony has the perfect case for sale (Active Case AJK-THA) with a built in tripod mount get one.  The camera never has to come out of the case for taking pictures, you can screw a tripod in the bottom of the case, works great.  BATTERY DRAIN, No more so then any other camera, try switching off the camera when not in use, with the super fast startup when switched on you could have this camera off more often then other cameras.  I can't say enough about  how much I like this camera.  Is it for everyone, no, it's a small camera, some people may find the small size a bit awkward, the controls are simple to use but again because of the small size they are on the camera so you might hit one inadvertently.  It takes some getting use to holding this camera but after a few times using it becomes second nature and you will be taking great pictures with it.","The Sony Cybershot T-1 is a High End Luxury Camera. There are plenty of 5.0 megapixel point and shoot digital cameras on the market. Most of them take great pictures, and do about the same thing as the next one. What makes the T-1 stand apart from the rest is the stylish design (the size of a credit card), and the big 2.5 inch lcd screen on the back. Show it off, and you will be envied by all your associates. Here are the pros: very compact, covert, zeiss optical and huge 2.5 inch LCD. Now the cons:No view finder, No tripod mount, New memory Chip, excessive red eye.There are less expensive 5.0 cameras that will take just as good, if not a little better pictures. However this camera is smooth, attracts attention, and is much more fun to use.","I was sold on the size and 5mp capacity. and assumed it would perform at that level. in daylight yes sort of..but indoor I saw weakness as described here in the reviews. then I was getting unhappy about that. Just in time I was reading through these reviews and read bobtmigo's thoughts. he SAVED me.. and the camera! All the problems of washed out daylight pics and orange pixely indoor pics were finally gone! Bright CLEAR like a 5 mp should be!<br />per what bobtmigo's mentioned, I ended up with the following settings:<br />for indoor (flash) set to program mode, flash power high, iso 400, sharpness lowest, ev to +2  , could flash a whole room clear and bright!<br />for daylight : program mode, iso 100, sharpenss high, ev to -.7<br />the funny thing is the lcd display would show great pics in auto mode but once on the PC very different (washed out / orange)<br />also the 512 sticks from sandisk, when they are available in july 04 will be ~ $120-$150 each so the $300 price now is temporary.<br />also for heavy use, a second battery is really needed, the cam can really eat power and gets warm from using the lcd at normal brightness setting. the wall charger is needed to keep one battery ready at all times.","I bought my husband the DSCF717 5MP for christmas and he loves it. We went to Walt Disney World last week and didn't want to haul around the big camera with bag, etc. so we decided to pick up the \"T1\" for a travel camera. It takes great pictures and has that great marine pack for underwater and waterpark use. The underwater pics are great!!!  This camera is a great second camera to the DSCF717. I wouldn't recommend it for a primary camera as there are red eye problems (can be fixed with software) but it is perfect for a vacation. It fits in an IPOD Armor case and the IPOD fanny pack which enhances it's travel appeal. We took over 600 pictures and didn't need to use the back up battery. We bought the 256 memory and it was plenty for each of the 7 days of our trip. Just download each days pics to your laptop and start over again. We are very pleased with this camera for what we used it for.","I couldn't be more pleased with a camera. It is so small and can do so much, and is easy to use even for the inexperienced. The short video with sound capabilities makes it the answer for all of my needs. I absolutely love this camera.","This is a follow up review to provide critical data not available at the time of my comprehensive review on March 5th.<br />I experienced only two problems with this camera. One is redeye, and the other is the difficulty of emailing the 2MB files generated by a 5 megapixel camera.<br />The solution to both problems is a photo album product like Picasa. Turn off the redeye reduction on the camera, and use the redeye correction feature in your photo album software. Do this with any digital camera because disabling redeye reduction on the camera will eliminate the pause before image capture and will also leave pupils nice and large.<br />Picasa displays the pictures as thumbnails. I simply highlight the ones I want to email and Picasa will automatically shrink them to about 100K each and send them in a single email.","****Before purchasing this item, be aware that you are purchasing through the listed merchant (Circuit City) and NOT Amazon.com. Thus, if you want to do something like cancel your order online, well, you CAN'T! Instead, you have to call CC's 1-800 number and put a special cancellation request in. Be sure you read every detail about the dealer before purchase. Also, CC has a rather poor policy on credit card charges. Instead of waiting to charge the order when the item(s) are shipped, they instead charge you for the amount as soon as you put the order through on Amazon.com's website. Amazon says they can't do anything about this, so you will have to ask the CC sales rep to reverse the charges. Even though CC's return/exchange policy says a refund cannot be made after an order has been placed, pester them until they will cancel the order. If it hasn't been shipped yet, chances are you can cancel the order and reverse any charges incurred on your card. The only good thing is that the sales rep I spoke to seemed helpful and courteous enough.****","attention small camera seekers:  this is the ONE.  Just buy a hard sided ipod case to keep it in - perfect size, clips on anything, just slide out camera and go.  I travel to Europe alot, and this was really a great tool - surprised by quality and ease of use.  No waiting to take pixs, and didn't run out of power ever.  Not much to take along, either -<br />not trying to sell the camera, but if you're a traveler, be confident that this will do the job beautifully and unobtrusively.","Trashing Sony seems to be the fad these days.  I find much of the criticism of the DSC-T1 to be unfounded, likely spread by people who never touched the camera.  I'll admit that I ended up buying a Minolta DiMage Xt to save money, and I don't need all those pixels anyway, but the DSC-T1 is a very nice 5mp camera and it, by the way, takes very good pictures.  I'll say Xt's picture quality is better but the Sony's 5mp helps when it comes to clarity and details.  Also the lens is non-protruding just like the Minolta's, so the speed of the camera is amazing.  The 2.5\" LCD is just sharp and beautiful, great for showing pictures to a few friends at the same time.  Every company should adopt a big and sharp LCD IMHO.  The styling of this camera is a bit weird at first, but it looks better in person, trust me.  The price is on the high side, here's where Sony must address people's complaints.  But this is a high-quality camera.  Sony fan or not, you will find plenty to like here.","As many people have noticed, this camera does not take good pictures out of the box. But if you spend a little time taking test shots and playing with the many controls, it can produce stellar results. With mine, I found that by setting it to Program mode (instead of Auto), setting the exposure to -0.3 EV, and the speed to ISO 100, I get consistently excellent results - not quite as good as bulky cameras costing twice as much, but impressive for something as small as this. Thankfully the camera remembers these settings between uses, so the adjustment only needs to be done once. Since then the camera has been a constant companion and lives in my pocket all the time (the lens cover has never once opened accidentally, perhaps because I slide it into my pocket endwise). The vulnerable controls and LCD on the back of the camera are protected by my PDA, which lives in the same pocket.<br />Also, don't be afraid to change the flash power setting. This can make a huge difference when you're taking a closeup of Tiddles or shotting your daughter's birthday party. (Sony - why isn't the flash power automatically coupled to the focus distance?)<br />Instead of Sony's expensive accessories, I bought a cheap PCMCIA memory stick adapter that lives permanently inside my laptop. That means I only have to take the power adapter when I go travelling. The ludicrous docking station and USB cable stay home.<br />The camera needs more memory. The supplied 32MB isn't nearly enough; I immediately upgraded to 256MB, which is more than I'll ever need.<br />But the single biggest drawback is NO TRIPOD MOUNT. Big mistake, Sony.<br />To anyone who uses Photoshop to correct the colour balance or other defects: learn to use your camera! There's a menu setting for this. Play with it and do some test shots. Put a little effort in now and save a lot of time later.<br />At the end of it all, it's a great camera, incredibly versatile and capable of high-quality results, but with some serious but (mostly) easily-corrected defects. Most people aren't going to spend the time making test shots and calibrating the camera, which is a shame because it's necessary if you're going to take good pictures. Sony should not have released this camera in this condition, and I hope they get it right next time - if they do, they'll have a real killer on their hands. Even so, I'd still strongly recommend this camera to anyone who's willing to put the effort in and who (like me) doesn't have the option of waiting for the next version.","Summing it up this cam is with me inspite of all his mistakes. I have a canon rebel for really good quality photos and also a sony p10 which works with normal memorystick, and i have to tell you that my T1 is the one which is always with me.<br />When i took it home first time i got shecked cause it does many red eyes pics, and the flash is horrible, but somehow i fell in love with it in 2 days.<br />pros :  you will love it. lol, i know this is not technical term but if you have another bigger cam as well no doubt you should take it .<br />  as a communication tool it is far better than any other cam on the market cause of the big big lcd display. when i take it out and show my pics it is easy to share or discuss anything<br />  the video quality is excelent..playing back on tv or pc really enjoyable<br />  really really nice feeling to have it<br />  operates very fast , you wont miss the action with it<br />  you have fast start simply pulling the lense cover down it is already ready to shoot<br />cons:  though Zeiss the lense is small<br />  flash is good only close<br />  red eye is frequent<br />  pic quality is doubdtful if really 5,1<br />SUmming it up, i love mine. It saved me so many times with a vidorecording, oor fast pic that i can tell you to get it with good heart. BUT only if you have another digital camera for good quality pics. I am a Canon fan in cameras but Sony did really something special with T1. There is a firmware update available for it now which corrects some mistakes. Despite little pricy i feel it is a good choice. As my sony vaio TR3A is the perfect thing to take always with me as a notebook, this is the cam always with me.  If you wanna have one camera and portability is not that important i suggest CAnon G5, or if you really wanna care about  quality and don't mind to spend triple i am for Canon REbel. That makes you a photographer! But besides take the T1 for being always in the pocket. and get a 256 stick to it.","I got this camera because it was the most compact digital with 5MP.  I knew it had a big LCD, but I'm surprised at how useful this is.  It's so fun to take a shot and pass it around for everyone to see.  The LCD is very sharp with good color and contrast.  The screen is so much bigger than Sony's DSC-P51.  I did find a very nice compact case which is rigid on the inside (semi-hard) to protect the LCD on eBay.  Sony's case is not very useful and defeats the purpose of the compact camera.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the camera and I keep it in my pocket whenever I'm out.","Although I have much experience with cameras, camcorders, and digital images, I have never owned a digital camera before. My main camera has been a Nikon 6006 SLR, so I am pretty picky about quality.<br />After extensive research, I settled on the DSC-T1. It is exactly what I expected, and almost exactly what I wanted, but allow me to elaborate because it may not be exactly what YOU want.<br />I was tempted by larger digital cameras (and I will eventually get one of those too). For example, the Panasonic Lumix is few bucks cheaper and has more controls, a BIG lens, great image stabilization, and 12x optical zoom (digital zoom is meaningless). It is even possible to get a medium size 5MP digital camera with 5x optical zoom and better pictures than the dsc-t1 for much less. However, I concluded that I would rather have a good camera with me 24x7 than leave a great camera in the car or at home. I was SO right. I have already captured SO many photos I would have missed. I carry the camera at all times in one of those silk bags that come with Oakley sunglasses.<br />I considered other small cameras like the Casio Elixim Z4, but it does not have video in US versions. The Canon S400 is very good, but it is slower and thicker with a much smaller LCD, and a newer version is coming out April 30th. No ultra compact that is clearly better than the DSC-T1 is on the horizon.<br />In addition to ultra compact size, I wanted at least 4MP, at least 3x optical zoom, quality video ability, speed, ease of use, and flexible shooting modes. This camera has 5MP, 3x optical zoom, excellent 640x480 video mode, speed, ease of use, and shooting modes flexible enough to accommodate everything from action to night images.<br />Video is in MPG files, which can be played back on the free Real Player. It is not possible to zoom while shooting video, but it is possible to zoom before recording begins or when recording has been paused.<br />I haven't tried the software that comes with it yet. I run Windows XP, and I just place the dsc-t1 in the cradle, turn it on, and it appears as another disk drive in Windows Explorer. I can copy files from it and paste them onto a hard drive. I can then delete the image files from the camera to free up the space on the memory stick just as if I were deleting files from any Windows folder.<br />Apparently slowness is a problem with all digital cameras except for a few of the most recent ones, and the DSC-T1 seems fast to me. This may be the result of the newer and faster Duo Pro Memory Stick technology. Get the 256MB Duo Pro Memory Stick. The 512MB stick costs three times as much. Don't bother with a spare battery. They are too expensive, and the battery life is OK. You don't want to be frequently opening the delicate little battery/memory doors on digital cameras anyway.<br />Don't worry about having no optical view finder. They just make cameras bigger. The 2.5 inch LCD is bigger than any other digital camera and is quite sufficient.<br />Such a small camera is a little tricky to hold SECURELY without getting in the way of the lens, so if you tend to drop things, then you WILL eventually drop this unless you use the wrist strap at all times, which partially defeats the convenience aspect. I still haven't attached the wrist strap because I am extra careful, but someone could still bump into me while shooting. On the other hand, I don't want to overstate this problem because the camera is quite durable/graspable when the lens cover is closed.<br />Almost every indoor picture with the kids has at least a hint of red eye. I consider about 60% of them to have too much, but I still get more quality shots than I have time to email, so I really can't complain. BTW, 5MP jpeg files are about 2MB each, which makes email a challenge. Less than one out of ten indoor pictures seems grainy. It is actually possible to take decent pictures in total darkness when using the flash because the auto focus works in the dark, which is not true for every camera.<br />It is possible to use one of the modes that forces the camera to 100 speed to guarantee maximum resolution (0% graininess), but you may have to brace the camera well for the slow shutter speeds that result. In fact I took some good pictures from my front porch at NIGHT by bracing the camera, but this will take more practice. Note that such pictures did not use a flash because a flash is useless beyond a few yards away, and only works WELL up to 6 feet away.<br /><br />One pleasant surprise was the excellent sound quality. I carried a digital voice recorder 24x7, which would fill up until I had time to manually transpose my notes and delete them forever to free up memory on the recorder again. Before that I used the very expensive little Pearlcorder L400. It was less convenient to transpose from a tape, but at least I could keep the tapes forever. Sound quality on all of them was poor. Whereas, with the DSC-T1, I discovered I could take hours of VIDEO notes in 160x160 mode with perfect sound quality and then just copy these files onto my hard drive to keep forever. This is when I knew I was keeping the DSC-T1.","Why do so many reviewers mention the red eye effect as if this is not a deal breaker?  A chronic red eye effect makes a camera useless.  The home photoshop cure takes a great deal of time and never comes out real well.<br />Also the main selling point of the T-1 is that it's compact and can be pocketed all day every day. If you need a big case to protect the LCD, the device is no longer barely there.","Bought the T-1 a little over a week ago.All I can say is wow! The camera's features compared to it's size are incredible.Sony engineers truly are the masters at miniturization that's for sure.I also found the site \"[...] that had a excellent review and great,large pics.The site also has alot of good articles about new technology and gadgets but I digress.<br />  Let's get down to the nitty gritty about the T-1.I will start off exploring the camera's only three flaws in my opinion.That's the \"red-eye\" reduction,flash and the lack of some sort of lock for the slide down lens cover.You can accidentally open the cover(and subsequently start up the camera) and expose the lens to debris,etc.The other problem was the \"red-eye\" reduction.Bottom line it's just not up to snuff for the camera.The flash is also a little weak.Besides those three annoying,yet totally easy to live with things,the camera is a winner.Oh,one more little annoyance.In order to take video @ 30fps,you need the top of the line $300 512MB Memory Stick Pro Duo stick.Ouch! expensive,but I think worth it given the camera's cool factor and if you can afford it.<br />  Now the good stuff about the T-1.One:It's size!It's barely bigger than a box of Altoids!Two:The HUGE 2.5\" screen.It's the same quality screen that you see on PDA's.It has absolutely no glare in direct sunlight.Three:Shutter time.The shutter is BLAZINGLY fast! So you can take alot of pics in very little time.Four:Startup time is less than a second.Five:Quality construction(which is a HUGE deal to me)It feels and is a quality built camera.Feeling substantial yet not heavy in my hand.Plus,I'm just a sucker for anything with a brushed metal surface..lol.Finally: The overall experience.What I mean is,do you feel that you got a little more than what you paid for?Does the camera excite you? Are your firends totally blown away and jealous? YES,YES and YES!!!<br />If you've got the dough,go get one now!","Comments: Testing this SONY DSC-T1 during February 2004, has been a pleasure, carrying it in my pocket all day, every day. The size and weight is ideal for ultimate portability. Using this 5M pixel camera at 3M pixel resolution, using the smart zoom feature, or 5 MP mode produces excellent results. The T1 also allows in-camera cropping of images, and in-camera image resizing for e-mail purposes. The high quality movie mode is comparable to high quality digital-video tape camcorders, 30 frames per second at 640x480 pixel size image, with the exception of typical camcorder better optical zoom capability. The camera also allows one to view and edit-out portions of the video. The image quality is stunning, and color quality and saturation is also spectacular. HQ (fine) video where 3 minutes fills 256MB card, however, the video is movie quality with very smooth moving objects, in great color definition. Quite a bonus for a digital still image camera. SONY has definitely placed a great deal of engineering muscle into this device. I have produced a number of 8x10\" photos and am stunned at the color and image detail. The trick in any photography activity is knowing how to take good pictures and finding correct lighting, etc. Taking care of business, when framing the image, and setting the camera features, will produce truly great results. \"The camera that one can take everywhere is the best camera to have,\" is the remark I deliver to my students, and this device does not disappoint. Spend a few minutes, try 60 minutes, reviewing the 100 page instruction book, buy several high speed 256MB memory cards, and have a great time capturing images every place you go throughout the day. As to a Camera Rating, it has earned a solid A+. FYI, I also shoot action sports events for FAU, NCAA Atlantic Sun Conference, and others using Canon's best digital equipment. Therefore, when I do not desire to carry large Digital 35mm size equipment, SONY's T1 is an ideal companion.<br />Regarding SONY's DSC-T1's low-light operation in the still-image and movie modes, this camera as many that have a maximum aperture of f3.5 coupled with maximum ISO level of 400, will experience image blur if care is not taken at exposure. In using this camera extensively in many lighting situations, one would have to sacrifice low light sensitivity in exchange for extreme portability. In movie mode and still photography, in dim lighting, extreme care must be taken at exposure to prevent image blur. When in very-low-light environments where the design limits of the imager peak at 400 ISO, image noise may become unacceptable, when compared to larger SLR cameras like Canon's EOS-10D which performs quite well at ISO 800 at long exposures. The trade-off is size and weight of the equipment. For flash photography, the T1 operates quite well for small group shots where camera-to-subject distances are within 4-6 feet, which is within its design limits. The tiny built-in flash will not be able to create enough (flash) light for large groups with low-available-light conditions, where the camera is 3 or more meters, or 10 or more feet from the subject. As to red-eye reduction, the mechanism is for the camera to emit short flash-bursts prior to the actual image capture, in effort to close the iris's of the subject when the main flash and exposure occurs. All human conditions do not operate so regularly, where perhaps the subject's iris' did not close sufficiently to prevent the main-flash's reflection from the subject's retina. We have not experienced an unusual level of red-eye problems, however, occasionally it can occur, particularly if the subject's iris does not react to the pre-flash light.<br />Problems<br />One issue to be careful about is the placement of the right most button which activates the close-up feature. One's thumb may accidentally press this right-arrow button when holding the camera, when close-ups are not intended. So look on the LCD panel often at the lower left corner to see the Flower symbol. If shown, you're in close-up mode. Simply press the right-arrow button again to turn-off close-up mode. My only complaint is SONY's insistence on using obscure, proprietary, expensive, memory cards. In this case the \"Memory Stick Duo Pro.\" SONY may have been better served had it chosen an industry standard SD card which is now available in 1 GB sizes. However, SONY says that with the DSC-T1 set in high quality FINE video mode, SONY's card is necessary because of its theoretical 20 MB per second transfer speed; presently that speed is unavailable by other SD card manufacturers. And after you see what this high quality FINE mode looks like, you too will be a SONY believer. As one may notice, even with a few complaints, I'm quite enthusiastic with the results.<br />James L Wilson Professor,Principles.of.Digital.Photography and Post.Image.Processing Florida.Atlantic.University Boca.Raton.Campus Operating.Entity.BocaDigital.LLC.

I used it every single day while out and about, I shot over 1500 pics, and let's just say \"wow\".<br />The camera performs overall very nicely.  The user interface is straightforward and easy to figure out.  The lens combined with the 5.1 Megapixels make for great prints.

You need more memory than the 32MB that comes bundled with the camera.<br />I searched around for a case for some time, and I finally found the best case via eBay.  It is a custom crushproof pouch that is form fitting to the camera with a tiny belt clip to boot.  Perfect pouch & great price.  Prior to this, I used a Louis Vuitton cigarette case pouch, which also works & looks pretty nice.  It certainly added to the stylish looks (& wow factor) of the camera.<br />For great pics and great ease of use/portablility, this camera is the best.","I actually got this camara a few months back, and can highly recommend it to everyone.<br />If MPs are your thing,, it has it. If you like portability, it is perfect, and if you need the best quality screen, this is it. Show off like no one else can.","Prior to purchasing a T1, I had been porting one of two digital cameras, the tiny Canon Powershot SD10 and the Canon Powershot S50. Both the Canon models are very good at what they do.<br />The 4MP SD10 (still considerably smaller and lighter than the Sony DSC-T1, but with no zoom) excels at taking short-range flash pictures indoors. I carried it in my shirt pocket and used it as kind of a notepad to record prospective film rentals, purchases, and all manner of things I might want to do more research on later. Also, if I happened to run across something of more photographic merit, at least there was some possibility of doing it justice.<br />When more serious about taking photos somewhere, I would strap the S50 (5MP, 3x zoom) on my belt and expect generally high quality results.<br />When the T1 was released, I saw it as potentially replacing the functions of these two cameras in one pocketable device. In truth, it is not quite as good at either end of the spectrum, but the results are close.<br />For notepad use, you cannot turn it on (via the lens cover) with one hand and shoot with the same grip as you can with the SD10. In spite of the increased megapixels, the apparent resolution is about the same, and text appears sharper and cleaner on the SD10. The SD10 allows you to set a two second exposure delay, which enables you to steady the camera and avoid motion blurring caused by hitting the button. On the Sony, the delay is fixed at ten seconds, which is awkwardly long. The zoom on the T1 allows you to control your flash distance while still being able to completely frame your subject, as opposed to the fixed lens SD10. Once you've taken a photo, the screen and controls on the T1 are much better for scanning (or reading) the results in-camera. Of course, the SD10 is easier on the pocket and pocketbook.<br />Not surprisingly, for general photographic use the Canon S50 still has an edge over the T1, but not by as much as you might think. When comparing shots of the same outdoor subject, I found the images from the Sony somewhat noisier, slightly less sharp, and a little overexposed. (I recommend turning down the EV in sunny environments.) Otherwise, there isn't much to distinguish them in most circumstances, which I find amazing given the dimensions of the T1. Also, it's nice to know how long your battery is going to last.<br />At present, it is difficult to find a high capacity Memory Stick Pro Duo chip in stock anywhere at a reasonable price--sad that the T1 has been released before you can buy adequate memory. I don't know anyone who likes Sony's flash memory formats besides Sony.","I've had this camera for about a month now, and have been using it extensively in that time period. The size is incredible, it is the size of a credit card and only weighs 6.3 ounces. The body is made of a high quality metal, and feels good in your hand.<br />There's no optical viewfinder on the T1, so you'll have to make do with the huge and gorgeous 2.5\" LCD on the back. It uses transreflective technology, found on PDA screens, so that the LCD doesn't wash out in sunlight.<br />The camera also has a 3x optical zoom, but the lenses don't stick out of the camera. Instead, Sony put the zoom mechanism inside the camera body and uses a prism to reflect the light from the main lens. Very cool.<br />The flash is weak, and drops off after about 6-7 feet. Red-eye is also a problem with a lot of my indoor photos, and the red-eye reduction doesn't reduce the effect all the time. Picture quality is very good, though you might want to tweak some of the auto settings to get more control over shooting. The camera does a good job most of the time though.<br />You can also shoot movies with sound at 640x480 resolution at 30 frames per second, but you need a Memory Stick Pro Duo to accomplish this due to it being faster than regular Memory Sticks. Otherwise you're limited to 640x480 at 15 frames per second. A 512MB stick, the largest currently available, will only hold about 6 minutes of video.<br />You cannot use regular Memory Sticks with this camera, and the included one only holds about 12 photos, so you'll need to cough up extra if you like taking tons of photos.<br />Battery life is good for such a small battery, I can get about an hour of shooting in before it dies. You also get a cradle with this camera, which you can use to charge the battery inside the camera, hook it up to your TV and display photos, or hook it up to your computer.<br />The DSC-T1 is awesome in terms of design and features, and is well worth the price. Aside from investing in a bigger and faster Memory Stick, you get your money's worth and the collest camera on the market.","I bought the Sony DSC-T1 two weeks ago. I was very impressed by the size, the screen, and the features.  It is an awesome camera that I have only found two small shortfalls with:<br /><br />1. The flash is only rated to a distance of 1.5 to 2 meters, this sucks in a no light or very low light environment.<br />2. The Red Eye reducer is not so great.<br />If you're looking for a case to protect this tiny camera, I would suggest strolling over to the PDA section of the store and picking up the PEGA-CA23 Carrying Case for Sony CLIE TJ/TH/SJ Series Handhelds. The only thing that would make it better is Velcro... but the snap works fine and does not endanger the camera's screen. P>Over all I am very happy with the features and quality the T1 offers, the video and sounds are great, you can add 5sec audio tags to any image and it's so damn sexy.","I bought the Sony DSC-T1 two weeks ago.

It's overall very good , the small size and handling are a plus .<br /><br />I highly recommend it .","From all the reviews that others gave for this camera, there were some inconsistent facts.  Hope this review answers all those inconsistencies.<br /><br />Fact 1: The camera does not support black and white pictures.  HOWEVER, it supports Sephia, which is just like black and white, except instead of shades of grey, its in shades of tan color.  Maybe this was added in instead of B&W because Sephia seems to look better than B&W.  In any case any picture in Sephia can be converted by paint software to b&w (but you can convert color pictures to B&W using paint software too)<br /><br />Fact 2: Blurry images can be eliminated by choosing the correct options.  It is eliminated completely if you force the flash to happen (via option) during each picture.  The flash brightness is adjustible.  Blurry images happen only if the scene is bright enough and the default options automatically turns off the flash, and you can't keep the image steady.  The only problem comes is when you wish to take pictures of places that are not too bright and the objects are too far away for the flash to brighten.  In this case, forcing the flash to happen will remove any blurry images, but the long distant objects will be dark.  For this special case, you need a steady hand or a tripod.  Why do blurry images happen?  Because the aperature is left open longer to gather more light for the scene.  (Otherwise it becomes too dark in the picture).  Any movement during the time it is open will end up being blurry.  If you leave the flash on, the camera always assumes there will be enough light, so it always closes the shutter fast, removing blurry images.<br /><br />Fact 3: Cool accessory to have for this camera is the 2.6X telephoto lens VCL-DH2630 (requires another separate adapter body VAD-PHA as well).  It increases the total optical zoom to 7.8 times, which you will not regret having if you are taking scenic pictures.<br /><br />Fact 4: The camera can take 22 minutes 37 second movies with the included 32Meg memory stick if you choose the 160 pixels wide movies.  And with the default 32 megabyte memory stick, you can only take 1 minute 27 seconds of 640 pixels wide movies.  Increase the stick size, you and increase the length of movies proportionally.  So with 2 Gig mem stick, you get more than 24 hours of 160 pixel wide movies, and 1 and a half hour 640 pixels wide movies (length of most theatre movies).  And they all include sound!<br /><br />Fact 5: The camera has a deep list of features.  Most of the people who use it will use the default automatic mode.  There are two other modes (scenic, and programmable) you turn with the dial.  It is in these other modes that you can get special features or tune your picture capturing options.  The only thing you can't manually adjust is the focus, but the camera comes with many different auto-focus settings and predefined focus increments.<br /><br />Fact 6: The camera takes pretty good pictures.  See [...] for pictures taken with this camera.","I have owned this camera for over a year and so far am very impressed with it.  For the price, you can't beat the picture quality.  This camera is very user friendly.  Charge the battery and you are ready to go.  The auto mode works so well, you very seldomly need to adjust any settings.  The flash works well inside of about 25 feet and does a great job in low light situations.<br /><br />It does not have all of the bells and whistles of the higher end digital cameras, but is great for non-professionals.  This camera blows all other 5mp pocket cameras out of the water!  Also, for those looking for even sharper images the 7mp version of this camera is coming out in October for under $500.","ok, when i had a old sony cyber-shot, it had like 1.9 MP.....and i thought it was great, so no biggy.....this camera is so much cooler, sound and a lot of other options, the shutter speed is the same as any other digital camera, and if you dont like to wait for the shutter just buy a advantix camera or something, stop complaining about it.<br /><br />BEST CAMERA EVER!!!","I bought this in 10/2003.  Love the camera itself.  It is my second Sony digital, having used the prior Mavica for thousands of pictures. The lens just stopped working; would not open. Sure, parts are covered for 12 months, but no labor after 90 days.  They gave me an estimate at the auth. svc. ctr. of $235 to fix labor.  For a tad more, you can buy a new one...but why should I have to!?","Note: the Sony DSCP92 and this camera are VERY close in features, with the only major one being the price. In fact, they are so close I had to print out both feature lists to find the three small details that are different.<br />One difference is the battery: the P10 has an InfoLithium NP-FC11, and the P92 has NiMH AA batteries.  The InfoLithium is square, sealed and compact compared to the AA batteries in the P92. Both are rechargeable and the charger comes in the box, but the AA batteries in the P92 must come out of the camera to be recharged, whereas the P10 just plugs into the wall (a nice feature.)<br />The P92 is (a hardly-noticeable) two-ounces heavier than the 7.5-ounce P10.  This probably comes from heavier batteries and larger case.  The case on the P92 is slightly larger, and to my judgment, a bit more bulky feeling than the P10. I REALLY like the way the P10 feels in my hand.  I had a Fuji digital camera that took GREAT pictures and had a quick shutter speed, but it was bulky and felt cheap.  The P10 feels solid.  Even when the lens is fully extracted, it too feels solid.<br />The other difference is in the available Scene Modes: P10 has seven (Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Landscape, Beach, Snow, Fireworks, Fast Shutter) and the P92 has five (Twilight, Twilight Portrait, Landscape, Beach, Snow)<br />The buttons feel like they will last the life of the camera and are labeled and quite easy to use.  Just from the labels/icons next to the buttons I was able to fool around with the camera for awhile before I had to consult the owner's manual.<br />Speaking of the owner's manual... this camera has a deep list of features, and when you break down the how-to of each feature it can make the manual a bit lengthy.  But, it's worth it in the end.  You will be taking better pictures because you will be using more of the features that are designed to make your picture taking easier and better.  So far, my favorite feature is the Snow Scene Mode. I took some pictures in the snow at the normal setting and later took some in the Snow Mode.  After downloading them I noticed a big difference; the pictures (in Snow Mode) looked exactly the way it did to my naked eye.<br />Cons:<br />- My Fuji digital took better low-light pictures than this one.  The flash on the P10 has three settings (Low, Normal and High), but it still seems to overpower some settings where you would like to catch the ambient lighting. I think this is simply an operator error and me not reading even deeper into the manual. But the Fuji low-light pix looked better with less button pushing and feature fumbling.<br />- The shutter is a bit slower than other digital cameras, but that is due to the 5 megapixels it is trying to gather.  I bought a SanDisk 256MB MagicGate MemoryStick Pro because I was told that it took faster pictures and shortened your downloading time versus a regular issue MemoryStick. You can also use the Fast Shutter Scene Mode (better used outdoors) to help you out with the slow shutter.<br />Favorite features:<br />- Display is bright and can even be seen outside.<br />- Your most often used features are just a button away.<br />- Size and feel. Just slightly longer than a deck of cards.<br />- You can alter (i.e. Solarize, Sepia, Negative Art) and edit pictures right on the camera.<br />-  You can take movies with sound!  Awesome feature.<br />I highly recommend this camera to anyone that is looking to buy one. It can be your first digital camera or your tenth, whatever your level of picture taking this camera can accomodate you.","We got an open box special from a circuit city in Mass. It was 450$. It normally goes for 499, which is still cheaper than most 4MP cameras. I am in between being an amateur photo and pro. I gave in to the digi revolution because my 35mm broke. We took this camera on our trip and used it very often. The battery on this camera lasts up to and over 2 hours per battery, which is about 1.5 hours longer than the DSC-P09. The movie mode is incredible, slightly better than a web cam, and the microphone is suprisingly good. good enough for a concert! We bought a sony computer around the same time and we were very happy (and mindful) of the media stick input in our computer. The full size pictures import very quickly (2.6 ghz computer). The crispness of the photos is unlike anything I have ever seen. The only time when you start to see any distortion is when you view the photos at 200X magnification. The pictures, unless you plan on printing over 25 X 25, are better than you'll ever need. The ease of use is far above average. The lens is good enough (as good as all the others, except the one with the Zeiss lens) the LCD screen is big enough, the shooting modes are easy, etc. The biggest feature and selling point of this camera over any other is the 90 minute movie mode.<br />The negatives are you can't choose to shoot in black and white, only sepia, which is very close, and that indoor pictures come out poorly. Unless there is a lot of natural light, the picture will come out either fuzzy or the color won't be right (I hear that's the same with all digis).","I had a dsc-9 that was stolen so I purchased the newer model.  Both cameras are great.  READ THE MANUAL AND LEARN HOW TO USE THE CAMERA.<br />The camera lets you know if there is not enough light to take the picture, and it automatically defaults to \"NO FLASH\" MODE. If the lighting is dark the shutter will slow and still take the picture.  This is true with any camera.  Slow shutter speeds cause BLURRY pictures.  If you want to take pictures in very low light you have to use a tripod, AS WITH ANY CAMERA.<br />This camera packs so many features in a small package it is incredible.  These features are worthless if you fail to learn how to use them.  I bet every person that gave this camera a poor review still has a vcr that has the clock blinking 12:00am.<br />If you want a high resolution camera that is fairly easy to use, strongly consider this camera.  Also consider purchasing Jasc Paintshop Pro for an inexpensive way to improve any photo you take.  Unfortunately, you have to learn how to use the program as well.","This is my first digital camera, what a way to start out. It's so easy to use. Quality is great. The video is great, very clear picture. I'm very glad I went with this one, because it'll do everything I want it to do for a long time. And with the 256 memory stick I purchased, I'll always have room for one more picture! Highly recommend","This camera takes really nice pictures, but very generously spends its lithium ion battery.  As a usual Sony, it makes you to buy other sony products, especially the memory stick. Although slightly more expensive the other kinds of digital storing media, I like it so far.<br />The more u use the camera the more you like it. I haven't gone through the software much, I am using XP, but most people haven't enjoyed pixela I guess.<br />have a spare battery, and spare memory stick you ll like the camera more.<br />wish it had a better(larger)lens aperture, but this is the problem with this family of digital cameras, small, handy, portable but has limitations.<br />Flash is very good as far as I ve seen, and sometimes more powerful than you really need, good idea to set it at normal, and if that is not enough, go for a higher setting.<br />clever camera, e mail option is very handy, but slows the whole process of taking pictures, dont use it if you are in need of successive shots..","This is a great camera, but you must learn to use it correctly. buy the sony 256MB pro stick at least and an extra battery. The people who gave this camera a poor review did not read the manual fully and have very unsteady hands while holding the camera. Plus don't understand lighting fully.","We bought the P10, 5 megapixel camera for Christmas, and we've now used it for about 3 months.  I've experienced the problems with the blurriness, caused by a delay between flash and shutter, that have been mentioned by others, but I'm getting better.  There is some skill involved with using the camera well, but it's not all that heard.  I have benefitted from putting the camera on a tripod to minimize the impact of my shaky hands.  Very small tripods that you can fit in your camera case are available.<br />The biggest aid for me is to remember is that I'm not wasting film if I take multiple pictures of the same scene.  At least one of the pictures is sure to turn out great!<br />Other positives on the camera:<br /> o Great, small size<br /> o Lightweight<br /> o Seems to charge quickly<br /> o Holds scads of pictures with larger memory stick<br /> o Very easy to start using.  I read through the manual once and was ready to start.<br /> o The fuzziness can be overcome with practice.  And since you can delete your mistakes on the spot, you can practice all you want!!!<br />Negatives:<br /> o The memory card that comes standard is just too small.  If you plan to take lots of pictures on a vacation, the small card is probably a waste.<br /> o The fuzziness may cause you to lose some shots.","We bought this camera in anticipation of the birth of our first baby. Half the pictures from the delivery room came out blurry. The ones that came out in focus are beautiful but we are very disappointed. All of the other features are wonderful. We have called Sony's help line and cannot solve the problem. I am at the end of my rope with this camera. I feel I am missing out on irreplaceable moments.<br />This is a great camera as long as you are taking picutes of non moving things - not a baby.","I used old digital camera from Sony (2.1MP, about 3 years old).  Good experience with Sony Cybershot, I purchased DSCP10 week ago.  When I opened box, it was full of everything that I really needed.  Here are pros and cons:<br />1.  It is very easy to use for first time user.  (Might be little harder for first time Cybershot user)<br />2.  Small enough to carry on pocket<br />3.  Good Quality of Picture (Of course, it is not better than SLR...  However, it is good enough to print and keep it)<br />4.  Full Support with MPEG2 Movie clip.  (128MB will last almost 6 min.  Should be able to capture memory)<br />5.  On Sceen control (Most of menu/function shown on LCD)<br />etc....<br />Battery life is not quite long.  If I can have extra battery, that would be great...  Also, data transfer to comp is not quite fast.  Maybe, Memory Stick Pro will solve this problem.  little heavy...<br />Overall, I like this camera.  If someone wants to buy around me, I'll recommend this one first.  Please get this one.  You will like it!","Compre la Sony DSC-P10 hace unos 6 meses y creo que es una buena camara digital. Al aire libre capta muy buenas imagenes y su capacidad de grabar pelicula con sonido por medio del memory stick la hace una muy buena eleccion, sin mencionar las innumerables otras caracteristicas que esta camara posee sobre las otras cybershot. (Es mucho mas pequeña que las otras DSC-P y 5 MP). El problema viene cuando quieres captar imagenes en interiores o con poca luz.....es un desastre. Ni siquiera se pueden identificar las imagenes un su pantalla de cristal liquido y al \"revelarlas\" las fotos pierden toda su riqueza de colores como las captadas al aire libre. Siendo un fanatico de Sony me duele aceptar ese hecho. Espero sea de ayuda. (En español es mejor!!)","I had the SOny DSC 1 with 3,2 megapixel before. THat one i loved, I tohught to change it cause the dsc10 is smaller and 5 is supposed to be much better quality. THe compact sire and the easy menu and the videorecording pic and voice quality is excellent.<br />But I might not know it well how to use or dunno but half of my pic are blurry , not sharp , too dark. I try to fix the settings well but i am not an Xpert in it . WIth DSC ' everything was automatic. Maybe this is too clever for me but i dont think it seems to be worse pic quality . Farer objects with oom not bright enough and not sharp. I cannot decided wich flash to use. SOmehow i love the cam but could t learn how to make good pics with it . I bought it 31th of December.","For what it offers, this camera is a great deal (both, price and mail-in rebate considered). After shopping around, this was one of the best options we found in the 5MP range. Things we've loved about it:<br />1) Portability (fits in almost any pocket).<br />2) Default picture quality is great (even indoors or by night), plus the max. resolution (2592 x 1944 pixels) allows you to obtain huge enlargements, though the 32MB Memory Stick that comes with it will not fit too many of them.<br />3) It captures video with sound, an upgrade from our previous camera which only shot \"silent\" movies.<br />4) Built-in display has great contrast and picture quality.<br />5) Pictures can be downloaded to PCs or Macs using the traditional USB mode or the faster, more recent USB 2.0 mode which spits them into your computer in a snapshot!<br />The biggest drawbacks I see with the camera are:<br />1) Dependability on propietary technology for storage (Memory Stick) and power (lithium-ion battery).<br />2) Long time it takes to shoot the picture after you press the shutter. This has caused me to loose a few \"Kodak\" moments that just passed \"too fast\" in front of the lens for the camera to react in time to them.<br />All in all, I can live with the cons and highly recommend the camera. For its price, for now I think you'll have a hard time finding something as good.","Good one but I have to agree with what disappointed_user has to say. I agree with James Arvo esp the negatives. Overall Im happy with the camera esp for the price i paid<br />I also found sample shots of many digital camera at Steve's digicam site very helpful. You can judge yourself whether you need to purchase a different one. I was wondering whether I should go for dscv1 but it was out of my budget.","The Sony DSCP10 Cybershot 5 MP is a good quality camera but is only suitable for those who are happy with the preset settings that come with the camera. My biggest gripe is that there are no manual override (i.e you cannot change the preset settings), aperture priority or shutter priority which makes the camera virtually useless if you want want more control on how your pictures are taken. If you are happy with simple snapshots, then go for it. But if you want to be a bit more creative, you will be better of with a Canon or Nikon.","It's a great all around camera from what i have used.  The only thing it lacks is a black and white picture taking mode (it gives you 3; sepia, neg. art, and solarize.) I would find the black and white feature much more useful.  One other thing is the zoom in the 5 mega pixel you only have 3x optical zoom instead of using 4x smart zoom.  I am also having some trouble with the differance of opinions of the length of the memory in the movie mode and how long it can record with what memory stick. The camera says 90 min with the 128 stick but consumers say differantly.  Who is correct??  Don't get me wrong I love the camera and would recomend it to anyone that is listening!","This is my 4th Sony camera and this is the 5th generation of Sony's DSC's digital cameras (prior main models: DSC 30,50, P5, P7, P8). So this model have evolved with time, refining features, resolution and size, with every model I wished some changes, and for the next model the changes were done, even minute changes... however, it can be overwhelming for a newcomer to check all the 40 or 50 features, variables, settings, modes, screen symbols etc.<br />Regarding general features, you may check Sony's website ([...]) but here is what I personally like and dislike:<br />My favorites:<br />-The all time favorite: You can zoom, trim, copy and save from exisiting pictures, all inside the camera . Say, you want to make a single, separate copy of just one face from a group picture. This is far faster than using the computer.<br />- It has the option to make 3 copies from one single shot...with bracketed exposure (every copy of the picture will come with a different exposure and you keep only the one with the best amount of light). The amount of light between each copy is user defined.<br />- It has an option for a series of 3 pictures with a 0.5 sec. delay between them. This is new in Sony's, a welcomed feature,it's easier to freeze \"the right moment\". It might compensate an existing delay when pressing the shutter, too (if you use it moments before the moment you pretend to capture).<br />-Improved white balance: You con control indoor light color from incandescent, fluorescent etc. with very acceptable results.<br />- It is possible to organize your pictures in different \"folders\", so you can organize them faster once in the computer.<br />- It has several combinations of shutter speed/aperture: small aperture and long shutter (\"fireworks\"), large aperture and fast shutter (\"sports\") etc. etc. ( 7 options); I guess it must compensate the lack of manual controls over aperture/shutter speed.<br />- About the 640X480 movie mode: since this is a series of photos instead of real video, objets in swift movement are blurry, and since not everyone has a steady hand, images usually are a little shaky. In spite of this, this feature was the main reason I purchased this camera, I don't like to use or carry a videocamera, instead I always carry this camera in my pocket and I has been able to capture key moments in the life of my 2 kids, in the most diverse places. Please note this: I takes 128MB to record 6 min. If you buy a mega-hyper-expensive 1GB memory stick you'll get some 45 min. but yo'll be able to record only some 30-35 min. in one standard 800MB compact disk. Remember that you can cut or delete unnecesary portions of movies right in the camera (it splits a movie and you delete the undesired portion).<br />- You can adjust the picture's sharpness, contrast and saturation (besides of exposure adjustment). Adjusted at its maximum setting, a picture of some glorious clouds over a blue sky will be captured very,very close to the real thing.<br />Drawbacks:<br />- Painted, plastic case (DSC-P5 and  P9 were all brushed stainless steel!)<br />- The 6X zoom (3 optical and 3 digital) works only at 3.1MP, not at 5MP (here only takes optical 3X).<br />- I found the font size in messages etc. too little (Am I getting older?).<br />Features I find useless:<br />-There is an histogram, a graph showing the amount of light and shadow on the screen. What is the real and useful purpose of this? Mmmhh..<br />-I've never used the \"sepia\" mode. I guess someone in need of a brown picture, would change the color with software, not with the camera. Who knows?.<br />A note for first timers: Remember that a tiny lens (like the one in this camera) will gather just a small fraction of light compared with larger cameras, so be prepared to get yourself used to the flash when taking pictures at dawn, sunset or indoors...it means a shorter battery life, too. More: In a trip, I used to take some 20 or 30 pictures everyday, and at night I review them in the hotel and kept only the best ones (1 or 3 per day). Just imagine the quality of every picture kept.<br />About the software: Ill-designed. You'll have to get some decent editing software separately. They pretend you should learn to use a non-standard software with limited features...it might be well for someone living in Mars or where fine editing software is non-existing.<br />The bottom line: I have had DSC's cameras over time because they always give you more features for the price...if a small size camera is important to you. Otherwise, there are many other less expensive cameras with many features, but they will be always larger in size, and only if you're lucky you'll have good color reproduction and easy file handling.","ok, so this camera has good zoom, great resolution, its small, it takes awsome videos with sound, that can be up to 90 min!!!, whats not to love??? some people say the menus arent user friendly, but it took me 30 seconds to learn how to use them! the buttons on the back are really easy to use. the battery is also very good. people also say the the screen isnt bright, but u can ajust the brightness very easily...it comes set on medium brightness but u can make it very bright.","I just bought the S400 from Dell for $xxx a little while back and was considering the Sony DSC-P10 at the time as well.  I figured I'd write up a review on amazon to help other people out that are in the decision making process.<br />**I posted a similar writeup for the Canon S400 about 10 mins ago, and also provide recommendations in that review of what accessories to buy for that camera if you decide to go with it.**<br />Price:<br />-----<br />The Sony DSC-P10 is 5 MP vs. 4 MP for the S400.  The difference in resolution may immediately sway your decision to teh DSC-P10, but I would think very carefully. While the extra 1 MP sounds like a lot, my old 2.0 MP Canon S00 was fine for priting pictures all the way up to 8x10 (w/o any cropping). 4 MP resolution should allow you to price 11x14 with no cropping, and 8x10 with a lot of cropping.  5 MP is just excessive IMO. These days, it's just a race among manufacturers to see who can advertise the highest MP number.<br />Shooting modes and menus<br />---------------------------------<br />P10 also has some convenient shooting modes which make it more user friendly.  It also has great features like cropping, resizing and rotating right on the camera which helps when you are not by a computer and want to free up room on your media storage.  P10 Also has a smartzoom feature which is neat in theory, but as all users of digicams know, you should never use digital zoom of any kind. Turn it off and stick to optical zoom. You can always do the equivalent of \"digital zoom\" on your computer later with any photo editing software, even MS Paint!<br />The flash on the P10 is more offset from the lens than the S400, which will cause shadows to be cast on subjects when you take pictures. Imagine someone shining a flashlight on someone's face from an angle you you taking a picture. You'll see shadows on one side of the person's head. While it is not severe, it is worth noting that this effect is not as noticeable on the S400 (the flash is closer to the lens).<br />S400 has 9 point autofocus system, while P10 has 3 point.  It means that the S400 can choose from 9 points to autofocus from in the current settings you are taking a picture of.  In the end, this means that the canon has better of of chosing the right thing to focus in on which will mean better pictures.  Imagine having 3 oranges and 1 is rotten. You have a 1/3 chance of picking the rotten one. Now imagine you have 9 oranges with 1 rotten one -- you only have a 1/9 chance.  This analogy isn't perfect, but you get my point :)<br />The Canon S400 has a far superior menu system and is much easier to use.<br />Size:<br />-----<br />Canon S400 is smaller, making it a more pocketable camera IMO. The specs shown them being only very slightly different in dimensions, but the total volume of the cameras makes the S400 ideal.  Those with bigger hands may prefer the layout and slightly larger size of the P10 though.<br />Memory storage:<br />---------------<br />The P10 uses Memory cards, which are limited to 128 MB, unless you use the double sided ones (Sony Memory Duo), where you can flip them over to get another 128 MB. Far too much hassle for me.. sounds easy in theory, but in real life, you will hate it. My friend who bought the P10 surely does.  You can get larger memory sticks, which comes in the form of the \"Sony Memory Pro\", which are 256 MB and 512 MB.  Keep in mind though, that these cards have problems acting as regular storage for files, and things like Mp3s for sony mp3 players. They have some type of digital rights management (DRM) on them that have causes lots of problems for people (so i've read on many reviews).  Also, these PRO cards only work in 2003 (or newer) sony devices.  Lastly, the memory pro cards have some type of management files on the cards themselves, taking up about 20MB of space. So a 256 MB card, really only has about 230 MB.  Maybe not a big deal, but com'on, at advertise the size correctly!<br />Battery Life:<br />-------------<br />Battery life on P10 is better than the S400. It will last about 20% longer.  However, the batteries are cheaper for the S400 AFAIK and they also charge in about 1/2 the time vs. the sony batteries.<br />Conclusion:<br />-----------<br />All in all, i think the S400 is a better choice. Sure, CF maybe outdated in a few years in favor of smaller, superior storage media like SD, MMC or xD cards (which are going up to 1 GB btw), but until then you can get a great digicam with dirt cheap media. I picked up a 512 MB Kingston card for very cheap from eBay.  Memory sticks are IMO, completely limited in storage and future expandability. The fact that sony has shunned all pe-2003 devices from using larger than 128 memory duo cards, indicates that users of the P10 can expect similar treatment going forward.  Be warned!","A great camera, and I love it a lot.  But, the mpeg movie feature will require external light and there is no flash plug in feature.  so if you are shooting movies inside at night, make sure the room is well lit.","Great little camera...<br />I was looking for something that I can carry around and take reasonably good pictures with by just pushing down the shutter...<br />I am very happy with this puppy. Picture quality is great - certainly good enough for 13x19 prints...<br />Camera is responsive - quick shutter during daylight and fast save to memory stick - allowing multiple pictures in a short time.<br />The built in scene-selections are sufficient for me...<br />The only gripe I have is that the camera does not auto-rotate pictures taken in portrait orientation (my 5 year old Kodak had no problem doing that)...","I own 4 other digital cameras (digital hobbiest)and bought this one because it seemed to be a pretty nifty overall camera that was small to carry. Went to Las Vegas last week with this camera and found it to be very easy to use with outstanding picture quality and color reproduction. I was even more pleasantly surprised when I got home and downloaded some of the movie clips I had taken at a show in a darkened theater. The results were excellent (for a digital camera) with outstanding sound too.  The MPEG video sucks up memory pretty quick in high res, but gives really great video and audio for a camera that is not considered a camcorder.  Very easy to use and super small to carry.","This is a great product. It does what it is intended to do in a capable fashion with little hassle<br />-<br />Read the review by WOOFUSDOG, it is detailed and CORRECT<br />-<br />I can add 2 notes:<br />The lithium ion battery in this model is a great upgrade compared with the P92. This camera has a better \"fit and finish\" when compared to the DSC P92. This, and some added photographic flexibility make this camera a better buy, even at a higher price.<br />NO \"non-SLR\" camera shoots the same image that is viewed in the viewfinder. Te SONY manual notes this, this is NOT a defect, as cited in another review. When it is too bright to see the LCD, adjust the backlight and brightness, it can be viewed in ANY light. Read the manual, it helps.<br />Buy this camera, a 256mb memory stick, and ADOBE Photoshop Elements for a complete package. READ THE MANUAL....this is a great product if you take the time to learn how to use it........","As I was reading some of the reviews posted for this camera, I felt compelled to clarify some of the glaring errors in other reviews. For my complete review, please scroll down.<br />maflleje complained thoroughly about how there is no black and white shooting mode. Despite claiming to be an \"advanced point and shoot user\" he still has not figured out the basics. Turn the dial to SCN and press \"menu\", it's right there. You can even shoot in Sepia, negative and many other modes that have come with Sony's for a long time.<br />Another incorrect statement is that burst mode takes 3 pictures in succession, when it can actually take up to 16. Also, the lack of a swivel LCD is also irrelevant, because the only digital camera that comes with that also happens to be terrible. The Nikon coolpix has a swivel LCD, and I have never seen such awful pictures from a digital camera as I have seen from that coolpix. And no, the included 32MB stick cannot take 32 pictures in 5 megapixel mode, it takes less than 10. My 256MB card can hold 100 pictures in 5 megapixel mode, therefore 128's can hold 50, etc...<br />Also, one of the best memory sticks also happens to be very hard to find in the search. Search for \"Sony MSA128S2 256 MB\" on amazon. It's cheap, fast, and sony brand.<br />Another ridiculous comment is that you can't delete pictures from your camera from windows explorer. I think that person just needs to learn how to use windows. Simply click \"move files to different location\" which is in the upper right of the window, and after moving the pictures to whatever folder they are automatically deleted off the camera.<br />Another person complained about having to buy a memory stick reader. Any memory reader is the most useless thing ever and a complete waste of money. You can already leave your memory stick in your camera and then plug that directly into the computer. With a memory stick reader you take the memory stick out of the camera and plug it into the reader which plugs into the computer. THAT IS THE EXACT SAME THING.<br />Also, people have complained about the included 32MB memory stick. Almost all other leading manufacturers don't include any memory at all. Nikon, Fuji, and Canon do not come with compactflash cards, and some Kodak's come with small internal memory. So be thankful that you get anything at all from Sony, it's a good way to start.<br />Also, one person complained about a lack of a 2 megapixel setting on the camera, making it slow to upload pictures online via dialup. If you post your pictures to MSN groups or many other sites, they automatically truncate the pictures for you, so you don't have to reduce them to that size. On top of that, you could even use the included 1 megapixel setting if you have dialup, because 1 megapixel looks almost exactly the same as a 5 megapixel when printed or viewed in 4 X 6 format.<br />So, unless you're an absolute hardcore professional, this camera is awesome and is almost for everyone. If you're pro, go for a Canon rebel Ti digital or Sony V1. Otherwise please do not make baseless incorrect complaints about my favorite camera.","I am one of those persons who is sometimes uncomfortable with high-tech things, so it takes time until I get enthusiastic about them. But this camera really captured my attention very quickly. I also had a traditional camera with me when I had this Sony, but I barely used it.<br />I have to say that this is very easy to use and understand. I use a lot of high-tech devices in my activitites, but it is for the first time when I feel compelled to review something electronic. That will tell you how much I enjoy this camera.<br />It is a small device, so that it fits into a pocket, easy to be used, and the quality of the pictures is very high. I managed to make very nice photos and capture certain details that a traditional camera would not have managed to do. I even know someone who published some photos taken with this camera. You can also make short movies: even if the quality is limited, it is fun.","As an owner of the 2 megapixel Sony DSC-S50 I was a little disappointed with the DSC-P10.  First of all it's missing the ability to shoot B&W photos.  Although you can edit your photos with basic photo software later, you no longer have the ability to view and shoot B&W photos.  Another feature greatly missed is the 2\" swivel LCD display.  This allowed you to hold your camera over your head, out over a ledge or lower than eye level without you having to get in those positions to take a picture.  Most disappointing, though is the slow response time.  Being new to the 5 megapixel realm, this may be common.  But taking one picture to the next, especially when using a flash, can take up to 7 seconds.  A cool new feature is Burst mode, which allows you to take 3 photos in a little over a second.  But again going from one set of three to the next takes a whopping 9 seconds.<br />Now for the good stuff.  Being an \"advanced\" point-and-shoot user, I like the ease of use along with the more advanced controls the DSC-P10 gives you in taking photos.  I'm learning how to use the histogram to get desired lighting effects.  The menus are fairly easy to learn and navigate and the compact size makes it easy to carry.  The Burst mode, mentioned earlier, is a cool feature.  And, as was with the case of the DSC-S50, I'm very satisfied with the sharp picture quality.  A great improvement in the Movie mode is the 640 x 480 resolution and no longer being limited to 15 seconds worth of video.  Now your only limitation is the size of your memory stick.<br />One recommendation if you decide on this camera, get a spare battery or the starter kit that includes the spare battery.  The battery life on this camera is about an hour and fifteen minutes.  Not long enough for an event or a day out on vacation.  Also get at least a 128 MB memory stick.  The 32 MB stick that comes with the camera only gives you 24 pictures in the 5 megapixel mode.  Again not enough for a day out.","This is a good digi camera, I bought this camera before thanksgiving.<br />Pro: Small, lastest features other camera don't have it, very easy to use, even my parents and grand parents no how to use it. shooting high quality movie, but this feature is depend on your memory stick, if you got a 16 meg ram of memory stick, forget it. If you got 1gb memory stick, this is very useful. it can shoot more than 1/2 hour - 45 mins mpeg movie.<br />Con: Expensive, The back panel that open the camera to sync the pic thingy, it is very easy to broke, so watch out for that. If you really don't wanna get broke of the back panel, i recommence you buy a memory stick reader, and a battery charger.<br />Picture quality is very good, with 5 megapixels, and autofocus work very well.<br />The cheapest place I can find is amazon.com. you can check yahoo shopping too, they have some store sell very cheap, but it is not trustable.","I have been a digital camera user for over 5 years now and I have been fortunate enough to experience a variety of cameras including the Kodak DC 240, Canon A400, Canon S30/S45, Nikon Coolpix 3100, Kodak DX6340, and finally Sony P10. Let me just say that the P10 takes by far the best pictures and it's compact size can easily fit into your pocket. Of all the digital cameras I have used they all have varying degrees of lightning problems, but the Sony P10 has the best looking night pictures of the group. The P10 comes with a lithium ion battery that lasts way longer than the conventional Nickel metal-hydride batteries other cameras use. I believe it is most useful to compare this camera to the competition.<br />Almost all Kodak cameras include a one time use battery that cannot be recharged. In fact, you cannot even put in a lithium ion battery into any Kodak except for the very top model. A lithium ion battery is almost essential for digital cameras since they use so much power. If anything other than Lithium ion is used, you will be changing batteries every 10 minutes. I ended up returning the Kodak to amazon.com for this reason alone.<br />Canon digital cameras include a lithium ion battery but my biggest gripe about Canon's are poor quality pictures indoor or night conditions. Many pictures were taken in a cave with one of those compact Canon cameras and they looked awful when compared to the Sony. The Canon S45 is far too big and heavy and the indoor pictures are only mediocre.<br />My friend has a Nikon coolpix 3100 and for a brand that professionals use, this camera has the worst lighting problems of any digital camera I have ever seen. In fact, the lighting issues were so terrible that even my five year old Kodak DC 240 looked way better.<br />Olympus cameras are okay only that they do not come with Lithium ion batteries, but you can buy those separately at least, unlike Kodak.<br />The reason I do not mention the many types of shooting modes each camera has is because they are relatively the same. The Sony comes with a lot of features including Night Shot, night shot with a person in the foreground, multi-burst shooting which is useful for sports (you can take up to 16 consecutive images of things like a baseball swing), it even has special modes for taking pictures of water and a separage mode for snow.<br />The great thing about this camera is, it's perfect for amateurs and people a little more advanced. All the pictures I've taken so far look great in point and shoot mode, but it also allows you to adjust the shutter speed, white balance, and much more for people who are into that sort of thing.<br />I found the controls for the Sony P10 very intuitive. For all the basic controls I didn't have to consult the manual. The controls are not as intuitive on the Canon S45, it's a little weird, and the Nikon coolpix doesn't record sound in the movies. Most Kodak's play back movies and pictures with the lens open and out, which I think is stupid because then you risk damaging the lens when you don't have to.<br />Also, if you subscribe to consumer reports, you will notice that Sony has the lowest number of repairs followed by Canon in a close second. I have experienced repairs myself as my Kodak DC240 lens got stuck one day and I had to send it in to Eastman Kodak for repair.<br />Also the Sony doesn't have a great big delay when taking each picture, a lot of cameras have this problem. Another thing that bothered me about the other cameras is the time it takes for the camera to be ready to take pictures after you turn it on. Sony cameras tend to be ready fast right after you turn it on, which has helped me capture so many more moments, believe me when I say you'll miss lots of great moments before other cameras turn on.<br />The sony also has a really wonderful movie mode, where the audio is crisp and the movies are clear. My only complaint about the movies are, they don't have image stabilization, so they turn out a little more jiggly than I would like, and for some reason the zoom is disabled when you're in the middle of recording movies. All minor things, but they should be noted.<br />The great thing about 5 megapixels is, you can get your photos blown up to 20X30, and believe me when I say that is really cool. Also, if you were ever to make these pictures your desktop wallpaper, they look good even at 1280 X 1024, which is the highest resolution on a 17\" monitor.<br />Also, I don't know why everyone complains about the included 32MB memory stick. Yes I do understand it is too small to truely use and you have to buy another one, but most digital cameras such as the Canon don't come with any memory at all! The small card that comes with Sony's is to just get you started, and by giving you that they already outdo other manufacturers.<br />Overall, the Sony P10's compact size, wonderful quality pictures, intuitive interface, good price, variety of features and durability make it the perfect choice of digital camera for almost everyone. I cannot recommend this awesome camera enough!","Oh this camera is good! It is easy to use and it takes great pictures on the day time. At night it is always hard to take sharp pictures though, a lot of my pictures are blurry, especially when you do a full optical zoom. I am not sure if it is a problem across all digital camera though. The picture colors are not as bright as some other cameras but it seems to be more \"realistic\" photos (ie not articially brightness enhanced). I would have preferred to get DSC-V1 though, because of so many enhancements as well as Carl-Zeiss lens but at the time of purchase the price of DSC-V1 is out of my league.<br />Here are some of the things that annoys me:<br />- Does not have 2Megapixel settings. Sure, why do u want 2Megapixel pictures when there is 5Mp and 3.2Mp available? But have u ever try to load up 3.2 or 5 Mp pictures (about 1.2 - 3 Mb in size) to the internet, if you only have dialup modem available? Also, you really do not want to put such big pictures on the net anyway. 2Mp pictures are sized around 300 - 400k which is reasonable.<br />- Only silver color camera available in USA (Asian countries and Australia sells red/blue colors as well).<br />- 32Mb memory sticks included: I mean come on, that is so small! I thought it is a joke that Sony gives such small memory sticks. I never used it because it would too easily be filled up after taking a few shots. I probably will use it for backing up of my Sony Clie instead. Sony should give out 128Mb memory sticks instead, especially it is so much cheaper these days.<br />My recommendations are:<br />- Get a spare battery, especially when you travel overseas. Even though I sometimes managed to use only 1 battery per day, when u go somewhere u just point and shoot and do not think about battery life, so it is simply better to get a spare. if you can afford to fork out so much for this camera I cannot see why you cannot get a spare battery as well.<br />- Get large size memory sticks (like 256Mb or more), especially when u are taking high resolution pictures. I personally have multiple 128Mb memory sticks.<br />By the way, get the Sony tripod as well. It is small, portable and reasonable price. Good for taking group photos!","bought this camera Dec of 2003.  This is a great camera with outstanding image quality, perfect for point-and-shoot use, though I did return it shortly after purchase in exchange for the Sony DSC-V1.  For only a hundred bucks more, the V1 has full aperture, ISO, and f-stop adjustment, which this camera does NOT have.  The lens on the V1 is a bit better in my opinion as well. BUT, make no mistake, if this is in your price range, and you don't mind giving up total exposure control, this camera is an outstanding, best-in-class choice.  I would have kept it if the Sony DSC-V1 were considerably more expensive, but since it wasn't, I went with the full manual control which that model provides.  Either way, you should be happy with one of these two great Sony cams, and at 5MP, you should be happy for a long time!","At first I was not to sure which 5megapixel camera to purchase however one of my friends emailed me a picture of his new kitchen and I could not believe how amazing and clear it was. Turned out he shot it with this camera that was the turning point in making my decision. The battery was a little shaky to begin with however once i drained it fully and recharged overnight its been excellent ever since.<br />I would recommend getting a 256mb memory card but no the magic gate just the regular double sided 128mb will suffice.<br />You won't regret buying this camera its amazing value for money especially with the $50 current mail in rebate!","The Sony dsc \"P10\" Digital Camera is the top pick for CSC. Running against cameras like Olympus stylus, Canon Powereshot, Sony V1, Nikon, Fuji, and More. The new release of 5.0 mega pixels has shot prices for digital cameras up to $1000+. This camera I purchased through a Private Dealer cost me $400.86. The Retail Price is Running $499.00 to $599.00. Purchase this camera from a wholesale dealer for the best price $377.00. Great Photo Even in dim light w/o a flash. The p10 is very compact. Can eaisly fit into any pocket. The camera can record 90 minutes of mpeg like a home movie. There are alot of great digital cameras on the market that shoot good pictures and video. What makes the p10 the top pick is it comes with a rechargeable lithum battery. Many use AA batterys, the digital camera consumes theses AA batterys in about two hours time whill the unit is on. That can add continious expense to the camera. It's also the best resolution on the market. 6.0 megapix is out, though only a few. And the smallest that we found. Also the best price for a major brand.","This was my first digital camera.  I like the ease of the Sony and feel like it has been very easy to learn how to operate.  The pictures I have taken have been great and the color and clarity have been good.  The only drawback is that the pictures can become blurred very easily with even the slightest movement.  And it seems slow to take pictures sometimes but I might be trying to compare it too much with a 35mm.  Overall, I would highly recommend this camera.","It's so light I had to keep checking my camera bag to make sure I hadn't lost it. Initially I was reluctant about the only 3X zoom, until I downloaded the first set of 5MB (then 4, 3 and 2 & finally 1.2MB being most versatile) images to my laptop & realized that you don't need zoom when you get such incredibly clarity and can zoom in on the actual picture to see detail that you never noticed visually. You can crop and edit accordingly. There's an email size mode as well - only 55-65kb. Menu navigation is a breeze (without consulting the manual) and easier than my previous Cybershot cams. I bought the 1GB Magic Gate stick (cost more than the camera!) but I can now use the little thing as a video cam for up to 90 mins in MPEG4 (great for interviews, presentations or stuff you want to edit later). Night shots no problem, but hold VERY still, as your slightest movement will create blur. The external device \"garage\" is well placed under one flap.","i upgraded from an olympus 2.1 megapixel camera to the p10 and have never looked back!  this is by far a camera that produces quality rich pics with crystal clear detail, vibrant colors and a fairly easy to use operating format.  i've printed many 8 1/2 x 11in pics and keep getting the same response from people when i tell them that its from a digital camera and not film.  they are totally blown away!!!  so am i!  this camera not only makes film processing obsolete but it also produces images that give film a run for their money.  the battery life is fairly long compared to my old camera and the camera design is very sleek and compact.  i dont think i'll be trading this camera for a while.  the p10 has been one of my best electronic buys ever!","While the pictures the camera takes are of pretty great quality, the biggest problem I have with this camera is that if you move it even just a little while you take a picture, the whole picture is blurry. Not great for candid moments, when you don't have time to hold perfectly still. If you just figure a way to get past this problem, you've got a great camera on your hands.","I bought this camera a month before and have one big problem. After taking a photo with flash, it takes about 10 secs to recharge. This creates a lot of problems in birthday parties. I missed a lot of good photographic moments due to that. I am going to send back since it is covered by warranty. Otherwise the camera is a \"awesome\"<br />-- sun","I just took my new DSC-P10 on a two-week trip through the Canadian Rockies, where I took over 300 pictures of the scenery, people, indoor and outdoor points of interest, etc.  The camera performed flawlessly, and the pictures are incredible - especially for a camera that fits easily in your shirt pocket!  There are tradeoffs in a camera this compact, of course, like the size of the LCD display - but those are expected.  I took two 256-MB memory sticks and two batteries, and did the whole vacation without having to download pictures to a PC (didn't bring one), or running out of battery power over the course of any day.  I took most pictures at 3.1 Megapixels, which is all that's needed for any normal print, but I used the full 5 Megapixel resolution for those special scenic shots.  The camera seems to do an outstanding job with its automatic exposure mode, but I used the spot metering for particularly difficult situations and was also happy with those results.  Rendition of colors was excellent.  Most of the menus are reasonably easy to figure out, but some of the symbols displayed on the LCD are hard to identify, and sometimes a little small to try and read.  Overall, a GREAT camera that I'd recommend to anyone.","Back in 2001 I bought the brand new DSC-P3 after months of researching digi-cams online and at the stores. I loved that camera, because it was Sony quality which seems to last forever; I admit I have dropped it several times and it works great. The camera is still running strong as I sold it to a friend, sadly I was slowing becoming unhappy with it because of the lack of zooming features, I knew that I should have bought the one with zoom.<br />Well back in early august I decided on the DSC-P8 as my replacement digi-cam as I from my P3 that Sony cameras last, and it had a 5 mega pixel resolution with zoom, everything I wanted. As I walked into the store to look at the display I felt uneasy about spending the $400 on the camera because it was not as compact as my P3 and I didn't like the look as much as my old one. Then I remembered how I regretted not getting the next model up from my P3 which was why I was in the store looking at Digi-cams again. So I looked up one model then two, and alas I found that I liked the P10 more and could afford to spend the extra $100 for the extra features that were the best at the time, and still are I hope, as so two years down the road I wouldn't be buying another yet.<br />So Far it has been a few months and already I have taking thousands of pictures with amazing quality and I love the camera. So many features and great battery life, not to mention the zoom is so great that I closed in on a plane flying over head that looked no more then a dot in the sky and managed to see the planes markings in the picture on my computer without any enhancing. Great! Not I finally have the camera of my dreams.<br />This is the camera for me, great features and improvements over my P3 and well worth the money. For $100 more I am happier that now I have a super compact, fast and reliable camera that I have already dropped once and it is still fine. When I say compact, it is half an inch smaller then the already small P3. Check it out! It have USB 2.0 which I don't have yet as I need to convince the girlfriend first, and supports up to 1GB which is more then an hour of high quality video as compared to the seconds I got with my P3.<br />BUY ONE!","I just purchased this camera, September 1, 2003 and absolutely love it! I like good pictures without all the fuss and this does it!  It's basically very easy to use and well worth the money spent. I'm VERY happy with my choice, no regrets!","I'd like to mention some very interesting and hard to find out information about the p10 that I hope will be helpful.<br />Smart zoom allows addional zoom power if you are shooting below maximum camera pixel capability. This can only be seen on the screen and not in the view finder.<br /> The video compression works well but fast motion may seem a little jerky. Almost 6 minutes of VGA fits on a 128 meg card. A 256 meg card goes for as little as [money amount]plus shipping on the net. Camera allows dividing video and deleting unwanted side for reducing memory use. Zoom function does not work during video probably bewcause of noise or focus issues. There is also an email quality video mode which will give  90 minutes of recording with adequate sound.This allows recording a lecture or interview in video with sound! The included software seems to only allow saving editing to MPEG1 which is computer only. I don't understand this. Maybe they want to sell something else. Don't get stuck with a lot of work you can't put on a video disk and look into other software.<br />On the web you can download Projector Station 4.1 which is for putting  jpeg images into xga format and into a file on a memory stick card for projectors. This allows about 500 images onto a 128 meg card in a file that can be accessed from your camera. When you are visiting the relatives you can bring all of your family photos in the camera for playing on the tv with the video output cable supplied. If they have windows xp the camera will allow you to hook up with only the cable w/o any software and and have camera memory show as a drive. You can copy any pictures you want to other computer. Very 2K!<br />The battery really lasts quite well and the camera will tell you how much time is left on it. You can also purchase extended life batteries. The long cords on the charger are awkward and it must plug into the camera to charge battery. An external charger would be convenient.<br />Camera will stay contiuously in focus allowing a much quicker shutter response than other cameras. Using the manual distance setting speeds things up also. You can edit still pictures by zooming in during preview and then cropping what isn't in the screen. You can also make lower resolution copies of pictures for emails.<br />The camera takes surprising quality shots in low light without the flash. I am guessing that it somehow processes the images to avoid some of the low shutter blur. The camera is amazing and it fits in my pocket.","This is a terrific little camera - well-built, easy to use, nice features, compact and classy look. Of course, if you have advanced skills and experience, you'll want more camera. But, this one is great for the average photographer.<br />Do NOT buy the camera from sony.com. They stink! I bought my personal p10 from a local dealer. I bought another one as a gift from sony.com. For the prices and the Sony name, it is disgraceful. There is NO customer service and delivery is SLOW. It's really unbelievable. For your sake, purchase it somewhere else.","I recently purchased this camera and was impressed with its ease of use, and especially its crystal clear photos (when sized on my computer to 800x600).  The only disappointments with this camera were that there was no manual focus, and the automatic focus that's included does not focus on things unless they're about a meter away.  The closest you get to manual focus is a  menu option that lets you choose approximately how far away your target is, and this isn't very precise.  On the bright side, the camera's photos are brilliant, and its compact size allows for easy portability.  I may return it, however, to get a camera that does have manual focus and perhaps a RAW image format mode - which this camera does not have.","This is a great compact camera and simple to use. It has lots of options to play around. The quality of the pic is excellent. It also tranforms to a camcorder which is great for weekend photographer that prefer lots of activity.<br />I would suggest to try and check this out.","I recently purchased the Sony DSC-P10 as a second digital camera. My first digital camera was a Sony DSC-P30 (1.3 mpx). This camera is the smallest camera out there that offers 5 mpx. I like it because it easily fits into your pocket so you're more prone to take it with you randomly. Sometimes, there are moments you just have to capture on film! There are a lot of accessories that you can purchase (against what someone else said, there is an additional flash add-on, and filters and other things).<br />This camera offers basic features for those \"point and shoot\" people out there. If you have no idea with what to do with ISO settings, exposure, etc... this camera is perfect for you! It has so many preset modes (most of them work well... some have to be retuned). The image quality is about the same with other cameras in the compact range (this camera is sub compact) if you consider the size. Yes, the Canon 5 mpx cameras have better image quality, but they are much bulkier.<br />If you prefer a camera w/ more manual control options, then I'd go with a Canon or Nikon. They seem to have the most features that make the digicam rival high end SLR cameras. If you'd prefer Sony, I would go with the new V1 5 mpx. It's like the P10, but with a lot of advanced features for those advanced photographers out there.","One word Awsome.  I have had the camera and underwater housing for 2 weeks now, and have made 2 dives with it.  I can't begin to describe the quality of the pictures above and below the water.  The features on it will take a little time to master but once you do, you will not want to put this down.","This is my third digital camera. My first being a Mavica 1.2 Pixels, my third a Sony 3.2 Pixels and now the P10 5.0. So far Im greatly satisfied. It has many features and the MPEG videos look great. The pictures look awsome. I was amazed at the quality of the pictures taken in dark places. The Auto Focus Illuminator is awsome, it shoots that red laser and its cool. It took me about 2 days to get really comfortable with the camera and its small too, alot smaller than the P92 with the same features. I do recommend getting a memory stick of 256MB or higher. I really dont have any complaints with the camrea, I highly recommend it for everyone.","What a purchase!<br />This camera is easy to use and has great performances. In order to use it at its best I recommend to get a 128 Mb memory card. This will allow you to store many high quality pictures and also good quality short videos.<br />When it comes to download the files in your PC, it's a true \"plug and play\" procedure (at least with XP). You plug the USB and the PC starts downloading the files automatically, in the folder of your choice.<br />Another smart feature is that it works with both regular and rechargeable batteries (that are included).<br />The camera comes with a specific program (for the PC) that I immediately uninstalled, since it's not user friendly and, at the end, totally unuseful compared with what XP allows you to do.<br />In order to play / work with your pictures, Photoshop remains the best option.<br />I definitely rate this camera 5 stars.","i feel that this camera is geared towards novice users who are looking for an ultracompact, high resolution, point and shoot.  in that regard, the dsc-p10 succeeds but i kept thinking that it would be nice if the camera had more features that users could grow into.<br />pros:<br />- 5MP resolution and 3X optical zoom<br />- very compact (smaller and lighter than the competition) with a stylish body<br />- excellent build quality - no squeaks or rattles here<br />- easy to use<br />- convenient e-mail features<br />- good battery life<br />- good neutral colour balance<br />- automatic white balance worked well under both daylight and incandescent lighting<br />- infrared AF assist lamp - i definitely prefer this to white light assist lamps<br />- MPEG recording only limited by the size of your memory stick<br />- selectable ISO sensitivities<br />- has a multi-burst continuous shooting mode<br />- good on-screen information<br />- quick acting auto focus - typically locks within a second<br />- relatively quick startup<br />- automatic lens cover<br />- battery charges while in the camera - you don't have to remove the battery to recharge<br />- usb 2.0 connectivity means faster downloads of pics<br />cons:<br />- occasional image noise<br />- operational times could be faster<br />- the included 32MB memory stick is inadequate; be ready to shell out additional $$ for more memory<br />- you pay a premium for the sony brand<br />- softer images than the competition<br />- occasional ghosting<br />- very limited manual controls (no aperture- and shutter-priority modes!)<br />- autofocus points are not selectable<br />- no control over colour saturation or tone<br />- no manual white balance<br />- no RAW file capture<br />this is a very nice camera.  for someone looking for an ultracompact point and shoot, this would be perfect.  however, if you think that you'll want more manual control in the future, i would recommend getting a camera such as the canon s50.  about the same price, a little bigger, but you'll have a camera you can grow into.  good shooting!","If you are considering the Sony P10, you are probably looking for your first digital camera.  If so, you are considering a very worthwhile purchase, both in the abstract (acquiring a digital camera) and in the concrete (the Sony P10). I've had a P9--the previous model--for about six months, and I am extremely pleased with it.  I often comment that it has \"changed my life.\"  (More on that below.)  First, here are the features I really like about the P9:<br />__ 1) Very small (fits in your pocket).<br />__ 2) Great resolution (5.0 megapixels is very nice).<br />__ 3) Delay after pressing shutter button is quite short.<br /><br />__ 4) Good selection of features, which are easy to access.<br />__ 5) Very easy to download images to your computer.<br />__ 6) Memory sticks are very compact and have multiple uses.<br />If you are new to digital photography, #3 will come as a surprise to you. Be sure to check this on any digital camera you consider!  Some have a delay of close to a second, and it will drive you crazy if you intend to photograph anything but static objects (i.e. NO people).  With regard to memory sticks, I'm a big fan.  They are very small and can be used in other devices such as camcorders, computers, and voice recorders.<br />There are a few things that could be improved in the P9, although these things do not seem to be appreciably better in other models that I've considered, and are often significantly worse. Here are the things that could be better:<br />__ 1) Built-in flash is terrible (as are all built-in flashes).<br />__ 2) No connector for an external flash.  (Argh!)<br />__ 3) Annoying delay after pressing the on/off button.<br />__ 4) High capacity memory sticks (over 128 MB) are expensive.<br />With respect to the flash, I think it is best to think of the P9 as having no flash at all.  If you don't mind having everything look flat, with stark shadows, go ahead and use the flash.  Otherwise, you are much better off using natural light--the brighter the better.  (Note: low light images are grainer, and consume more memory as the compression algorithms are less effective on grainy images.) I would really ding the P9 for this, if it were not that every point-and-click camera I've ever seen, digital or otherwise, has a similarly pathetic flash.  (Why can no manufacturer get this right?  Simply being able to bounce the light off the ceiling would help immeasurably!) Finally, when you hit the on/off button, there is a delay of several seconds before you get any indication that the camera is going to turn on/off.  This can be very confusing, especially since the button provides no tactile feedback!<br />Now, a few comments to newbie digital photographers (as I was six months ago). I'm sure you can already list some of the obvious advantages of digital photography: 1) You can preview them on-the-spot, 2) You need only keep the ones you like, 3) You can store them on your computer, email them, and post them on the web very easily (i.e. no scanning).  But, is this all hype, or does it really make a difference?  My answer is this: It makes a FAR GREATER difference than you can begin to anticipate!  To me the difference is so significant that I can scarcely compare digital and conventional photography.  They are distinct activities. As proof of this, I now take (conservatively) ten times more photos than I used to, and I continually view them, compose them, and share them using my computer.  All of these things are possible with conventional photography, just like it's possible to walk ten miles to work rather than drive.  You could do those things; you just won't.  Admit it, you're human.<br />Whether you buy the P10 or not, do yourself a huge favor and purchase a digital camera (especially if you have kids).  You'll wonder why you waited so long to take the plunge.","I think this model of sony is out of comparison to any other brand. In fact, it yield superior quality of pictures, very handy and excellant features.<br />I cant imagine buying another one.<br />I had previous model P72 but got this new one to have facility of using the under water hausing.<br />great camera , great price","One great camera from Sony!!

This is my second digital camera, I was so happy with my first one that I waited 4 years to upgrade. This camera has been worth the upgrade.<br />  Another reviewer mentioned not being able to choose shutter speed, I think they just haven't explored their menu fully. It does pay to spend a day studying the user guide and playing with the different options and features.<br />The camera is very easy to use and a great compact size. We did choose to upgrade to a larger 256 memory stick. I like that the sticks are directly compatible to and make it easy to transfer from camera to computer to pda.","Just got this camera a few weeks ago and had the chance to use it at family gatherings over 4th of July weekend.....no complaints at all! Compact, easy to use, good-looking, and most of all takes great pictures! Getting a 5-megapixel camera for the same price as most other manufacturers' 4 MP models is a huge advantage! The movie mode is also lots of fun. It's also super easy to transfer pics to the computer, just USB and go! As with the other Sony products I own, this camera draws oohs and aahs whenever I take it out! All in all a great deal for the camera, although one might want to invest in a 128 MB memory stick and extra battery for vacations and longer picture taking events when downloading to a PC is not readily available. Pick it up!","I bought this camera recently. Being a bit of photo enthusiast was really impressed with quality and features of this camera. The features are very close to what you get with any 35 mm SLR cameras. It took us a little time to get the hang of the AF feature ( I recommend using the center AF not multi AF as unlike SLR it doesn't tell you where the camera is focusing). You can watch the photos taken on your TV also... and if you want with some voice comments too :-).<br />It's an excellent camera. Hat's off to Sony!!","As usual, Sony has outdone themselves.  I have never had a problem with anything Sony I've ever owned--and this camera is no exception.<br />It boasts 5 megapixel pictures, countless features, good looks--in a package small enough to drop in your pocket--amazing.  Menu is easy to navigate, read and understand.  We upgraded immediately to a 128 meg card, although we wanted to get the 256--we opted not to deal with the copyright issues on the memory stick pro cards.  It seems some photography stores can't develop pictures from those protected cards--not good.  You can get a nice 128 for about $... now!<br />...  Other options include upgraded lenses, tripods and other toys you can grow into--very nice indeed!<br />We have been told by some very knowledgable industry folks that we may never have to buy another digital camera again!  Overall--we are very happy with this Sony DSC-P10--we can't wait to start booking vacations!","It has every thing that you need for home photography and at the price I think it is more than worth it...I have used the Nikon 3100, Powershot A70, Powershot A60, Sony P72..but there is none better than this...I have to tell you though the A60 was my second crush.<br />The night photos in pitch dark room was surprizingly very clear...havent seen a photo with red-eye(s).. plus it so compact...just hope they had put a little more memory with it...","excellent picture quality, outstanding features, long lasting batteries, compact size, high quality"]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P72","amazon_reviews":["Not happy","I've own this camera for nearly 12 years.

I assumed that the 16GB disc was included as listed under the product information.

Therefore you have to have a memory card.....specifically a \"memory stick pro\" which is different from most point and shoot digital cameras today.  The memory stick pro card is more expensive because they are outdated and hard to find.  The camera itself is very sturdy and takes decent pictures for being a 3.2Megapixel camera.

(at Amazon)<br />Am very happy.  Did have a hard time finding a memory card, but finally got one at Amazon.","All I can say about this camera is that's it's great.  We bought this exact same camera the year it first came out in 2003 for our sons wedding. We had never had a digital camera before and this camera is great. It's seven years old now and is still working great. We love to use it for short videos. It will take up to the memory stick pro 2 GB. So you can really take alot of pictures on this one stick.  I just purchased another one the other day that I happened to find on Amazon.com and when I received it it looked as good as new and everything works perfectly. I can't even tell the two cameras apart. I really am thrilled that I only payed $39.00 for it. Very Happy with this camara and will buy another one just like if I find another deal.  My family consist of my husband and myself and our teenage daughter and she's always using our camera and now that I've found a second one she'll have her own.","This camera was purchased to replace one that had gotten broken (same DSCP-72 Cyber Shot). It takes great pictures and is so easy to use. Glad I was able to replace it at a great price.  Shipped fast, product was as described and works great.<br />Thanks","The Sony camera that I bought takes extremely good photos...I am as pleased as punch with the results!","I gave this camera to my children to take pictures of my grandchildren  who live in another country.  They post them to a site on the internet, and I can see them as well as order paper copies.  The camera works well, and we are all pleased with it.","I've had this camera for three years now. I've experienced all the same issues as many folks here. The strange power off/with lens open, then reversing. The only thing I've done is immediately remove the batteries after turning on the camera while pushing the lens in. it works!<br /><br />I have a suggestion for those of you with blurry pictures. This camera has 5-6 settings for the quality of photos. If you press the trash icon button while in regular mode (do not have an image up screen) the menu for image size will appear. These are jgs folks. They are pixel based and can be very small. Also jpgs are meant for screen viewing, not printing, so you need to boost them up in order to get decent prints from these images.  If you want clear images..please try to use the highest setting possible in order for the camera to record as many pixels of information. I use the highest setting 3.1M (other options are 2.8M, 2.0, 1.2 and VGA (which is the lowest and will give you terribly blurry picutres). It's quite easy to mistakenly press this button and change the image size, (this happened to us once while on vacation..terribly frustrating when I discovered what should have been beautiful, mmemorable photos were all at a low resolution.) Please give this a try<br /><br />I'm all for class action suit vis a vis the battery chomping and lens issues. It's uncanny how often this has happened to so many people.","a good first camera, it is cheap and has good simple to use auto modes. The macro mode was a bit disapointing, it is difficult to get clear pictures with alot of detail but not imposible. low light videos or pictures with out a flash tend to have a red tint to them. It is a bit large for the features it offers, and the softwear which came with it was not very user friendly.  I have been pleased with it for pictures of family and friends. pointing and shooting usualy yields good clear pictures which I have been able to enlarge to 16\" by 22\" with no distortion.  The video mode works well for capturing fun moments, but most be taken in a well light area.","Did alot of research before buying - had the camera 2+ years and it takes awesome and vivid outdoor pics but indoor tends to be a little \"warm\" (read orange/reddish) in auto mode.  No dial to change settings - you have go into a menu system.  Has good flash and takes good 640X480 movies (with sound) limited in time only by memory space.  Only complaint is recharge time between flash shots - 3 to 4 seconds.  I was surprised to see that it is still avaialable.","I purchased one of these cameras a few years ago and still use it today for all sorts of photography. Eventhough the camera is a 3.2MP it takes very clear pictures, I remember when I took a picture of a friend, he commented that it looked like a picture taken out of an 5 or 6MP camera.<br /><br />I have been nothing but happy with this camera. It takes 2 double A batteries and has been everywhere with me, from FL to CO, to the deserts in Israel, or the dams in Amsterdam. This is a really great camera.","I have a sony cyber-shot DSC P72 and find it takes super photos, easy to use and have no problems with it whatsoever. Looking for another for my son...","I Have this camera and love it. No problems whatsoever and in fact i am buying another for my son. I happen to have lost my manual on this camera though and was hoping someone may have one they dont need/want. [...]","This was my first digital camera purchased in Jan. 2004.<br />I've had it over a year and have taken hundreds of pictures with it. The camera has functioned well and is very easy to use. The main problem with it is blurred pictures. Very annoying. Out of the last 20 or so pictures we took with it almost half have been blurred. The LCD is too small to tell, so get ready for some disappointment when it comes time to review and print your pictures. At first I thought it was user error and that they weren't waiting for the AF to finish, but it happens to me, too. The default shutter speed indoors is 1/30th /sec. which meant a tripod in my old SLR days. After looking at the last batch of blurry shots on the Memory Stick I hung it up and bought a DSC-W1.<br />The DSC-P72 is also very slow between shots, frustrating when trying to capture an unwilling subject, such as a small child.","It's priced well an gets well lit photos.<br /><br />It doesn't focus as well shooting indoors. The more light there is for focusing the better. The focus assist beam helps. Outside photos have no problem.<br /><br />Also, with no flash, photos indoors can appear shaked, but not that bad.<br /><br />Video capabilty to good for the price. You can start recording an image quicker even if its 60% of 1mp for video. Helpful when you have limited time and cant take a photo.<br /><br />Useful modes, effects and beutiful photos make it a pleasing camera to have.","This is my first ever camera, and in comparison to my relative's and friend's cameras, it fares very well. Comparatively inexpensive against other cameras in its class.<br /><br />Sony makes it very easy to just take photo shots on a whim and still comes out with great pictures. Of course, I had to teach myself to hold the camera still, but maintains excellent picture quality. I love the movie mode which allows for awesome pictore movies, great if you want to take family videos, but don't want the hassel of a huge camcorder. Or, just to capture that moment.<br /><br />But, as wtih many things, it's advisable to get an extended warranty.","This camera is great.  Especially for beginners.  It has a lot of advanced features that are easy to use.  It makes great photos that are crystal clear.  It allows you to zoom in onm a shot and crop it and select a mega-pixel level (which some cameras don't do)  This is a great camera, but the new 4 mega-pixel is better.","The Sony DSCP72 is my first digital camera after getting a lot of use out of my old Canon Elph APS camera. I was looking for something with the features of the higher-end cameras but the form (and price!) of the middle-range models. The P72 delivers in this sense. It has enough features to satisfy the Ansel Adams in all of us, while still being extremely simple and intuitive to use.<br /><br />I'll elaborate on some pros and cons<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- good size and weight<br /><br />- includes rechargeable batteries and charger that give the camera great battery life<br /><br />- movie mode is one of the best I've seen (and unlike other cameras, you can record a movie until your memory card runs out or your battery dies, which ever comes first! On my 256 MB card, this means about 10 minutes of large video and 2 hours 40 minutes of e-mail-size video)<br /><br />- gives you good control over what you want to be automatic, and what you want to control<br /><br />- excellent picture quality<br /><br />- good zoom<br /><br />- crisp LCD display<br /><br />- fully compatible with Mac OS X and iPhoto (fast transfers, too)<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- dismal battery life with standard AAs; bad if you're away from your charger and those are all you can get your hands on<br /><br />- only 2 picture quality settings; Fine and Standard<br /><br />- slow to load after taking a picture with the flash<br /><br />- slow to turn on/off<br /><br />Overall the P72 is an excellent choice, as someone's first foray into digital photography or as a step-up from an entry-level model.","Works very good outdoors. Even better with automaticly summoned flash.<br /><br />In a shady location, image looks better if you:<br /><br />---Press Menu, go up to program, go right, pick ISO 100.<br /><br />If you're aiming outside and it's dark near where you're shooting:<br /><br />---Go to Menu, go in program, and choose spot, choose low flash, and exit menu. Then press the Up button until it's SL-.<br /><br />Indoor shooting is easy with flash and slow without. The steadiness of an image in Auto is quite optimal. Advanced settings in Program like Center AF, Spot Metering, ISO at 400 can make it better. (If you need a little brighten spreadon the image from Auto choose burst2.)<br /><br />Any darker place, you will need to set it somewhere so the camera can capture an image with no blur.<br /><br />Burst2 lets you wait as little as Auto mode on, because of shutter speed priority. But the Program indoor brightening<br /><br />is taken away. Big negative there.","Works very good outdoors. Even better with automaticly summoned flash.<br /><br />In a shady location, image looks better if you:","This is a great camera but at this site you dont get anything with the camera so you will have to buy all sorts of things just to make it work without a problem.  If you go to circut city they have this camera for 229.99 with all the accessories!","Sony DSC-P72 is my first digital camera.  I am writing this review four months after buying the camera because I have been busy--busy taking a lot of pictures.  The magic of the digital camera still enthralls me.  You press the button, a lot of things happen inside the camera, and a jpeg file, comprising the photo you took, is stored on the memory card.  No need to worry about buying film or spending money in developing it.  I wonder what took me so long to switch to the digital technology.<br /><br />Well, I think I should move beyond my encomium of digital photography and give you some information about DSC-P72.  I believe DSC-P72 is the right camera for beginner to intermediate level photographers: for beginners who don't have any experience with digital cameras, and for intermediate-level photographers whose first digital camera was a paltry 1.2 Mega pixels or thereabouts and lacked any maneuvering capability.  The DSC-P72 can take up to 3.2 Mega pixel pictures (it can take lesser resolution pictures too) and has a lot of features you can play with.  You can make this normally-color camera to take black and white, negative, solarize, or sepia styled pictures.  In its basic mode it is very easy to operate.  Just click the button and take a picture.  And if you want to go for more sophistication you can always press the menu button or go to the `set up' and change the settings there.  Its slight weakness is in taking pictures using the in-built flash.  You can't just take pictures click click click.  After taking a picture with a flash the screen goes blank for a few seconds and a little lights keep flashing.  You can take the next picture when the camera recovers and the screen starts showing the view.  The DSC-P72's metallic silver body looks sturdy and I believe it can take a little abuse.  This workhorse is small enough in size to be slipped into a picket.<br /><br />The DSC-P72 can even make movies, in three modes.  The easiest to use mode is that of making a motion picture.  Unlike many other digital cameras (purportedly preset to take movie clips of 30 seconds or shorter) the DSC-P72 can make a movie of as long a duration as the space on your memory card.  This camera can also make animation clips, though I neither understand that feature nor have used it.<br /><br />Once you become proficient with the camera you can start making folders on your memory card to sort the pictures as you take them.  The camera let's you make folders but won't let you delete them from the menu; to delete the folders you would have to reformat the memory stick--something I do after each transfer of the pictures to my computer.<br /><br />The 16 MB memory card that comes with the camera is obviously small in picture-storing capacity.  A normal picture, at 3.2 Mega pixels, would take 800 kbyte to 1.3 Megabyte space.  After realizing that the best use of the digital camera is to take several pictures of the same shot (and later decide which ones you want to keep) I bought a 256MB memory card over the Internet.  I can now store over 120 pictures on that card.<br /><br />Transferring pictures from DSC-P72 to computer is a breeze.  I just hook up the digital camera to my Apple computer via the cable that came with the camera, turn the camera switcher to `preview', and turn on the camera.  The Apple senses the presence of the camera, opens up iPhoto, and asks me if I want to import pictures from the camera.  I am sure transferring pictures to a PC is equally simple.  I have found a very effective way of obtaining prints of my choicest pictures.  Once the pictures are on the computer I upload them for free on Ofoto.com (a Kodak subsidiary) and order prints at 30 cents/each of the selected pictures.<br /><br />The DSC-P72 comes with two NiMH rechargeable batteries and a re-charger that you can connect to a standard wall outlet.  It is a good idea to buy an extra pair of batteries.  I have an extra set.  I have made it a habit to put one set in the re-charger and put the re-charged set of batteries in the camera, after each session.<br /><br />I don't have a lot of experience with other digital cameras, but I am pretty happy with my DSC-P72 and I'll highly recommend it.","I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA ABOUT 6 MOS AGO LOVED IT! TAKES GREAT PICS CRISP AND CLEAR. I PUT ADDED ACCESSORY OF SNAP ON ZOOM LENS BECAUSE I TAKE PICS OF MY KIDS AT THEIR CONCERTS AND THE REG ZOOM WASNT STRONG ENOUGH. VERY EASY TO USE. MY ONLY PROBLEM NOW IS WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT -WHEN I CLICKED A PIC -TOOK THE PICTURE RIGHT AWAY. NOW HOWEVER I DONT KNOW IF I MESSED UP THE SETTINGS (I KEEP READING BOOK AND CANT FIND OUT HOW TO FIX IT) WHEN I TAKE A PIC AND PRESS THE BUTTON IT TAKES LIKE 5 SECS FOR PIC TO SNAP??? BY THEN WHAT I WAS TAKING A PIC OF MOVED. ITS VERY ANNOYING AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX SO I CAN JUST SNAP A PIC?? OTHER THEN THAT I LIKE THE CAMERA. WILL HAVE TO CALL SONY AND SEE IF THEY CAN HELP ME BECAUSE ITS VERY ANNOYING AND WHEN U WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER PIC REAL QUICK AFTER ONE U JUST TOOK U CANT TAKES FOREVER.....","Sony is good. I bought this camera before Christmas and for the last 6 months, its been working very good.<br />The pictures shot in daylight are flawless, I havent compared it with any other camera, but they look very good.<br /><br />In the night, putting the camera on Night mode makes it work good. However the night is not as good as the day ones(obviously).<br /><br />The zoom is good, the camera came with 4 rechargeable batteries and a battery charger. Had to buy a memory card and a camera case.<br /><br />Worked good.<br />Pros:<br />1) Nice screen.<br />2) Very Nice camera in good light.<br />3) Zoom is good enough for most photographs.<br />4) Sturdy, Dropped twice, nothing happened(luckily).<br />5) Also lets you capture video(video quality not very bad).<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Not so good during low light.<br />2) Battery Consumption is very high. Cannot go without the charger and the extra pair of batteries.<br />3) Stabilizer not effective on full ZOOM.","Got this a few months ago.  It is a fun camera to have.  Taking and deleting pix is a breeze.  You quickly learn, however, that you must hold fairly still when taking some of the pictures (depending on mode you are in)as action shots can be blurry.  I am sure I need to learn more about it to improve on that tho.  Camera has an auto mode as well that works good.  The memory stick that comes w/ it is poor-- buy one that has 128 MB and you are set.  Took this camera on vacation (9 days) and stored over 120 pictures and two small movies without having to download for more space or change batteries....  Software is not great, better stuff out there.  Takes wonderful pictures of flowers, colorful things.  I have yet to learn all that it does, but it is a great buy for me and my family.","Prior to purchasing the Sony DSCP72, I was using a 5.0 megapixel camera from a not-so-good manufacturer, a camera with confusing and complicated settings and a camera that got dropping by an enterprising young nephew. Still working, but somewhat battered and still hard to use, I replaced it with this Sony.<br />If you want to buy a digital camera for fun use, for amateur picture-taking, for ease and for a good value, this is a great camera for you. The camera body is neither too small nor too big, and can fit in your purse or small bag for everyday use (I keep mine with me all the time). The menu is simple, the settings easy to master, and there's still quite a variety to work with. I found the shutter lag to be minimal, though slightly longer when using a flash. Zoom isn't exceptional, but it's standard to this class of digital camera. Last but not least, the video function is nothing short of phenomenal for a digital still camera: you get 640x480 video with sound, with clips as long as your memory card allows. Let's put it this way: the quality is just as good as an old home movie's. Perfect for someone who wants to play around with digital video a little.<br />Of course the camera only comes with a 16 MB Sony memory stick; it's pointless to mention this as a detraction so *no* digital camera comes with much more. You have to buy memory for cameras; it's the price you pay for not having to buy film, and that's all there is to it. Memory sticks are certainly readily available, and the new Sony Memory Stick Pro series holds a lot of pics.<br />But now for the only negative comment I'll make in this review: I mentioned at the beginning that I was using a 5.0 megapixel camera before this. As I needed to replace that, I went for a better brand and lower MP, thinking it wouldn't be that noticeable. Sadly... it was. I miss the higher resolution. The pictures were so crisp and clear, and bumping down even to 3.2 has been a disappointment for me. My advice, then: stick with the Sony Cybershot line, but go for the higher resolution.","This is an excellent camera.  It takes beautiful pictures & is very easy to use.  It's also resilliant!  A friend accidentally threw it in a pool and after six days of drying out not only does it work like before but the memory stick still had all the pictures on it!  I chose this camera for the macro capabilities, for which it is very good.  I do wish it had some sort of steady shot & the original memory stick is too small, but a larger one isn't too expensive.  It's not the newest camera these days, but its price is dropping, making it a great camera for the money.","Cyber-shot P72 has taken outstanding pictures.  In all cases, the pictures taken with Cyber-shot were of better quality than my standard camera (during day light hours; I have yet to shoot pictures during low light conditions).  I have taken pictures two ways.  One without a tri-pod, and one with a tri-pod.  The tri-pod made a significance difference in picture quality; similar to professional grade pictures.  Picture details were great.","This is a nice little camera but beware warranty for labor is 3 months and the cost of repair is  $150 , I am not sure why Sony warranty term is so less when all other competitors are offering one year warranty on parts and labor. So better take a extended warranty if you really want to buy this one.","I love my Sony P72 Digital Camera.  I love that I can take pictures and not have to worry about how many I take because I can delete the bad ones and I have a memory stick that holds more than 24 pictures (a normal roll of film).  It's also easy to get prints nowadays even without buying a photo printer.  The only complaint that I have about this camera is that it takes a couple of seconds to \"come back\" after taking a picture that uses the flash.  Really though, this is a small complaint and its something you get used to.","this is a great camera.  The software that comes with it is horrible, like all sony software, so if you have windows XP dont install it and use the automatic driver.  only bad thing is that the batteries dont last long.","takes great video and pictures and produces great quality pictures and video on computers as well<br /><br /> i've seen my friend with the same camera print out pictures from this camera and they came out perfect","We purchased this camera just before our daughter was born in order to catch all her moments. Within a short time of purchasing this camera, we started having trouble with the batteries staying charged for any length of time. Sony wanted to charge $150 to repair my camera! There is also an issue with the delay between the time the button is pushed and the time it actually takes the picture. Try getting a baby to hold a pose for 3 seconds while the camera decides it is ready to take the shot!!!","Overall a very good camera.  Outside photos look great.  Indoor photos just ok.  My biggest complaint is that too many indoor shots come out blurry.  Sometimes I take 2 or 3 of the same shots with same settings and yet one will come out blurry.","This is my first digital camera and it has been great. Easy to learn and takes great pictures. I have yet to have a bad picture, although bad hair days don't count. I would recommend to any new digital camera owner.","Can't say much that hasn't been said about the camera itself so I will mostly just mention a few tricks for dealing with some of the issues many people have brought up regarding this camera.<br />One note.. the video with sound capability is underated if anything. While it is deffinatly not a replacement for a cam corder, its portability makes it far more practical and less obtrusive for capturing 'moments'. With 256mb you have about 12 minutes of recording. Quality is around 15-22fps at 640x480<br />( think webcam ). Additionally if you drop it to the lower quality you have more than 2 hours of recording time. However, while the sound quality will be the same, the image will be pretty pixilated.<br />Many have complained about the slow shutter speed ( as in the time between pushing the button and the picture being taken ) but there is at least one way to get around it in certain circumstances. Provided you have enough light to forgoe the flash you can hold the button partially down and it will spot autofocus, then once it locks in it will immediately take the picture when you fully depress the button. Practice by trying to capture shots on the TV... sporting events are geat for this, especially when they do replays. It will give you a good feel for the timing of the camera.<br />It sounds tricky but the button sensitivity actually makes this very easy, To engage the spot autofocus you basically just need to rest your finger on the button, then actually pushing it requires a deffinate increase in effort. Additionally, using both single point AF and spot metering will make the process even faster. Not perfect but an improovement over the general performance if you are trying to catch fleeting moments.<br />In low light indoor shooting you can up the ISO to 400 and increase the exposure to attempt some flashless shots using this technique. Taking the time to steady the camera in some way will help immensely. If you think tripods are expensive try some of the table top versions, there is one at Bestbuy that goes for a whopping $11 and does a great job.<br />When the flash is being used I have yet to find a way around the delay completely, however if you turn off the red eye feature the amount of pre flash will be decreased which will lessen the delay. Red eye can be manipulated on the computer with a little effort.<br />I would never bother using the digital portion of the zoom. Just keep your image setting at the highest quality and you will have all of the same information anyway and more freedom in choosing how you want to crop the image later as there will be more image to work with. Even if you use lower quality to preserve memory I would suggest switching to the high quality to take any shots where you start zooming beyond the optical 3x max. Again you will have all the information you would have had using the 'smart' zoom and will have more options when editing later or even on the camera itself... the same goes for the solarize,bw, and sepia functions. All of those effects can be done later from the full color picture, full color pictures however can not be regenrated from pictures taken with these effects selected on the camera. A negative can be turned into a normal shot by filtering it using a negative image editing effect to get the negative of the negative.","I have this camera for close to a year now and never regretted this buy. It's a hardy camera that works well, the buttons are well-placed and easy to learn, making stuff like deleting and viewing photos, adjusting image size, using the timer a piece of cake.<br />I especially love that you can take good quality movies with this camera, it doesn't restrict the movies to 30 second short films like some other cameras, the only limit is the storage space in your memory stick. The movies have good sound and picture quality.<br />Another good pt is that it uses rechargable AA-size batteries, making it easy and cheap to replace the batteries when it dies. I bought a pair of spare AA batts and use them alternately. The batteries are dying now that it's been a year but considering the usage, I think it's reasonable to replace the battaries once a year.<br />the only complain I have is that the LCD screen tends to black out whenever I use the flash. In fact, the flash seems to eat up alot of the batteries, a couple of shots using flash kind of clean up most remaining battery life. But if you switch the camera off for a few moments, it might return to normal. As I rarely use the flash, its never been much of a problem for me.<br />All in all, its a good camera for people like me that uses it for touring and family events. It's a good camera size too. I originally liked the Canon Ixus and thought that size was perfect. But after trying my friends' Ixus, I find that such a small size is not suitable for me, as I have weak hands and my photos with such a small camera tend to come out blurred. No such problem with this camera though, the weight is just right to steady my hands. However, it's a compact camera that's easy to bring around.<br />In one line, I really like this camera. It took alot of good photos for me and helped me preserve many precious memories.","This is my first digital camera, although I've used others.  I've been pleased with my purchase.  The price is reasonable for the features compared to the rest of the field.  It would be nice if there were more manual features but this is designed more as an entry level camera so the feature set follows that.  The image quality is good but it could be improved.  The auto mode often takes pictures at ISO levels that result in a lower quality picture so it's best to try a few different settings to get comfortable with how you want the pictures to look.<br />The included software, I feel, is lousy.  I tried using it for image transfer but I ended up uninstalling it and just using the included software in Windows XP.","Do not believe what \"barbara carroll\" says about this breaking when her warranty expired.  Sure there could be an occasional \"lemon,\" even from Sony.  But if you register the camera you get a one-year warranty, and this is a relative new product.  So if what she says is true she only has herself to blame.  This camera is a solid buy and the picture quality is amazing.  Because I have a large collection of (cheap) SD cards I prefer a camera that uses SD card, but I've used the Sony many times (my good friend has one) and I really like its quality.","Overall, I'm very happy with this camera.  I shopped around for several weeks for a camera in this price range and I ended up choosing this one.  Interface is intuitive and has just enough options to let you experiment, but not so many that you need a degree in photagraphy to understand them all.  3MP seems to me to be a happy medium in the cost/performance category.  Obviously, 16MB is not enough memory, you will have to buy more.  With 128MB, I can get about 80 pictures or 6 minutes of video at the highest resolution.  The only downside is that memory sticks tend to cost more per MB than CF.  I love the fact that this camera comes with 2 rechargeable batteries and a charger.  In case you haven't heard ... do NOT use standard batteries in digital cameras.  Battery life is more than acceptable, but I always carry a spare pair.  I only use Linux and open source tools to edit my pictures.  I can happily say that my camera worked the second I plugged it into a usb port.","I got my camera in December of 2003 and I've been using it almost every day since. I am a graphic design student with not much cash, so I wanted something around the 300 dollar range that was at least 3 megapixels and could do video. I got my P-72 for 270 bucks, and it was definitely worth it.<br />Cons:<br />-Some low light shots take a while to snap and pics sometimes come out slightly blurred when flash is not used.<br />-Bundled memory stick is only 16mb. I recommend getting a 128mb or 256mb.<br />Pros:<br />-Geat quality images in ample light or when using flash<br />-The software bundled with the camera is useful, and the camera has very high connectivity for easy and quick transfers.<br />-Video mode is very handy and movies transfer easily into computer.<br />-Has many shooting options including macro and multiple shots and frame by frame.<br />-Batteries last for quite a while, I use it every day and only have to recharge once every 2 weeks.<br />-It's VERY durable. I recently fell while skateboarding and had the camera in my hand. When I fell my hand hit the the cement and it basically pounded the camera into the ground. Any other camera would have definitely been smashed to pieces, but the only damage done was one of the hinges on the battery lid broke. The battery compartment still shuts fine even with the broken hinge, and the camera still functions perfectly.<br />All in all the DSCP72 is a solid camera for a decent price.","I purchased my camera about 4 months ago, and most of the time, it doesn't dissapoint me at all. It's built like a tank (made in japan), I dropped it on hard surfaces for a few times, and it still works great, except there are some scratches. For stalkers it may not be a good buy since the pictures come out blurry with the flash turned off, but I get sharp pictures with the flash, which you can adjust the level. I haven't used the software that comes with it, since I use a Mac, and just had to install the USB driver onto my computer, so when I just plug the thing into my computer, the pictures are right in front of you. The menus are very user friendly and easy to understand. You can program the camera in the way you want to take pictures. The pixel quality is also adjustable, ranging from VGA to 3.2 million pixels. The MemoryStick in the box is only 16 MB and can save about 10 pictures in 3.2 million pixels. I would recommed a 128 MB MemoryStick, which you can take about 80 pictures in 3.2 (148 in standard quality, which there is a very small difference between fine quality) It takes about 6 hours to charge the batteries but the battery life is more than satisfactory. The movies I recorded seemed better on the camera's screen than in my computer, but still they look good on the computer.","I bought the camera 2 months ago, never failled. It takes very good pictures, good quality, EXEPT at night<br />CONS:<br />1 the shots come up blury and with a low definition. I actually couldn't recognize myself in a picture that was taken at night.<br />2 The memory stick that is included doesn't have much storage room (about 10 pics in 3.2 mp)<br />3 Zoom is not that great.<br />4 In pictures taken with flash, takes to long to reactivate for use again. AND the long time between the pressing of the botton and the actual picture being took makes the \"moment\" you want to preserve not possible.<br />5 I don't like the software that's included, but is user friendly and VERY easy to use<br />PROS:<br />1 Very good quality pictures (with daylight)<br />2 Very easy to use<br />3 battery life is amazing<br />4 High conectivity PC (UBS) or TV (very easy to do so)<br />I would recomend to buy this camera if you are not professional, 3.2 is MORE than enough for the size of pictures you would need-","I've always found these customer reviews very helpful when trying to make a purchase decision so, here goes.<br />Bottom Line: I highly recommend this camera.  If however, you can afford the 5MP Optical (Sony P92 Cybershot) purchase that instead.  That is not to say, in any way, that the 3.2MP Optical is not a good purchase.  It is.  The difference is a slightly better image quality and higher price.  The P92 will allow you to zoom in a little closer and provide more detailed images.  Specifically, the P92 provides 3X optical with 4X digital for a total of 12X or quality prints up 20 x 30\", while the P72 provides 3X optical with 3.2X digital for a total of 9.6X for quality prints up to 11 x 14\".  Currently (January 2004) the price difference is about $70.00.  The extra money might be worth it if you're the type to say, \"I wish I could have gotten in just a *little* closer ...\"<br />Specifics: The P72 has all the standard bells and whistles that come with higher priced cameras such as auto focus, auto exposure, night mode, etc. (click on the PDF link for the manual if you have specifics you're wondering about).  At the time of my purchase (September 2003) I had three main requirements for a digital camera: at least 3.0X optical, a movie mode and it had to be around $300.00 or less.  There were many good, even excellent, quality digital cameras that offered all three including this one.  However, the movie mode for this camera is the bomb!!  It was the final thing that sold me on it.  Again, at the time of my purchase, most digital cameras only allowed for about a 30 second movie mode without sound.  The P72's movie mode is only limited by the size of the memory stick used *and* it records with sound!  Really good sound!  (The sound quality actually surprised me a little.)  A 128MB memory stick can record up to 5+ minutes (10+ with a double sided 128MB) and a MSX-1G memory stick (if you can afford one) can record up to 44+ minutes!  Unless you need long uninterrupted recording time (say for an entire wedding or graduation) who needs a camcorder?!  This is smaller and lighter to carry and the image quality is just as good.  In addition, Sony includes a cable that allows you to plug the camera directly into your VCR or DVD recorder's audio and visual jacks allowing you to record/copy your movies directly to VHS or DVD with full screen image quality.  Or, you can plug the camera directly into your computer via USB connection on the back of the camera (again Sony includes a cable) to burn images to a CD or DVD.  How cool is that?!  But wait there's more.  Sony has a 1.7X telephoto lens and adapter (Item numbers VCL-DH1730 and VAD-PEA respectively) that work on both the P72 and P92 (as well as the P8 and P10) that takes the total zoom times even higher!  I highly recommend these additional accessories especially since with the purchase of the camera Sony will probably provide at least one discount coupon you can use towards their purchase.<br />In general: The camera is easy to use - especially if you read the directions and manual *before* you use it like you should with anything.  (Often people gripping about problems haven't read their manuals.  You know who you are.)  :)  It's compact and lightweight.  It's great for trips or just to have at the ready.  I didn't want to go over my budget but I wanted a really good quality camera.  So, I researched many different digital cameras before making a decision.  Almost every overall review for this camera received a very high mark whether it was from an expert or a customer.  I love it and I feel certain it was worth every penny I paid for it.","I've bought this camera about 3 month ago. it's a great point & shoot camera (you cannot control manual white balance and shutter speed) and it has very good photo quality. the problem is that some of indoor photos are noisy, also shutter speed is too slow indoors, making it impossible to capture anything that moves. but it do a pretty good job with outdors.<br />if you are looking for a point-and-shoot camera, DSC-P72 is one of the best but if you are interested in more manual control I recommend Canon powershot A70 for the same price.","I bought this camera back in the summer of 2003, primarily for my trip to Europe. The camera didn't dissapoint.<br />My only gripe is that some of my pictures from the beaches of france are a little grainy...may have been the humidity(as it was really hot in all of europe that summer) that messed things up...and I was on the beach with my camera... all day.<br />While those photos aren't bad...the quality isn't up to par with the rest of my photos from the trip and back at home.<br />One other gripe I have about the camera is the \"zoom\" sound the thing makes...it gets annoying and only draws attention to you in quiet areas(like the beach or a museum).<br />Sometimes the color wasn't what I had hoped it to be either...maybe I didn't have on the right settings but I didn't think it caught the colors of the sky too well. Eh.<br />Enough with my whining...this camera is pretty darn good. The ability to zoom in with the optical...and zoom in with the digital is great...you can never take a bad picture. If you're taking shots from any distance...it is good to zoom in all the way with the optical...just so you can zoom in again closer with the digital and take another high quality photo from that.<br />This camera is also very strong. I got sand in it...and the shutter eye was kinda [messed up] for a bit(which may have to do with why some pictures didn't turn out so well)...but after awhile it kinda just fixed itself. The shutter protecting the lens began to open all the way again and works great.<br />I also dropped my camera once and my memory card went flying...thankfully the camera still worked great...and I was able to find my memory card(in the dark no less)...and the camera doesn't even have a scratch on it from the instance. The camera is very strong.<br />What seperates this camera out from the less sony series...the p52 and p7 is it's ability to take movies with audio. The quality is pretty darn good for a digital camera. Playing movies I've taken on my computer...they are in excellent quality from like 4 by 6 inches or so...distorted quality when you put it on full screen...but hey...if I want full screen I'll save my pennies for an actual camcorder, right? The audio is pretty good too from my experience...not as crystal clear as if you were actually there...but decent enough where you can understand clearly what is being said.<br />Overall, I'm pretty darn happy with the camera. Are there better camera out on the market? yeah...maybe...Canon's are supposed to be pretty good and some people I met travelling had those and they were cool...but the P72 is pretty good from my experience.<br />This camera is cheaper from when I bought it...and it's bigger brothers are fairly cheap too. So if you're set on getting a camera, and this one in particular, ask yourself what kind of money you're willing to spend...(this is fairly affordable now) and do you want 2 more megapixels(this camera's original price for 2 more megapixels).<br />This technology just keeps getting cheaper and cheaper though too. So that is something else you wanna figure into your purchase...do you need a digital camera now? I felt I did for my vacation(how many times does one get to go to europe?).<br />So I'll finish my review saying that this is a good starting digital camera...a few bad photos here and there(could be blamed on the weather) and some trouble with colors in the sky but some great things about it too such as the video with audio and durability of the thing not to break by the forces of gravity or sand.<br />I'll give this camera a solid 4 stars. There's better out there...do you want to pay for it though?","December 24, 2003<br />(...) ANYWAY, I just got this camera yesterday and I can't put it down.  This user-friendly camera has everything you could think of for an average person who just wants GOOD PICTURES.  The image quality is superb, providing you with crisp, smooth, clear pictures.  The menu and navigation is easy to use and best of all...this little camera can take videos!  It's not just an \"added bonus\"; the video quality sure is acceptable for a camera like this and the video feature is ideal for any short clips you wanna take when you're out with friends.  One of the features I love on this camera is the \"night mode\" (thats what i call it)  This is a feature that allows you to take a picture OUTSIDE IN THE DARK!  I sure couldn't do that with my old one.  Of course, some light source is DEFINITELY necessary, but it deals with especially \"dark\" conditions and actually \"brightens\" the picture so that when you see it on your computer, it looks the SAME way as we humans actually see! Last but not least, the camera brings a video cable so that you can SEE THE PICTURES YOU TAKE ON YOUR TV!!  This goes for the VIDEOS TOO!  I mean, could there be ANY BETTER WAY to show the pics or videos to all your friends at a get together?? Unless you're willing to hook up a projector, this TV-compatibility feature sure beats anything else.  Finally, for the price that I got it ($269.99 at Best Buy), this little techological marvel is sure worth every penny.  I WOULD recommend, however, to buy the 128 MB memory stick for it, since the 16 MB one that the camera brings can only fit about 10 or a few more pics on the HIGHEST quality (3.2 megapixels).  They're not expensive (...)  (...)","I got this camera two days back. I took a few indoor pictures with flash and without flash (note, there is plenty of light through my balcony glass doors). The pictures with no flash came blurred. Also took another picture in less lighting. I found lot of green , red color spots. I had KODAK DC3200 which I gave it to my brother(so far more than 2500 pics taken by that). I love those pictures. I don't think I had this problem in that camera. I have sony miniDV which I use sometimes to take digital pictures which seems to be better than this though pixel is less.","I just purchased the canon dscp72 camera and could not be happier,the initial set up is very easy and although I did not read the manual and this being my first digital camera it worked excedingly well. My first time use with out any experience was at my daughters Christmas concert and the picture quality is great. The video quality was also great, now we dont have to lug arround 2 cameras. This works great as a still camera and a video camera. after weeks of research we couldn't be happier","Hi, I bought this camera about three months ago and have taken about 200 pictures with it.<br />Pros - excellent battery life even when using the LCD - I'm able to get over 50 pictures (about half with flash) easily.  When the pictures come out, they are of good quality.  I've printed many of them and they look great.<br />Cons - Many of the pictures don't come out, and they often end up blurry.  This is especially true in low light conditions.  The LCD does not have good enough resolution to tell if your picture is blurry or not.  The camera is already starting to fall apart even after a few months - I feel as if the joints of the camera are coming undone.<br />In the end, you may be one of the people who gets an untarnished camera, but if I were you, I would stick to more reliable manufacturers","I  brought  the  Sony  DSC-P72  a  few  days  ago.  I  can't  complain.  It's  a  great  digital  camera.  It's  small  and  lightweight.  The  image  quality  is  great.  The  features  are  excellent.  The  control  buttons  are  easy  to  use.  The  LCD  screen  shows  your  sharp  and  crisp  pictures  that  you  have  taken.  You  can  add  special  effects  when  you  take  your  pictures.  You  can  take  pictures  in  Solarize,  Black  &  White,  Sepia,  and  Negative  art  mode.  There  is  a  self-timer  feature  in  this  digital  camera.  The  picture  will  be  taken  after  10  seconds.  You  are  also  able  to  shoot  mini  movies.  The  mini  movie  quality  is  good,  because the  sounds  and  images  came  out  clear.  The  Sony  DSC-P72  comes  with  2  Sony  Nickel-Metal  Hydride  batteries,  battery  charger,  power  cord,  CD-ROM  software  (Image  Mixer),  16MB  memory  stick,  and  A/V  connecting  cable.  The  A/V  cable  has  to  be  connected  to  the  digital  camera  and  the  TV,  in  order  to  view  your  pictures  on  TV.  By  the  way,  if  you  are  planning  to  take  plenty  of  pictures  with  this  digital  camera,  you  should  buy  a  memory  stick  that  is  higher  than  16MB.  You  should  also  charge  the  supplied  batteries  for  about  6  hours  before  you  use  it.","I love this camera!  I had bought another brand and had to take it back.  I bought the Sony DSCP72 and found it easy to use and it takes GREAT pictures.  I was able to download to my computer with no problems and have been very pleased with the quality of the pictures.  I have been so impressed that I bought my Son a Sony DSCP52 for Christmas.","I use both a Canon A70 and this camera. There seems to be a lot of debate about which is best. After many hundreds of photos on both I can't tell any difference in photo quality. Pick whichever camera looks best. I lean away from this camera purely because memory sticks are more expensive.","I must say that I agree with everyone else.  This camera is nice, and you will need a larger memory card.  Something that wasn't mentioned by anyone else is that this camera also has special effects (such as sephia, b&w pictures, and a few others).  I thought that only the higher priced Sony cameras had these effects and almost purchased one because of it.<br />The camera takes beautiful pictures and is a nice compact size.  The one thing I don't like is the software that comes with it. In my opinion, it's just too confusing and clunky.  Image transfer is a breeze, however.  I also noticed that the finish of the camera seems to have smudged off even though I use the camera very lightly and gently.  Nothing too noticable, but something I spotted.<br />I haven't printed any of the pictures yet but I do think that once I do, I will be pleasantly surprised.","The best Digital Camera I have come across. My friends who have been using other brands, Canon, Minolta & Fuji have decided to sell their camera to get this one. Its the best for the price you pay. Excellent photographs. Never had the need to shoot at 3MP. I get excellent pictures at 2MP. Transfer of images are quick, and it has sufficiently long battery life. Doesnt come with a carry case, which is something Sony should think about. The ability to be used with normal AA batteries makes life simpler. I would recommend this camera to all. Its the best!!","This $300 sony DC really disappointed me!<br />All images I take show color spots, a lot of background noise<br />on the photo.<br />I own a 2 years old Nikon DC and compare with the sony stuff I can<br />only say that sony sucks on photo technology.<br />I think the DC is a weakness for all sony product. I have a<br />sony digital camcorder(TRV27), the still photo taken by it shows<br />many color noise points, too.<br />Suggestion: Don't buy it. Read journal's review about<br />DV and buy good-rated products( Like Nikon, Fujifilm, Olympus).","I've had the chance to review a few 3 MP cameras since I've bought three for various people.  Among the 3 contenders was the FujiFinePix A301, Olympus 520D and the Sony DSC-P72.  Each has their nice features but the Sony was by far the most feature rich.  The MX MPEG movie format by far the best movie format that I've seen on these digital cameras.  The Sony has full sound and 640x480 resolution (great for displaying on the TV) and will record for as long as you have Memory Stick space.  I've made numerous little movies that were spur of the moment that I certainly would not have thought to bring out my camcorder.  The photo's are excellent and the menu system very intuitive.  Navigation is nice but like other cameras, the nestling of the file directories is somewhat tedious to navigate through.  The biggest disappointment was with the included software.  The Imagemixer is a mediocre software at best, not that easy to use and very limited features.  Sony does not even provide a image browser for those folks that just want to see the pictures and maybe put up a quick slideshow.  Cannon at least has the ZoomBrowserEX software, Sony doesn't give anything.  I can't rate the value of this camera since I got it through points but I would have definitely paid the going rate to get this camera vs the others.","This camera fulfilled every need i had for it, and at the price, after a Sony rebate, it was very affordable!<br />The best feature i have found on this camera is the \"voice photo\" option, which allows the user to take a still picture, and attach up to 40 seconds of audio to it. Since i use the camera for recording memories, it's an excellent way to have more memory than just a single picture, you get an audio clip of whatever was happening at the time as well.<br />it also records full VGA quality mpegs, with sound, and outputs directly to the TV!<br />the still pictures are excellent quality as well, anot to mention the physical design of the camera. it's great!","I have always put off getting a digital camera because I did not have much faith in the current \"at home\" printing technology.  But I changed my mind when I discovered I can have digital pictures printed profesionally.  I bought the Sony DSC-P72 in August this year and have not regretted my decision.  This is my first digital camera.  I like that it takes clear and crisp pictures.  It's flash and AF illuminator are powerful.  Allows some manual control over the settings to give help me get better pictures.  Menus are very user-friendly.  It took me only less than 2 hours to figure them out.  I also like the rechargeable batteries that came with it.  But if you're planning to go on trips better have an extra pair or two ready.  It also takes normal AA batteries.  Only two things I didn't like, the measly 16MB memory stick and the \"slow\" battery charger.  Get a 256MB memory stick and you're on your way to taking tons of pictures and a (fast) travel charger.  For those who are complaining that the camera cannot take multiple shots in quick succession, read the camera's instruction manual again.  You can either shoot in clip motion, multi-burst mode, or burst mode.  However, the picture quality will suffer if you use one of these modes.  Better shoot with a film camera since we all know that as of now, film cameras are still faster than digital.  Overall, I like this camera and I'm glad that I got this one as my first.","I've researched digital cameras until bleary-eyed and finally decided on this one. I have a Sony camcorder so the memory stick is interchangable with both camcorder and camera.  The battery was charged only once (initial charge) and so far I've gone through a 125mb stick (using the highest clarity mode) and more.  3.2 megapix is sufficient for my use, although I would like to eventually upgrade to a 5.0 when their prices fall.  I read somewhere that if you do a lot of cropping, a 3 megapix will start to lose its clarity.  Nonetheless, this is a remarkable point and shoot camera, easy to operate and the rechargable AA batteries are the best.  In a pinch, if your rechargable batteries die, you just need to pop in fresh AA's from energizer or duracell, without having to worry about recharging the batteries.","This Sony is my first digital camera and I really like it.  I did a lot of research to figure out the features I wanted (1) at least 3 MP, (2)video with audio and (3) at least 3x optical zoom.  The camera is very easy to use.  I got it while I was on vacation and didn't really read the manual, just started taking pix.  When I got home I used the Lexar USB to transfer the images/movies on the memory stick.  (BTW, the Lexar worked great.)  I was very pleasantly surprised at how sharp and vivid the pictures are, and how easy it is to transfer to the computer (I had also considered a Kodak and the Canon).  I love having the movie w/audio, which actually took some nice clips of a family ping pong game.  The movie length is limited only by memory, unlike Canon which has a 3 min. limit.  Also, unlike Fujis and Nikons, the Sony has audio.  I didn't experience any slow \"shutter\" -- except in very low light situations -- and even then I thought it was tolerable, considering I didn't expect much based on what I heard about earlier dig. cameras.  It also comes w/batteries and charger which is nice.  128K memory stick is a must.  I did buy the Sony brand sticks just because the first one produced such good color that I've stuck with it, but may try the Lexar stick bcz that has gotten good reviews too.  For my next camera, I will probably get a 4x optical zoom, because it would be nice to have a longer zoom function, but all in all this is a good camera at a good price.","This was my first digital camera.  Having used a 35mm, I was amazed with the features.  I really like being able to review the pictures and delete the ones I don't like.  I was suprised with the clarity of the dusk and night time shots.  I bought a miniDV camcorder at the same time but the P72 has been more useful.<br />A few recommendations when purchasing this camera or any digital camera - If you plan to upload pictures to your computer, upgrade to USB 2.0 if you have USB 1.1 since it's 40 times faster (each picture is around 1.8mb).  The 16mb memory stick only holds 10 quality pictures.  The 256mb Pro stick is a good option for the casual user.","I bought this for my wife, I own the 707 model. Takes very good pix, 3 megapixels and a 3x optical lens ( stay away from the digital zoom cameras ), you'll need 128 card (lexar brand is good).  The only negative thing is the plastic housing that the camera is encased in.","This Camera is everything that we needed from a digital camera and more. We originally bought a Nikon, but that didn't record sound - we decided that being able to make soundless movies was pointless so swapped it for this Sony and are really pleased with it. It makes taking good photographs very simple and enjoyable. The various modes do make a difference to the quality of some pictures but the auto mode is perfect - all the photos we have taken have been excellent quality and we have printed many pictures as A4 size with no drop in the quality. Contrary to what we were told in the shops, the batteries last for ages - on a sightseeing weekend, the batteries lasted 2 full days and still have some charge left - we had the LCD screen on the whole time, used flash and zoom and took over 100 photographs and made several short movies. The best thing about the camera is that you can take as much movie footage WITH SOUND as your memory card will allow. The only thing that put me off buying this particular camera was the size and shape -others are slightly smaller, but this is easy to hold and light to carry as it uses ony 2 AA batteries, which are easy to replace.<br />This is our first digital Camera... great pictures and lots of fun - we would thoroughly recommend it to others!!","I recieved my P72 today and have been really happy with it.  This is my first digital camera.  I think the one feature that no one has mentioned is the ability to take *very* nice pictures in a room that is completely dark.  To look at the pictures, you would never know that the pics were taken in a room completely dark.  The image quality rivals my 35mm camera.  The size and feel are just what I expected.","This is my first digital camera ([$$$], July 2003). I'd have to say it exceeded my expectations, but I can't really compare it to other models. One pleasant surprise, among several, for me is that the camera can take quite serviceable MPEG videos with sound. This fact has rolled back my schedule for acquiring a a digital camcorder. Most 3 megapixel digital cameras can take video but often with restrictions on length or without sound. The P72 will take video as long as there is memory stick capacity. (I have a 256 MB memory stick ([$$$], July 2003) and can probably get more than 10 minutes of video on it. BTW, resist the temptation to rotate the camera 90 degrees to take \"portrait mode\" videos; while it is generally easy to rotate still pictures with the included software, this does not seem to be the case with MPEG. The P72 comes with two AA formfactor NiMH batteries and a charger, something to keep in mind when doing price comparisons. I've also successfully used AA alkalines, which exhaust much more quickly than the NiMHs. I think my main disappointment is the Pixela software; I struggled along with it and got some use. However, I recently put an HP photo scanner into service and started using its bundled software, instead, and find it much better for organizing and navigating a collection of photos.<br />I can definitely recommend the P72 as a combination point-and-shoot/short-video camera and, as a beginner, I've found<br />digital photography to more rich than expected, and I expected it to be good.","I didn't base my choice on the reviews about it on this site I simply saw the pictures my friend took with  DSC P72 and  I was amazed by it's  quality... I think this $$$ were well spent.","Lots of cool features to keep you learning.  I would say that is the biggest problem for most who may not have enjoyed this camera... learn how to use all it has to offer and your pics will look great.","Lots of cool features to keep you learning.

It fits in a shirt pocket with room to spare.  It does short video snippets with sound well.  And the corner vignetting is an improvement over the P31.  But the light metering sometimes saturates (burns out) parts of pictures, it does not focus for macro imaging (the P31 does a great job with this) and waiting for the lens to move is slow.  Also, you need to carry extra batteries because this eats power, but, fortunately, rechargeable AAs are cheap.  Having a real physical zoom is an improvement, but this camera doesn't zoom in that close.  And 3 megapixels really aren't that much better than 2.  In summary, go for a lightweight snapshot camera like the P31 (with which I've shot more than 18,000 pictures!) or go all the way to the top to a 5 megapixel high resolution system.","I purchased this as an upgrade from a 2 mega pixel fixed lens DSC-P31.

Even those taken in good light out-door conditions and using super fine are very blurry, after you zoom them to 100%. The camera is so.. slow in low light environment, and needs at least 5 seconds time to take one single picture.<br />Overall, this camera's OK if you just want to print it out to 4x6. If you want a really good camera, turn to Canon powershot serial.","This is the first digital camera I buy and I really like it. It's very easy to use for a novice like me. Picture quality is good, movie mode is really cool. Price is reasonable especially because I got this camera with a free 32MB Lexar memory stick promotion and free shipping. Only downside is that the LCD screen will go off for a second or two if you use a flash. Other than that, I couldn't find anything that I don't like. A perfect for non-professional photographer.","I recently bought this camera and I must say I'm really impressed, it takes great pictures (I was personally impressed and 3.2MP is more than enough for me) and besides the pics, you can take very long movies as well! But of course you would have to use a bigger capacity memory stick (cause as everyone says, the supplied 16mb MS is just not enough) and record your movies until the card fills up. And the beautiful thing is that you can edit (divide, cut, delete the parts you don't want) your movies on the spot, so you can still save some more space by getting rid of those unwanted moments in your videos and still keep the good ones. There are so many good specs to this camera, yes it's true that it doesn't have the most extensive manual control options, but it certainly has much more than you would expect from a \"point and shoot\" camera. I simply love it, and I'm so happy for the day that I waved goodbye to 35mm cameras and film processing costs. I'm more than happy to keep all my photos on my computer and just print those which are special. This baby is full of pros, but the only con as I mentioned before, is that the supplied memory stick is just a tactic to make you buy a bigger one. 16MB doesn't do it (unless you only take lo-res pictures and no movies!)<br />I also would like to add a comment to bpm003's review, about the LCD being off when the flash is charging. Despite what bpm003 thinks, this is definitely not a con, it is just the factory default \"battery saving mode\" which you can always change. This way it turns off the LCD to make the batteries last longer (also the camera activates the auto focus only when you half-press the shutter) whereas if you turn the battery saving option off, you can enjoy the instant playback of the images (by simply pressing the quick review button) and not worry about the LCD turning off, plus the camera focuses more quickly even when you don't press the shutter, so you can take quicker shots. Just wanted to make this clear.<br />The bottom line is anyhow, you'll like this camera very much if you're looking for a P&S camera. I simply love it!","I have been shopping for a digicam for a year now. I have been waiting for the right marraige of price, features, size, etc. When the Canon S30 got discontinued, I had to start looking all over again. Other cameras were either $$$ for similar features, and/or had proprietary batteries - a feature I don't care for. (If I'm away on vacation and my batteries die in the middle of a tour, I want to be able to throw some throwaway AA's into the camera as an emergency.)<br />The DCS-P72 has a relatively low price, rechargable AA's, a nice compact size, and some nice point-and-shoot features.<br />I hate when people put a camera like this down because it doesn't have enough manual modes. I take pictures of family & vacations. I'm not doing weddings. I need a camera with basic features (this camera has some really nice settings) that takes nice pictures. This camera meets all my needs. Only word of caution:  don't trust the automatic ISO setting on indoor low-light shots. Set the ISO to 400 manually and your pics will be perfect.","Pro's<br />1. Has all the desirable features like video out, only 2 AA batteries, decent movies w/sound etc.<br />2. Nice build quality, the battery compartment door is the best I have seen so far.<br />3. Bundled rechargeable batteries and 4hr world charger are excellent.<br />4. Smart Zoom is useful feature and works much better than digital zoom on other cameras.<br />5. Fast shooting time (with option to take a burst of 2 pics), if you turn flash off.<br />6. The lens retracts itself when you are in view mode for a while, very sensible feature to protect the lens.<br />7. Very good battery life inspite of bright LCD.<br />Con's<br />1. Not really pocketable, thick/bulky/long. Included errata says the correct thickness is 37mm. Sony P8 or Nikon 2100/3100 or Canon S200 are smaller in size.<br />2. Only a superfine 1.5MB size available in auto mode for 3MP images.<br />3. Proprietary MS/MS Pro is 2 to 5 times cost of CF cards. And still can't be used even in many Sony devices which need MS MagicGate or MS Duo version.<br />4. White balance and colors for indoor/flash pics are bad.<br />5. Very less control over what camera will shoot. No action mode for fast shutter. Most flash or low light pics are blurry because camera chooses 1/40 sec or slower shutter speed.<br />6. Lens is noisy and a bit slow to startup/zoom/shutdown.<br />7. Colors are very saturated and many pictures are not crisp.<br />If lens was brighter and took low light/flash pictures better it would have been a superb camera. Every digital camera has its limitations, choose the one you like the best and enjoy!","I have the predecessor P71 version of this camera.  I thought hard about buying the FUJI with the 6X zoom but am very glad to have bought the Sony instead.  In comparison to my buddy's FUJI, it takes TERRIFIC PICTURES IN LOW LIGHT SITUATIONS.  This is key- the picture doesn't black out at parties/indoor graduations/weddings, etc.  As an experiment, I took several pictures of my girlfriend's dog in near-complete darkness.  They turn out beautifully- the illumination feature for this camera's autofocus/rangefinder is very powerful.  Very few cameras in this price range have this capability (I checked).  Also- this camera has a TERRIFIC BUNDLE, making it a great value.  I figure the charger itself is worth $.., and it uses standard-sized AA batteries.  They are interchangeable with the rechargeables on your walkman, meaning that you're not stuck with buying $.. \"battery paks\" that don't fit anything else in your house.  Only two minor quibbles:  the camera automatically defaults to a \"no flash\"/energy saver mode every time it is turned on and off.  This feature is irritating and you will probably miss some good shots because of it.  Also, the shutter speed is slow.  But this is true of all digital cameras.  If you want a quality digital point and shoot for a great price, this is the camera.  No doubt!","I just bought this camera and have been extremely impressed with it. The camera is very easy to use and takes great pictures. It has a nice compact size that can easly fit a loose pocket. I think it's great buy!! Only con memory stick only takes 11 pictures at high quality, I recommend an upgrade.","Hey first i was looking in the canon cameras, especially those sexy and small ones. But surprisingly i saw this new model from sony called the sony p72. The reason i gave this a shot was because i saw reviews said the canon have a problem with purple fringing which means sometimes theres a purple outline around images such as tree branches. it was a minor thing but i want a perfect camera. the sony p72 has the best image quality out there! its 3 megapixels which is all you need if you don't plan to print a picture bigger than 8x11, which most people don't. It also as a AF illumintor which helps measure the light so it knows the perfect ammount of flash. the AF illum. is usually on expensive/higher end cameras, but guess what? its on this cheapo camera. haha. Yeah it also has movie mode (w/sound)which is above average. Its not like a camcorder but the movie mode satisfies those who need to catch those moments when you don't have your camcorder. Another great feature is it uses memory stick pro. Memory stick pro is a new design that allows high capacity memory card. I suggest a 256mb one, which can take 160 high quality photos. Theres also those cool modes such as black and white and etc.<br />pros:<br />good quality<br />good zoom (3x optical) and smart zoom (digital)<br />nice movie mode<br />AF illumantor<br />good battery life (uses nice sony AA batteries/rechargeable)<br />cons<br />not much except no manual controls so you can't get the brightest night shots.","After searching for months and reading many reports I purchased the Sony DSC-P72. The camera was a snap to use for this first time digital owner. Menu is excellent, focus does a terrific job, and the download to my computer was instint. Picture quality after I enlarged to 12 by 14 was superb. Sony supplies you with ni-mh batteries and charger, plus can use regular AA batteries.With Optical zoom, 3.2 megapixels, charger the $329.00 was normal but with sony quality. Memory stick media is getting cheap too, I purchased 128 m for $40.00 and 256 is available. I don't need more functions or 4 or 5 meg after using this camera!<br />I also compared with our Canon A-70 to her Sony P-72 and I still love my A-70 though. Her P-72 was the same price and takes great shots as well. It just lacks manual aperature control and shutter control against the A70's ability to do so. However, the P-72 takes sweet shots too for the person who just wants the camera to do all of the work. Sony is top quality as well. But hey, this is a camera, not a camcorder! What are you waiting for? Get it now!","Usually the best reviews come from those indivduals that just bought something and haven't found the bad news, or are unwilling to accept that they made a bad decision.  I had read the reviews on almost every 3-5MP digital cam on Amazon.com, and had several in the final running for my actual purchase.  This camera won the contest because of its high quality user interface, low light performance, and most of all its video mode capabilities.  Its the only camera I've seen that does a reasonably high quality video mode, with no time limits other than what your storage capability is.  Also the resolution of the video mode, and the fact that its in a very compatible format sealed the deal for me.  This camera is very intelligent when using the \"auto\" settings, and could definitely help anyone take better pictures.  For those like me, most of the features are manually controlable as well, in addition to saving manual settings to your own program.  One thing that didn't get mentioned in previous information about this camera is that it saves the settings information as part of each picture, so that you can go back later and compare which settings are working best for you and your picture taking styles.  I already recorded several movies and was astounded at the audio/video quality that I was presented with, I was able to connect it directly to the T.V. and the frame-rates and resolution were just fine for home-movie quality recording.  If you get tired of only having a camera, or only having a camcorder, and never both.  You have to take a look at this thing.  Also, this camera comes with 4 effects like Sepia, Black and White, Solarize, and Negative.  I was very pleased to find out that these effects can be used in BOTH the camera mode and video mode.  I was also amazed to see that in video mode that the zoom is available for use, and that the camera utilizes an auto-focus, much like your average camcorder.  For what I do, I did not need 5 megapixel.  I mostly print images smaller than 8x10, and much of my work ends up on my websites.  So I wanted to trade extra megapixels for features.  This was absolutely the right choice for me.  Also, the camera came with 2 nickel metal hydride AA batteries as well as a charger, USB cable, and television intervace RCA cables.  That is a lot of toys for the over-all price.  This camera has also gotten great marks for battery performance, and I wasn't able to kill them after playing all afternoon and evening on about half of a full charge.  I ended up having to put it on never-ending slide show mode to drain the batteries all the way down.  It took over 4 hours even then."]},{"name":"Kodak EasyShare CX6230","amazon_reviews":["I got this camera in 2004 so it's been a while and I\"ve been using it for 12 years.

And guess what?  I still have it.  I have taken over 10,000 pictures over this span of time and it still works wonderfully.  The color in scenery shots is very real and action photos come out crisp.  With a 512 Mb SD card, it holds over 600 pictures and one nice feature that is not the case with some newer models, the card can come out without having to reset the time and date saving precious picture taking minutes.

IF you bought this camera now, what on EARTH are you doing? I think a buyer should go with a better Panasonic Lumix digital camera, which you get 6x zoom, 7.2 MP, for a better price.","I have owned this camera for a year now. This is a good basic camera. It has a lot of nice little options like zoom and a close-ups setting. A lot these days is made of the megapixels in a camera and although this one seems to be on the low side it takes great pictures.<br /><br />Some things to think about:<br /><br />This camera eats up batteries fast. you can't leave the batteries in overnight or they will die. If you do take the battteries out there is an internal memory that saves all your pictures so you don't lose anything. Nice feature.<br /><br />Also: USB connects right to any USB port on your computer which is nice. But you have to load the software to your pc and if you do this I recommend you go with the absolute minimum installation.

But if you are like me and already manipulate images with other software go for the minimum installl. This will avoid yet another icon in your systray and another application checking in online for updates etc.<br /><br />all in all its a good first camera at a reasonable price.","We got this for our 6 year old over a year ago and it's been a wonderful little camera.  I think the kid has thrown it and it still works.  The color is great and even my close up pictures look good if they aren't blown up too large.  I actually got an HP for Christmas and the darn thing broke after less than a month when I dropped it from about a foot up on carpeting.  Also, I know that Kodak (unlike HP) stands behind their products if something goes wrong.  My brother got sand in his at the beach and Kodak, despite finding sand in it, replaced it for free.  Buy a Kodak!","I bought this camera because I wanted a good camera with video recording abilities at an affordable price. After using it for a year, I know the good and bad.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />-The price was the lowest for a good quality 2.0 MP<br /><br />-Good pictures<br /><br />-It records video (See bad)<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />-It does not come with rechargable batteries.  You either purchase their Kodak dock ($50-$70 more) or you buy a AA recharger kit ($30-$40 more). This is a hassle if you travel and just want to recharge your camera over night. The sony digital cameras come with a rechargable batteries and a simple cable to plug into the AC outlet.<br /><br />-The video recorded is limited to 30 seconds and the video only plays on Apple movie player. They give you Apple movie maker to view your video. I can't edit the videos unless I buy a Apple editing software.<br /><br />-It only records 30 second videos.<br /><br />Conclusion,<br /><br />This is an OK 2.0 MP starter camera.  Knowing what I know now, I would have spent the extra ($75 more) and bought the Sony digital Camera since it comes with a travel friendly rechargable battery and cable and allows you to record video to the extent of your memory card. The Sony digital camera records video in a microsoft friendly format (.avi) which you can edit with Microsoft Movie editor (which is free, downloaded for their site).  In the end, you get what you pay for.","This camera is a very well built.  I've had it over 3 years now ( When i go it, i paid about $200 for it, so it's dropped quite a bit in 3 years).  If your worried about the fact it had only 2MP, don't.  2MP is perfect for 4x7(typical size of 35mm pics), and it will show a full picture on the computer screen(which looks very nice).  Well if u got the money i'd def go with the Z700 by kodak, but this is still a very effective, and at that price, how can you beat it?","I love this camera!  I have had it for almost 2 years and I just can't say enough about it.  The first week I owned it, it fell out of my little sister's hands while taking a picture.  If fell about 4 feet on tile and I thought that was the end of it.  But no, it is still here and has fallen many times because I tend to be very clumsy.  I have taken it all over the place, vacations, school events, etc.  It is our \"everything\" camera.  Well I guess I made a point that the construction is very durable.  The photos this camera takes are of excellent quality considering it is only a 2.0 mp I love all the modes it has and ease of use with the menus and the settings.  It has a date stamp that looks big and yellow when you print out the pictures but you can easily choose not to display the time/date stamp.  It also has a low battery indicator that lets you know in advance when your battery is dying.  Like I said, I just can't say enough, my camera still works till this day and I'am thinking of upgrading to a kodak easyshare z740.  But I'll stick with Kodak because I have no complaints of their products durability and quality of photos.  Great value !","Kodak EasyShare cameras are the least expensive, simplest to operate and sharpest picture digital cameras I've encountered.  I was SCARED to try a digital (you know, I thought you had to have a dock in order to download pix on my PC, etc.--sounded like a lot of equipment and hassle) until my brother bought me this little camera; I'm a real digital nut, now!  I subsequently bought one for my sister and an upgrade for myself.  I LOVE them.  Friends have seen my photos and are amazed at the clarity and great color, even from my original 2mp version.  And all I have to do is plug my camera's \"cord\" into the USB port, leave it there, and each time I want to download pix, I just plug the other end of the cable into the camera--everything else is automatic!  Couldn't be easier.<br /><br />My upgrade (4mp) does better with distance or low-light shots, but close-ups were fine even with the 2mp.<br /><br />I have only a few complaints, which would not have stopped me from purchasing the cameras, but... if you're considering purchasing one, you might like to know: 1) shots taken in low light tend to have round blips of light all over them (maybe the flash picks up dust particles? not sure)--the lower the light, the more spots; 2) the EasyShare software has little editing ability--red-eye and switch to b&w or sepia, but little else--you really need MS PictureIt! or Photoshop (or equivalent Mac product) to work with your photos; 3) the video capability on the 2mp version is totally useless--you could barely tell what you were taping; 4) on 3mp and 4mp versions, videos work fine--nice and clear with good sound, but they create .mov files requiring QuickTime to play--not great for a camera whose name is \"Easy-Share\"--I can't share my videos with anyone but others who have EasyShare cameras.<br /><br />As I said, it wouldn't stop me from buying another one, but if this is your first, this will help you make a more informed decision.","We were able to purchase this model for a very reasonable price. We took it home and played around with it. At first I was a little concerned that it wouldn't take a good quality picture because it was only 2.0 MP. Boy was I wrong!  This camera takes amazing pictures. It's so easy to use, it's lightweight. I would highly recommend this camera, you won't be sorry.","This is a good camera for the money. I'd recommend it.<br /><br />It's not that hard to learn to operate and takes good<br /><br />pictures.I sent some e-mail and they were real nice.<br /><br />Carol","This is a great little camera for people who are just wanting to mess around with digital photography, but don't want to do anything serious.  It's ideal for quick snapshots on a family vacation or the kids in the backyard.  It's also a perfect gift to give a kid who really wants a digital camera, but you don't want to spend $300.<br />Other positives:  It's lightweight, doesn't require a lot of thought, and the small screen really guides you through what all the buttons are for.  Everything is well labeled, and sharing photos is simple.  Other people have said that they didn't like the software, but I didn't have a problem with it.<br />Because it's designed to be simple, it has some flaws when it comes to more complicated operations.  It takes really crummy night shots.  Don't even bother trying to use the nightime setting unless you have a tripod.  Also, the screen on the back is deceptive, especially when it comes to nightshots.  You think you have a good picture until you load it onto your computer and you realize it's totally blurry.<br />But, for a 2 megapixel camera, it's great.  It's a good gift for kids and a good starter camera for just about anyone.","PROS: This camera takes good resolution pictures and is very easy to use.  Easily affordable. Comes coupled with a good software package. Battery life is also good compared to other cameras in this class. As stated earlier, a Dock and 128mb memory card is recommended for best results.<br />CONS: Button controls are a bit too close together on the rear panel. Preview screen is a bit smaller than average.  \"Green\" flash indicator light positioned too close to the viewfinder. Random shutter and flash speed control in \"Auto\" mode, increases the chance for blurry pictures in other than still and/or brightly lit shots.<br />MAIN ANNOYANCE:  No audio or visual indication that a shot was taken as the shutter operation is extremely quiet. If you are in a noisy or outdoor environment, it is hard to tell if you actually took the shot or not.  Couple this with the random shutter speed and flash control in \"auto\" mode and one may find themselves getting photos of things other than the intended subject matter (re: ground, sky or blurry/tilted images).<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Good for general still picture taking on bright sunny days. Easy to use and affordable. Because of the shutter/flash timing limitations in \"auto\" mode, those seeking to take quick pictures \"on the fly\" or a greater range of pictures in more challenging lighting/motion situations (re: nightime, action shots, sporting events, etc.), should really look elsewhere.","I am very happy with this camera, good quality pictures, great features and very easy to use! You couldnt ask for more. I am looking into getting the docking station to go with it.<br />The only thing I would like to have,is a power cord to charge it as it does suck up some batteries.","My first digital was a 1.0 Olympus for $399.00  The LCD quit working after 2 years, and it was going to cost $100.00 to repair.  I thought naught!  A new eMac running Panther with a new Epson printer prodded me to purchase a new camera.  Amazon had it for $129.00 with a \"free\" 32 MB Viking memory card.  I upgraded to a 128 MB card for lots of pictures.  I needed to upgrade the camera software from the Kodak website, but it works flawlessly with panther!  This camera is great!  It is very intuitive, and I didn't even look at the book for the first few pictures;  it was point and shoot.  Downloading the pictures via the USB port was a snap (also very quick!) On the eMac, the pictures are automatically downloaded into a picture folder which works with iphoto.  The picture quality color is excellent when printed out.  I find this a great camera for the novice or intermediate picture taker.  It is definitely a digital for dummies!","Estube investigando y consultando los datasheet de muchas camarasdigitales y la unica que me llamo la atencion por su precio fue esta, es una camara buena es muy facil de manejar y se ajusta a lo que un principiante busca.<br />Lo unico malo son dos cosas:<br />*Primero que todo aconsejo que compren baterrias racargables por que esta camara consume las baterrias standar muy rapido mas o menos unas 50 fotos.<br />*La calidad de las fotos crei que iba ser mejor la calidad es buena pero no excelente!!!!!!!!!! aconsejo que inviertan mejor ne la serie 6330 es excelente.<br />Aprovechen ademas y compren una memoria sd de 128 MB para no tener futuros problemas con la memoria interna de la camara que son 16 MB.","I've been using it for 2 months, after a long research. It's my first digital cam, and here's my openion.<br />you SHOULD get rechargable battries with this cam, I've got rechargable 2100 mAh and totally satisfied. It comes with normal battries, won't let you discover the camera features!<br />If you plan to take video clips, you should get a memory card.I've got  Viking 128 MB Secure Digital Card and happy with it. The internal 16M will take only two video clips (with audio), each of 30 seconds and will get \"Memory Full\"<br />The video quality is not so good, 320x240 and increasing the size will make it so bad.<br />It's a chinese product, but it's reliable. I've seen alot of ppl complaining from the Canon A60.<br />My friend has HP635, it's cool too. If you are a pro. then get the HP, you'll be more satisfied. If you need the simplicity get this one.<br />Btw, the Burst option is not in the HP, and it's a nice feature, but I guess it's not a vital thing to chose a camera.<br />The HP software is much better (cmon, it's HP).<br />Those two cams are the best in this category ($100 to $200) after a long research. I was about to get the Canon A60, but it seems risky and stopped functioning with many ppl, then they suffered Canon customer support. One of them threw it away!<br />The Nikon 2100 is also great, it captures video clips with 640x480 but with no audio!!!!! and that's why I didn't get it.<br />Kodak can connect to your TV directly, it's a nice feature not included in HP, but frankly speaking I don't use it! The video clips look horrible on the TV, but the slide show is nice.","The camera has excellent resolution for a 2 megapixel camera. It actually takes better, clearer photos than my friend's 3.4megapixel sony. Very simple to use, and features are great. Reasonable battery life, but don't expect them to last a vacation.","This is a great camera. This is my second digital camera and by far the best I have used.  I have read some reviews for this camera and I must say that most people complain about things that are easy to correct if you just read the instruction book.. The software that comes with it is great and easy to use. I don't see why some people have a problem with it. The battery life is actually really good with this camera. I use Sony rechargeable Ni-Mh batteries and get a lot of pictures out of them.<br /> When taking pictures I love the 5 settings it has (4 are listed but the fifth is burst which you get going into the menu) plus the video. The burst setting allows you to take 3 pictures in quick succession. I think it's 3 frames per second. I agree that the video quality is not very good but this is a camera. I think common sense should tell you that if you want a digital video recorder go buy one.<br /> Overall this is a really great camera that I love to use. The only downside is that it did not come with a bag to carry it around. Obviously that is not a big deal but it would have been nice. So if you are considering buying this camera I would strongly suggest you do. If you have a good printer you can get some amazing photos with this camera.","This is my first digital camera, and I researched here and elsewhere on the Internet before buying it. I bought it based on the positive reviews here, and I'm very glad I did!<br />The Zoom (both in and out) feature is much better than I was expecting, because some reviews here led me to believe it wasn't that great. Well, mine does a terrific job! Of course, the extreme close up pictures are grainy, but you can get really close before this happens.<br />It takes very vivid pictures that are easily transferred to your PC with the included USB cable. While it is true you must load the Kodak software to do this, the software is pretty powerful and has a very easy to learn (friendly) graphical user interface.<br />It comes with an internal 16MB's of memory (18 Pictures at Best setting, 35 at the Better setting), but you probably would want to buy a 128MB SD Card like I did (which holds up to 149 Pictures at the Best setting, 298 at the Better setting) so you can really take pictures without having to worry about running out of space/memory before you do pictures. The Review and Delete features are first rate, as well as the LCD display. The Flash button is also great, since you don't have to search through the menus to cut the flash off or on (default is on).<br />It has a movie mode that I don't really plan on using, but it's there if I want it. Of course, I doubt the quality of the video or sound would be that great, but again, the option is there. Same with the Share button, you press this button to 'bookmark' a given picture if you plan to send it to friends or family over the Internet in E-Mails, etc., or to print out on your printer. That way, you don't have to search through the many pictures to find the 2-3 you think are worth sharing or printing.<br />But be prepared to either buy the Kodak 6000 Camera Dock or a Battery Charger that will charge Ni-MH batteries (most come with at least 2 Ni-MH batteries), because I've read on the Internet it uses batteries very rapidly, like every other digital camera out there.<br />I would highly recommend this camera to family and friends and anyone else wanting an excellent bargain as well as an excellent camera!<br />Bottom line-<br />Pros:<br />Price, features, LCD Display, 16MB's Internal memory, everything you need included in the box (except a charger or Kodak 6000 Camera Dock), first rate Zoom function, and no more film to take to the drug store!!<br />Cons: No camera case and the batteries included are not rechargeable.","Wow, I have had a 2.1MP camera (HP 315) for a couple years and this one outperforms it in every way!  Here's what I like:<br />Color/B&W/Sepia filter<br />Built in 16MB memory<br />Fits in your pocket<br />Clear pictures (both people and landscape)<br />Dummy-proof :)<br />The only thing I don't like is the navigation button on the left, because I have to push a little above the center to \"select\" an option."]},{"name":"Nikon D2H","amazon_reviews":["As described","Great!!!!

Perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography. I have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s. Maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography. This may be long- winded, but it's extensive and can be useful.<br /><br /> I received the Nikon D2H camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago. I think I got them shortly after the D2H system was released in 2003. Since then, I have used them to shoot images of all types -- documentary, sports, daytime, available light, flash, and dead- of- night -- for the paper I work for. This is the only camera I work with.<br /><br /> First, please read the manual. There is a ton of information there, and the information is terrific to begin with. The D2H is highly- configurable, with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use (resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time, for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera).<br /><br /> I'll just punch right in to the way it feels. The camera is a rather heavy beast, and for some, there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day, like I do. But the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through. I've long since given up using any camera bag. All I have are a fanny pack for a 14mm, 55mm, teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt. And the D2H's hold the 17-35mm Nikon and the 80-200mm Nikon one- touch or the Sigma 120-300mm 2- touch.<br /><br /> Shooting is a breeze. The batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge. I have my D2H set on ISO 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower ISO as often as I can, because the higher ISOs bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation. Just today, I purchased digital noise plug ins for Photoshop to limit this, and that's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at ISO 800 and above.<br /><br /> I now have little problems with capturing images in even barely- limited lighting. I recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an Airbus at 36,000 feet over the Pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8, and it looks tons better than night shots via the D1H, which lacked the internal digital noise filter. That filter kicks in at around 1/2 second and longer exposures, and can make you wait as long as your image you've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise. When you shoot this way (and in general), don't simply react by cranking up ISO because you will not be happy with your results.<br /><br /> The camera can be loud. At over 7 frames per second, it can make you obvious in a quiet room. Shooting sensitive situations can be testy, so limit your shooting to single frames. I wish this camera had an option to silence this camera, but since the mirror has to raise and lower, there's no chance to do this.<br /><br /> Am I happy with the D2H? Definitely, yes. Are there improvements that can be made? Yes. But the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. People have been bailing out of using the Nikon system and going Canon, which has some incredible gear, I won't deny that. But instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment, learn how to use the D2H well and you'll be much happier than ever. And that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations.<br /><br /> For instance, white balance. This can be the best thing for you, or the worst thing you've ever dealt with, depending upon how you approach it. Daylight, grey skies, dusk and dawn are easy, because you can set the camera to daylight, flash, shadow (for dusk and dawn times) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark. But the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue/green or orange- red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you don't properly use white balance. Preset white balance is king, here. I can get grey, black and white when I preset in mercury vapor light. And I used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting can't figure. There is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well! If you do this (and I can go on for miles here), you're on your way. So, with trying this D2H, or considering it, read through some of the digital D2H forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances. Generally, those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it. I can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail. When you have decent light, you'll have a decent image. But when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system, you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable.<br /><br /> In closing, I have not been paid by anyone, I have no Nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that I'm giving the D2H credit where it's long overdue.","I've had my D2H for 9 months now. I've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great. It seems this issue plagued a minority of users.<br /><br />Camera is very fast, exposes well and delivers results. It's primarily designed to be a sports and Photojournalism camera -- for situations where speed counts. It's a 4 megapixel wonder -- it's true it only has 4 megapixels, but they are 4 GREAT megapixels. Images upsize wonderfully.<br /><br />I love my unit, and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup, or wait for the D2X. The price of the D2x is making that decision a bit easier and I'm leaning toward another D2H.","I ordered this camera in December, have had it since then, and it an amazing camera. First time I have ever had professional camera, and it takes time to learn how to use it. It is not a point and shoot camera. If you want large pictures and like to crop, this may not be the camera for you. However if you want the ability to take great pictures, and learn how to use a professional camera at a great price this is the one to buy.<br /><br />Ability to have custom curves, which means to have predetermined parameters for different conditions. Ability to chage ISO at random for different conditions.  You can pay five thousand dollars for its successor, the Dx2, however for $2000 this is a bargin that you will never find again.<br /><br />Jim Comfort"]},{"name":"Pentax Optio S4","amazon_reviews":["This came as a new item!","As an owner of an older model, I had been very pleased with the camera, particularly its small size (and perfect fit in a mint tin). However, with the S4 I was very disappointed with the shot to shot time.  Especially for flash pictures, the picture button must be held down for a full 4 to 5 seconds to take a picture. Reviewing pictures is also slow - there is a 3 to 4 second pause between each picture when reviewing them on the camera. After using it for a year and being very pleased with all other features of the camera, this drawback alone has gotten annoying enough to want to get a different brand. According to the Optio, the delay is a result of slower processing speed within the camera. So if I was buying again, I would go with a different model of Optio with a better processing time, or check out a different brand.","I had the very first Optio S, and I could not find many things about it to improve upon, except for the battery door hinge, less barrel distortion, and more megapixels. Well, the next generation Optio's have 4, 5, and 6 megapixels, so take your pick. The biggest selling point for me has always been the size. These cameras fill niches that a bigger camera frequently cannot. It is ideally suited for street photography, travel, candids, and snapshots.<br /><br />The Optio S line is tiny and inconspicuous. Your subjects won't often realize that you have a camera in hand. The Optio S4 fits inside an Altoids tin just like the first model, and it should always be that way. I would like for them to make an even smaller camera.  An average-sized hand can conceal it quite nicely. I love the picture quality, even though there is barrel distortion and vignetting, but the kind of photography that I pursue often benefits from it. If I want to do architecturals and mural-sized landscapes, my medium-format camera or 4x5 view camera is what I use. Like I said, the Optio S fills a certain photographic niche, just as a large-format technical camera would for architectural photography. And like all cameras, this one won't make you a better photographer; that takes STUDY and PRACTICE.<br /><br />If there was any other camera that came before the Optio S; that comes closest to it in terms of character, rendering style and other intangibles, I would say it was the Pentax K-1000. If you know anything about the K-1000's cult-like following, you would know what I mean. It's like the K-1000 was reborn as the Optio S. The Optio S is the digital K-1000.","So I figure I might as well give my thoughts on it. I don't have much to compare it too, but I really appreciate this camera, and I continue to feel, looking back, that this was a great buy.<br /><br />Firstly, I used to play with the white balance, and could never get it right, but my wife discovered the easy mode on the camera, and ever since, I've had only great color. I have no complaints at all about color, resolution, etc. I find the quality much better than film cameras, and that's all I needed.<br /><br />At first, the battery life was great, but after about a year and a half, it started to go. By now, I get like 60 pictures on a battery.<br /><br />The one thing that annoys me is the occasional lag between when I press the button and when the camera snaps the picture. I think this is normal of digital cameras, but I can't help being annoyed by it. Fortunately, it's not too bad, and doesn't happen all the time.<br /><br />Of course, size is great. I got a leather case for it, and stick it in my pocket.<br /><br />The camera seems to work like new. I had no problems with it at all, which is of course nice.<br /><br />All in all, very happy with it.<br /><br />Bruce","I bought this camera because I was looking to replace my small, point-and-shoot film camera.<br /><br />The Optio has been a great replacement, giving decent image quality in a very small form factor.<br /><br />The interface is solid and relatively easy to use. My only complaint is that the power button and the shutter release seem to be switched around -- the power button is often pressed by people that have never used the camera when they mean to take a picture.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this camera.","I've had this little gem for a year now and use it daily. The size of the camera and the quality of the pictures makes it the best investment I've ever made in a camera. I have tried other larger, more technical digitals in the past few months, thinking I would like to upgrade my little Optio, but always come back to my faithful little friend. It goes everywhere I go, weddings, outdoor shots, even my son's rollerblade competitions and I've never been disappointed. It's so easy to use, I've had no problem with the battery life as long as I keep my eye on the LCD and it shows me when it's getting low on energy. It doesn't take that long to recharge...just a matter of my knowing when.<br /><br />The only thing I wish it had was more optical zoom.","This camera is small, light and easy to take along anywhere. The 4m pixel resolution is plenty for your average amateur photographer to take snapshots on vacation or when out with friends. I've printed out many photos taken with this camera and they come out sharp. It may just be the printing process, but the prints come out with better colors from this camera than they did with my film camera.","Just got this camera about a week ago.  Love it!!  Small, sleek, fits almost anywhere (including in an Altoids can).  The picture quality is amazing and the colors are vibrant.  The battery lasts much longer than I had anticipated.  The camera is ready to take a picture a second after being turned on, which sadly was not the case with my bulky Kodak DX3500. The Optio is so easy to use, you almost don't need the manual it comes with.  The only complaint is from my fiance --  he has rather large hands, and he sometimes has problems hitting the right button because of the buttons being so small.  All in all, I would recommend the Optio S4 to anyone interested in a high quality, compact digital camera.","Great pictures and small size make this the coolest around.  Have had it for a year now and had no problems with it.  Outstanding battery life and great screen.  Buy this camera","I have had this camera for 2 months now and I am very pleased with it.  I first could not believe how Pentax put in a 4.0 mp in such a small size.  It is unbelievably small!  It is the smallest digital camera out there.  Zoom is great.  People who broke this camera simply did not handle it carefully enough.  You get the best bang for the buck- cheaper than many of 4.0 mp digi cams out there on the top of Pentax rebate- I got the check in the mail in about 8 weeks.  Picture quality is great.  It also has amazingly many features such as sound/video recording, 3D photo, and multi-colored photos.

Pros:<br />  -Size: This camera is tiny considering its 4MP resolution and 3x optical zoom (this is because of a unique lens arrangement).<br />  -Lens: The range of the lens is perfect--too many digicams aren't wide enough, but this one gets to about 35mm (35mm equivalent). The quality is pretty good considering the camera's size. It won't compete with a much larger, more expensive lens on \"prosumer\" digicams, but they won't fit in your pocket, and what good is a better lens if you don't have the camera?<br />  -Image Quality: Excellent image quality for a camera in this size and price range. Will print out 8 x 10 inch prints without a problem (assuming you don't crop too much). There's a little lens distortion at the edges at the wide end, but nothing abnormal for sub-compact.<br />2. Cons:<br />  -I think there's a slightly newer version that is either out, or soon will be. Check Pentax's website.<br />  -Shot-2-Shot: The shot-to-shot time is pretty slow (feels like a second or so at high quality).<br />  -Focus: Doesn't focus well in low-light, which makes it hard to take pictures at dusk or later unless you turn off the auto-focus.","I don't understand why this camera is cheaper than the Pentax Optio S, which is only 3,2 MP.<br />Can anyone tell me ?","I spent about a month meticulously researching digital cameras and finally decided on the S4.  I have been extraordinarily pleased with my purchase.  Here are the reasons:<br />*It's VERY small!  I travel extensively... large cities, beaches, mountains.  I have an excellent 35mm camera, but it's simply too large and requires an extra carrying case.  The S4 will easily fit in any shirt, pants or coat pocket.  This encourages you to take it everywhere... the more often you have your camera with you, the more great photos you'll end up with.<br />*The quite acceptable 4MP resolution and 3x optical zoom (ignore digital zoom claims; it's a gimmick).<br />*A huge variety of user options, including night, portrait, and sunset modes.  You can also take fantastic 60-second video clips or use it as a voice recorder.<br />*It comes bundled with quality photo organizing and editing software.<br />If you're looking to hang your photos in the Smithsonian, you may need to look elsewhere, but this camera will suit all others just fine.<br />One tip:  some have complained about difficulty finding a carrying case.  Just get an Altoids can and use double-stick tape to adhere some micro-bubble-wrap or other soft cloth to the inside.  I did this and it works perfectly!","This tiny camera has now been everywhere with me in its Altoids tin -- the snow of the Rockies, the outback of Australia, the beaches of Mexico.  It is the perfect camera for those shots that you would never have got with a bulkier model.  The thing just works well, has all the bells and whistles you could want and takes great pictures.  Durability?  Use the Altoids tin desdigned to protect it!  Quality?  Great for memories, and, from what I've managed so far, often good enough for sellable art prints.  Convenience?  Can't be beaten!","I got this for myself after the holiday season with some $ and gift certificates I had received. (I didn't buy it here.) It's SLICK. Yes I use an Altoids tin as a case. Yes it always gets comments from every single person I show it too. Yes it's slick. Picture quality is O K. I find the autofocus a little finicky, but there are so many options to choose from when taking photos that I'm sure with a little practice I'll get every picture looking perfect. I find the battery to run a little on the weak side, hopefully their next version will be more robust.<br />But so far, so good.  I'd recommend it. It's just too cool.","I love this camera. I have taken it everywhere. Up mountains in the snow, fishing in saltwater with lots of humidity and in sandy deserts. It still works as well as the day I bought it as it is durable and tiny. It even fits inside an altoids tin! Did I mention the excellent pictures it takes?","Pentax Optio S4 is amazing digital camera. We can say \"Size does matter\". The size of the makes it stand tall from others. The camera can fit in pocket and it is very useful when we are travelling.<br />Operating the camera can be little tough. The picture clarity is good and the resolution is very decent for road warriors like me.","I agree with all the positive stuff that's been said about this camera... one thing that I do want to stress also is that if your local camera store has those special machines that are able to process your digital pictures onto regular 4x6 glossy prints, those pics do come out looking awesome!  My friends were totally surprised to find out that my 4x6 glossy prints came from my little Optio, because the picture quality looked unbelievably just as crisp and clear as the pictures from my 35mm camera film.","I have had this camera for about 2 months.  It is my first digital camera.  I shopped for small size, fast shots, and good quality shots.  So far, this camera has met these needs.<br />The functions are easy and intuitive.  Uploading to my computer via the memory card is easy.  The display on the back of the camera is clear, even in daylight.<br />And the size is great.  I actually use an Altoid tin as the case!<br />I highly recommend this camera.","Lets be straight, I didn't know much about camera specifics. All I knew was that I wanted a sleek, compact, great quality digital camera--and I got exactly what I asked for.<br />In fact you will find yourself taking ten times the amount of pictures you have ever taken with a 35mm with this nifty camera nearby; it is just irresistable to ignore during those fun times with your friends when you want to capture a few snapshots or a quick minute, good-quality movie.<br />Sure  I researched some 5-megapixel+ digital cameras, but the truth was I needed a camera that could remain at my side at all times--something that would not feel irratating in my pocket. (For all you girls out there, it fits nicely in a jean jacket or pant pocket. Now you can capture all your party moments without lugging around a brick!)<br />Overall, the quality of the images is great. I was very impressed by the many manual options. Don't get me wrong, if you want more advanced manual controls go for the optio 550 or canon s50, but for others like me, the psuedo-photographer, or really the average person who wants innovative size and quality in one package at an affordable price, buy it, dont hesistate!","This review is from the perspective of an amateur photographer and a first-time digital camera buyer.  My primary goal was to have a) something very portable with b) intermediate features that I could grow into.  So this is what I think:<br />Pros<br />* Excellent portability - extremely light and small<br />* Numerous settings allow you to take pictures under vast majority of conditions<br />* Very good macro function<br />* Great `WOW' factor!<br />* High resolution - 4MP<br />* Good optical zoom - 3x<br />* Records short videos - upto 60 seconds<br />* Decent-sized LCD screen<br />Cons<br />* Average picture quality (you have to print the photos to see the real quality)<br />* No SD card included (only 11MB of internal memory; budget for SD card)<br />* One proprietary battery not enough; budget for spare<br />* Battery cover somewhat flimsy - handle with care<br />* No case; you could get one from Fry's/BestBuy for less than $10<br />Optio S4 serves my purpose very well.  I hated lugging around my previous 35mm camera.  Now I pretty much have the S4 with everywhere I go during the four weekends that I have had it.  Overall evaluation is thumbs up!","I had owned a Canon S400 for 6 months and was very happy with it. My only complaint? It was not quite small enough to automatically carry it with me everyday, the way I carry my wallet, pager, cellphone etc. It was just sightly too thick and caused a visible,rectangular bulge in whatever pocket it was in.<br />I read the dimensions, checked the reviews and ordered an S4.<br />When I first opend the box, I could'nt believe the dimunitive size of this camera! Its one thing to read the size numbers, but actually see is unbelievable(I can picture James Bond using this camera). My Canon S400 looks and feels like a brick by comparison. It's so small, I get nervous handling it without using the handstrap. It's really that small!!<br />I'm an amateur photographer (and technology geek), and have owned 5 previous digital cameras(3 Canon, Fuji, Nikon).<br />First the obvious: the Canon S400 takes better pictures. Canon makes the best lenses and has the best technology. The pictures from the S4 are good, the canon pictures are better.<br />With all small(tiny?) cameras and devices, there are always compromises- the S4's tiny size and 4oz weight ensure its always with me, to take great pictures whenever opportunity presents. THE BEST CAMERA IS USELESS IF YOU DONT HAVE IT WITH YOU !!","I have an optio S (3 MP) camera and I am very satisfied with the performance. However this camera and the Optio S4 are available for a lot cheaper at [...]<br />You may want to research that site before your purchase here. Keep in mind that price drops on Amazon are common and there is no price protection beyond 30 days. I saw my purchase drop $50 due to a price cut - hope you benefit from my experience.<br />I was advised to sell my camera back on Amazon (wonder how that helps me recover a price drop ??)","This camera is awesome.  I've had it for two weeks now and it has lived up to every single one of my expectations.  I did have to buy an extra memory card, but what camera has enough memory these days?  I love this camera, it definitely has the 'wow' factor and also works really well.  The pictures I've taken with this camera are definitely of the highest quality.  Amazing.....","Compared to the older Optio S, the S4 features 4 megapixels (vs. Optio S's 3MP), and weighs in at only 3.5 ounces vs. Optio S's 4.1.  In short, the S4 is another truly AMAZING digital camera that's no bigger than the Apple iPod.  If there's one consumer-grade digital camera you get this holiday season, the S4 should be the one.  (If money is object, choose the S model.)","Just one information about something I read, please readers be carefull and always double check the reviews. The Casio EX-Z4 which this pentax is often compared to, use THE SAME optic of the Pentax (digital processing is different though).<br />Minolta Xt is a 3mp very compact camera with totally different lens concept (telescopic instead of sliding).<br />This camera is quite amazing: increadbly small in size, but with good features and quite good image quality.<br />Some distortion and less sharp image in the corners, though, so doesnt really compare to an Ixus IV for example.<br />But beware! The 4mp version doesnt bring much improvement over the cheaper 3mp former model.<br />Same for the Casio. I would stick to 3mp versions for a better price/quality ratio - (well if you get a deal, 'cause on amazon they sell almost same price now...)","OK, so you can't have it all.  Well, I almost have it all with my new Optio S4.  The size is the selling point, bar none.  I took it with me everywhere today (first day with it) and snapped tons of photos.  It's great to be able to take it with you anywhere for anytime photos.  I upgraded from my old stalwart, my Sony DSC-S70.  Even though my Sony was only 3.3 megapixels, the picture quality was much sharper than my new Optio.  Obviously, given the small size of the Optio, there had to be room for sacrifice, but the photos just don't seem like they are 4mp quality.  Size was the obvious primary concern for Pentax...and what a slam dunk the design is!<br />Don't get me wrong, I couldn't be happier with my purchase, but products always have room for improvement.  I can honestly say this engineering marvel has very little room for improvement.  The battery life, myriad of settings, simple manual, and compact charger earn a solid 4 stars in my book.<br />Bottom line:  Buy this camera.  You will take more photos than you ever imagined (read: get a 256MB card and extra battery for true shooting freedom).  One more thing.  Shop around.  Got mine online (not Amazon) brand new... Also got my 256 San Disk card ....  Deals like this are impossible to pass up!<br />Get it. You'll thank me later!","The Pentax Optio S4 is a superb camera; the fact that it's an ultra-compact camera as well makes it even more amazing.  I researched and tried out many different compact digital cameras before settling on the Optio S4.  I travel quite a bit and was looking for a camera that I could slip in my pocket without sacrificing too much in the way of quality images.  What I found in the Optio S4 is an extremely compact camera that sacrifices nothing with respect to image quality.<br />The resolution, edge-to-edge sharpness and color rendition rivals or exceeds that of larger cameras, much less other compacts.  It's exposure metering is precise and handles backlit and mixed lighting scenes with ease.<br />In terms of size, the Optio S4's closest competitor is the Casio EX-Z4.  The Casio is a bit slimmer, but it's taller and wider and the Optio S4 outperforms it in resolution and edge sharpness.  The Casio uses a folded lens system, which is innovative but detracts from its optical performance. Also, the Casio (at least the US version) does not offer a movie mode, something the Optio S4 does very well. The Optio S4 is so small it will fit inside an Altoids breath mint tin!<br />Battery run time on the Optio S4 is quite acceptable and there are a number of built-in power saving features you can elect to activate.  As with most of the compacts, internal memory is small, so plan on buying a SD data card along with the camera.  A 64mb or larger card would be a wise purchase.<br />Overall, the Pentax Optio S4 is a superb 4 mega pixel camera in a compact package.","I first bought the casio Exlim did'nt like the dock system!So I bought the optio 4.The Quality of the Casio is much better! Made in Japan vs Philippines (BUT) the camera is still very good!You can order the Casio Exilm wallet type case and it works fine! You can find at a lower price at other dealers..OH yes!It has software included but,I found Kodak easyware MUCH more simple and looks great when you use full screen.You can download from Kodak websight..","I bought this Pentax Optio S4 after being frustrated with my Sony digital camera.  The Sony was just too big and a pain to carry; therefore, I never used it or took it on trips.  With the Optio, ther is no reason not to take it with you.  It is so small, takes great pictures, is easy to use, and the owner's manual is great. Definitely THE gift of the season!","Extraordiary camera... combination of very samll size, large image size, and outstanding pictures. It's the kind of camera you will carry with you every day. Battery life is 70-80 pictures and recharging time is quick. Very easy for the beginner to use but also has all the features an advanced user could want. Color quality equals the best I've seen from ANY digital camera. Highest recommendation... you will not be disappointed.","pentax had heads turning when they introduced the optio s because that camera could fit into an altoids tin.  well, pentax has upped the ante.  they've managed to a full megapixel of resolution without increasing the size of this amazing camera.  the result is the optio s4.<br />pros:<br />- yes, it still fits in an altoid tin! the main selling point of this camera is its small size: 3.3 x 2.0 x 0.8 in, weighing in at 3.5oz.<br />- relatively high \"wow\" factor.<br />- average four megapixel resolution.<br />- good reliable metering.<br />- low image noise at low ISO settings.<br />- fast autofocus in well lit situations.<br />- very good macro performance for an ultra-compact.<br />- wide range of focus options including manual focus!<br />- histogram display in live view and play modes.<br />- allows decent manual control for what is billed as a point-and-shoot ultra-compact.<br />- no color cast from flash.<br />- fast startup time.<br />- solid build quality - stylish aluminum case.<br />- bright LCD monitor with anti-reflective coating.<br />- shooting priority during play mode.<br />- doubles as a voice recorder.<br />cons:<br />- some chromatic aberrations.<br />- some vignetting visible.<br />- moderate barrel distortion at full wide angle.<br />- average photo quality with soft edges.<br />- images noisier than competition.<br />- the right most button at the top of the camera is the power button. right beside it to the left is the shutter release button. for me, the more logical button placement would be to have the shutter release button on the far right.<br />- no AF assist light.<br />- some redeye occurrence.<br />- poor shot to shot times - very disappointing.<br />- metal body scratches easily.<br />- RAW and TIFF formats not supported.<br />- longest shutter setting is 4 seconds.<br />- only 11MB of built-in memory provided so add $$ to your budget to buy external memory.<br />- below average battery life and the battery is proprietary so add more bucks for a spare.<br />like its predecessor, the optio S, the S4 is an amazing camera, providing a wide feature set in an ultra-compact package. it is simply the smallest camera with its feature set available today (10/2003).  it is very similar to the slightly bigger casio ex-z4. so why only four stars? opportunites for improvement would be: better shot to shot times, a longer shutter setting (max right now is 4 seconds), and an AF assist lamp.<br />i hope this helps you with your buying decision. peace.","Pro:<br />-It's SMALL:  Smaller in both length and width than most flip phones (like Motorola or Samsung) and has the same silver finish<br />-Ease of use: I'm not really a techie, but I was able to figure out how to use it by reading the manual over a couple of times. Trust me, if I can do it, anyone can.<br />-It came with an updated USB driver for the camera that installed in less than 30 seconds on my WinXP PC.  I chose not to install the included photo editing software, but that's up to individual users.<br />-When connected to my USB port, the pictures (w/o the editing software) showed up in folders under \"Removable Disk\" icon that pops up next to my CD-Rom drives whenever I plug in the camera<br />and I just view them with the WINXP picture fax viewer<br />-I've taken about 50 pics already and there were no \"RED EYE\" problems for me in any of them, unlike a lot of other reviews I've seen on the internet<br />-The frame rate for the video was almost the same as watching home movies from my camcorder, although the sound was very very low (just need to bring the camera in closer to the person talking)<br />-has built in speaker!  I watched and listened to the small video clips, each one about 60 secs.<br />-The flash is very, very good!!!  Pictures in low-light (not withstanding the LCD problem) at about 12 feet, come out crisp and clear for me<br />-All the other buttons and controls (except the four-way dial) are extremely easy to use and all the major regular features like flash settings and manual focus are literally at the push of a button, not through the menu screen<br />-I've been using only my right hand for all menu options and also taking pictures (warning to left-handed people, this is a right-handed camera)<br />-OVERALL: This camera has features which will please even up to an Intermediate level photographer.<br /><br />Con:<br />-The metal body scratches easily.  I've had it for about four hours, and there's already a small scratch, but any small scratches are not a problem if you are not less than half an inch from the body of camera.<br />-There are discrepencies in the manual, specifically with the various photo \"modes\" available.  Several of them are not even listed or explained at all.<br />-There are only four fixed resolutions you can take pictures in<br />-The four-way dial is way too small for most hands<br />-The LCD screen is almost totally black in very low light conditions<br />-NO (Secure Digital) FLASH MEDIA STORAGE CARD INCLUDED (prepare to shell out anywhere between $25 to $200 additional for storage -- about 40 pics with a 128 mb card at the higest resolution)<br />-The AC adapter for the camera itself is \"optional\" (either buy another battery or keep your battery charger handy)<br />-the battery life also is not very good, and it seems it needs more charging time than its use time<br />-NEED A CASE if planning on TRAVELING with the camera.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />If you're looking for the digital camera that has everything, go for a 5 megapixel one (e.g. Canon S50) which is larger in size but has everything a semi-professional photographer would want.  But if you're a gadget freak, this will impress the @#$% out of your buddies.  But, not just aesthically, this camera was extremely easy to use and doesn't involve any sort of a lengthy learning curve, even for complete newbies to digital cameras, like me.  Even with the con's, I still love this camera!","I didn't buy this camera from amazon (I found a lower price elsewhere).  The Optio S4 is an amazing camera.  I was going to buy the Optio S, but decided to hold out for the S4 since it had some options that were worth waiting for.<br />I've only had it for 2 days, but it has been taking some great pictures.  It's super-tiny!  The quality of the pictures is not bad at all.<br />With its features and the price, I would *highly* recommend this camera.","I use film for most of my work, also I already had a 4 MP digital camera that was not getting a lot of use do to it's size. I wanted something for snapshots that I can carry with me non stop and take all those goofy Kodak moments. Controls are well placed and accessible. Since camera is so small, buttons may feel little cramped for users with big hands. Many cameras if powered on accidentally inside the case or pocket will try to open up and therefore break lens mechanism. Pentax on/off switch is very secured and if by any chance you still open it up by mistake and lens is blocked camera will not power on. I think this is an excellent feature since camera is so small and can<br />accidentally turn on when it's tossing and turning in your pocket.<br />Some people complained about slow write up time to the memory card. I haven't experienced that so I can't say anything bad. It took me a while to learn how to take picture properly. It is a small camera so you have to me more careful about camera shake (aka pay more attention to shutter speed). Also since controls are so small they are not as sensitive so in order to take a pic you really need to press the shutter down.<br />Pros:<br />-SIZE! SIZE! SIZE! It really doesn't get any better than that. Small body that fits into Altoid tin.<br />-Picture Quality. It's excellent for JPEG. File size is anywhere from 2.5 - 2.9 MB in the 4mp , least compression mode. It would be nice to have a TIFF there. But to answer everyone's question: yes I printed very nice super sharp 8by10 images out of this little wonder. 8by10 is all I want, if I need to go bigger I buy a better camera or use film.<br />-Flash. Very powerful and superb even in comparison to my other bigger cameras.<br />-LCD. Super sharp and detailed.<br />-Battery Life. I was super skeptic about battery life but after week or so of use I can say it hold its charge and last very long time.<br />-Ease of playback, deletion and control access. Very intuitive and well placed.<br />-Build in memory. It's nice to have a backup 11 Megs just in case.<br />Cons:<br />-Placement of LCD monitor. If you try to use viewfinder and monitor is on it will blind your eye for a bit due to proximity. It is not a big deal outdoors but in dark environments it causes a bit of problems.<br />-Viewfinder is small and cramped.<br />-Picture quality distortion along edges. They come out a bit blurry there. It is much better than original Optio S but still not perfect<br />-No 400 ISO. Really disappointing for low light photography. Also 200 ISO is very noisy.<br />-No focus assist light. Makes it hard to take picture in the dark.<br />-Zoom can have few more steps.<br /><br />Now you have to remember that I(you) bought this camera mainly for it's size. If you want tiff mode, superb quality pics, big zooms I think you should go for a bigger and different camera. But if you want something that will be always with you for snapshots, candits and travel photos I think this is an excellent piece of equipment. I keep my in my pocket all the time, I use it for work, pleasure and hangout. I take it kayaking, hiking and climbing. It's a snap shot camera with surprisingly powerful features, nice image quality and average zoom. My set includes an extra battery (not used yet), petax leather case, 512 memory card and Ziploc bag. And true, it is so small I misplaced it twice."]},{"name":"Olympus C-5060 Wide Zoom","amazon_reviews":["Thank you so much for the quick delivery and the great quality product!","This is my third Olympus of this generation.

I have found it a very good item. I had to get a special filter for takeing photos through windows, to cut out reflection. while taheing photos through the windows of trains in Europe.","Since a Google search will turn up this listing on amazon at or near the top, I thought I'd add some advice regarding the 5060 \"mode dial\" problem.  This is that problem where the on/off switch starts working erratically and then soon all of the functions begin behaving very strangely or not at all, including macro mode, flash settings, program settings, etc.<br /><br />There are two solutions - one extreme, and one really simple.  I solved my problems with the simple fix.  Try it and it might work - if not, use the drastic fix.<br /><br />The simple fix:<br />1. Get a can of \"DeOxit D5 Power Booster\" spray from Caig Laboratories.  You can get it from Radio Shack and many other electronics supply places.<br /><br />2.  Attach the red straw to the spray head and use it to squirt the DeOxit into and around the mode dial switch, the menu buttons, and any other moving buttons that you think might have electronic contacts underneath.  Try to avoid the LCD, and don't saturate the entire camera back - just squirt it into the crevices.<br /><br />3.  Manipulate all the buttons and dials you have just sprayed.<br /><br />Voila!  I'll bet your camera works perfectly now.  My guess is that a gradual process of oxidation on the electrical contacts causes at first intermittent, then permanent discontinuity of the electrical switches.  DeOxit is a really good electrical contact cleaner and removes the oxidation from the electrical contacts.  (try it on slot cars too - they will run faster!).  I use the spray on any old electrial switches that are mis-behaving and very often it will solve the problems for a long time, then another shot usually restores function.<br /><br />Some people report using WD-40 successfully.  This works on the same principle, but WD-40 does NOT clean the electrical contacts the way the DeOxit does, so I recommend skipping straight to the DeOxit.  WD-40 will also leave a greasy residue, and can eventually \"gum up\" when it dries out.  DeOxit dries completely, is not greasy, and won't harm plastics or metal finishes.  WD-40 can destroy some plastics.<br /><br />If not, proceed to the drastic method, which is to replace the mode dial.  Instructions can be found here:<br /><br />[...]","I was sad to see many users having issues after a few years of owning this camera.

Learned to use and love it and got great photos, but then after it was a little over a year old it malfunctioned and has become useless. Every time I turn it on it gets stuck trying to zoom and no dials or controls will respond, I can't really afford or justify paying another $150 for repairs. I'll be very cautious if I'm considering another camera from Olympus in the future.","I bought the C5060 reconditioned over a year ago, and I am always amazed at how beautiful the photos are and what I see through the monitor. The drawback I ran into was that you cannot see your info through the viewfinder. My local camera shop sold me a \"shield\" for bright times of day, and that helps a lot. My daughter is a photographer (mainly in the modeling field), and she really loved handling and using it. I'm thinking of getting her one for her BD in two weeks. I'm saddened by the poor reviews of it here and there, but I'm wondering if we surveyed 500 users what the percentage of the mode and/or dial problems would surface. ANY camera, ANY machine CAN have something wrong. Since I love the output and already own it and have a 5-year warranty since day one, I'll go on my merry (but a bit more informed) way and enjoy it. If it breaks down, I'll send it to Olympus or to my local shop, and my warranty will cover it at 100%. I have purchased approximately 8 or more Olympus cameras, but I've not had problems with any of them. If one should get \"sick\" I'll grab my C700 (GREAT camera BTW) and my Stylus 500 and go on my way. It pays to have more than one camera. I'm still of a mind to get this thing for my daughter since she loved it so, and she took gorgeous photos with it.<br /><br />I'll take the chance as the cost sure beats the original cost when I was dying to get it ($1,000!). I think I paid just over $400 completely with Olympus warranty, and Olympus has never been less than gracious with me!<br /><br />I think \"stuff happens\" and I may or may not get hit. I'll proceed to learn, and if it fails big time, and my warranty is not honored, I'll go to another model, but Olympus has had my heart (due to lenses) since the 70s and their SLRs!) I'd probably go E-Volt or one of the other SLR digitals they have been putting out.<br /><br />So as long as they repair, I am covered by warranty, and they treat me as nicely as they always have, I'm an Olympus die hard. ;)<br /><br />Lindsay","DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  The internet is full of reports of mode dial problems.  This is a design flaw that Olympus apparantly has not addressed for out-of-warranty users.  This problem will render your camera useless and it a very expensive repair.","I certainly respect that others have had issues with this model. However, I am going on my 3rd year with mine and have had no issues at all and have thoroughly enjoyed using this great camera. Quality issues aside, I've found it's a great all-around camera to have. It's definitely not an SLR -- but it's also not just a point and shoot. Photographers with experience will enjoy the ability to use the manual modes and other creative functions.<br /><br />The articulating viewfinder has been really enjoyable - flipping it around and being able to hold the camera above the crowd - and still see the LCD view of what you're taking was especially good.<br /><br />Pros: Feels good in the hand, controls are easy to use, menus are generally very intuitive. The top-mounted LCD (data) is handy to avoid having to look at the color LCD for basic camera settings. Wide range of lighting and settings to get creative have been enjoyable.<br /><br />Cons: the optical viewfinder is pretty useless - poor representation of what's really in the picture. The LCD display is generally very good, but in very bright sunlight it's extremely hard to see. There are hoods available that strap over the camera - very nice to have in order to see what's on the LCD.","I'm an amateur photographer so I chose the Olympus C5060 for it's automatic settings capabilities. I also had heard of some problems with the C5060 so I purchased an additional 2 yr warranty from Olympus for only $50. So far (over 1yr) I've not had any problems.<br /><br />The camera takes great pictures, with excellent color even in low light conditions. I've take outdoor, long range, indoor, macro closeups, etc and every picture looks good to me. I especially like the C5060's picture quality in no flash indoor pictures.<br /><br />Overall a very good camera with excellent results.","I got a C5050 which was the predecessor to this camera.  After about over 1 year of non-frequent use, the CCD is having problem.  I did a search on Google and this seems to be a common product defect problem.  The symtom of the problem is that the LCD screen looks like a bad TV signal reception.  As first, I thought it was the LCD problem but when I took a picture.  The picture turned out all badly which than I realized it's the CCD problem.  I have another Olympus D490 which is almost 4 years old and no problems.","I had dropped my old Olympus 3040 when visiting my sister and shooting pictures of my nephew and cracked the lens, so I had to get a replacement.<br /><br />I had liked how the 3040 worked, so I decided to stay with Olympus and got this camera and was not disappointed.  Though it is not a professional camera, there is many controls available to use (it can be used more than a mere point and shoot).  And the wider angle lens is great to have to get group shots easier than mmy older camera.<br /><br />The only quibble is thee battery pack, I prefer having AA Batteries so I can always have a charged set ready to go, but more and more cameras nowadays use the battery packs, so it is not something that is really that negative.","Bought this as a christmas gift for my wife.  I got to try it out a few times and was never disappointed with the results.  Wish I read up on the reviews before I got it, might have got something else instead.","Regardless of the negative reviews, the C5060 is one great advanced digital camera. Keep in mind that this is a point and shoot or creative shooting camera, but with little flexibility in lense add ons. The wide angle and macro capabilities are superb. The low light performance so commonly complained about can easily be overcome when neeeded by increasing the exposure by a third of a stop or two. I've taken over 8000 photos with  this camera in 16 months and never had one problem with it. Be careful where you buy yours. There are refurbs and non-US versions out there now.<br /><br />I've moved on to a digital LR but the C5060 was a great camera for me and expect it to remain so for it's new owner.","I have had the c-5060 for almost a year and am very happy with the camera. The wide-angle lens is great for landscape photos. I find that the amount of post-processing I need to do with photos from this camera is minimal. Sharpness is always good right off the camera. It also handles contrasty scenes very well and doesn't overexpose as much as other cameras I have owned.","(Updated Jan. '06 - read last paragraph)<br />I've had this camera since May '04, and I have never had any problem with it. No problems with the menu, with freezen, or any of the ones mentioned in other reviews. I'm not saying those problems don't occure, since I've read the same comments in other sites, but I consider myself lucky for not having to deal with that.<br />My experience have been great with this camera. It has lots of features, and even thought I take approx. 250 pictures a month, I'm still learning to use some of its features. I've taken night pictures, and, in comparision with the Canon G5 (which I considered when buying mine), the pictures from the C5060 are way better. No purple halos around the lights (like the G5, and when the noise control is ON, it really minimizes the noise in the pictures. Zoom control is a bit slow, but it offers a semi-decent range. I'm still planning to buy the 1.7x zoom magnifier. Obviously, if you want more you should try an SLR. 40.5 filters can be bougth online (B&H), or even found in Ritz Camera. I strongly recommend buying a polarizer, it really helps when taking pictures during the day.<br />One of the more common complaints about this camera is the use of proprietary batteries. Other than the cost of the batteries, the Olympus battery offers great capacity and allows you to take the camera for a 4-6 day trip without needing to change batteries. I recommend buying a 2nd battery, try an online search for a non-Olympus battery, I found one for $20 (a third of the cost from Olympus), and it offers the same duration as the Olympus.<br />Overall, after comparing this camera with others that I consider in the same level (Canon G5, among others), I would give this camera a 4.5 out of 5, based on all its features and the lack of problems I've experienced.<br /><br />Update Jan. '06:<br />I'm starting to experiment problems with my camera dial.  I traveled to Central America, and I guess humidity didn't mixed well with the C5060, as soon as I got there it started malfunctioning. Even thought I'm not happy with the problems, the camera still works great 90% of the time. I still like the camera, and love the picture quality, however, I have to drop one star because of this problem. I have to add that this problem has been documented (you can read about it in any user review you'll find on the web), but Olympus refuses to acknoledge it and fixed it at no cost. From what I've heard, it will cost between $150-200 to fixed it.  As a side note, I have bought the 3x lens, and it really expands the capability of this camera.","I have owned an Olympus C-3040 digital camera for 3 years, and decided to upgrade to the C-5060 for 4 reasons: 1) Faster processing; 2) Wide angle lens; 3) 5.1 megapixels; and 4)I am familiar with the Olympus software and menus, and didn't want to learn a whole new system again.<br /><br />The C-5060 has met all of my expectations and is a great camera.  My only negative comment is that I wish Olympus would standardize on the lens specs so that I don't need to buy new filters again.  The C-5060 uses a 40.5 mm size, and I have not been able to find adapters for it.<br /><br />The reviewers who moan about the camera's instruction manual are all not using the features of the Adobe Acrobat Reader software for the .PDF file that is on the CD with the manual. If you click on the Adobe drop down menu for fit to page, you get a beautiful 8.5 x 11 full page manual.  And if you print both front and back -- print all odd no pages, then reinsert the paper and print all even no. pages -- the manual is only about 135 pages.<br /><br />I purchased my camera new in mid-December, 2004, and the bugs described by some of the other reviewers here have not appeared.  It worked perfectly out of the box after 6 hours of charging the battery.","I think Olympus has missed the boat here.  This camera in no way improves on the 5050.  After falling with the camera in my hand and breaking it I decided to 'upgrade' to the 5060 and so far have been disappointed with the results in \"low light\" ie any indoor shots, and the macro feature isn't as sharp.<br /><br />I wish I'd saved the money and had my old camera repaired.","Note to readers: You will find updates at the end of this review, which was written about a few weeks earlier. It is not entirely happy reading.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />I've been very happy with Olympus digital cameras, having gone through several generations of them. Facing some work which required wide-angle capability I upgraded from my 2020z so I could use my wide-angle conversion lens, giving me a 35mm camera equivalent of about 19mm when needed.<br /><br />In terms of photographic quality, the results I am getting from this camera are nothing short of spectacular. Great sharpness and resolution that, as some reviewers have pointed out, are virtually as good in the standard HQ mode as in SHQ and TIFF. Fast shutter. Many exposure options. Very little noise. The camera is significantly larger than my 2020, but the build is solid and comfortable -- making steady shots a lot more likely. I also like the menu system,  and the various convenience buttons offer a lot of adjustments that do not require going deep into it. Though some users have noted that the lens is significantly slower than that on the 2020 and 4000, I have had some good luck with low light situations, and when things get pretty dim I increase the ISO settings, with good results. No problem there. I find this a fair trade off for wide angle capability. I also like the tilting and swiveling LCD (more flexible than on the 5050). It's bright and filled with useful information, so I use it all the time, though a 'my mode' setting allows me to power up without it in a pinch.<br /><br />OK, some quibbles. First, there is the mode dial failure issue, which some reviewers have noted -- and which is the subject of a Yahoo group and a fine Wrotniak article. Whether Oly has worked this problem out, what the failure rate is, etc. are not clear, and until I am persuaded that my production line was clean I will have a little 560 in the bottom of my bag in case of failure -- something I would generally do anyhow, particuarly since the 560 gives extremely fine results and runs forever on rechargeable CR-V3's.. What does bother me is the silence of Olympus on this matter. They have not satisfactorally explained the situation to many who have asked, and they haven't had the courtesy to respond to some questions I put to them. Anyone who invests in a product of this quality deserves a response, and as a long-time Oly user and advocate I am extremely disappointed and have the sneaking feeling there is a real problem here that should be resolved by a recall. After all, some of us rely on this camera in our work and if there is a problem want to have it fixed on our calendar.<br /><br />Speaking of the mode dial, the on-off switch is just below it and I have found that it is simply too easy to move the mode dial when turning the camera on and off, an unhappy situation if one is in a hurry. Bad design. Wear gloves? You're cooked.<br /><br />Another quibble is that Oly has eliminated a slot for SM cards in favor of microdrives which few Oly users use. I have pile of SM cards and would have liked that option (in addition to the CompactFlash and xD). They have it on the 5050.<br /><br />Ok, as for the battery issue. I borrowed a friend's Oly 5050 which runs on AA's and though the NiMh's I used were fresh I could squeeze no more than 60-80 shots out of the camera (using LCD; and remember that NiMh's have a fast discharge rate which means that when you need them they may be sorry shape to power a workhorse like this) before having to change batteries (this is about the same as with my 2020z). Using the 5060's proprietary battery (and others I picked up from third party resellers for as low as $7.00 each -- they work perfectly) I'm easily exceeding that, and can do almost a full day's shooting without worry. In addition to finding cheap Oly compatible batteries I found a marvelous rapid charger for less than $20 which cuts charging time by about 2/3rds. I've thus been able to cut the long cord on my OLY OEM charger back to a few inches, giving me a tiny little charger to put in the bottom of my gadget bag for travel. Yes, it would be nice to have the AA option in a pinch, but Oly makes a battery holder that uses two of the camera's very small batteries, and if one can pick up spare ones that work perfectly well for seven bucks (cheaper than four decent NiMh's), why not buy a few and just be sure one is in your pocket when you go off on a shoot? By using a proprietary battery Oly has also improved battery loading very significantly (my 2020 latch cover is a bugger, and more than once I've spilled batteries on the floor when changing them at night or in a hurry).<br /><br />My conclusion is that this is a fine camera that has a design flaw or two, and may or may not have a serious one that requires factory repair -- and should get some honest speaking from Olympus, a reputable company that has a fine product line. One needs to go into the battery situation with eyes open, but by no means is it required to purchase Oly branded batteries or chargers for backup. Given the extra power and fine results I'm happy. So far....<br /><br />-----> new comments:<br /><br />The camera died yesterday. I had done a relatively full day of commercial shooting and it had behaved beautifully. Brought it home, changed the battery, offloaded my data and set the camera down for a couple of minutes while I went off to get a cup of coffee. Came back and, voila, dead as a doornail. Checked out various contacts and pulled the battery to see if the camera would reset (occasionally my trusty 2020 would freeze up, but would unfreeze very suddenly after about 20 minutes of batteryless rest). Left the battery out all night and 16 hours later took it and camera over to a nearby camera store where I do a lot of business. They noticed the 5060 had died with lens fully extended and that it would not respond to an ac adapter. Alas, it is in the mail and Olympus sez they will turn it around within a week (not holding my breath on that folks). (note: I've learned that it may take as long as ten days for this camera to reset itself. Unlike some earlier models, it has a little battery or some other voltage holding device which allows users to recharge batteries or protect settings for a long time without a battery. The good news is this feature can save a lot of pain, the bad is that it there is a problem not fixed by the factory reset function you may have to wait quite awhile to find out if your camera is actually dead or just in a deeper than usual sleep).<br /><br />It does seem to me, having read quite a bit and having had this experience, a rare one in my Oly experience, that there must have been both shortcuts and maybe some truly untested bits and pieces in the manufacturing process that are causing problems to what would seem like quite a few people. These problems, as in my case, come after about two months of fairly heavy usage. Sure, covered by warranty, but I now have to backfill and the camera I hoped to have with me on a forthcoming trip will probably be on a workbench somewhere. Or Oly will send me a new one and two months from now....well lets see, but I suspect this is not the end of the saga. Hmmmm, those new Canons and Nikons are looking better and better.<br /><br />End of story (for now?)<br /><br />Olympus did as it promises and got my camera back to me about two weeks after they logged it in. Actually, my post office track told me they had the camera several days before actually logging it into their system, but from what I can learn there is nothing new about that. Calls to customer service to check on the camera were all but useless -- unfriendly and sometimes difficult (due to language spoken by agent). The technical report indicates that three circuit boards were replaced, suggesting some kind of catastrophic failure (which also managed to kill my memory card).<br />The camera is now working pefectly and my fingers remained crossed. My dealer tells me the turnaround time is about the best in the industry. I wish I knew more about checks they ran on the camera and whether there was a firmware upgrade, etc. but one can't have everything. It still puzzles me that such a fine camera just imploded, but I do see a lot of BMW's and Mercedes by the side of the road these days!","I had an Olympus C-4040 which I was very happy with.  I \"upgraded\" it to the C5060 when they came out.  I have to say that the bright f1.8 lens on the 4040 had spoiled me.  A lot of low light photos that had been easy with the 4040 were out of the question with the 5060.  The lowest f stop on the 5060 is only f2.8.  That means that photos I had been taking at 1/60th of a second were now needing 1/20th to 1/30th of a second exposure.  If you use a lot of flash maybe it won't matter to you, but I use natural light for most of my stuff.  The 5060 was stolen recently and after research I scoured the internet for one of the older C5050 cameras that has the F1.8 lens to replace it.<br /><br />The other issue I had is with the propietary Li-on battery that came with the 5060.  A spare costs $70.  The 4040 and the 5050 use AA batteries.  A better option.  I hope someone from Olympus reads this.  Lenses matter.  I looked at the new C-8080 camera, but the lens on it was a mediocre f2.4.","I have bought this camera in April and took it to a vacation abroad. The mode dial failed in the middle of the vacation which was very disappointing. After nervously rushing to the nearest internet PC I found that fiddling with the dial can help and it temporarily came back to life. It ultimately failed when I was back from the vacation.<br /><br />Be sure you can have the camera serviced in your area, because I have to send it abroad for repairs.","I have been using digital cameras since 1998 and had a chance to work with about a dozen different cams. 5060 is one of the best. When I was making a choice on what camera to get, 5060 wasn't on my list at all -- I did not want to get a camera with non-AA batteries. However, after I saw that my AA choices are limited I decided to extend my searching range. I liked everything in 5060, except the batteries, and it was superior in quality and value to the cameras in my selection (4-5mpx canon, nikon, sony, casio). I ended up with 5060 and I can say that I'm happy about my choice. There's even a positive side about the battery -- it is only one (in comparison to 4 AAs) and it's very to change it. I bought two more batteries on ebay for $20 (non-olympus). You can read about all the features in many other reviews. I want to point out the LCD screen -- I like it much better than those on Canon's (that open up to the side). Design of Olympus LCD is much better and proved to be extremely useful in many cases. With swivel screen I can take photos at the angles I could not even imagine before. Camera takes CF memory cards (cheaper and more popular then other formats) also it has 2nd slot of xd memory card. It's sort of a waste, as I would never buy xd card, but since 32mb is included with the cam, you get emergency 32mb storage. Ability to attach filter directly onto the lens adds a lot of convenience -- no need to get adapter tubes, and camera keeps the same size. Battery life is very good but if you are going on a trip get two more batteries. Proprietary batteries can be a real pain if you run out of them, so make sure to have spares. Also, charger that comes with the cam is somewhat weak -- takes about 5 hours to charge a battery. See if you can find used BCM1 charger (charges battery in 1 hour). 5060 does offer some inconveniences but nevertheless it is a very good camera. It produces great photos, offers 4x zoom, very convenient swivel screen and many more extras. I can't say that this camera is perfect but in comparison to others it is superior.<br /><br />------<br />Update<br /><br />I've been having problems with this camera: the option to move AF target simply disappeared. Called Olympus, they suggested to reset the cam and it helped. I read that some people have software-related problems with the camera. I'd suggest to try and reset it and see if it helps.","Just for information to the people who bought the c 5060 recently like I did and reported the problem with the charger's blinking red light when first charged out of the box.  I had the same problem but went ahead and fully charged the battery overnight despite the instructions saying to call customer support.  The battery was fully charged in the morning, the indicator light was green, and have not had a problem since.  What happened I think is the battery came from the supplier uncharged so the first time it is charged it takes a long time (I left it overnight probably 10 hours) and red indicator light is blinking.","July, 2004 - Just like the other reviewer from Texas, out-of-the-box the battery/charger had a problem.  I'm sure this is a good camera if I ever get to use it.<br />The charger flashes red after about 2 minutes of charging.  The instructions say to immediately call Olympus support.  Which I did and after about 15 minutes on hold, I'm told I can either return the camera or mail in the charger and battery.  I'm mailing the charger/battery - so I'm guessing I'm out of a camera for a couple of weeks.<br />When two people take the time to report the same problem within 2 months, I think Olympus has a serious problem with a supplier.<br /><br />November, 2004 - follow-up:  Since I was going on vacation the first of August, I purchased a second charger and battery - which worked fine.  It took Olympus four(4!) months to return the charger and battery I submitted to them - AND - they reshipped the same equipment back (still malfunctioning) in the same packing materials with instructions to resubmit the equipment if I still had a problem.  The camera works great - but if you need help from Olympus - good luck.","Having been very happy with my Olympus c3000 for a few years (3.2 MP) I was distraught at knocking the lens off one day while shooting from the perch of an active pogo stick (no more of that). While Olympus offered to totally overhaul it for $195 I thought it time for a new camera. After trying 2 canons (A75  at $225 and an S1-iS at $440) and being very unhappy with the image quality and focusing I bit the bullet and went for the 5060 wide zoom. This camera is far superior to either of those. More megapixels, yes, but that's not what sold me. It is so fast to start up, focus and write to the card. There is almost no shutter lag in good light.  The proprietary battery I wasn't crazy about untill I saw how long it lasted -- at least 3 times what 4 AA rechargables did in my old olympus. And I love WIDE so having the what is equal to 27mm on the 35 platform is great. The tilting, turning viewer which flips over for storage is also a great plus. And it feels very solid (titainium). It has a focus assist light which the s1-is didn't which I need for I shoot alot in dark places. The video mode is quite good and lastly it takes compact flash cards which are the least expensive per meg, so buy a few and you have a real bargain. Finally the lens is super sharp and bright. I also think black cameras are best for not calling attention to themselves. And the image quality is stunning as the very first print showed me. A great camera. No regrets.","The Olympus C-5060 Wide Zoom is an award winning (most recently PC World Best Buy in the Advanced Digital Camera class - February 2004) digital camera and has impressive specifications (5 MP, 14X seamless zoom, 2 different usable memory slots [xD and CF], wide angle zoom lens, super-handy multi-position LCD, movie mode with sound, etc.) going for it.  It has lots of manual controls available for the more serious photography enthusiasts.  You can attach it to a tripod, hook up additional flash units, add lenses and filters and do many manual, creative things not widely available at this resolution and price.  None of this made much difference once I started to actually use the 5060.<br />This is the third digital camera that I've bought, and the first that I've been really happy with.  The most important thing about a camera (at least for me) is the quality of the images that it produces.  I am a beginner at photography, with no picture taking education, and I've only used a fraction of the features that are available on this unit.  The best thing is that the pictures that I take with this camera are almost always very good, with a fair number edging into stunning, lush, and gorgeous - usually with all settings set on full automatic.  Using the manual modes is just not necessary to get many great shots.  Another thing that I want to point out is that the battery life on this camera has been better that any of the others that I've used.  The proprietary BLM-1 battery that ships with the 5060 significantly outlasts any AA batteries that I've ever used in other digital cameras.  On one charge I have been able to spend many hours per day over several days, using the LCD almost always and the flash on occasion, and I have never yet run out of power.  It is a bit slow to recharge once you've used most of the charge, so if you're snapping tons of pictures and have no time for a recharge, buy a second battery.<br />This is a camera that I recommend to anyone who wants sharp, colorful, gorgeous pictures with minimal hassle, and is able to afford the price range.  Try it for the features and price - you'll love it for the pictures.","I greatly anticipated the arrival of my new C-5060 and when it got here today I put the battery in the charger and started the rest of the Getting Started procedures. I got all the straps and lanyards attached, read most of the manuals before I found that the charger (a very cheap-feeling plastic unit, made in China) was blinking a red light. This blinking light means that the battery or charger is over-heating or something else is wrong. It also means you can't charge the proprietary battery and therefore can't check out your nice new camera. Olympus says to contact a service center not the people you bought it from in the first place. I figured, if it has problems out of the box I should just return it and decide later if I'd want to replace it with the same model or spend the extra $$ for an SLR.<br />The good news is: the camera fits nicely in your hand for one-handed shooting if you like; the QT movie mode does sound now; and the manual is included in the box. It looks like it has an impressive number of features. The buttons are well placed on the camera but since some have functions that vary with the settings your using, I would imagine it could get confusing. I do wish it had a manual focus adjustment (I didn't notice if there was a way to do this in the manual.)<br />You should also check the cost of the accessories if you plan to use it for anything more than a point-and-click camera.<br />As I said, I'll be thinking over the next few days whether I'll replace it with the same camera (one that I could use I'd hope) or if I'll upgrade to an SLR or maybe just stay with my Sony FD-91.<br />Thanks for listening and I hope this doesn't discourage you too much because it appears to be an excellent camera for the money.","I purchased the C-5060 last week. So far the camera takes good pictures and has most of the advanced features I need. Before I purchased the camera, I read numerous reviews that stated that the full instruction manual wasn't included with the camera, but was included as a PDF file on the CD. The camera does ship with a \"Quick Start\" sheet and a tiny (impossible to read) mini pamphlet that is almost useless. I thought I could get by with out the printed manual. Boy was I wrong! In order to fully use the C-5060, the printed manual is a MUST. I tried printing the manual from the PDF file included on the CD, but page 67 not only crashed my workstation, but also crashed my business server. After re-starting my system, I tried again to print the manual, but again page 67 crashed my system. Once again, after restarting my computer, Pages 68-149 printed ok, but after printing almost 150 of the 289 pages I called it quits. I called Olympus tech support and was told to download the PDF file from the Olympus web site, and try again. I asked that a manual be sent to me, but was told that I'd have to pay $10.00. Olympus will not budge on that policy. Shame on Olympus, keep in mind that the instruction manual is 289 pages, and much of the information contained in the manual is important to get the most out of the advanced features the camera offers. My advice: Buy another brand of camera that includes a full instruction manual. Even though the C-5060 is probably a good camera, because of the hassles of not having the manual, I can not recommend this model, or for that matter this brand.","This is my 3rd Olympus digital camera. This is my favorite so far. One older 2.5MP Olympus camera just didn't have the picture quality I wanted although it was very well made. I owned the Olympus C4040 which was a great camera. I was going to settle for the C4040. It took awesome pictures and was also built well. Unfortunately I had a situation which required more money then I had and the C4040 had to go! Now I have the C5060 and it's a keeper. Once again it is well made and takes great photos. I bought it based on a Steves Digicam Review. I read reviews here after I bought it and actually got concerned that I made a mistake. People talking about malfunctions and poor battery life? UH OH! Well, I have waited a couple of months and took alot of pictures before I wrote this and so far I have had no problems. The battery lasts quite a long time which is great. Even using the flash and the lcd for a long time didn't drain the battery too quickly at all. ebay has alternate Japanese batteries for much less than the Olympus battery so extra batteries are no problem. The button layout is great. One thing I noticed right away was the evolution of Olympus digital cameras. This camera is well thought out and I could see the details they improved upon over the years. I recommend this camera highly! I imagine that some of the cameras purchased toward the beginning of their manufacturing run, had a higher degree of faults. Usually these problems are worked out and it seems this could be the case with the 5060.","David Oliver's review is right on the mark - though I don't seem to have the oversharpness issue that his camera does.<br />I'd just like to add how easy it is to take manual control of the camera.  Just about all of the frequently used types of adjustment are easily accessed without delving into the menu system.  Once you take the time to understand this camera, you can easily make any shooting adjustment you wish. The design is very ergonomic.<br />I too have no complaints about the battery.  It lasts forever! And if you need to stretch the battery, you can easily work with the LCD off.  If your making an oncamera adjustment and need to see what's on the LCD, it switches the LCD on and then off again when you're finished.","The Olympus C-5060 is a truly great camera! About the only complaints I have are that when using the viewfinder what you see is not necessarily what you get, especially when close to the subject, and manual focus can be a little difficult. An SLR camera would take care of both of these problems, but I can't afford it. Also, the supplied 32-MB memory card is way too small. A 256 is about the right size; it will hold nearly 100 images in the better-quality jpeg format.<br />My main reasons for looking at this model were the lithium-ion battery and the ability to zoom out to a reasonably wide angle. There have been negative comments about the battery in other reviews; I can't understand why. With my old camera, I had become very tired of messing with piles of AA NiMH cells, charging one set while using another. The Olympus battery lasts for hours and hours on a charge. Just in case, I bought a second battery (Merkury Innovations, about $20, higher capacity than the original).<br />The physical design of the C-5060 is excellent. The controls are not tightly crowded, but are spread throughout the body. Buttons are different sizes and shapes, so using it in low-light situations is easy. The camera seems very rugged. I hope I never drop it, but I would be very surprised to find any damage if I did.<br />The CCD array is very quiet and has a noise-reduction feature for low-light situations. I have taken some night-sky pictures in which stars are points of light on a completely black background. It is also possible to take good flash photos at night. The camera lights the subject with an eerie red glow for a few seconds in order to get an accurate focus.<br />Using the camera in fully automatic mode generally produces good results. When you need to take control, you have many choices: aperture-priority, shutter-priority, or fully manual exposure, for instance. I don't think there's anything that can't be placed under the user's control. Unfortunately, that eliminates excuses for taking bad pictures.<br />The image quality is just about perfect. I was a little disturbed at first by ghostly outlines around tree branches and other objects. This turned out to be the sharpness setting. One would think that zero, the factory default setting, would be normal; minus numbers would produce soft focus and positive would sharpen the image. Not so! At zero, images are over-sharpened, producing unpleasant artifacts. I set it at -5, and if I feel the need to sharpen an image I use the unsharp-masking filter in Photoshop. Also keeping white balance always under manual control prevents color variations that sometimes occur with WB set to automatic.<br />All in all, I am very happy with my decision to buy this camera. It has generally surpassed my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something beyond point-and-shoot but not able to move up to an SLR with interchangeable lenses.","I was an early adopter of digital photography and thus had an older, 2MP Kodak camera.  I decided it was time for an upgrade and after an extensive search, I settled on the Olympus C-5060.  I couldn't be happier. This camera is loaded with features for the advanced photographer, but also is simple for my wife to use as a point and shoot camera.  I find the wide angle lens much more useful than a long zoom lens, since most of my photos are either indoor shots or scenic outdoor shots.  The wide lens captures so much more of the action.  And the camera is fast.  I have it set on the highest quality JPEG mode and it snaps away pictures very briskly.  The quality of the shots is breathtaking.  My only complaint is that like all cameras, in auto mode, you have to be careful when taking highly contrasting shots because the auto exposure will sometimes be fooled.  That being said, you simply have to change the exposure mode to focus on the subject (rather than the whole scene) and your exposure will turn out fine.<br />Overall, an excellent camera and a fine value.","Big, bulky and black; that's how I see the Olympus C-5060 Wide Zoom digital camera. This is no pocket sized camera, and it shouldn't be either since it is feature packed. With a 5.1 mega pixel capacity, 14x zoom, rotating view-finder and attachable wide conversion lens, this camera out perfoms many. Sounds great doesn't it, now let's see if it is.........","I've enjoyed using this camera. Controls, while complex, are not difficult to figure out. Performance (in outdoor field-trip conditions in the southern U.S.) is stellar. Battery life is phenomenal, even on an all-day shoot. Weight and size are comfortable for both large and small hands, and it seems sturdier than most cameras in this category.  In this part of the world, the fact that it is rated to operate in 90% humidity and 104 degrees Fahrenheit is definitely in its favor.  I appreciate the utility of multiple memory slots and a nifty button to switch between them as needed.  This is about as good as 5 pixels gets nowadays!","Before buying this camera I seriously considered the Sony DSCV1. My daughter has the Sony DSCP10, and it seemed a good idea to share accessories.  However, research made me decide that the Sony had serious problems--short battery use in the camera (with a battery that sometimes wouldn't hold too many recharges) and a viewscreen that sometimes conked out the minute the warranty (90 days for this part) was up.<br />I chose the Olympus C5060 because the lens is approximately equivalent to the Sony DSCV1 and most of the other high-end lenses out there for this type of camera.  Not as bright as the renowned C5050, but respectable.  I've used Olympus 35mm cameras, (and a very early digital) and I personally have liked them very much--they just feel right in my hands.  This particular model has a mostly-metal (lightweight magnesium) body, which feels quite sturdy.<br />Good stuff:<br />1.  Batteries are the same as for the digital SLR camera--good for a lot of shots (about 400-600 in \"normal\" conditions) between charges.<br />2.  You can personalize nearly all camera settings, from power-up to viewing, to shooting, to power-down.  \"My Mode\" allows you to save special photo settings that you use frequently--flip to it, and everything is the way you like it.  Manual, AP and SP modes, too. And the P setting allows point-and-shoot no-brain photography.<br />3.  While too chubby to be pocket-sized, the camera is compact and lightweight.<br />4.  Dual slots for media storage--Olympus proprietary and generic CF.  You can switch between them and use them both.<br />5.  Quick shutter response time--almost like a film camera!<br />6.  LCD viewscreen turns in against the camera back when not in use--nice protection feature.<br />Bad stuff:<br />1.  Long charge time (6 hours--i.e. overnight) for that long-life battery.  I can live with it...  A second battery runs about $100.00, by the way.  This is a heavy-duty item!<br />2.  Lens tube is plastic--probably identical in construction to all C series cameras.  (There's a metal rim so that plastic isn't exposed when the camera is closed--except for the lens cap.)<br />3.  No 5050 lens, alas... Will we ever see 1.8 again?<br />All in all, I'm glad I got this camera instead of my original choice.","Buy this camera and an external flash together and forget about 2.8-4.8F lense thing. Lots of other digicams with faster lenses still do not get you 1/30 shutter speed or better w/o flash (which is the minimum shutter speed for moving objects, such as dogs and babies) for most of indoor/night shooting conditions.<br />OK. Let's talk about external flashs. Olympus FL-40 and FL-50 are the best choices and they are loaded with features such as TTL auto and moterized zoom, but they are pretty overpriced. Promaster 5750DX and 5550DX are very nice alternatives. They are as powerful as FL-40 with full TTL compatible, but they do not have moterized zoom capability.<br />If you want to spend less than $100 for an external flash. Get a Sunpak383. It does not have TTL capability. That means you will need to calculate proper aperture/shutter speed every time you use it in your camera's manual mode. Not convenient, but still works.","I've had the C-5060 for about a month and I love it.  The quality of the photos is excellent.  I'm very happy with the built in flash which is MUCH more powerful than the one in my Kodak DC4800.  I also like the fact that I can control the intensity of the flash.<br />Yes it uses a proprietary battery, but I've taken hundreds of photos with flash on one charge.  I will admit that I've purchased two spare batteries just in case.....<br />The menus are not difficult to use, although there are so many features that I've only just scratched the surface on it's capabilities.  The User Manual on CD is 289 pages!  The camera has lots of \"one touch\" buttons that allow you to set features without needing to navigate through menus.<br />All told I'm very happy with this camera and don't think I'll be looking to buy a replacement for many years to come.","Let me say up front that I take a LOT of ambient light and/or super-wide angle photos, so I'm not ready to toss my 35mm gear yet.  I have thought that digital is for Pascal Programmers - every 'bug' is a 'feature.'  However, after owning several cheaper (2 Mpx) digital still cams, I finally felt this one was worth taking the plunge - and I'm not disappointed.<br />The camera is smaller than it looks in pictures, controls are well-placed, and it feels solid.  The menus are not totally intuitive, so you do have to look at the manual.  Picture quality is everything, and IMHO, the Oly 5060 is currently the best thing going.  Nice sharp images with good color and low noise.  Once set up, it comes closest to printable images right off the card (fiddling with Photoshop will always make them 'better' of course . . .)<br />Others have noted the 'slow' lens, so I bought the FL-20 flash, which is nice by any standard - smaller than a deck of cards and adequate for living-room-size venues.  Expensive - well over $100 - but the option is to get a cheap flash and fart around with 'manual' mode whenever you want to use it.  Really - do you want your $600 camera, or your $35 flash controlling the exposure?<br />I Also got the WCON-07C wide angle lens attachment, which turned out to be surprisingly huge - the objective is almost 4\" across and blocks the built-in flash (which is fairly worthless anyway).  I know true rectilinear was too much to expect - there is some barrel distortion with the built-in lens at widest, and the converter lens makes it a -lot- worse.  Still, a digital still cam with 99 degree angle of view is pretty cool, barrel distortion be damned.<br />Ok, to wind this up:<br />PROS:  1) Outstanding Picture Quality, at middle zoom ranges<br />2) Smaller than it looks in the ads, and easy to handle<br />3) Nice flash and wide / tele conversion lenses available.<br />4) Camera itself pretty reasonable on price / quality basis.<br />5) 32Mb storage - more than most - included (xD card).<br />6) Also takes Compact Flash cards.<br />CONS:  1) Distortion at widest angle<br />2) Must buy additional $35+ part to attach accessory lenses.<br />3) You need the nice little flash & its pretty expensive.<br />4) What? ANOTHER media card format..??<br />Overall, this is a nice, nice camera, subject to the tradeoffs inherent in all digital cameras.  Very Good image quality at mid-range focal lengths.  For impromptu images in tight locations, you need a wide angle - for less money, I could have gotten a fast <20mm lens for my 35mm system - but if you want wide and digital, you are going to find that life is full of little trade-offs, and this is the most bang for the buck right now.","Iv'e had this camera now for three months and I gotta say, this is one fine camera !! very user friendly, the battery seems to last forever, I cant say enough good things about this camera!!","I've had the 5060 about three weeks and have had great luck taking pictures.  Pictures are high quality,  good color and good exposure with just auto setting.<br />The menu was not that tough to get used to (bark is worse than the bite),  plus,  there are special short cut buttons for common features (like flash settings or ISO) where you press one button and the jog wheel gets you right to the feature setting you want.<br />I love the tilt LCD and the solid feel in my hand.  I sometimes forget to take the lens cover off,  but the cover design lets the cover pop-off with no problem. This is better than the 5050.<br />I think the wide angle improvement (27mm) made the lens ap. drop from 1.8 to 2.8,  but I'm not sure.  I would have preferred the 1.8,  but I love the 27 wide angle with no attachment necessary.  All the other cameras I looked at had a 2.8 also (including Nikon 5400, Canon G3 and G5).<br />The 5050's 1.8 lens was the exception.  Even with the 5060's  2.8 ap.,  I have taken great indoor shots.  Really!  I just printed a beautiful Christmas picture I took in front of the tree.  Yes,  I used wide angle rather than tele,  but aren't most indoor shots at wide angle anyway?  I try to zoom with my feet indoors to get the widest angle possible,  and the 5060 beats almost every other camera with wide angle (except the 5400),  but, the 5400 doesn't have a low light auto focus assist.  The 5060's low light auto assist seems to do the job!<br />BTW,  the movie feature works great,  too!  I did not buy the 5060 to take movies,  but it is easy to use and the movie quality is excellent,  even in dim light.  You can take as long a movie as you have room on your card, too.<br />I also love the included remote.  The remote is better than the timer,  but it has a timer, too.<br />I would buy the 5060 again,  but if I had a 5050 I would be happy too.  Happy New Year!","I have to agree with other comments about the darker lense on the new 5060. I have a couple of year old Olympus C2040, the second edition of Consumer Reports number one rated camera. It the first report, it took top honors over even the 5 megapixel cameras in printed picture results. The following year with the 2040 it was comparable to the 5s. It cost about the same as the 5050 and 5060's are now. But wow what a camera. Most of it is due in part to the super bright 1.8 lense. I think Olympus decided that people, when they are shopping for a camera, look at the obvious numbers. For example 4x sounds better than 3x in the zoom. The problem with larger zooms is that they require smaller apertures. Smaller aperture means a smaller hole the camera looks through, which equals less light, which equals, more flash, which means more bleached out, unnatural light, more battery being eaten up, and just simple less ability in varying conditions to get faster shutter speeds, which equals needing a tripod, or a fuzzy shot.<br />  When I bought my camera with the 1.8, the camera shop manager had one also as his personal camera. He showed me two of the same shot of a guitar sitting on a bed of leaves. One he took with the Olympus, the other with a Nikon, at twice the money. Both shots were very well defined on the subject, but the Olympus bright lense brought out the background a lot better. The definition was way better.<br />  Consumer reports rated the Olympus C5050 as their number two pick, and the Nikon came in first at a lot more money. I don't agree that the Nikon is better with 100 shots per battery charge instead of 400 with the Olympus, and a darker lense on the Nikon. I guess that is something for another review.<br />  Anyhow, I think the C-5060 has some nice features, but the bottom line is that we are taking a box, and opening and closing a lense, and recording what it sees. Ever try getting a clear view through a pin hole. You get the idea. I would pick up the 5050 if it were in the market, they are discounting them to make room for the 5060. Myself, I can't imagine getting better results than I am already getting with the 2040. I print out an 8 1/2\" x 11\" on glossy photo paper, and it looks indistinguishable from a 35mm photograph.<br />  It is ashame that we have to pick out, one of these, it would be nice if we could have one of them all. After all, the 5060 does have some nice features.","It's hailed as an upgrade of the 5050 - but Olympus slowed down the most important part of the camera... the lens.<br />The 5050 used to start at f1.8 and top out at f2.6. Now the 5060 starts at 2.8 and ends at f4.8 at 110mm.<br />This makes it virtually useless for existing-light photos indoors or in other dim light. It also makes it tough to get a (built-in) flash photo when you're zoomed-in, as the flash can't pump out enough light to illiuminate a Christmas play (for example) from the front row. The only way to get f2.8 is to stay on the wide-angle, which shows significant distortion, especially at the edges.<br />I say they blew it, if adding the wide angle was the reason they lost the fast lens speed. They should have just let users add their own wide-angle converters.<br />It's a looks and feels like a beautiful camera - but for me the low light performance is a real negative. If this is an important part of your photography, keep looking, or buy an add-on flash - and if you buy the 5060, get it from a vendor who will take it back."]},{"name":"Samsung Digimax U-CA 3","amazon_reviews":["I bought this camera originally in April '05.

It take very clear picture, It has night shot, and low light mode. You can't go wrong with this one!!!!","This camera was released in 2004 so it's been eclipsed several times over in terms of megapixels and video quality. You know what? As long as you're not using it for video, you wouldn't know it's 8 years old. It's fast to start up, locks focus quickly, and most importantly, produces superb image quality. I'm sure sony's sensor has something to do with it, but I think the secret sauce is mostly in the incredible Carl Zeiss lens. In terms of sharpness this camera rivals my Nikon D80 with 50mm 1.8. It's that sharp. As other people have noted the battery life is terrible. I pack an extra and forget it's a problem. Buy this camera, you won't be disappointed.","I bought this camera back in February 2004, when it first came out and have been using it ever since. Even though it's just 5 mpxl, it's got a Carl Zeiss lens and my photos look really good blown-up even to 12x18.  Yep!<br />I paid $422. online for it back then, and since I'm not happy with the current pocket models, I've purchased this model again,[at greatly reduced price here] because I wore my original out.<br />It's a little bulky, but it's got a HOT-SHOE [which No Current pocket-Model has] Manual settings (also no current pocket model has these), multi-Mpxl settings, Burst mode, AE Lock, mini-video mode, etc., etc...<br /><br />** HIGHY RECOMMEND","Most people don't realize it is not about pixel size!  It's about the quality of the Lens that give you that sharp clear picture.  The stop of this Zeiss lens goes down all the way to 2.8!  This is an indication of how good this Zeiss lens is.  In summary, this is an \"oldie but a goodie\" digital camera.  Yes the view finder is a little small but it does have an eye piece for focus which is a plus.  This 5MP is way under rated compared to days newer models.  The camera body is a rugged metal compared to the cheap plastic models today.  It's a little larger than the newer models, but again it's the picture it takes that counts.  This is a diamond in the rough.","This is my camera of choice and after losing mine on vacation I searched the Internet for a replacement. The LCD screen is small, true, but the Zeiss lens makes for very clear and crisp quality photographs. I would buy from this seller, Caffe Matteo, again and again for the accurate description of condition and the generously low price. I can't thank him enough, but here goes...Matteo, thank you for your generousity and ethics, you are an exceptional person.","This is BY FAR the best camera I've ever owned. I currently have a 5D and an S90, but I still use the DSC-V1. It just takes unique, outstanding pictures, with \"only\" 5 million pixels.<br />The new high end point and shoots are scams. 12 million pixels? Their pictures look like crap.<br />5 years ago I carried this camera around India for 2 months, and it withstood the nastiest conditions. Humidity, heat, shocks. And really, the pictures are, in my opinion, much better than most point and shoots nowadays.<br />If anything it's a little slow and bulky, but it was way ahead of its time and in many respects still is ahead of today's point and shoots. For what it's worth used, it will beat any recent camera in the same price range -hands down.<br /><br />And the infrared pictures function is beyond words. Why don't they still do it now?!<br /><br />Buy with no, no hesitation.","This camera is a high performer. Handles low light and night time situations very well with low noise and moderate to nice sharpness. The flash is adjustable, bright to low, so it doesn't look harsh. If you want to get serious there is a hot shoe so you can add your own flash, a rarity on automatics. I also appreciate the SLR functions which along with a tripod have taken my still life pictures to the next level. I can't emphasis enough how professional the photos look. I'm an art director and some of my pro photographers have started to comment. Take a look at some of my food photography: [...]<br /><br />My cons include: low battery life, really 30-40 minutes per battery. You will need to buy 3-4 batteries to carry with you, which may mean carrying a charger too, often weighing down otherwise light trips. Don't expect to travel where there is no electricity with this camera unless you have tons of batteries. A small display screen, and relatively bulky size compared to today's standards. The focus function on manual modes is hard to use because the screen is too small, but practice makes perfect. The resolution could be better, but works nonetheless. Regardless this camera is a great deal.","I need to edit my first review of this camera.  After owning a Sony DSC-S75 (which I love!), a Canon SD1200, a Sony DSC-H20, and a Canon E-1, I think this Sony V1 model is one of the best older digital cameras.  It has 5 megapixels, which is actually just the right size for most people who will be getting prints made.<br /><br />After testing and using some of the new models of digicams with high megapixels, I used to think that more megapixels meant better quality, but that's not true.  I have learned that higher MP on a smaller camera with a smaller sensor means more noise and graininess, there's just no way to get around it.<br /><br />The DSC-V1 does not have this problem.  I have taken photos with this camera that turned out crystal clear with little to no noise whatsoever, when viewed at 100% in Photoshop.  This camera does the best at photo quality that would make great prints.<br /><br />The only downside is that the videos are a little jerky, and the small batteries it comes with do not have LONG battery life.  Sometimes it does have a problem focusing on dark settings, sometimes darker photos might turn out a little blurry, but that could probably be fixed with tinkering with the manual settings like f-stop, etc. if I knew more about that kind of thing.  But for photos in any other setting, like daylight, people, indoors, etc. this camera can't be beat for sharp images and accurate color.","I have owned my DSC-V1 for at least 5 years and remembered paying over $500 for it new.<br />So why am I writing this review in 2008?  Well the camera has survived many world trips, drops and still works great but I convinced my wife that it was time for a new one.  So we started our research and bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5K since the reviews were awesome.<br />Then we took our first picture - we looked at each other and thought - our Sony takes better pictures.  But I really wanted to love and keep this Lumix with HD video and all, so I took a slew of pictures with both cameras and asked my wife to tell me which ones she preferred - 90% of the time the Sony photo was preferred.  So we visited her friend that owned the same Lumix (maybe we got a defective one) and compared more photos (even swapped memory cards) and again the photo quality from the Sony was better.<br />So how can all those reviewers get it wrong?  Because in most cases they never do a photo comparison but if you did, boy would you be confused - I think it is easier to just be happier in your bliss.<br />We also tried a Canon SD850 and go the same results.<br />So I still have my DSC-V1 because I feel like I would have to go with a DSLR to find better photo quality.  You can read all the reviews and specs until you eyes and head spin but in the end the proof is in the picture.<br />I rated the camera 4 stars but I agree with the reviewers about the speed and flash placement but if you want a camera that takes great quality photos, is durable and very affordable then look no further.","I do not agree with the negative comments regarding picture quality on the DSC-V1 as posted by other reviewers.  I do agree, however, with the comments about the flash recharge time and how lousy that performance is.  I got past that by purchasing an external flash and attaching it to the hot shoe on top of the camera (How many other digital cameras in the point and shoot class have a hot shoe????? Huge Plus for the DSC-V1 there).<br /><br />Now, this camera was affected by the CCD issue that affected many camera families (not just Sony) over that last few years.  Sony offered a free replacement of the CCD and I took advantage of it.  I knew I was going to be without the camera for a few weeks, while the repair and shipping took place.  But I had a vacation trip planned during that time, and I needed a camera.<br /><br />So I went out and bought a Sony DSC-T30 7.2 megapixel camera to use for the trip.  It seemed like a great camera, and it's actually pretty capable.  But the DSC-V1 just crushes it in photo quality.  The color shading on the V1, and the depth of field are so much better -- and that surprised me based on the 5 megapixel vs. 7.2 megapixel specs.  My wife still likes the T30 for the size, as it's case fits in her pocketbook nicely.  But I use the DSC-V1 almost exclusively.  The external flash took care of the ONLY negative I could come up with.  I feel I hit a home run with that purchase.","I own this camera for 3 years now and I found that this camera has some real cool features. Photos are really good. The only problem with the camera is flash. If you ask somebody to take the photos, you have to particularly tell them not to put their fingure on the flash. Orelse, flash does not popup. Also, you cannot take pictures continously on flash because it takes some time for recharge. This is annoying me allot and I'm thinking of buying a Nikon camera because of this damn flash thing.","I have owned Sony DSC-V1 for 3 years, and have overall been quite satisfied.  You just need to be aware of the limitations of this camera and try not to push it beyond of what it was designed to do.  Hey, it is a point and shooter, not an SLR.  Outside, in good lighting, DSC-V1 knows few rivals.  The pictures uniformly come out sharp and clean, with realistic colors.  F2.8 stop should theoretically blur some of the background, but I have never been able to achieve this effect.  Inside photography with DSC-V1 is possible provided:<br /><br />1) you do not come too close to the subject (the flash is somewhat overpowered) and<br /><br />2) you know how to utilize manual controls to your advantage.<br /><br />The quality of manufacturing is impeccable, as could be expected from Sony with a Zeiss lens.<br /><br />In 2006, there are better options on the market, but this one remains a solid choice, if you get a bargain price.","The V-1 is way over-rated.<br /><br />Slow shooter<br /><br />Flash recharge very slow.<br /><br />LCD very poor compated to some competition.<br /><br />Px OK but no better than the little Sony P150<br /><br />and not as consistant.<br /><br />And the 150 is MUCH faster in all ways with a terrific screen.<br /><br />Having owned it and tried and tried and tried it,<br /><br />I am selling it.<br /><br />A P150 or P200 & OTHERS, would be better cameraS. (Unless you want to fiddle. I dont.)<br /><br />ALSO, AND VERY IMPORTANT, I BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH TOO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT LENSES. THEY ARE NOT THE WHOLE STORY IN DIGITAL AS THE ARE IN FILM. IN FILM CAMERAS, SHOOTING THE SAME STOCK WITH TWO DIFFERENT LENSES WILL QUICKLY SHOW YOU ANY DIFFERENCES.<br /><br />WITH DIGITAL YOU DONT HAVE THE \"SAME FILM\" AND THE ELECTRONICS (CANON CALLS IT DIGICS?)CONVERTING THE IMAGING DEVICES INFORMATION INTO VIDEO IS EQUALY CRITICAL.<br /><br />NEVER BUY A DIGITAL CAMERA BY BEING SOLD ON ITS LENS. BUY IT<br /><br />ON COST, SIZE, WEIGHT, FEATURES AND.,.....TEST PICTURES COMPARING SIMILAR SHOTS, TAKEN AT THE SAME TIME AND LIGHT, WITH A SECOND OR 3RD CHOICE. IF YOU ARE A NON CRITICAL USER, FORGET IT ALL, BUY ANY GOOD BRAND. YOU'LL BE HAPPY.","This camera is perfect for taking pictures in nightclubs or at night.  The main reason for this is the \"Night framing\" ability that allows you to see an IR picture of what you are framing, then when you take the picture it shoots a normal flash (this is not the same as a night shot where the picture itself is a IR image, this just lets you aim.)  In addition, when you don't have the ability to see the LCD, you can use the AF laser emitter to target your images.  Either way, if you get a camera that does not have these features, its always guess work if you have the subject in frame if its dark.<br /><br />I will never buy another camera that does not have these features.  I cannot believe they are not standard on all digital cameras.<br /><br />As for red eye, I would not use the anti red eye feature on the camera.  It makes people squint in the follow flash.  Use either editing software or better yet, get the off camera flash and bracket accesory for natural red eye reduction and shadows.<br /><br />If you are thinking about this camera, accessories I would almost say MUST be budgeted are:  The leather flip case with strap (not the stupid pouch case), extra battery, 512mb memory stick and if you intend to use the 5mp that you are paying for and want to send your pix, you should ABSOLUTELY purchase a copy of Sharegear file sharing software (not a Sony product).  It is hands down the pest way to share video and pix.  It's also the cheapest ($20.00, one time), but that is just a bonus.  (you need dsl/cable to use it effectively).<br /><br />An almost must have accessory is the HVL-F32X smart flash and bracket.  It makes the camera a bit bulky, but dang those images look good.  An external flash off camera will always beat a built in flash for taking people pix.  I don't care how nice the camera is.<br /><br />Another word about the MP's. 5MP is enough.  Higher than that is great if you need to count the hairs on a fly, but the price in storage cost (MB per image) is probably not worth it.  If you don't even use the full MP, then why upgrade your camera?  That's just me.<br /><br />Hope this helps.  FYI I have had this camera for over a year and still think its better than all my friends newer ones.<br /><br />Brian","A couple of years ago this camera was a very good option given its 5MP, Carl Zeiss optics and nice zoom; however, nowadays it is just below most of the similar priced or similar featured cameras.  The 5MP are no longer a big differentiator and you can probably find better overall packages from Canon and Nikon today.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Carl Zeiss optics.<br /><br />- Night Shot capabilities.<br /><br />- Convienient size.<br /><br />- Infolithium battery tells you how much shooting time you have left.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Memory Stick Memory.  Expensive and slow.  You can sometimes pay a $40-$50 premium over similar sized Compact Flash or SD memories.<br /><br />- Slow shooter.  This is specially annoying if you are shooting kids.  By the time the shot is taken, your kid's smile or special gesture is likely to be gone.<br /><br />- Flash is too bright.  Causes flash-lighted shots to be too bright and in many cases to get red eyes.<br /><br />- Colors do not come as natural, especially in challenging light situations, such as late afternoons and some indoors situations.<br /><br />For similarly priced cameras and a good combination of manual/automatic features, I strongly prefer Canon's mid range and prosumer cameras ($400-800 price range).","Esta es una excelente cámara digital automática.<br /><br />1 La óptica de Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar Lens es excelente, inigualable, felicitaciones a Sony por la alianza.<br /><br />2 La resolución de 5 MP es más que suficiente para las fotos familiares.<br /><br />3 El tamaño es muy conveniente, ya que cabe en cualquier parte<br /><br />3 Los videos con sonido son espectaculares<br /><br />4 La función de visión nocturna y el holograma láser son sorprendentes para una cámara tan pequeña y de gran utilidad.<br /><br />5 Las baterías son muy duraderas<br /><br />6 Algunas críticas que no le quitan méritos: el encuadre a través del visor es ligeramente más pequeño que el real visto por la pantalla de la cámara; las fotografías son numeradas en orden sucesivo y no incluyen la fecha en la numeración.<br /><br />En pocas palabras: Excelente","Up to yesterday I was not happy with the battery in this camera. I bought it in December of 2003 and by July of 2004 the battery would not take a charge.  The second battery (at $70.00) charge up to a week before Christmas and then would not charge either. I read through the reviews yesterday looking for someone with a similar problem and found none.  This sent me scratching my head back to the owners manual. What I found was a message in very small print on page 10 about cleaning the DC plug on the charger or your battery won't charge. I did, and they did! I now own two very fully charged batteries. My review yesterday was 4 stars for the camera and the 5th deleated for the bad batteries. I would now like to make my review a very happy 5 stars.","I have not noticed an extra special feature on the descriptions. It's a real pro one. Buttons work randoom. Oh yes!, I am VERY satisfied with my camera. How couldn't I be ? Sony tested it ONE HUNDRET TIMES before I bought it.<br /><br />Honestly... the other features make an excellent camera.","This being my third digital camera I did a lot of research online to find the best camera I could afford. I was open to any manufacturer as long as the pictures were the best I could get in the \"pocket sized\" and full featured digital camera with at least 4 Megapixels. Basically I was pointed to the Sony DSC V1 by most camera review web sites. I bought it and have NOT been disappointed in the least. It takes great pictures and has many great features including the ability to shoot in the dark. Check out the manual and the sample pics. Then go and buy this camera. It's even discounted these days. You can't go wrong. This baby makes you look like you know what you're doing even when you don't.","I owned quite few Digital Cameras, but the Camera's I used most before this are Sony DSC-S85 and Canon A80. I damaged my S85 during rafting(still works with Power Supply, but not with battery) and gave Canon A80 to my brother. I bought DSC-V1 because of rave reviews on sites like dpreview, stevesdigicam. Especially for faster focus, so that I can catch my kid in action.<br /><br />So, I will try to compare against S85 and A80.<br /><br />Compared to S85 and A80:<br />1. Smaller than S85 but S85 has better grip, though I hate manual lens cover on S85. Bulkier than A80 and A80 has better grip.<br /><br />2. V1 focusses much faster than S85( 1.25 sec vs 0.6 sec) and still few outof focus because catching kids on camera is not that easy. A80 is faster than S85 but still slower than V1. But Autofocus is more accurate and far superior on A80 out of all three. It covers much area with 9 point AiAF. I tested all three at once, A80 locked focus when S85 and V1 failed. (esp plain background with little contrast). V1 With all that hitech Laser pattern only checks for the contrast in only little center area(though 5 point , but all around/near the center). It fails to focus even when there are object in sides of the frame(not in center). V1 Continous Auto Focus option helps little bit in catching those little kids though.<br /><br />3. Battery life is not even half of that S85, just one hour of typical usage, so extra battery with a charger is must. So extra money/luggage too. In the case of A80, You drop a set of Hi-Capacity Ni-MH AAs and forget it for few weeks.<br /><br />4. Main problem, Flash recoup is really slow, anywhere between 7 -10 seconds. if you choose power save mode, it is around 20 seconds by the time camera is ready for another shot, (as another review has mentioned it). So, any indoor flash photography is a problem especially with kids. It won't let you take photo until the flash it completely charged. If you press shutter button before it charges completely, you have to release, and do it again. With S85 it is less obvious, and A80 hardly noticable.<br /><br />5. Any indoor snaps without flash is ruledout, tried using higher  ISO400, max aperture, exposure compensation etc.  I think both S85 and A80 is little better, but not by much.<br /><br />6. picture quality is on par with S85 I think. I did not feel quality is any better than S85. I felt A80 is little better than these two, especially the JPEG compression.<br /><br />7. Though Canon A80 had rotating LCD, resolution and quality is not as good as S85 and V1.(this has been addressed in A95 with 1.8\" hi-res LCD).<br /><br />I have been experimenting since last 2 weeks, and above were the few things I observed.<br />I considered Canon A95, Sony DSC-W1 and this one(Canon G5 is little bulky and slow autofocus). I was getting all these around the same price, but I though V1 has 4x optical and Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lense( I think Vario-Sonnar is better than W1's Vario-Tessar) and W1 had many complaints about JPEG compression artifacts and not somany manual controls.<br /><br />So, Now, I am thinking should I go for Canon A95? or should  think of Casio EXILIM PRO EX-P600 which is veryfast and comes with Canon lense(this is $50 more).???<br /><br />I hope this one helps atleast some people to decide if this camera fits the bill for them.","This 5MP digital camera from Sony is easily the best out there. The time between clicking the button to the picture being taken is fast. The laser focus is very high quality and works wonderfully. The optical zoom is the higher than all other 5MP digital cameras in the category. The LCD screen is bright and high quality. When it comes to picture quality there are some differences. To be able to get good color balance, the picture mode has to be used, not the automatic. Pictures always turn out too much of a color(red, green, or blue) when automatic mode is used. The flash is slow to charge and creates a very off balance blue color, and the camera ceases to function while charging. The battery life is a little under what is expected while taking pictures. When flash is used, the battery power is greatly reduced.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Great zoom<br /><br />Small size<br /><br />High quality LCD screen<br /><br />Many different functions<br /><br />High quality video with sound<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Battery life<br /><br />Flash is off colored, slow charge, causes camera to not function while charging","This is one of the first cameras I have ever owned, I found that it is a little too advanced for the beginner photographer, but is a great bridge from beginner to a little more advanced.<br /><br />First off, just let me say how pleased I was with the photos this camera takes.  Great, great quality.  I was even more pleased when I took the photos onto the computer and I blew it up several sizes--the pictures stayed nice and clear.<br /><br />Using full automatic mode, I have read some customers complain about color saturation problems...it's almost as if they are talking about a different camera, because I am experienced no problems like that.  This camera makes very close to real life colors...and, if by some chance, you do happen to experience some sort of color saturation problems, there is a manual override that will work just nicely.<br /><br />The camera is very easy to handle all of the features.  It's not confusing at all, even for the more of a beginner photographer.<br /><br />There is only one thing that I am going to have to complain about concerning the camera functions...<br /><br />The shutter speed, I thought, was way too slow.  This camera seems so advanced that you would think that the shutter speed would be fairly fast...but it's not.  You have to hold down the shutter for a few moments before the picture finally takes.  And when it does take, it takes several seconds for the picture to save...<br /><br />I found one flaw in the camera design--the location of the flash.  It's on the top on the very left hand side (left hand side when the lens is point away from you).  It's a weird place because in order to hold the camera properly, you have to lay your finger right on top of the flash.  Which is just fine, when you are not using the flash, but when you do want to use the flash you will want to put your finger right on top of it, because it feels comfortable to do that.  However, you can't use the flash if you do that!  So, then you will probably result to putting your finger on top of the silver band around the lens, but that won't work either because your finger will be in way of the flash.<br /><br />The location of the flash is the only camera design defect that I have come across, though.  Otherwise, this is a nice camera that takes really splendid pictures.  I'd recommend this camera to the beginner photographer passing over to an intermediate photographer.  If you are looking for a compact camera, this is a pretty good compact camera.  It gets great pictures, and is pretty much compact.  Although, it is not completely portable, it's a little bigger than a lot of the compact cameras out there...but, you have to keep in mind the megapixels that you are getting.  5.0 megapixels, and lots of features.  A very nice camera, I am quite pleased with it.  Although, the flash defect has led me to looking for a new camera, because I just find that defect a little too hard to over-come.  Other than that, I enjoyed this camera.","I got my V1 about a months ago and I haven't stopped using it ever since. The pictures are very crisp. In the manual mode I can pretty much do anything. The joy of my life came when I froze a falling drop of water at a 1/2000sec stutter speed. I even got it a tele lens that increases the zoom to approx 7X. Some one who does a lot of wild life photography will certainly appreciate the Night shots.<br /><br />It has a wide array of features and they all add an extra special tag to this camera.","I love this camera.  I'm not going to get into a bunch of details, but I've taken photos aboard an aircraft carrier, inside museums, out in the swamps, at sunrise on the beach... never less than outstanding quality photographs - any bad photos were my fault entirely.  easy to use, fun to play with, small, lightweight... I love this camera.","WAY overrated - Amazon reviews have certainly sold out.  Nightshot is a joke - it's a black and white image - better off just using a flash.  The aperture only goes down to F2.8, so forget about serious low light color photography with this camera (Cannon C3040 - a four year old camera goes down to F1.8).  Like the other reviewer I had dead cells right out of the box (white and purple spots on the image).  Day time photos look really great but in any light other then bright sun light the photos will blur.  I wish the Carl Zeiss lens was on my old Cannon.  Bottom line is this is another Camera crated by marketers and not photographers.<br /><br /> Two because in perfect daylight conditions the Carl Zeiss lens really can produce a nice image.","I bought a Konica KD500Z in 2-02 for $500, used it for a year, lost it in the car for several months, bought a Sony DSC-V1 for $500 to replace it, found the Konica and let my niece use the Konica for her very active summer.<br /><br />The KD500Z is small and easy to carry. It takes a memory stick and an SD card. It can't take action shots and it can't take good photos in low light. The infrequently used options are not very easy to use. With that said, we took a lot of great photos with it (and a few short movies) and loved having it at hand. I use a card reader to download the photos to the computer. We don't miss the hassle of getting film developed, but sometimes we miss the crisp glossies.<br /><br />The Sony is a better at action shots and in low light, its controls are easier to understand and it takes better movies. But the Sony is a little bigger and takes only one memory stick. (With a 256 memory stick, the battery becomes the limiting factor. I have not run out of memory or battery in either camera. You do need to learn to pace your use. It helps to bring on vacation a laptop with a memory stick slot. During a vacation it would not be a bad idea to archive the downloaded photos to the web or to a CD or DVD. I had to reformat a hard drive after a recent vacation with my laptop.) The Sony battery does not seem to last as long as the Konica, but that is purely subjective. I like the Sony much better.<br /><br />I have not used all the capabilities of either camera. I got another 5MP camera only because I like being able to crop out a lot of the original photo and still have good resolution. (I do not otherwise need poster-size photos). I use Photoshop Elements to touch up every photo and am happy with it. We keep the photos in the \"My Pictures\" folder, a subfolder for every day, and set the screensaver in XP to \"My Pictures Slideshow\" at full screen and let it randomly select and display digital photos.<br /><br />After spending the summer with my niece in her tiny purse, the Konica would not start when the lens cover slid open and needed repairs (outsourced by a good local camera store) costing $172, which I am told is a flat rate for repairing digital cameras!","I bought this camera 6 months ago but I waited with writing this review until I have enough experience with it. All in all, it's the best choice available in its category, i.e. a compact camera for high-quality photography and unlimited video capability.<br /><br />Plus:<br /><br />-> Compactness. I used to have a non-digital photographic camera and a non-digital Sony video camera: the two together took the better part of a rucksack... The V1 fits into my breast pocket, and knows everything the old ones did.<br /><br />-> High-quality 5 megapixel photos with the Zeiss optics<br /><br />-> Unlimited 640x480 MPEG video capability, with surprisingly good low-light performance<br /><br />-> On-board cutting of videos possible (spares memory)<br /><br />-> Nightshot and nightframing (more of a toy, really)<br /><br />-> Fast USB connection<br /><br />Minus:<br /><br />-> LCD panel cannot be folded out. This is really annoying when shooting over a crowd or making self-portraits etc. Would not have been a big deal to add this feature.<br /><br />-> Sluggish and rather unstable autofocus, esp. in video mode. Often, when shooting at a subject with a distant wall in the background, the focus periodically oscillates between subject and background. This is surprising as Sony does not seem to have this problem with its analogous video cameras. The problem can be circumvented by manually setting the distance.<br /><br />-> Short battery life (ca. 90 min.), as noted by others.<br /><br />-> No zooming in/out while shooting video (presumably due to power supply constraints?)<br /><br />The other option would be to buy a dedicated digital videocam with still capability. That would do better in the video compartment, at the cost of still image quality. I vote for a dedicated still cam mainly because the quality of still images we make today seems good enough to stand the test of time, while the videos we make today (including professional ones) will only be good for a laugh 10-20 years from now. (640x480, really! And such a drastic quality loss in the compressed format...)","I had my older sonyFD88 stolen, and was devastated. After a few weeks of undecided confusion, I made a list of all that was important to me in a small camera. I think I made the right choice. The Sony V1 won out, hands down.<br /><br /> The clarity in the photos were stunning, and also one of the first thing I noticed was its indoor low light situations looking so great with little \"noise\" or blur.<br /><br /> I also love the ability to add lenses with the thread availability of the sony 4x lens. I have had so much fun with macro lenses and filters, and also with a threaded adaptor a tele lens, that doubles the 4x. That surpasses all the small 5 megapixel cameras.<br /><br /> This camera has allowed me to enhance my creative juices and rivals with some of the more expensive models, and yet I just throw it in my purse. People are really surprised when I tell them what camera I use, as the normal everyday photographer has no idea what potential they have in their hands when they buy this beauty. It has all the bells and whistles of cameras in the $1000 range, and I compare my photos every day with that scenerio. its a great camera with admirable learning curve as the more you use it. Great buys on it right now too...","I was looking for a compact camera with some manual features. I was considering Kodak LS753 / Sony P100 / Canon S410<br /><br />I found this Sony DSC-V1 open box and bought both DSC-V1 and Canon Powershot S410 from BESTBUY to compare the quality. (S400 seem to give better picture quality than S500 because the compactness for S500 5mp size)<br /><br />  Sony MemoryStick write speed is quite impressive and time between pictures is really small. However flash takes a while to get ready. In case of S410, the time to write to compactflash is too long and flash takes a while to get ready between pictures.<br /><br />  DSC-V1 pictures in low light are just amazing. Nightshot is just perfect. MPEG recording is really impressive. Carl Zeiss lens performs equally good as a Canon or Nikkor lense.<br /><br />  Manual features are great and LCD screen is reasonable size. Close focus pictures really come out well as compared to Canon. Battery life indicator is a plus over S410<br /><br />  Negative aspects are -<br />  - the cost of the camera and cost of the accessories being a Sony product.<br />  - the battery needs to be recharged pretty soon.","Excellent picture quality, I am no expert, yet I can easily see the diffence between my pictures and my friends' Canon and Kodak cameras. Size is pretty decent, I carry it everywhere in my pocket ( that's if I don't mind a bulky pocket though ). The night vision makes people go aaaawwww, but is not as practical as it initially sounds. I got a 256Mb pro stick for movies, and I am pretty happy with it. I could use a stronger optical zoom, and certainly a different location for the built-in flash.<br />Bottomline, I love my camera. It's helping me store my memories in better quality than ever.","I must begin by explaining that I got back into the digital camera market having to replace my Kodak DC240 which was purchased (and cutting edge with 2.0MP) in 2000.  The DC-240 finally went dead and I took it to Best Buy who, on their warranty, gave me the purchase value towards another camera, and thus the DSC-V1.  I have had the DSC-v1 for a little over a week now and have some interesting insights.  I generally look to Amazon for reviews and hope that you will find this one useful.  Please know that I am not a professional, and don't know a whole lot about photography (had a couple of classes in undergrad.)<br />To set this up, I have a friend who, upon hearing that I had this money to spend, recommended that I buy a digital SLR.  Sounded great, but I wanted something that would fit into my pocket.  I was looking at a Kodak with 10x zoom, but when I went to purchase it, I realized that it did not fit into my pocket.  I am more prone to grabbing my camera if I can just toss it in my pocket and take it to a party, to shoot art, or take pictures of my dog!  So now to my take.  Please note that these are not necessarily pro's or con's but observations.<br />-5MP WOW!  Image quality is great.  Coming from a 2MP, I am blown away!<br />-USB2.0 is fast and a definite sales point to this camera.  Make sure you have 2.0 on your computer if you are planning on shooting large images!<br />-The rechargeable battery is nice.  I don't know if I am sold on it yet though.  I am still pondering buying another battery should I be on vacation away from an outlet.<br />-People have complained about the controls, I have big hands and they are not a problem.<br />-I do have a problem holding the camera.  Go hold one before you buy it.  I like the camera and knew this going into it.  My left hand has the tendency to hold down or cover the flash, My right index finger has the tendency to cover the viewfinder.  I will learn to live with it...<br />- The camera has tons of features, which was one of my reasons for purchasing it.  They can get a little confusing though.<br />-If you are looking for a simple point and shoot, or a camera for your grandmother, this is not for her/you.<br />-The display, although small, is adequate and clear.<br />-I was looking into cameras with a greater zoom.  This 4x works great.<br />-The camera works quickly with 5MP images allowing you to quickly zoom in and out and scroll through them.  The LCD displays them clearly<br />-Menus are clear and precise.<br />-The ability to control aperture, shutter speed, and focus is great.  It gives me the ability to treat this camera like an SLR.<br />-The night framing/shot features are nice for shooting at night or indoors.  They allow you to frame a scene on the LCD before shooting the image.<br />-The hot-shoe is a nice feature as I can connect this camera either to a professional flash OR a professional lighting kit to allow me to shoot artwork.<br />All in all, this is a great camera.  If you are just looking for a point and shoot, this camera is not for you.  It is a lot of camera packed in a small package.  Be prepared to read the lengthy manual several times before getting SOME of the features down.  Also beneficial is some knowledge of basic photography, as terms such as metering, ISO, f-stop, and shutter speed are used often, and to fully understand the camera, working knowledge of these terms is necessity.","sony style<br />sony quality<br />sony durability<br />sony luxury<br />nothing beats this camera, except for a bigger zoom","The Sony DSC-V1 is my first digital camera and I absolutely love it.  I don't really have anything to compare it to, but I have so far only one serious complaint.  I bought a Sony camera in particular because I wanted to be able to take short mpeg movies as well as photos.  The Sony apparantly is the only camera that can take mpeg movies of longer than 3 minutes.  However, this camera only offers two movie sizes:  160 (for e-mailing), and 640 (full size).  The 160 size is so small it's hard to see -- when enlarged to 2x in Real Player, it gets very fuzzy.  The 640 is lovely to look at but the file size is HUGE.  I recorded for 16 minutes and was close to filling up a 512 mb memory stick!  That size just isn't practical for anything -- I can't take a movie small enough to e-mail, or even burn onto a CD -- I'd have to buy a DVD burner to burn even the shortest movie in this size.  What I really need is the 340 size movie, available in other cameras (my cousin's Canon has it).  That is my only really serious complaint with this camera.  The other things (position of the flash, hard to find good grip for left hand, expensive memory, and reds do seem to be a little bit extra-saturated) are workable.","Let's face it, THE reason to buy a digital camera is to get many features in a small package.  The V1 does just that and takes fantastic photos.  It's basically the F717 in a point-and-shoot package.<br />Pros:<br />4x Zoom lens<br />Compact size<br />Full manual controls<br />FASTEST auto focus available, even in low light (laser assisted)<br />FASTEST auto focus, even with NO light, very cool IR Nightshot<br />DATE label your prints....a rare feature on digicams (for some strange reason.)<br />Cons:<br />Relatively short battery life, you WILL need a backup<br /> SLOW recharge of flash, up to 10 second delay between flash photos<br />Should come with a separate charger instead of tie up the camera for charging duties<br />BAD location for a pop-up flash...akward to hold such a small camera if you can't put a finger on the top corner<br />Memory stick is still a more expensive storage medium, but at least the capacity has increased with MS Pro<br />I've owned a lot of digital cameras (10 of them, in fact), and the V1 is the very best.  My last was the Nikon 5700 which took very good photos but was hard to use and set up.  It also lacked some basic features such as a focus assist lamp (very frustrating.)  The Canon G5 is a worthy competitor, but it lacks the Sony's low light capability and costs a bit more.  Give the V1 a look before you buy.","Hi there<br />After my very bad experience with a casio camera, I bought this camera for just about 150 dollars more than the casio had cost me. this camera however, was about a thousand times better than the casio camera.<br /> the nightshot is excellent. movies are great. the carl zeiss lens is something I worship every time I use this wonder machine. the display is fantastic. the menu toggling is extremely fast. the pictures are high quality and taken with  5.0 pixels. the shutter is awesome (just the other day I took a picture of a friend playing baseball, and it showed the ball coming at her in the air without any trails. the picture was crystal clear and awesomely sharp). the camera is only about 700-800 dollars (plus or minus), but it is just like the professional journalist cameras (except its small enough to fit in your pocket). you can put on all these effects like negative, sepia, and solarization which are all really cool. the camera is very light and nice to carry around. and lastly, all my friends remark on the cool design. this camera is really worth getting. I have not at all been disappointed.<br />the camera is all sony's years of expertese put into something barely 9cm big.<br />If you want a camera which is affordable, takes extremely  high-definition pictures, has amazing mindblowing features, and can fit into your pocket.... then the sony dsc-v1 is what you have always wanted.<br />I promise you its the best on the market, and will be for some years to come.<br />Good luck to you on your purchase.<br />joel rosen","I don't bring this camera with me everyday, it's a bit bulky for a carry with me everyday camera.  But I love it, the quality the build, the exterior design.  I especially love the nightframing and the 4x zoom with good sharp image. I have my Minolta xt with me everyday but it works poorly on low light condition. V1 has a very good autofocusing, a bit slow in recharging the flash thou.<br />You won't regret having this camera around.  This one goes with me on travels.","This Camera is excellent. It has lots of advantages over other cameras.<br />I also own a Sony DSC S-85, and a Canon S-400.<br />Both of them excellent Cameras too, but with a different consumer target.<br />Sony took some of the best features from the S-85, which is a \"Prosumer\" camera, and made it much smaller, like a compact \"point and shoot\" camera.<br />These characteristics give several advantages to the DSC-V1.<br />If you are the average photographer, you will probably just use the camera to point, shoot, and enjoy! And of course, you will want it to be handy and small.<br />The DSC V1 will do that without a problem, using the Automatic setting, but you will have to learn some basics, (as with all other cameras). If you are learning photography, you are an amateur, or a Pro photographer that wants an small and excellent camera for hanging around, you will truly enjoy the Manual settings, as you can learn and experiment playing with the aperture, the speed of the shutter, the EV, the scenes, the effects, etc.<br />Another great thing is that is not an expensive camera. Comparing the camera with other 5MP cameras, for example, the also beautiful (point and shoot only), Canon S-500, we will see that the prices of both cameras are almost the same. The Canon S-500 is smaller, takes beautiful pictures, and, of course, is a Canon. But the DSC-V1 has a lot of more features, and the best: it offers the manual modes...<br />Fortunately, there is a way to be better camera shoppers, and to learn everything about some of the best selling cameras in the market: [...] is an excellent internet site, that offers professional reviews for lots of cameras, comparisons, lessons, etc. and features of most of the cameras from the top brands.<br />Also, this site contains an excellent review about the Sony DSC-V1, in: [...]<br />As the great photographer Phil Askey tells us in his review, there's an ugly error in the DSC-V1: The Automatic White Balance. For some strange reason Sony simply didn't put the correct temperature settings in the sensor. So, either if you are a \"point and shoot photographer\", or an amateur, you will have to learn and dominate the use of the Manual White Balance feature. No questions asked. That's why I'm giving this camera four stars, even though I love it and I would give it 6 if I could and if the White Balance was at least Average.<br />Good luck on your search","This camera takes THE BEST pictures for a crisp and colorful picture.  I would recommend this camera over ANY camera on the market.  This works well with the Sony Digital Photo Printer DPP-EX7.  Prints great Pictures.","I had a hard time deciding between this camera and the new Canon Digital Elph 500<br />I am upgrading from 2 previous digital elphs<br />Pros:<br />Excellent digital photos (better than my last Elph S400)<br />Excellent night shots<br />More features for advanced photographers<br />Faster shutter speeds<br />Better flash<br />Cons:<br />Price for media very expensive<br />No battery recharger included (have to charge inside camera or buy a separate charger)<br />Larger size<br />Flash in awkward place<br />Software very bad....Canon's software better","Before you buy DSC-V1, here are some tips about it:<br />The camera is excellent, considering image quality and features. You can manually set the functions or set the automatic mode (helps beginners but provide features for more advanced photographers - get the manual in Sony Website). The image is better than P92, for V1 has bigger Carl Zeiss lens. P92 is very very easy to use, but V1 has a range of features not available in P92.<br />1) it requires extra memory stick (which, as you might now is more expensive than compact flash). 256Mb is recommended. 128Mb provides 80 photos full-quality. (any 5.0 Camera, whatever the brand, needs extra memory though.)<br />2) Spare battery would be useful. The NP-FC11 lasts about 80 minutes and take 2hrs to recharge.<br />3) Unlike old Sony cameras, you can take pictures faster (whether P32, P92 or V1), but when using V1 with flash, you need to wait few seconds to energy recharge (a bad thing if you need the flash and don't want to miss a thing) - but it's like 3 seconds.<br />4) A very nice feature is the nightframing and nightshots - it has infrared visor for very dark places.<br />Comparing to P92, the improvements are amazing. I used them both and found P92 easy to use, but V1 has many useful features, better for those who want to make creative or art photos.","This is an excellent product with countless advantages.  The picture quality is excellent -- ask anyone who is knowledgeable about optics and they will drool over the Zeiss lens.  Like many Sony products, the camera has a tremendous number of fancy features, is easy and intuitive to use and has a beautiful feel and appearance.  Sony is a quality manufacturer and their products instill confidence.  The manual, occasionally a Sony weakness, is quite helpful.  In addition, the price has come down considerably and it is actually a very good value at this time.<br />There are a few disadvantages with the camera -- it's still superior to competitive products overall but these are things you should be aware of.  Like most digital cameras in this megapixel range, the photos are not a perfect match to the 4x6 format and need cropping (I have heard that a higher megapixel camera may solve this problem if you don't have time for this \"hobby\").  The included Memory Stick is insufficient.  Battery life is short.  The movies this camera makes are grainy with a jittery auto focus but most people are aware that it doesn't make sense to rely on one device for both needs (see Sony's HC-40 for a great camcorder).<br />In the final analysis, another home run by Sony.","I wanted a camera small enough to put in my pocket for snap-shots of my kids while on the go, but I also wanted some big camera features to be creative with. This Sony is quite compact, yet I love it's big camera abilities, to numerous to mention here. The Carl Zeiss lens adds an incredible sharpness to every picture. The list of accessories for this model is outstanding and will allow creative expansion for the amateur and the professional alike. However, the picture managing software, 'Image Mixer', included with the camera from Sony is an absolute nightmare. I figured out most of the features of the camera before the image program, and now I just use Picasa.","I bought the sony dscv1 about 3 weeks ago and I've already taken more than 600 photos with it. I have to say it is almost perfect... It's difficult to believe how this tiny little camera take superb photos with extremely true-live colors. This camera can work in fully automatic mode; scene mode where you tell the camera if you are shooting a beach, lake, landscape, snow scene, night scene or portrait night scene. If you want to you can work fully manual changing the aperture from f2.8 to f8.0, shutter speed from 30 sec to 1/1000 sec, and ISO (the image sensor's sensitivity to light) from ISO100 to ISO800. Other modes like shutter speed or aperture priority are available too. The nightframing function let you see through the LCD screen in completly darkness, so you see all with a green tone but when you press the shutter the flash pop up and record the image with natural color... if you want to you can  also record images without the flash using the nightshot function.<br />The hologram AF works pretty well, you just press the shutter half-way down and the camera produces a lasser pattern that \"paint\" the subject helping the camera's foccusing system and showing you what portion of the scene are you pointing.<br />Another great function is the live histogram, this is a graphic where the camera tells you if the picture you're about to take will be under-exposed or over-exposed, so this is continiously changing as you focus on a different subject or as you change the shutter speed or aperture.<br />You can get interesting effects changing the white balance from the factory pressets light sources or telling the camera what is white just framing a white subject under the lighting condition you are working.<br />Other functions include:<br />- changing the focus operation from single focusing (you press the shutter halfway down to focus) to monigoring aF (you don't have to press the shutter to focus) and continuos focusing.<br />- AE lock function. To measure the exposure of any portion of the image so after that you can recompose the picture and shoot with the exposure fixed to that especific portion of the picture.<br />- You can record tv size video only limited by the memory stick capacity.<br />- Can record pictures with sound. (Pretty cool function)<br />- The camera can take 16 pictures in succesion each time you press the shutter with the multiburst function or If you want to you can record 3 pictures continuosly with the burst 3 function. You can also make animated gif putting together consective images.<br />- You can record your images in tiff mode or as a jpg file. Tiff images are not compressed so the image quality does not deteriorate.<br />The only bad thing about this camera is the 32 mb that come with it, since each 5 MP picture in fine quality will be at least 2.0 MB, so you will have to purchase another memory stick. I recommend the sony 128x2 (256 total)<br />Well this is a great camera and it can work as a point and shoot camera, as a fully manual camera or even as a video camera.<br />Thanks SONY!!","When you really compare those pics that were taken with different brands of 5 MP DCs do you realize how perfect the Sony dsc-v1 machine is. But be careful of its white balance adjust, use it wisely.","Recièn he cambiado mi Sony dsc-p10 por la Sony dsc-v1. Que buena decisión!!. La Sony dsc-p10 es una muy buena cámara e incluso mas pequeña y delgada que la dsc-v1, pero que en situaciones de poca luz se comporta muy mal. La dsc-v1 tiene varias característica que aventajan a la dsc-p10. Una de ellas es que la dsc-v1 posee las funciones Nightshot y Nightframing. Nightshot te permite disparar a objetos en lugares oscuros como escenas al aire libre por la noche o a animales o plantas en situaciones nocturnos e inclusive en total obscuridad. La función Nightframing te permite enfocar un objeto en la noche y grabarla con sus colores naturales usando el flash. La calidad de las imágenes es superior a la dsc-p10, èsto gracias a su lente Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar. Otra cualidad que hace de la dsc-v1 muy superior a la dsc-p10 es que tu puedes elegir el mètodo de disparo entre: 1)modo automático (el enfoque, la exposición y el balance de blancos son automáticamente ajustados lo que te permite una facilidad de disparo...èsta es la única función que posee la dsc-p10) 2) disparo automático programado (tu puedes cambiar la combinación del valor F y la velocidad de disparo) 3)prioridad de velocidad de disparo (esta función te permite disparar un objeto en movimiento rápido congelándolo) 4) modo de prioridad de apertura (èsta función te permite cambiar la profundidad del enfoque brindándote ambos, el objeto y el fondo dentro del enfoque o disparar a un objeto con un fondo borroso. y 4) modo de exposición manual (tu puedes manualmente ajustar la velocidad del disparador y los valores de apertura lo que te permite disparar en situaciones de acuerdo a tus propósitos). Lo que yo podría decir en contra de èsta extraordinaria cámara es una falla de diseño al colocar el flash (que salta) en el lado donde normalmente tu colocas tu dedo izquierdo para disparar pero creo que nada es perfecto y con el tiempo aprendes a agarrarla correctamente. Otras cualidades en contra y que muchos ya han mencionado (propias de todas las cámaras Sony) son: 1)la poca duración de la batería (que se compensa adquiriendo una de repuesto) y los 32MB del memory stick que es una broma y que tambièn se compensa adquiriendo uno de 128MB ó de 256MB. Espero sea de ayuda. (En español es mejor!!).","I bought this camera about a month ago and have enjoyed the freedom of having a digital camera immensely.  I spent a significant time comparing different cameras and the reviews written on amazon convinced me that this was the camera for me.  I really appreciate all those who wrote in because otherwise I probably would have bought the olympus with a 10x zoom.  After comparing them and reading the reviews I think hands I got the camera that fits my needs better.<br />Thanks for your help in picking a great camera.","I purchased this camera to eliminate the use of my film camera.  It was worth it.  The picture quality is just as good if not better than my Canon Elph APS camera.  If you are a point and shot photographer use the Auto mode.  If you like more control over your shots, you can do that also.  My only complaint is the 32 MB card that comes with it.  Get a larger memory stick.","I went shop to buy Canon G5 and the shop keeper showed me this camera. And i have taken Sony-DSC-V1 to my home. I have used Canon G2 which was also very Good, but the sony model is more handy and ith less weight. I feel it is superb.","I bought this camera to replace the Sony s85 that I lost a few months ago (which i loved). V1 has great construction, design, button are better functioning but i have to say that the flash is oddly placed. The flash pops up even in a well lit room and pushing down the flash is another unnecessary hassle.  I expected the picture quality to be better than the S85 but it is not the case. I wouldve choosen the Canon G5 but I have many memory sticks and didnt wanna switch to CF. I regret getting the V1 slightly.","I bought this camera to replace a 4-year old 1.6MP Sony MAVICA after spending the last two months doing research and reading a lot of reviews.  Every camera I looked at had its Pros and Cons.  I just had to decide which ones were going to have an affect on my final decision.  I ultimately went with this camera, because it was small, easy to configure and most importantly met my needs.  Don't expect to find a camera that doesn't have any cons.  I fell in love with it as soon as I took it out of the box.  I spent the first couple days reading and re-reading the 130-page manual to make sure I understood the different capabilities.  You have to do this if you expect to get the max benefits of this camera.  Even now I find myself having to regularly refer to the manual for help, because I'm not a professional photographer.  This is by no means an easy camera to master in one hour.  Yes, you can point and shoot, but you still have to read the manual and make some initial setup changes. This camera is a big improvement over my old one when it comes to image quality (no suprize here) and overall capabilities. The first thing I did was change the image resolution from 5 to 3.1 MP, because the 32mb memory stick that comes with the camera only allows to you shoot about 12 images (using fine print) and 23 images (using standard print).  You can always set the image size to VGA and can take up to 196 pictures.  I say if you're spending this kind of money, don't set it to VGA, because you pictures will be ok (as with other cameras) at best.  The higher resolution will allow you to print some great pictures on photo paper if you have a good hi-res printer.  I used an Epson Stylus Photo 825 ($100) and the results were great--much better than those you get in the mall. I went ahead and bought two 128mb memory sticks to cover me. The other thing I did was disable some of the camera's sound features (shutter and power-on sound) so I could save on battery power.  I would recommend buying a second battery through the internet since it's cheaper than getting them through Sony.  I also bought a separate battery charger so I wouldn't have to use the camera as a regular battery charger.  The last thing I would want to do is bake the components in the camera just to charge one battery or for that matter a backup. Excessive heat wears down electronic components over time. After I setup the camera, I took several pictures (using the flash) to see how if performed against my 1.6 MP.  The first thing I noticed is that the camera did a great job of regulating the intensity of the flash to make sure it wasn't too bright.  The camera allows you to manually set (3 levels) the intensity of the flash for any occasion if you decide you want to go manual. I connected the camera to my TV to view the pictures and they had extremely rich colors.  I tried doing some limited image editing like changing picture size, rotate pictures, etc.  You can view multiple pictures on the camera's small LCD screen which is very nice. Everything worked well.  I haven't tried the other features yet. A lot of technology went into this little camera so you'll have to be patient.  I just scratched the surface.  It makes no sense paying a lot of money for this camera if you don't intend to fully utilize its capabilities (read the manual). This camera is small in size so you'll have to get used to it and handle it with care.  You can purchase optional wide angle/zoom conversion lenses, but using them disables certain features of this camera camera.  I guess it's because the camera lense expands and retracts and it would bump up against the conversion lense.  The conversion lense also blocks some of the light intensity of your built-in flash.  Sony recommends using an external flash when using a conversion lense.  That means a lot of extra $$$.  Don't waste your money on the optional starter kit for this camera. The camera case is ok for the camera, but the memory stick case and spare battery will not fit well.  It's too tight for my taste. That last thing you want to do is damage the camera's protective lense cover.  I bought a samsonite camera case that is a little bigger it stores my camera memory stick case and spare battery.  You can go bigger if you choose to bring along your AV connecting cable, AC adapter and USB cable.  Overall, this is a great camera. I looking forward learning its many capabilites and taking it with me on my trips.","I had just sold my Hasselblad that I had had for 28 years and I wanted a camera that would fill the gap. I won an ebay auction for the sony Dscv1 and never received it, so I was ready to get a nikon or canon.  I researched them all (the sony V1, the nikon 5400 and the nikon 5700 and to a lesser extent the canon G5 and rebel).  My biggest concern was the ergonomics of the sony V1, having the flash placed where it was.  I really wanted the small sized camera so that placed sony first. I have small hands so I thought I could adapt to the flash on the left side.  I also liked the Zeiss optics which came with the V1.  The nikons are sexier with the black color and fit well in my hand, but there were so many good features to the V1...night focus, in camera battery charging, a nice sized lens (136mm), no shutter lag, bright LCD etc.  that I returned to the sony and bought it.  Besides, I didn't want another large camera. I am very happy with the V1's small size and Zeiss optics and I have found the V1 easier to handle than the 5400 to handle. I have bought two extra batteries and the difference between 2 and 5 megapixels is fantastic!","i've been shopping around for a digital camera for a long time. i was debating from a canon and a nikon.  THANK GOD THAT I GOT A SONY.  i love the night shots, (dont even need a flash for this baby).  i'm not the professional photo taker but this baby has it all plus more.  i cant say anything bad about this product.  i'm loving life.  Plus.  get the sony printer.  it prints out amazing pictures.  (digital photo printer by sony $199.99)  this is also an \"oh my god product\"<br />thank you sony","This camera takes fantastic pictures--partly due to the Carl Zeiss lens.  The colors are acurate, the autofocus is quick, and there is essentially no shutter lag.  Have had no problems with it so far.  Battery life is average only.  Rec second one \"just in case\".  There is indeed a delete all function (delete folder), so ignore that comment from someone else below...it's in the manual...  THe LCD is somewhat small, but sharp and clear--even outside.  You can easily magnify your pictures in review mode if needed.  Rec using adobe photo album and element 2 for your pictures, much better than camera's software.  Make sure you compare prices before buying it (ie, epinons.com)","This thing is the best. ease of use and compatibility to a Mac. The BEST!!!!","if you are a casual photo enthusiast, this is the camera you want! I bought this camera in Dec 2003 after much research, and after buying (and returning) the Sony DSC-P10.  This V1 model has everything you want- fully manual exposure control (which the P10 does NOT have), compact size, a great Carl Zeiss lens, and 5MP resolution.  I had been an Olympus digital camera user for the past 3 years, and loved the image quality... I had some concerns about the lens quality of the Sony cams, but after some tests and comparisons, I am more than pleased with the V1.  And at half the size and more than twice the resolution, this is a killer camera at a great price!","Going from 35mm Nikons to digital cameras is a real culture shock, some change can be good. We wanted a compact digital that could perform like a 35mm Nikon, we compared all the 5 mega pixel cameras and the DSC-V1 won hands down. The Zeiss lens system (zero plastic elements), \"night shot\" and the overall size all are major advantages but the suberb picture quality and<br />the myriad of print options make this camera a true joy to use. The focusing system on the camera is the most sensitive available and the manual modes give you total control of any shooting environment.<br /> Add a DDP-5EX printer and you have camera to print in less than 2 minutes and you don't need a computer! One down note buy an extra battery, they last about 80 minutes in the DSC-V1.<br /> This is one investment with great returns, enjoy!","Never mind the picture quality, this little camera works !  I toothed on an Olympus D4040 and i was never able to penetrate its menu system, so i used it at only the most rudimentary level.<br />The sony and i hit it off immediately. Not to say i understand them all, but after two days i can waltz through every feature. What i particularly like about the Sony is:<br />1. the shutter button is always where i expect it -no more frantic groping<br />2. sony has reached a nice balance between burying a feature in a menu and providing it a button on the back.<br />3.The electronic lens cap...love this...no more fumbling with a lens cap that, at altitude and cold, sometimes requires more than the available dexterity. I can fully  operate this camera with gloves.<br />4.the LCD is so sharp that i can photograph a topo map [@1.2 M ] before a hike, and, on the mountain,  zoom and move around on the map better than the original. Very cool !!<br />5. the 40 second audio recording feature is handy to record details of a shot.<br />6. the 10 minutes of video [on a 256 M card] is useful.<br />What i dislike about the camera is the pathetically small battery...the lithium provided weighs less than half an AA ...my Olympus would run for months on 4.  Understandably, the Sony is lucky to make it through a day on one.<br />The flash is another minor problem...it wants to come up under your left finger, but since i rarely use a flash...i don't care.","Never mind the picture quality, this little camera works !

It's my first digital camera and the instant gratification of seeing your picture on the LCD is great.<br />Recently I took the camera on holiday to Australia.  Unfortunately while changing hotels, I misplaced my 128mb stick I had bought seperately.  I went into panic mode for a while and then decided to buy another one at a duty free shop in the city.  I bought a Sony 256mb memory stick pro.<br />Thirty eight photos later, I took it to a shop for printing and they said it had a stratch on it.  I took it to another shop for a second opinion and they said the same thing.  I went into panic mode again.  As a last ditch effort, I took the memory stick back to the guy I bought it off, battered my eye lids and told him how distressed I was about losing all my precious holiday shots, that I couldn't recover because we'd been on a big tour north.<br />He plugged in a Sony portable printer in the shop, and luckily the machine was able to read the memory stick.  38 FREE photos later, I was a happy customer.  The guy even refunded my money for the stick which was faulty as far as I was concerned.  That day I also found my missing 128mb stick. It was a case of rent-a-stick when I needed it.<br />I was absolutely blown away by the quality of the 5mp photos combined with the Sony portable printer.  People in the shop crowded around to see my photos being printed.  They are amazing.  The guy took one extra print to go on display in the shop to show people what the Sony DSCV1 and the printer combined are capable of.<br />The pop up flash took some getting used to, and my kids think the hologram red laser thingy is cool.  They think I'm zapping them.<br />What I like most about the camera is that it can be used as a point and shoot type camera for those that don't know much about photography, yet has aperature and shutter features so you can do the 'blurry background and streaky waterfall shots'. It's got a lot of room to grow into it.<br />I like the fact that it can accomodate such features as a tripod, tele photo lenses, extra flashes, polarizing lens etc,  which you can buy later on when you get more experienced.<br />I shopped around heaps on the net and in shops before I bought, but really fell in love with the size and cuteness of the camera, combined with it's smart technology and the fact that the battery can be recharged in the camera.  I didn't want to have seperate batteries that you take out, and my husband would no doubt borrow for his remote control yachts.<br />Putting your pictures on tv is easy and I also run them through the video and take a slide show of them on video as a backup.<br />I'm extemely happy with my new camera and see it will last me for many years technology wise.<br />By the way, I now have a little box that I put my spare memory stick in that is clearly labelled, and too big to get sucked up in the vaccum cleaner.  No more leaving it on the bed while reviewing the contents of my sticks, where it might get forgotton.","This is my  5th digital camera. I bought it because my Sony DSC-P9 never fullfill my need for a small camera that could produce profsional quality pictures. This Sony DSC-V1 is all I ever want from a digital camera. It small enough to carry around and the pictures quality it produce is second to none. I love it.","This camera was a great investment that enabled me to take the thousands of pictures that I did on my European tour.  The lens is incredible, the picture quality is phenominal, and it comes with tons of great features.  (helpful hint: you can save upwards of $150 by purchasing this camera through other online sources)","I invested 3 months of researching and reading reviews on the internet about digital cameras. The Sony DSC-V1 rocks. I have used it for 3 days and I am very impressed with the photos and the ease of use. Sony was the 1'st company to make digital cameras but Canon had been doing a better job until now. The Sony model is clearly a winner over the Canon G5, S45, S50 models. I personally compared the G5 and the DSC-V1 in low light conditions and inside the house and the Sony is clearly a superior camera. It is true that Canon G5 can sometimes produce better pictures in good light conditions but if I can not shoot good pictures in all light conditions then the camera is not a good choice!, the Sony V1 is highly recommended","This is my first digital camera.  The pictures look fantastic.<br />Right from the box I was taking better pictures than I have<br />ever taken with any camera.<br />WORTH EVERY PENNY !!","I have probably beaten everyone out there on the amount of time I spent researching and shopping for this camera. I was going for the Sony P10, but decided I wanted more than just a point-and-shoot camera. The V1 is it. For the price you get so much that I am not even sure when I'll get around to testing everything out. I am particularly excited about the nightshot feature which takes the greatest photos in low-lighted or even pitchblack surroundings. My only complaints, and I have read other reviews complaining about the same things, are that the battery life really is too short and you definitely need to get another memory stick (I bought a 256MB memory stick pro). Other than that, purchasing this camera will bring you hours of pleasure at a time and will capture those unforgettable moments (in still or in movie) as life-like as you would like to remember them. Buy it now!","I chose this camera because it is the best value for money in its class (on average, about $ 150-200 cheaper than the Canon Powershot G5 or the Nikon Coolpix 5400).<br />The DSC-V1 simply blows the competition away:<br />* design & weight--the V1 is less than 300 grams (10.3 oz exactly), whereas both the G5 and the 5400 are over 350 grams (17.2 and 13.4 oz, respectively);<br />* features--the V1 has the nightshot, which is astounding; the laser-focus, which is outstanding; and an incredible array of customization and adjustment possibilities (LCD brightness, zoom orientation, to mention few).<br />The camera also looks like a work of art and fits comfortably in your hand. The pop-up flash can startle you at first, however you get used to it pretty quickly and learn not to put your fingers there.<br />Still not convinced? Go to dpreview.com; enjoy the V1's amazing sample pictures; and, see for yourself the \"highly recommended\" rating given to the V1 by digital camera professionals.","Excellent camera with great quality in a compact package.  Good ergo.  Clear view screen.  Excellent in-doors with organic flash and even better with added external flash (hot shoe).  Great color outside under sunny through overcast conditions.  Only weakness is a limited optical zoom.  But, on balance, exceptional set of capabilities for the size and weight.  Overall high resolution, great options, external flash, multi-ISO, many white balance settings, nice preset and manual  functions, good AF, small size, infrared for night shooting, MPEG mode ... with Sony quality.  Very pleased overall.","I shopped around for a month.  Comparing every camera that was 3-5 megapixels and under $800.  Long story short, the Sony DSCV1 had the best overall features.  The best part was the VGA movies with sound, only limited to the memory stick volume.  I was able to replace my older Sony Mavica and my broken video camera with one small package.  The pictures are fantastic (only Canon was better), night shots were great (even has nightvision) and the movies were good quality.  The camera is a little pricier than some others, but you get what you pay for, and my pictures prove it.","I have owned this camera for over a week and simply am loving it.<br />Before buying it, I did some comparison and research. While Canon's cameras are very close in quality and also are packed with features, with the current $75 promotion, plus a very likely chance that you already own some memory sticks for your other Sony products, DSC-V1's great quality, small size but an abundance of features, you can't go wrong.","My third digital camera: Olympus 1.3MP, Canon 2.1MP and now this.  I considered the Canon S50 & the 5MP Pentax. I choose this one after reading the reviews on dpreview and checking with my local Sony Shop that they would repair it if it went wrong (the Olympus & Canon have both needed repair - within 12 months of purchase - & both manufacturers have fixed them for free and without hassle (I'm now much more confident buying from the U.S. into the U.K.).<br />The camera is better than expected as I don't find the balance as difficult as the reviews say, nor do I have a problem with the flip up flash - it becomes second nature after a while (I've had the camera 2 months).  The camera is a little bit bulky and I can't carry it in my shirt pocket but a belt case has solved that problem.  I've found a second battery useful, although I can only recharge via the camera as I have not yet got a separate charger.  Have not found this an issue and I have been out all day with the camera.<br />The video option is great. I've never really taken to video but this camera (and my three-year-old) might just convert me. It is easy to use.  You can't zoom when videoing nor does the flash work but the quality is acceptable and sound much better than I thought it could be.<br />Recycling to take another picture can take a time but it seems that the flash is the slow-coach and pushing it down allows the camera to come back quicker whilst the flash is charged in the background.<br />The low-light focussing is good, although the very-low contrast focussing uses a red hatching that is displayed on the subject which can be disconcerting and distracting for the subject.  It does allow, however, the camera to be held aloft for a different angle and the area being photographed confirmed.<br />Overall a great product.  No buyer guilt even though I'm now the proud owner of three different types of memeory card.","the sony dsc-v1 is a top-notch camera that is more portable than its competition.  it offers full manual control, 5MP resolution, and 4x optical zoom.  i do have a few nits though...<br />pros:<br />- 5MP, 4x optical zoom.<br />- great image quality.<br />- above average resolution, good tonal balance, good color response.<br />- full manual control.<br />- images exhibit very low noise, even at higher ISO.<br />- image processing parameter control (contrast, saturation and sharpening).<br />- very fast auto focus!<br />- quick startup, fast shot-to-shot times (except when shooting TIFF).<br />- fast write times to memory stick.<br />- has NightFraming which allows you to focus and compose your scene in total darkness with the aid of the infrared emitter, then shoot a full-color shot using the built-in flash. very cool.<br />- better than average movie mode.<br />- compared to the competition (canon g5 and nikon 5400), the dsc-v1 is more compact: dimensions are 4.0\"W x 2.6\"H x 2.3\"D weighing 10.9 oz.<br />- solid build quality.<br />- bright, high resolution LCD monitor with anti-reflective coating that works.<br />- battery charges in-camera, charger doubles as AC adapter.<br />- hot shoe for external flash (limited to specific sony flashes, though).<br />- many optional accessory lenses (telephoto, wide angle, filter lenses) available.<br />- histogram in Live view, Record review and Playback modes<br />- USB 2.0 means faster downloads.<br />cons:<br />- colors a bit washed out.<br />- noise levels higher than expected<br />- some purple fringing.<br />- mild chromatic aberrations visible.<br />- higher redeye occurrence.<br />- RAW format not supported.<br />- saving a TIFF file locks up the camera.<br />- continuous shooting capability limited to 3 frames.<br />- minimum ISO setting at 100.<br />- zoom control is oriented differently so it will take a few tries to get used to it.<br />- ergonomic issues: tiny menu and resolution keys, very easy to block the flash and optical viewfinder with fingers, left index finger falls right on top of the pop-up flash, suppressing it.<br />- lots of key functions are buried in menus.<br />- below average battery performance.<br />- no separate user settings.<br />- like most sony products, you pay a premium, pushing up the price.<br />- expensive memory stick pro cards.<br />- uses a proprietary battery so add a few bucks to buy a spare (or maybe two given the battery performance).<br />- the supplied 32MB memory stick is inadequate - again, more $$ for more memory.<br />- you'll need to remove from tripod to get to the battery or memory stick.<br />sony has succeeded in delivering a camera that has virtually the same feature set as canon's g5 and nikon's 5400 but in a more compact package.  it's not perfect though.  RAW format is not supported and writing a TIFF file still takes way too much time.  and there are some ergonomic nits that is uncharacteristic of sony.  still, this is a great package and worthy of consideration.<br />i hope this helps your buying decision.  peace.","I obsessed while shopping then bought the DSC-V1, and I have no buyer's remorse.  I'm very happy with it. I wanted a camera that delivered a balance of flexible user control, point and shoot simplicity, convenient size and great image quality.<br />This is my first digital camera.  I wanted to get snapshot results that compete with my film cameras for 4x6 and 8x10 photos. I'm more than a casual camera owner: I own two film SLRs (Nikon 8080s), a land point and shoot (Olympus Stylus) and a weatherproof point and shoot (Minolta Weathermatic).<br />I shopped online in detail.  I fell in love with the Canon S50 on paper because it had great specs and it seemed the right size for my wife to manage conveniently too (she likes her Olympus Stylus).  However, I looked at test pictures on the [...] site.  The bigger digital cameras (and the DSC-V1) seemed to outperform the S50, particularly in image sharpness.<br />In the store, I made up my mind and decided on the Sony DSC-V1. I pointed the camera all over the store and at many objects, including my squirmy kid.  The Sony seemed to focus quicker than the other cameras that I played with. The Canon S50 was not as responsive as the Sony DSC-V1.  The low-light focusing aids on the Sony DSC-V1 are impressive.  They are cool too: The lasers remind me of the alien weapon aiming device in the movie, Predator.<br />Biggests Pros:<br />\"It's the lens, stupid\" -<br />Pictures have GREAT color and image resolution!  I'm simply amazed.  This little camera does a lot with the out-of-the-box, automatic settings.  Be careful not to fall in love with all the snazzy, tiny cameras if you are fussy about your images: You must remember that you can't do anything with a zillion megapixels if your lens is just too small or, worse, plain mediocre.<br />Autofocus Performance -<br />It feels fast and works rather well even in low light.  Errors made so far have been mostly mine.  With practice, I'm learning about the camera's limits.<br />Right Size -<br />The DSC-V1 is small enough to carry and big enough to handle steadily.  I'm clumsy yet this camera is easy for me to use with one hand.<br />Design & Features-<br />The camera has great features and specs, and it feels solid in your hands.  The little door for the I/O ports is a nice touch compared to rubber stoppers on some other brands. For the most part, the buttons actually do what you expect. The manual is well-written and well-organized.  Browsing was enough to get me going.  Without a manual, I bet you could play with the DSC-V1 for 15 minutes and accidentally stumble on how to set 80% of the relevant features.<br />Low Light Sensitivity<br />I impulsively snapped several landscapes in the dusk and darkness to see what they would be like.  They were exposed nicely and displayed little/no camera shake. With a tripod, this camera will do wonderfully.<br />Cons:<br />Software - The software that comes with the camera is a little cheesy. After visiting the supplier's Web site and downloading updates, I got the camera squared away with my laptop (Windows 2000) and desktop (Windows XP). Be sure to follow the instructions and download the USB driver for your Windows 2000 machine, first. I did not and had some trouble with my laptop.<br />Other Image Acquisition Software -<br />Not everybody has drivers for their software to handle the DSC-V1 camera yet.  You may have to fuss a bit to get the camera to work with your software.<br />Price-<br />It's high.  It could be about $100 less, and it would be more competitive.<br />Moving up from this compact camera, the next (small) step up would be to an Olympus 5050, a Canon G5 or the Nikon 5400.  From there, you would need to move to digital SLRs.<br />Net: It's a wonderous gadget with great usability features. It's much more fun than my SLRs because I like the instant gratification of seeing results on my laptop. I was slow to go digital. I'm glad I waited for the DSC-V1.  In a few years, I may add a digital SLR to my toybox.","This is a great camera, it is my second Sony and I couldn't have ask for anything more. Easy to use and awsome photos and not to small.","The strong and weak points of this camera have already been covered quite well by other reviewers. I agree with basically all of them. What hasn't been mentioned so far are a couple points that I find irresistable.<br />I often read that consumers have no need for 5 megapixels. These are probably the same kind of people who said that nobody needed a Pentium desktop computer, that it was just too powerful for the average user. Plain and simple, more pixels means more flexibility, particularly when it comes to cropping. With 5 MP, you can crop out a lot of the image and still end up with a good 8 X 10. I do a lot of web work, which generally means low resolution mages. With 5 MP, I can take one shot of a room and split the image up into a dozen or more individual web shots, every bit as good as shooting a dozen small images. 5 MP (and PhotoShop) is essential for that kind of flexibility.<br />Analog video outputs are also high on my list of requirements. This allows me to send what's on the LCD to a television or monitor, doubling the camera's use to include live web cam usage. It also allows you to watch the LCD from afar on an analog monitor at a much bigger image than the 1.5\" LCD. Fortunately, most better cameras include this feature these days.<br />There are a lot of 5 MP cameras on the market, many much cheaper than the V1, so what makes this one worthy of consideration? Stunningly good images through the Zeiss lens and 640 X 480 videos with sound. This camera is small enough to carry around all the time, and you can take an acceptably good web movie on the spur of the moment at any time. With a 256 MB memory stick, you can even take 640 X 480 movies with sound for 10 minutes or more. As memory sticks get cheaper and larger, we will soon be looking at hours of video. The 1 GB stick already can hold almost 45 minutes. The rate limiting factor right now is cost. When 32 GB sticks are out, the 1 GB stick will be standard issue at less than $100. People will laugh that any camera ever came out with only 32 MB.<br />Large, cheap storage capacities are coming quickly. The news as of 9-1-03 is that there is now a material which will allow transistors to be painted onto cheap plastic, rather than the expensive etching of silicon that we currently see today (see this at the Science News web site). High capacity storage will be dirt cheap inside a couple years, so I'd suggest you buy just enough storage to tide you over. 1 GB right now costs as much as the camera itself.<br />Who shouldn't buy this camera? Anybody who can't come up with the scratch. If it's going to hurt, buy something cheaper. If money and portability are only small factors, you might want to consider the F717 instead. Images are a little bit better, and ergonomics are better as well. Also, anybody who can't get past the \"point and shoot\" mentality is buying a lot of power here that they will likely never use.<br />If you are a \"point and shooter\" looking to be a good photographer someday, this is an excellent place to start. Probably the best choice out there for these people. Combine this with the \"Seven Books in One Digital Photography for Dummies\" and PhotoShop (even the lite version) and you've got a stunningly powerful image capturing and editing system that anyone can master. Combine it with one of the Sony photo printers and you'll get archival-quality pictures that last over 100 years. Ahhh....<br />If high res and portability are high on the list, then you can't go wrong with the V1. It never leaves my side, just like the cell phone. I'm a believer.","After much research, I decided on the Sony DSC v-1. I am extrememly pleased with my purchase. I considered the Canon G5, but did not like the larger size and the longer shutter lag. ... I'll admit the zoom is a little annoying (zoom control is up and down, rather than left and right), but all in all the camera is up to par with what I have come to expect from Sony. The pictures are crisp and clear with excellent color. The camera is fast from startup to picture capture. Highly recommended.","Alright, I'm not a camera wiz, but I do appreciate a good point and shoot camera which makes pictures look like I am. I'm sure most of the cameras on the market will suit 99% of the people out there... at least in terms of picture quality. Here's my \"real-world\" perspective on why I bought the camera:<br />1) Rechargable (externally) batteries (don't overlook this feature, this is why I dind't choose Olympus--convenience!)<br />2) Full size video!! (The quality is great... it's a _BIT_ choppy, but how many of us take really long video's of something really important? Few. But this is nice to have if you need some interesting clips!<br />3) 5-megapixel -- this is more for marketing these days unless you plan on printing 8x10's or larger photo's. The bpp doesnt change it's only the resolution (or in english terms, dimensional size of the print) that changes as you add megapixels. I personally shoot 1.2mp all the time. It's nice though, having the option to take something in 5mp in case I ever want a high-quality print!<br />4) Compact w/4x (analog) zoom. We've all seen 100,000x digital zoom... WHO CARES? You can just \"zoom digitally\" once the print is on your machine, quality isn't going to be greater--I'm pretty sure this is true, don't quote me on it though.<br />So those are pretty much the biggest reasons... which mattered to me, living in the \"point-and-shoot-and-forget-about-it\" world. If you're a \"photo-phile\"(?) then there are plenty of reviews on the web for you!<br />Hope this helps someone... I, personally, love the camera! :)","Alright, I'm not a camera wiz, but I do appreciate a good point and shoot camera which makes pictures look like I am.

I, personally, love the camera! :)","I have had this camera for about a month, and have already taken 500 pictures. Before V1, I mostly used Sony DSC-S85, although I also played with many other digital cameras over the years. There were a couple of things that annoyed me about S85 -- slow focusing (often over a second), and the large size. The V1 is small and incredibly fast at focusing -- 0.3 - 0.4 sec according to dpreview.com. Compare this to G5 and the other cameras in this class.<br />Some other highlights of V1:<br />* Noise reduction for images with long exposure. I have taken some night-time pictures with exposures of 5 seconds, and they look great.<br />* The focus is quite accurate, even when shooting in low-light conditions. Definitely better than S85.<br />* This is apparently the first Sony camera whose firmware is user-upgradeable. Sony recently released firmware V.2 that adds several new languages. The next release may address the white balance problem (although I personally haven't experienced it).<br />* This camera can use the larger memory sticks (up to 1GB currently).<br />* There is a decent movie mode (640x480, 15fps). The duration of movies is only limited by the size of the memory stick. So in some special cases V1 can double as a video camera.<br />* Very good image quality. The lens is slightly smaller than S85's, but the pictures look at least as good.<br />Some downsides:<br />* The battery is pricey and doesn't last very long at all. I can shoot about 80 images before running out of juice. Spare batteries are quite expensive.<br />* No dioptre adjustment on the viewfinder.<br />Overall, the V1 has exceeded my expectation. This is the first camera that I like almost everything about, and don't feel the urge to return to the store.","In response to comments below:  The auto white balance in outdoors indirect sunlight issue is just an idiosyncrasy, not a deal breaker.  It's easy to work around.  Dpreview.com suggests setting the manual white balance to \"cloudy\".  I set the mode dial to \"P\", which is program-auto mode.  Essentially it's the full auto mode except you can adjust individual settings if you like.  In \"P\" mode, which is just one click from full auto mode on the mode dial, I have the white balance setting always on \"cloudy\", and let it do everything else automaticly.  Thus, when I find myself in indirect sunlight, I simply twist the mode dial one click to \"P\", and the white balance is properly adjusted every time.  Very simple.  You can see the adjusted white balance effect on the LCD before taking the photo to decide if you like the manual adjustment....................................All the cameras in this class, like the Canon G5 and Nikon Coolpix 5400 have their own idiosyncrasies.  None are perfect.  But with the Canon and Nikon, no matter what you do, you can't change the slow auto focus/shutter lag.  At least with the Sony DSC-V1, it's easy to correct the auto white balance for indirect sunlight....... just takes one click of the mode dial and you're all set........  This camera does so so many things extremely well, don't let the white balance thing detour you from purchasing it.","I have an SLR that I use for \"serious\" photography, and a couple of small pocket sized film cameras that I use for \"street\" photography. This Sony is my first digital camera.<br />I use it in a digital workflow with Adobe Photoshop 7 and a Canon i950 photo printer.<br />The color tonality and resolution from the Carl Zeiss lens is spectacular. Prints through the digital workflow easily match the best I've made from my Nikon SLR with prime (non-zoom) lenses. Photoshop makes it easy to edit the pictures, fixing light reflection spots, framing problems, etc.<br />Drawbacks: the battery life is not great. I quickly exhausted my battery on an afternoon-long shooting expedition. I've since bought a spare battery.<br />The camera is small and somewhat hard to hold steady. Also, if you are in your 40s or older, it's hard to see the LCD screen without bifocals.<br />The standard 32MB Memory Stick is a joke. Get a larger Memory Stick Pro - they come in sizes up to 1GB.<br />But don't let the nits distract you. If you are a serious amateur photographer, this is an excellent camera for you. I can't overemphasize how happy I am with the quality of the prints made using this camera and the Canon printer.","When I started looking for a new camera to replace my DSC-S75, the first place I looked was Sony and I'm not sorry that I did.  I've owned Sony digital cameras for 5 years now and have never had any problems with any of the ones I've purchased (for me or my family).<br />The V1 is a nice package... much more compact than the S75 and definitely the 707 or 717... but is much nicer to handle than any of their smaller Cybershot models.  It seems to have about as many features as the 717 .. except at a fraction of the cost.<br />Now I'm not a professional photographer, and I fumble around with the controls .. not quite sure what everything does.... So the manual is an important feature for me. This one is well written and answers questions quickly.<br />Picture quality is superb!  Instead of having the sizes set to 640x480 .. 1280x960 .. or any other combination.. the V1 uses the  megapixel ratings to let you know the size.. ie:  VGA, 1.2M, 3.1M, 5M, etc .. It really lets you know the size your images are going to be when you download them onto your computer.<br />The nightframing & nightshot features are very cool!  You can take a picture .. in pitch black.. and it come out with excellent .. true to life color.<br />The *only* thing that I have a problem with, is the power saving feature.  Once the flash fires, the LDC screen turns off and it 'powers down' for about 30 seconds while the flash recoups.  It comes back on, but that's precious picture taking time that you can't capture!  The S75 has a much better recovery time after the flash fires.  Sony needs to work on that one!  I would usually leave the red eye reduction on, and be able to shoot anytime w/ my flash as a fill... but now that's not such a great idea.  Guess I'll have to buy a flash for the hotshoe and hope that's not an issue there.<br />Ok, so there's two issues.. Where the popup flash is located.  It really is not ideally situated .. as it's right where your finger would be on holding the camera. It's no biggie to retrain yourself to hold the camera different.. it's just gonna take a bit getting use to.<br />All in all, I would recommend this camera.  The pictures are great!  The zoom is fantastic!  The color is true to life!  And the price is reasonable.","Aloha,This is a fantastic camera.  I did months of research and was all set to buy the highly rated Canon G3.  Caught wind that the G5 was soon to be released, thus delayed the purchase to see what the G5 offered.  The day came, went to dpreview.com to read the G5 review.  Stumbled across the Sony DSC-V1 review and knew right away, the Sony was the way to go for me.Why?  One central reason.  The Sony DSC-V1 takes just as good photographs, yet does it with an auto focus lag and shutter lag that is *twice* as fast as the G3/G5.  The DSC-V1 is just like using a film camera, you hit the button, it takes the picture, with almost no lag.The DSC-V1 isn't perfect.  Battery life is ho-hum, a second battery is a must.  At first it wasn't comfortable in the hand because of the small size, yet I've since gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore.All in all, I'm very very pleased with the Sony DSC-V1.  It takes great photos and is plug and play on my PowerMac running 10.2.6.Highly Recommended!","Having learned photography on a film-based Nikon SLR, I'd been hesitant as well as disappointed with digital camera until now. I wanted a camera whose price wasn't too far in the pro territory, but I also wanted a camera that didn't make me feel like I was giving something up by going digital.<br />When shopping for a camera, the things that were most important to me were:<br />-shutter response<br />-image quality<br />-manual controls<br />-intuitive menus and controls<br />-image resolution<br />-compactness<br />-battery life<br />I considered these all requirement, and set my standards high by deciding not to buy anything that would compromise any one of these things. These are all things digital cameras SHOULD have because if even one condition is lacking, the camera simply isn't good enough, bottom line.<br />I'd tried out a friend's Canon G2, but absolutely hated it because of the shutter lag - the delay between you depressing the shutter and the camera taking the picture was just intolerable. The image quality and resolution was nice, but I also found the camera too bulky for my liking. I mean, the whole point of going digital was to lose some of the bulk, right?<br />So I waited. I began eyeing the Minolta F100 and eventually the F300. I heard it had fast response. It had a very compact body (especially considering the 5 MP resolution of the F300) and while the image quality wasn't as nice as the Canons, I felt it was good enough that I could live with it. Plus, it had a full range of manual controls - I wanted to play around with long exposure shots or change the f-stop according to taste, and the F300 seemed to fit the bill.<br />However, one thing that bothered me was that the Minoltas had very bad battery lives. I did some research and people were complaining about batteries running down after 50 or 60 shots using rechargeable NiCads. My friend's G2 could shoot 400+ shots on a single charge, which was one of the benefits of its bulk. Not so with the Minolta - the thought of having to change batteries on essentially the equivalent of two film rolls made me hesitate about purchasing.<br />Canon also came out with the G3, but while the speed was much improved, I didn't like its bulk. The Canon S50 was essentially a smaller version of the G3, but I just didn't like the black-colored body compared to sleek silver. Yes, this seems like an especially minor point, but would you buy a car that came in a color you didn't like? If I was going to spend $... for a camera, I wanted to feel good about it.<br />Then the Sony V1 came out. Within minutes of reading the review at dpreview.com, I knew this was the camera I wanted. I quick trip to Best Buy to play around with it confirmed my feelings. This camera is great for its price!<br />The Sony DSC-V1 met ALL the requirements I listed above, with some extras such as the Nightframing and Nightshot modes. Battery life is good - about 100 to 200 shots, depending on flash use (the camera uses superior lithium ion batteries). It's got 4X optical zoom. REALLY easy-to-use controls and highly accessible menus (another thing I hated about the Canons - awful, convoluted menus!). The autofocus is very impressive, courtesy of the holographic metering system. I love the manual controls, too, but the thing that really seals the deal is the jog wheel that is present on nearly all Sony electronic devices. The jog wheel makes going manual a joy, instead of a frustrating experience of stabbing at buttons. If you've ever used film-based SLRs before, you'll know what I'm talking about.<br />In addition, the V1 supports the new Memory Stick Pro format, which is much faster than the standard Memory Stick and also faster than either CompactFlash or SmartMedia, I believe. The Pro format offers capacities up to 1 GB (I bought a 256 MB Memory Stick Pro with mine - well worth it, as the price of the 1 GB stick is as much as the camera itself at this point!).<br />The V1's firmware also appears to be upgradeable, as dpreview.com noted recently. So hopefully the problem of white balance in indirect sunlight will be corrected via a software update in the near future. But as I said, using the manual controls on the Sony is so easy due to the existence and placement of the jog wheel, it hasn't really been much of a concern for me.<br />The only major disadvantage I can think of is that Sony doesn't seem to have too many accessories for the V1 yet. Some, like the external flash units, look ungainly and definitely don't look like it was designed for the V1 (more like the V1 was designed to support exisitng flash units). Hopefully, Sony will increase the offerings of accessories, but for now, the V1 is satisfying enough that I will be more than happily shooting away for quite a while.","The Phil Askey / dpreview.com review of the Sony Cybershot DSC-V1 concludes that the camera's auto white balance is \"poor\" in  \"outdoors indirect sunlight\" conditions. I decided not to buy this camera.","I had the SDC v1 for 3 week.<br />PROS:<br />-Nice design/very stylish<br />-The auto mode picture quaility is excellent. I had canon s30 and the dsc v1 blows the canon away in auto mode.<br />-controls are nicely mounted<br />-power on and youre ready to shoot in 1 second. other digi cam can take 3 sec or longer to shoot.(like canon) -With so much functions on this camera. you will not find a camera this compact with this much cool functions<br />CONS;<br />-the software IMAGE MIXER which comes with the CAmera is very cheap. I had Caonon s30 software which was excellent. This sony software stinks bad. I paid 600 dollars for the cam. It should come with proper software to match the camera of this magnitude.<br />-The flash being pop up is mentioned in many reviews, however, i was ok with it as long as i knew not to put my fingers on top of it.<br />-The manual is poorly made. the canon came with 2 diffrent manual for the cam and software and 2 more in spanish. Sony dosnt even give a manual for their software. HOW SAD! You may think this is simple but, NOPE!!!<br />-I have to turn on the camera before i'm able to upload, with canon this was done in automatic.<br />-charging your battery is a joke. you have to buy a seperate battery charger. ohterwise, your camera becomes the charger.(YOu can only charge the batter by hooking up your camera to an adapter) SOny trying to save money in the wrong place.<br />CONCLUSION: this camera is an excellent camera for anything you want to do. however, I am very upset at SONY not the camera it self.THis being the reaons for only 4 stars. SONY dos not take detailed consideration when makeing accesories that comes with cam.<br />I would recommend this cam. its nice camera,but thats all youre going to get.","I have two film SLRs that I use when I want to take serious pictures.  This is my first digital camera. I wasn't going to buy one until I thought they approached SLR quality.<br />For the most part this camera takes better pictures than my Canon AE program.<br />The features are great.  You can keep total control of every feature or let the camera do it for you.<br />Particularly nice is the nightframing shot which lets you set up your shot in infrared and then flash it in normal light.<br />The hologram mode which paints your subject in a laser graph before shooting to control focus and flash also works flawlessly.<br />I was worried about picture quality, but at 5 megapixels features remain crisp and clear even when blown up by several degrees.<br />I'd read online about some color saturation isues, but I've experienced none whatsoever.  On full automatic mode the Sony engineers seemed to have programmed the camera to create a true to life portrait.  A lot of photophiles like higher saturation, and you can get whatever degree of color saturation, crispness, et al by taking control manually.<br />The camera is compact and portable.  You get about 1 1/2 hours of battery life during daytime use, and about half that if you're using the flash.  There's a feature that lets you know to the minute how much battery time you have left.<br />This looks to have all the features of the 717 without the lensocentric style.<br />Originally I was not planning on buying the telephoto lens, leaving that kind of work to my SLRs, but after seeing the image quality, fun, and ease of use of this camera, I'm getting it.<br />Another great feature is that the camera plugs easily into any tv set to review pictures, movies, and even make a slideshow.  I was at a family gathering and this feature proved to be a big hit.<br />As far as I'm concerned, the camera is flawless.<br />Highly recommended.","The camera's not exactly pocket sized, but it is fairly small.  It takes great pictures both indoors and outside.  The macro is fairly good.  Overall I would say that it's a great camera for an enthusiast.<br />I, so far, have no complaints other than the proprietary battery and storage medium."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 5400","amazon_reviews":["Very Good","I purchased this, and didn't regret it.

Today I tryed to use this camera to take some pictures but I cannot make any! The picture in the LCD is fuzzy and tailing. I cannot make out what is in the image. After taken picture, there are lots of ladder plus the fuzzy things. The old picture in the CF card can be showned clearly and normally. So that mean the LCD is good. Try many ways to solve the problem. But I cann't. Then I went online and find many people had the same problem of bad CCD. I just bought it 2 years and it cannot be used any more. It is really bad camera!<br /><br />The problem of CCD was fixed by Nikon free of charge.  I am satisfied with the service and the product.","I love this camera.  It is easy to use and top notch quality...The seller packed it REALLY well and I got it within about 4 days...I was \"blown away\" by his efficiency. The photo program is really great, too.","I have been enjoying this camera for almost 15 months now. Good thing is, it has various modes to take photos. Swivel screen is a real good thing when lot of people are obstructing your view. Though the screen size is small (1.5 inches). Its a nice camera for Point & shoot purpose & looks are pretty cool. Bad thing is - its a battery guzzler. I had to buy another battery so that I can use it for a full day, Thats why 4 stars. Controls are easy, gripping is easy, learning curve is short. It doesn't have a self lens shutter. You need to manually place the cap on the lens. I would recommend either buying a fast CF card or taking pics on 'Normal' with 5 MP combination, else it takes time between two consecutive shots. Overall a good camera, Nikon can still make it better. (I hope Nikon is listening)","When I saw the Coolpix 5000 in Best Buy in 2002, it was the top-of-the-line prosumer digital camera and I lusted after it. Unfortunately it cost $999. The 5400 is the 5000's replacement and is superior in most ways, and 4 years later, I have my hands on it for a quarter of what the 5000 cost in 2002.<br /><br />In my opinion this is the best wide-angle digicam currently available at the price of $250 used. The Canon G5 is selling for more than this camera purely on its brand name. This camera is pretty much neck and neck with it and you will get a good deal on it because it does not have the Canon logo on it. In short, with the Nikon you sacrifice the faster lens for a wider lens.<br /><br />What I like about the Coolpix 5400:<br /><br />- Nice 28mm wide angle<br /><br />- 5mp is plenty for the 1 1/8\" sensor size - do you really think a current 8mp camera can resolve 8mp of detail onto a 1 1/8\" sensor?<br /><br />- Fast startup time<br /><br />- Smaller than the G5, too large for a pocket but small enough for a sweatshirt pouch<br /><br />- Good battery - rated only 680mAH but still lasts quite a while, charges quickly, and is easy to pop in and out compared to other cameras that use 4 AAs<br /><br />- RAW support with 1.4 firmware (download from Nikon's website)<br /><br />- Nice array of buttons, not a lot of poking around in the menus necessary, common functions all have a button. Takes some time to learn them all, but once you do they make you faster and more efficient. I even wish it had one or two extra user-definable buttons.<br /><br />- LCD is visible even in direct sunlight, and its small size saves the battery<br /><br />- Flip-and-twist LCD is one of those \"How did I ever get by without one of these before\" things<br /><br />- Panorama assist is nice, unfortunately it only supports JPEG and not RAW<br /><br />- High quality build, except for the battery & CF compartment covers<br /><br />- Black cameras just look so much cooler than silver ones<br /><br />What I don't like about this camera:<br /><br />- Slow lens (max f/2.8, decreases with telephoto)<br /><br />- ISO 50-400 (small 1 1/8\" sensor would be too noisy at higher sensitivities)<br /><br />- HORRIBLE low-light camera - no AF assist lamp and if the autofocus even works at all under normal incandescent room lighting, you'll be lucky<br /><br />- Vignetting in the upper left corner at full wide angle and maximum aperture<br /><br />- Colors on the LCD look washed out - many photos that look dull on the LCD actually look fantastic, causing you to question whether the photo you just took is any good<br /><br />- Tripod mount is not centered underneath the lens and is plastic<br /><br />- Doesn't support USB 2<br /><br />- Slow CF write speed<br /><br />- Camera is unresponsive while draining the buffer onto the CF card<br /><br />- Only supports 2GB CF cards max<br /><br />- Locks up too frequently (seemingly every 75 shots when I shoot in RAW and keep taxing the buffer) - have to reinsert the battery and I usually lose a couple of the photos I just took<br /><br />- Slow shutter response and shot-to-shot time - terrible for sports or any kind of action<br /><br />- Very awkward in my hand - I have normal-sized hands and I simply cannot hold this camera securely with one hand. The grip sticks out enough but is too narrow. I have to rest the camera on my pinky to keep it from falling out of my hand.<br /><br />- \"Quick review\" is not quick since you have to press it twice for it to be useful<br /><br />Every camera has strengths and weaknesses, every camera is a tradeoff and this camera makes some \"unique\" tradeoffs. Overall, it fits me quite well.","I have had this camera now for 2 years and I have found that the people do NOT read the manual or do not memorise it. I get very good pictures and it has some great built in features. I love it.","My 5400 was a birthday gift from my wife. She purchased it from an online store (NOT Amazon, as she should have done)who called her for \"confirmation\" at which time the salesman talked her into a very expensive (over $200) filter add-on which is nearly useless and could be bought elsewhere for under $30. I should have waited for the d70 for just a little more money (actually I now have a d70 and it is amazing!). The 5400 takes great wide-angle shots, so you would think it would be a good camera for interior pictures, but it is hampered by its poor autofocus habits in low light. The 5400 is small, but its odd configuration means you will have to carry it in a larger case than you would expect. Images are generally very good, but the lcd is so small, you won't find it very useful for composition.<br /><br />I also had the same experience as another reviewer, the tiny screws holding one of the strap lugs stripped out and gummed up the lens mechanism. This caused a complete breakdown. As it was just out of warranty, I opted to have it repaired at my expense($150), but now wish I hadn't. Nikon should make good on this issue, as I suspect it is far more common than they will admit. Save your money and buy either a d50 (same $ for new)or if you have an investment in CF cards, go with a d70.","Overall the 5400 works well.  Nikon still has some of the the best macro capabilities (very important to me) out there, but the 5400 is not as good as the 4500, 995, etc, rotating body style cameras.<br /><br />When in macro mode, the autofocus wants to hunt.  The lens on the 5400 protrudes from the camera body and moves in and out when zooming.  The bulk of the camera and protruding lens tends to shadow the maco subject more than the rotating body Coolpix cameras.  Unfortunately, the SL-1 LED ringlight will not work with the 5400, so keep a flashlight handy!<br /><br />In fact, most of the accessories that work on the 4500 (etc...) will not work with many of Nikon's newer cameras- a huge waste of my money on accessories that are now essentially useless.  The protruding lens of the 5400 requires bulky adapters to connect to a microscope.<br /><br />Overall, the 5400 is an average performer with good macro and a poor camera design.","I purchased the Nikon 5400 to replace my trusty Nikon 990 - the odd-looking one which has made more than 20,000 captures and cause me to set aside my 35mm SLRs forever. I loved my 990 from the first day I took it out of the box. The 5400 has taken a little \"bonding\" time and I'm still a little ambivalent about it. Some of the things I like best about it are also the things that annoy me the most.<br /><br />The 5400 produces images of superior quality to the 990, not just in pixel count, but in dynamic range. It also produces sharper images over a wider range of the zoom, with less distortion and color fringing problems. The color balance is better, too, especially in the rendering of skin tones.<br /><br />Most of my photography falls into two categories: Tabletop catalog-style shooting with external flash, and travel pictures using natural lighting, both outdoors and indoors. The Nikon 5400 fulfills both roles beautifully.<br /><br />My budget would have allowed me to choose any of the prosumer cameras, including the more moderately priced SLR cameras, but given my shooting habits and requirements, none of them looked to be as good a bet at the 5400. And given what I know now about the camera I most likely would purchase the camera again today. The following is a listing of what I like least and best about the Nikon 5400.<br /><br />What I hate about it:<br /><br />1.) The optical viewfinder - The viewfinder has an excellent diopter adjustment, but the camera captures a signifcantly larger area than the viewfinder shows. This makes it very forgiving of sloppy ahooting. You're unlikely to accidently crop someone's head or feet off, but it's impossible to accurately frame an image. (He pauses and spits.)<br /><br />2.) The small size of the LCD - It provides excellent performance in bright ambient lighting, but it's just too small for effective evaluation of the image after capture is completed. It compensates for varying image brightness to make it easier to see the image, but this kills your ability to judge the exposure. You can be in for some surprises when your view images in the computer that looked good in the camera may be underexposed or have blown-out highlights. Thank goodness there's a histogram view you can use to evaluate the exposure.<br /><br />3.) Inferior dust seals on the sliding tube for the zoom lens - You have to be very careful when cleaning the lens on this camera. I don't know if it's a common characteristic, or if I just happened to get one with a bad lens barrel seal, but I put away the canned air after the first couple of times I cleaned the lens. Some tiny fibers apparently blew into the inside and you can see them on the inner element.<br /><br />4.) The small size - Because of the 5400's small size and pretty much non-existant grip I fully expect it to slip out my hand at some point. I will always use a strap and wrap it around my wrist when I'm using this camera.<br /><br />What I love about it:<br /><br />1.) Its superb wide-angle zoom lens. The was a deal maker for me. The widest angle is roughly comparable to a 28mm on a 35mm camera. This is simply not available on many cameras, and it's far superior to using an auxilliary lens to achieve the wide angle.<br /><br />2.) The swiveling LCD - Another deal-maker for me. It allows me use the camera at what would otherwise be very awkward high or low angles.<br /><br />3.) It has an optical viewfinder - Awful as this one is, it does provides a real, live view that never freezes or blacks out at the moment of exposure. The lack of an optical finder is what prevented me from buying the Nilon 8400, which zooms on out to a 24mm equivalent.<br /><br />4.) The small size - This is such a compact camera I can easily carry it along with me at times I would otherwise leave it at home. It fit easily into a jacket pocket, or hangs around my neck all day with no discomfort.<br /><br />5.) Scene Modes -  Especially the Panorama Assist. It's nice to be able to quickly select a scene mode to handle a particular type of shooting situation, such as backlighted portraits.<br /><br />6.) Super-close macro - not as convenient or as versatile as the 990's but still superior to most of them out there. You don't get maximum macro capability unless the lens is nearly at its widest setting, but you can still get very close as long as the macro mode is turned on.","i've had this camera since Dec 03.  i did extensive research, comparison shopping, and hands-on playing before purchasing this camera.  i was torn between this one, the olympus 5060 zoom, and sony dsc-v1 (since discontinued).<br /><br />i wish i had listened to the repetitive negative reviews regarding the 5400's slow to non-existent low-light AF.  i purchased this camera to document my son's childhood, but have sadly missed precious moments due to this camera's slow focus and shutter lag.  i pretty much prefocus and press the shutter button halfway in my son's direction and wait for a kodak moment to ever have a chance at catching anything.  prefocusing seems to help the shutter lag issue.<br /><br />i was also pleased to have the option for continous burst mode to capture my son's milestones in sequence shots, but please be aware that you will need to know how to set aperture and shutter speeds for proper exposure.  the flash is not usable in this setting and incorrect settings will result in blurred images.<br /><br />the horrible focus issues had me regretting my purchase days after the $700 transaction.  i purchased an additional battery and larger CF cards as well so it was a hefty regret.  i found myself wanting to purchase the V1 since it had a nightframing capability allowing it to focus in darkness, but couldn't justify another $700 purchase.  i unfortunately failed to discuss my return options with the store i purchased it from so i was stuck with the 5400 blind monster.  i have been taking my old reliable 35 mm Minolta with me to events like weddings since i anticipate low-light situations then and the need for a quick-response camera to capture once-in-a-lifetime moments.<br /><br />i love the option of manual controls for more creative shots.  there are a lot of buttons and controls on the camera body so you'll have easy access to them without navigating through the LCD.  however, i can't get past the slow AF issue to fully love this camera.  also, the writing speed is nothing to write home about!  SSSLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWW!  this is not a snappy camera.<br /><br />i will agree that the 5400 is capable of very good shots, but i think it's better suited for still life and landscapes.  and just like every other digicam, images still require photoshop manipulations to correct color balance and saturation, sharpness, and contrast.  i may be more picky than most since i've never printed an image without photoshop editing.<br /><br />i have decided to purchase the older Canon S410.  i have handled a friends S410 and love the EXCELLENT AF especially in low loght even at a long zoom.  the next-to-nothing shutter lag is very impressive.  it also uses CF cards so i can use the 3 Lexar 256 MB cards i already have.  the S410 is also only $250 from this site!  it's only 4MP, but i actually don't mind since i found the 5400's 5 MP setting too noisy and often used the 3.2 setting.  the S410 will also be more pocketable.  perfect for our upcoming summer vacation.  yes, the S410 doesn't have all the manual controls, but right now i just want to get focused and actually capture the moment.  i contemplated getting a Canon SDxxx model, but am hesitant to spend more money on new SD cards.  I'm sure an SDxxx would be even faster, but i'm already impressed with the S410 and i can save some money.<br /><br />i had previously given this camera 4 stars when i started typing this review, but after writing this much, have decided change it to 3.  i hope this helps.","There's no doubt about it, the Nikon 5400 is a great camera. Its small enough to carry with you (though a little too big for pockets), has a nice LCD, boasts amazing 5.1MP resolution, as well as professional quality 4x optical zoom (not junky digital zoom, like other cameras). You can print out an 8x10 poster of your photo without having to stretch the image, that's how great 5.1MP really is. Also, its got tons of features for a non-SLR model that are easy to use for camera beginners.","Great quality pictures. I have this camera for a month now and did not run into any troubles yet. Camera feels great in my hands.<br /><br />The best part of it I got it for free in just 3 weeks here: [...]<br /><br />Very easy to use and user friendly menus make this camera a valuable gear for any user. Recommend.","I bought this camera with some trepidation after reading bad reviews about problems with focus in low light conditions.  It has turned out to be a great little camera - sharp images, good colour rendition, wide angle zoom, and the option of full manual control. For enlargements at 8\" by 10\", it beats my venerable old Nikon FE with Nikkor 35-135 zoom. I also compared it with a friend's Canon Elph S400, and the 5400 is much sharper.  Low light focus isn't much of a problem, particularly at wide angle.  Digital cameras do take some getting used to, and you should be prepared to study the maual in detail - but the 5400 will produce great results. I'm a very satisfied with the 5400, after using film SLRs for 20 years or so,","Got a $200 rebate from Nikon on this camera and couldn't pass it up and never happier.  Very good all around performance, a few small problems (no Focus Assist light and fairly small LCD are some) but overall a solid camera with a lot of features and unbeatable at the price.<br /><br />For those who are having problems focusing in low light I have to ask, are you shooting on a tripod or by hand?  Take advantage of the nice feature whereby this camera shows you the exposure time right on the LCD when taking pictures, at medium and low light levels the camera will often have an exposure time of 1 second or more, this will lead to a blurry shot if it's not heald perfectly steady.<br /><br />If you are having blurry shots at low light, try the same shot on a tripod or just sitting on something solid, I bet the shot will be crystal clear and very bright (I took some late twilight shots tonight and they look almost like midday with the right settings!).<br /><br />Many features seems advanced for a camera of this price range, and sometimes at the cost of point and shoot ability, but if you are looking for a good prosumer level camera I have to say this feels like a solid bet.","I decided to try the Nikon 5400. It has delivered consistent, fine images and allows many pre-set modes to shoot as well as manual control. A top piece of equipment with Nikon know-how.","The Coolpix 5400 is a model that's nearly two years old and, in digital photograpy terms, it's already a dinosaur.  It takes good-quality pictures, better than most tiny point-and-shoots, but compared to Nikon's newer advanced compact digital cameras (8400, 8700, 8800, etc.) and the latest G-series from Canon, it's a very lackluster performer.  I also have issues with the very small (1.5\") LCD screen.  The sensor on this camera is small, resulting in picture quality that cannot be compared to cameras with larger sensors.<br /><br />Yes, this is cheap after the $200 rebate, but it's a camera that wasn't great when it was new and is definitely way out-of-date by now, and its picture quality just doesn't do justice to the Nikon brandname.","Although I have had years of experience with conventional cameras in both 35mm and medium format, the Nikon Coolpix 5400 is the first digital camera I have owned. I had grown weary of traveling with a 35mm and several lenses, or even more bulky medium format cameras.<br /><br />Other reviewers have amply written about the features of this camera.  I am going to focus on performance.<br /><br />The Coolpix 5400 has good optics.  I have shot the equivalent of several rolls of film on it.  The photos have been crisp, had faithful color rendition without any glaring digital artifacts, and really don't need any software manipulation.  So far, so good.<br /><br />All is not roses, however.  The Coolpix 5400 is very, very, very slow in writing from the a/d converter to the flashcard.  Fire off a bunch of shots in continuous mode and get ready to wait.  And wait some more.  Smokers will have time for a cigarette or two; others could take a short bus ride or file their nails.  It's that bad.  I find this to be inexcusable in a camera sold at the original price point of the 5400.  In fact, a lot of less expensive cameras are quicker.  Canons don't seem to do this as poorly as the Nikon 5400 and Sony with its new V3 may be the fastest prosumer camera on the block for the time being.  I think most other name brands will be quicker also.  I should point out everything is relative: all point and shoot and prosumer digital cameras will be much slower than a digital SLR.<br /><br />Another shortcoming:  the autofocus in dim light problem that has been amply documented by other reviewers.  This has not bothered me that much, but it is a problem to be aware of (this problem is not unique to Nikon).<br /><br />A former shortcoming, the lack of a RAW file format has been rectified.  You can now download firmware enabling RAW files from the Nikon USA website.  It is up to you whether you want to utilize the RAW format.  RAW is essentially uncompressed, but I doubt you'd be able to discern any real differences between a RAW or JPEG photo at normal print size.<br /><br />Were it not for the glitches I listed above, I'd highly recommend the camera to just about anyone.  As it is, the Coolpix 5400 is suitable for someone like a landscape photographer who takes a long time to compose a picture and has some patience; but it's not for the person who wants to take action shots and  review them quickly.<br /><br />The Coolpix 5400 has been recently discontinued by Nikon, and, depending where you shop. the price has dropped from a bit to enormously. That may make its few flaws more acceptable to the new buyer.  My advice: shop around and try to use the camera you are interested in buying as much as possible.  Online reviews can provide a good guide, but you really need to put your hands on a camera and run through the controls to see if it is right for you. What feels good in my hand may not in yours.<br /><br />Hope this has been of some help.","Having had some doubt about the ability to get high performance from a digital camera (below stratospheric costs), I decide to try the Nikon 5400. It has delivered consistent, fine images and allows many pre-set modes to shoot as well as manual control. A top piece of equipment with Nikon know-how.","This camera measures roughly 4\"x3\"x2.5\".  It weighs 0.8 lbs with the battery.  As I am 200 lb size man, this camera definitely is compact for me.<br />The camera is powerful.  It has a wide angle lens, standard. The optical zoom is 4x. Shutter speeds range from 10 mins (bulb) to 1/8000 sec (ultra high speed); but, 97% of my shooting uses 1/8 sec to 1/700 sec shutter speeds. f/ values range from 2.8 to 8.0 (8.0 reached at 4x zoom). In 1600x1200 jpg fine picture mode, it can snap 7 frames in 2.7 sec (high speed continuous), or 54  frames in 33.5 sec (low speed continuous). For faster continuous shooting, I recommend using the QuickTime movie mode (includes sound), rather than the ultra high speed continuous mode. The movie mode is 15 fps, 3 mins max at 320x240 pixels or 70 secs max at 640x480 pixels. You can combine and edit the movie clips, using QuickTime Pro software ($30 extra).<br />The camera can be used in fully auto mode, or for the best pictures, you will want to go to the fully manual mode ( this will be a learning experience for the novice).  Also, available, if you need extra high quality pictures (better than jpg), you can use the TIFF 2,592x1,944 pixel mode (5 mega-pixels is also available for the jpg images).<br />The color accuracy of this camera is very high. While photo editing the pictures, I seldom need more than one click of adjustment to achieve perfect color, and half the time , zero adjustment is needed.<br />Auto focus will be 97-100% accurate in average or bright light, but if the light is very dim, then the auto focus quits working. Also, the natural focus of the lens tends to be soft, so that a setting of high image sharpening, + contrast, and +1 color saturation is recommended. The lens has rather low chromatic and linear aberration.<br />The auto ISO sensitivity and the auto white balance of the camera is generally very good , so no manual adjustment is needed or recommended.  Image \"noise\" is almost zero at ISO's of 50 to 150.<br />The monitor measures 1 1/4\" x 7/8\" , 1.5\" diagonally. It is easy to see the image in bright sunlight, and has good resolution at 134,000 pixels. The monitor is big enough for me - I am nearsighted, but a lot of people would prefer the 1.8\" size monitor.<br />I can't give this camera a 5 star rating, because, then you would have to give the professional league cameras a 6 star rating. But, for its size and weight, Nikon has made a very powerful camera.","After having read through all the reviews I thought I'd contribute my input on this camera since a lot of people had something negative to say.<br />I'm a former Coolpix 5000 user and went for the newer version handing down my older version, and I must say the 5400 is indeed a better camera.<br />Before I get into that, I must first say that if you're a beginner user or searching for your first digital camera, the 5400 is probably not for you and I would recommend investing your money on a high end Canon which focuses on point and shoot, quick and easy, no fuss photos.  Although this camera does have point and shoot capabilities, the camera is clearly designed to be tweaked and played with to get a professional image.  This camera is the grade in between a consumer and professional camera and you'll immediately see and feel that when you begin to use the camera.<br />As for what remarks I've seen regarding fuzziness, blurriness or quality of images... the 5400 produces crystal clear, professional images once you've taken the time to learn how to use the camera and produce the images.  If you're not willing to sit down and learn how to use the camera, you're wasting your money.  Of course, if you're a previous Nikon Coolpix user it will be a relatively easy learning curve.<br />Frankly, who cares where the camera was made?  Every element on the 5400 works and functions great.  Nothing on the 5400 has been overlooked or \"skimped\" over.  This camera's been on the top 10 at PC World for months since its release and for good reason.<br />My favorite feature compare to the 5000 is that I'm not always removing the lens cap to do simple tasks such as downloading images into my computer.  The menu is also a lot better and it's a lot easier to navigate between the different shooting modes.<br />The features have already been thoroughly reviewed by other users, but overall this camera is an excellent camera with more features and absolute control then you could imagine.  If you want to be creative about photography and get quality, professional images, then this camera is undoubtedly meant for you.","Unter normal indoor lighting conditions the image in the 1.5 LCD display is extreamly noisey and blury","I had a Sony 1 MP camera before I was given this one, and I'll tell you 5 MP is a big diffrence! The camera has all kinds of settings, but they aren't realy good, the indoor settings have a slow shutter speed so the pictures almost always come out blured or they don't work with the flash. If you want to take a good indoor picture you need a tripod, and your subject must not move for several seconds. I learned the best setting is M, it has a fairly quick shutter speed, and you can turn the flash on, off, or there is a good red-eye reduction setting.","Other reviews describe all the features, and still others tell how people feel about the camera -- many people love it.  Rather than repeat that, let me just say that this camera is a lot of fun to play with.  With a mode dial, a command dial to shift shutter speed or other settings, and other dials and buttons, it's easy to get at all the features here.  It invites you to try things, and as you do, you'll learn alot about how to take better and better pictures.<br />If you just want to press the button, have a great picture and be done with it, this camera is overkill.  Cheaper cameras can do that -- mabye get a Canon S50 or a Sony p10.  But if you want a small camera you'll want to pick up every night and experiment with, this is your camera.  You can put it in green auto mode and get great pictures if you want, but this camera can provide you a lot more fun than that.","What can I say?  I love the 5400!  It is my second from the Coolpix series.  My first was a CP 880 that took a fall so the 5400 was a replacement.  It's well worth the money.  I looked around a lot and couldn't find anything I liked from other manufacturers that packed the features and flexibility of the 5400.<br />If you are a new digital user, the auto mode and scene modes are great.  I usually shoot in P or M modes and can turn the dial to Automatic mode and hand it to my wife who likes the ability to point and shoot without thinking about adjusting anything.  You can grow into this camera if you don't know yet how to shoot manually.<br />The 15 different scene modes to choose from are excellent. The panoramic assist mode is particularly cool.  You can shoot a panoramic horizontally, vertically or in a 360 degree circle.  You take photos and then put them together after download with the ArcSoft software that comes with the camera.  It even allows you to fine-tune the pictures in case they do not align they way you want them too.<br />Pros:<br />Turn a fully automatic camera into a fully manual camera with the turn of a dial.  I haven't found anything this camera cannot do that my recently auctioned SLR could do.  Picture quality is equal to me.<br />The camera feels great to hold.  All of the buttons are in convenient locations.  Menus can be customized to show what you adjust frequently and you can store two different user settings using the function button.<br />5-shot buffer is great.  It will take photos as long as you hold down the shutter release.  It only stores the last five frames even if you have held the shutter release down long enough to make 20 exposures.  Also does time lapse.<br />Shutter speed from Bulb to 1/4000.<br />Crisp Macro shooting.<br />The Vari-Angle display is much better than a fixed position display.<br />Three metering options- Matrix, Center-weighted and Spot are very effective.<br />Takes Type I and II compact flash.  I wouldn't go with anything less than 256mb.  Make sure it is USB compatible memory if you plan to use a Compact Flash reader in a USB port.<br />Hot shoe for accessories is a great addition.  When a speedlight is attached, you can set the camera to fire the internal flash and speedlight or you can turn off the internal flash and use only the speedlight.  This is great if you want to bounce your speedlight and use the internal for a fill-flash.  It also works with a SC-17 remote cable if you want to get the flash off the camera for close up/macro shots. (If you are thinking about getting a Nikon speedlight, go with the SB-80DX or find an old SB-28 or SB-28DX versus going with the SB-50DX.  It's worth the extra money if you are going to do any manual shooting/adjusting of speedlight.  There is no manual mode on the SB-50DX so you can't really fine tune lighting if you are shooting with the camera in manual mode.)<br />Battery life is good (about 1.5 - 2 hrs.) It comes with a charger and 1 battery.  A second (or 2CR5) as a back-up in my case has come in handy.<br />Cons:<br />The autofocus is not very good in low light situations.  I have a Nikon SB-28 speedlight with autofocus assist but the 5400 doesn't activate it. I knocked off half a star for that.<br />You have to go through a 1/4 view screen before going to full-screen view when using the Quick Review.  I think it would be better if it went straight to the full-screen view and did away with the 1/4 screen view. (-1/4 star.)<br />The only option for adding filters is the HN-CP10 hood with 77mm filters.  It's great to have a hood large enough to stay out of wide angle compositions but the 77mm filters are very expensive. (last 1/4 star)<br />Card cover is flimsy.  I have a card reader and each time I open the door to remove the card, I think about how flimsy it is. The 880 had a much more sturdy door.<br />Area through the viewfinder is significantly different than what you see in the monitor.  I read somewhere it is about 35% less through the viewfinder than the monitor.<br />Overall, it's a great camera for the beginner or advanced user.  As a result of purchasing this camera, I shoot only digital and don't miss my SLR one bit.  The owner's manual is 160 pages and thoroughly explains all the camera's features.  I've had it for 3 months now and am still learning what this camera can do.","I love this camera. I am a fine artist and need to archive my work. In the past, that meant shooting everything in 35mm and then my better pieces needed to be shot again in 4x5 format as well in the event I wanted to reproduce them at a later date as large prints. I had to bracket each shot at least three ways to make sure I got the best shot. And at the end of a photo shoot, it could get pretty expensive with all the film and processing. Along with the 5400, I also purchased a 512mb flash card and a AC adapter so I wouldn't have to continually upload my images. In one session, I was able to shoot over 40 works, and only two needed to be reshot because they were soft. I shoot in bright natural light and the auto focus worked very well. I shot everything at the highest resolution setting as tif files which are pretty big. I was able to store about 35 images on the flashcard before it ran out of memory. The colors were so accurate, I hardly needed to tweak them at all in Photoshop. Needless to say, the camera paid for itself in one photo shoot and the ease and time saving qualities are priceless to me. I would highly recommend this camera, but get yourself a flash card with more memory if you want to store more images than using the card it comes with. (I think an 8). Also, I would suggest steering clear of sellers who are offering this and other similar items at a ridiculous savings. They will try to upsell you with incredibly high cost extras like extended waranty and cases and cards and lenses. If you don't agree to buy any, they will likely screw up your order, lie to you and make your life a living hell. I went through that ugly scene and then finally went through Amazon to purchase my stuff. They haven't let me down yet with anything I've purchased.","I absolutely love this camera. I previously owned the Nikon CoolPix 990...... Nikon has come a long way since then. THe Nikon CoolPix 5400 has great features, takes clear, crisp photos.... and I especially love all the \"scene modes\" it has.... and I love the macro setting. You can get as close as 1 centimeter. I've enjoyed this camera and I love the results I get!<br />Highly recommend!","I am 67 yrs old.  After 340 photos I was unable figure out how to take an in focus photo at a range of 2 to 4 feet without a flash.  So I calculate the camera is beyond me and returned it. Amazons policy of return is a real life saver.<br />my web site is  [...]<br />My pervious camera was a Sony DSC-S50 the photo of the bridge is with the S50 and the second picture on the main page is taken with coolpix 5400.","the nikon coolpix 5400 is a solid 5MP, 4x zoom camera with a strong feature set.  but it has a few shortcomings so make sure to consider its competition.<br />pros:<br />- 5MP and 4x optical zoom.<br />- good color response, average resolution for 5MP.<br />- photos have very low noise.<br />- allows a great deal of manual control.<br />- macro mode better than most.<br />- low redeye occurrence.<br />- virtually free of chromatic aberrations.<br />- shadow highlights maintained.<br />- timed exposures up to 10 minutes.<br />- expandable with a boatload of lenses, flashes, and other accessories from nikon.<br />- wider lens than most.<br />- supports CF card types I and II.<br />- flip-out LCD display - protects LCD when not in use.<br />- high resolution LCD with anti-reflective coating that actually works.<br />- very comfortable to hold with a deep hand grip made of soft rubber.<br />- compact body feels solid.<br />- reprogrammable FUNC button, and initial record menu.<br />- above average battery life (i still recommend getting a spare though).<br />cons:<br />- some lens distortion, especially at maximum zoom.<br />- images occasionally appear soft around corners.<br />- slow response interface, non-intuitive menus.<br />- no AF assist light - very puzzling why nikon doesn't provide this.<br />- to add insult to injury, this camera has a hard time focusing in low light so an AF assist light would really come in handy.<br />- average auto focus speed.<br />- buffering issue? the camera locks towards the end of write process.<br />- slow CF write speed / processing.<br />- you're on your own when using manual focus - it doesn't show focus distance.<br />- LCD smaller than competition.<br />- RAW mode not supported.<br />- flimsy cover for CF slot.<br />- no live histogram in record mode.<br />- no support for external Speedlight features such as AF assist or flash zoom.<br />- connectivity options all over the place rather than in a central location.<br />- uses proprietary battery so make sure you add some $$ to your budget to get a spare.<br />- the supplied 16MB CF card is inadequate - again, more $$ for more memory.<br />the coolpix 5400 is a solid camera from nikon with a very strong feature set.  it will produce very good pics in point and shoot mode but still has full manual control if you want to be more creative with your shots.  i've given this a 4-star rating because of two important factors for me: the lack of an AF assist light and the dead time at the end of write process.  i would suggest that you consider the canon g5 and the sony dsc-v1 before committing to the nikon 5400.<br />i hope this helps with your buying decision.  peace.","In response to the made in Korea question, I received my camera a week ago and was terrified to see that it was made in Korea (having read the reviewer's comment).  After a week of unneeded stress, I can personally say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with my camera - it works perfectly.  I'm sure the reviewer had a problem with his camera and simpy assumed it was the fact that it was made in Korea.  More realistically, he simply received a lemon camera - it happens.  (Incidently, the \"Made in Korea\" is located on one side of the box in tiny print, or on the bottom of the camera.)<br />So far this camera has been amazing.  Super wideangle that no comparable competitor can surpass, and great macro capabilities.  I went for this one over the 5700 for that fact (and the price difference - plus having to deal with rebates).  I haven't yet had any reason to worry about the buffer speed as some reviews have nailed it on.  How many times do I need to take 30 continous low res shots in a row (as in, holding down the shutter release) and then turn around and take more shots?  Really, the only major drawbacks to this camera in my opinion, are the optical viewer and the price.  The viewer doesn't cover the entire actual shot taken which can cause you to get a shot you hadn't intended.  So I basically rely on the LCD screen usually.  But isn't that what most people do anyway?  The price is high basically because its a Nikon and built out of good materials.<br />There will be tradeoffs in any camera that you buy, and this one covered most of what I needed.  You really have to look at what you want personally, rather than what a camera review is looking for.","Someone mentioned when getting the Coolpix 5400, make sure to get the one made in Japan and not Korea. How can you tell where it is made? Any information will be greatly appreciated.","what the professional reviewers say about the problems w/ lack of AF assist in low lighting conditions is true: photos taken in low light are often out of focus. in addition, the viewfinder is inaccurate; you will eat up battery life because you will have to rely on the display to frame your shots accurately.<br />on the other hand, the ergonomics of the camera are great: it just feels perfect in your hand. and outdoor shots are detailed and colorful. the wider lens angle is also really nice.","Finally decided to get the Nikon 5400 from Amazon at the regular Nikon suggested price, because I have grown to trust Amazon, and my impression is that the \"lower priced\" 5400's out there are mostly gray market.  This made-in-Japan wonder, has not let me down.  Have been using the 5400 about 10 days now.  I took camera and manual up to a lean-to in the Adirondacks for an overnight, and had a great time trying the various features.  I took pictures in the deep forest in a misty rain, using a Leki Photo walking stick as a monopod and got great results.  I set the white balance for \"cloudy\" and colors were rendered accurately.  Subsequently, on a clear day in the shade, with white balance set to \"shade\", greens were nice and warm - not blue as with slide film (unless you put on a filter.)  You can even bring along a piece of white paper, aim the camera at it, and set the white balance precisely for any lighting situation.  I have methodically plodded through the manual, and pleasant surprises abound.  The camera is a joy to use, controls are well deployed.  And with battery, it only weighs 13 oz - a backpacker's dream camera, with 28 - 116 zoom.  This is possibly the only 5 MP camera on the market with a 28mm equivalent wide angle lens integral to the camera.  In macro, it will focus as close as 1/2 inch!  If you are into scenics and nature, this is the camera to own.  The only down side so far is the viewfinder (the glass one you look through) which has a somewhat restricted view.","Make sure you get one made in Japan (with fireware 1.3).<br />because Korea made has focus problem!!!<br />I had both, and return Korea's, which make me nuts.","I have been looking at cameras for quite a while but was having a very difficult time deciding if a digital camera would take the type of pictures I am used to with a 35mm.  I am happy to say that after about 30 minutes I had taken and printed pictures that are as good or better than my 35mm.  This is a great camera for beginners.  I used it for a vacation to Hawaii and the pictures were beautiful.  I highly recommend this camera for the variety of features and the ease of use for beginners.","Don't listen to this guy who said its a step backwards. The LCD is fine for all but the visually impaired, and excellent in bright sunlight (light that many LCDs have trouble in). 1.5 inches is fine, and is too small an issue to detract from its overall strength. Basically an LCD is for framing and reference, not for showing your pics to family and friends,; thats what prints are for, or even the TV out cable.<br />This camera takes stunning images with ease. Ive had it for a week. The more you get to know it and understand it, the better it will get, and so your pictures. To fully get the best out of it you'll need to be patient and read the manual, but out of the box shots on full auto are superb anyway.<br />The autofocus is quick, so long as you find some contrast to lock it onto, as with all autofocus, and shutter lag is virtually instant if you make sure focus is already locked onto the subject. Disable the 'shutter sound' beep via the settings menu, and you'll quicken shutter speed even more, to about 0.1 sec.<br />If people knock this camera its either because they dont have it and have only read about it or briefly tested it in-store, or because they dont understand how to use it. And maybe they have bad eyesight!","In response to \"that guy\" who said \" don't listen to this guy who said it is a step backwards\". This is a review of a camera not a judgement of people and their eyesight or if they knock the camera they \"can't afford it or don't understand it.<br /> As stated I have years of photographic experience and compared the camera to the Nikon Coolpix 990. I have had the 990 since the first day it came out (about 3 years ago) and it has been one of Nikons biggest selling digital for many reasons. I also campared it to the camera it's ment to replace , the Coolpix 5000.<br /> In my review I stated many people will like this camera and it does take good pictures, but compared to the new technology that's out there and the compitition from other camera makers (Canons new G5 for instance, and I don't own any Canon products) the 5400 as a whole is a disappiontment.<br /> People shouldn't write a review based on having a product for a week and comparing it to nothing.<br />I've used Nikons for over twenty years. I have always expected improvements with new models and most time they didn't disappoint. I loved (and still do) my Coolpix 990. The 5400 is a downer.<br /><br /> First, it's made in Korea! The smaller sensor is stretched for quality. The dull 1.5\" LCD screen is also a step in the wrong direction (if you can even see the image on it). Nikon's older 5000 had a larger chip and 1.8\" screen. Nikon should be making better cameras. Cameras with larger chips and a nice 2\" LCD (don't be fooled when they say the smaller chip is better technology, not!) Many people will love this camera and say they get great pictures with it. With the right know-how and software you can get excellnt images with a 2-3 MP camera. It's cute and does have a great amount of features (why I gave it 3 stars). If you want better images get one of the new SLR's.For your money stay with what you have ( 2-3 MP) or spend half the money and get a 3 or 4 MP (from [Amazon.com]) and wait for a better product from Nikon or something from the competition that's more reasonably priced..."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix S5000 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["It didn't do what I thought it was going to do<br /> But it's OK","Exactly as advertised  Al;so a very fast delivery.

My brother will be very happy because his S5000 quit working and couldn't afford to replace it.<br />Thank you very much for pricing it as you did.<br />Mtnhopper","We purchased this camera for use at the factory to take pictures for work instructions, sample boards and other various uses.  Works great and as intended.  There's a multitude of setting controls to ensure we can get good pictures in most kinds of lighting you can find in a large industrial environment.<br /><br />The biggest complaint is that with most other Fuji brand cameras, they use the xD memory cards which aren't as easy to find as more standard formats like SD or microSD, and generally cannot find that hold larger amounts of memory.  So if you plan on taking a large amount of photos at high quality settings without a nearby computer to transfer the files off the memory card, you'll want to purchase multiple cards.","Sweet, It was a great buy just lucky to grab it for what they wanted for it! Wish they had more.","I use this daily for work as a small town journalist photographer. Does NOT do well in low light situations.","I bought this camera years ago and it worked well as a beginner camera to get started in photography. The quality of photos produced by this camera are VERY out of date. 5.1MP is now MUCH less than what you get from your standard cell phone camera. At the time I purchased this camera, cell phones were just getting big (I don't think I even had a camera on my cell phone at the time). It also does not have a detachable lens, which is a major downfall for this camera.","I couldn't have gotten a better deal than with this camera. It's very lite to carry and easy to use.","For my money this is a great little Camera for general all around usage, certainly not for high professional use.","I bought this camera many years ago and it still works after 6 years! the pictures are excellent and the camera is sound and longlasting! If this camera is still on sale it is a good option!","Excellent camera.  Does an outstanding job on scenic shots with good color rendition and clear pictures.  I've used it to take scenics of farms, fields, and some shots of red tail hawks and it has performed well.  Good battery life using standard alkaline AA batteries.<br /><br />update: Apr 2013  - I have come across an issue that caused me to lower my rating.  I'm using a class 10 card and this camera writes too slow for real action shots.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I never had the issue with my previous Fuji, not do I have it with the HS25 I bought.","This was a GREAT camera. It took phenomenal pictures. I really loved it. It had very nice features and was easy to use.","Just today I noticed I never review this? Shame too. A very nice camera. Created wonderful images. Fuji did a great job. I look back on images I took years ago with this camera and still enjoy the quality and color. I moved onto larger dslr camera. But that is this cameras only fault for me. Small images.","The book for the camera is available online, but difficult to understand unless you know all the technical jargon.  For the price, it is excellent, a great camera for us to learn on.  But the pixels are too few for really excellent shots.","The Fujifilm Finepix S5200 does everything well .. it just a well rounded little camera. The video is one of main reasons I bought it .. It will withstand being beside a 1400 HP blown Alcohol V8 engine and record the crackle of the pipes while capturing the distinctive blower whine with no distortion... try that with more expensive camera's you just get static.","I've had mine for 7 years I think? just passed 11,000 pictures taken.  This camera is amazing.  The stock lens is A+.  I have 2 attachable lens (wideangle and zoom) but don't need them.  Pretty much set to \"auto\" and it does it for you.  There is a \"high speed\" shutter setting that makes it somewhat like SLR with good light.  I've used it wakeboarding, fishing, skiing, mountain biking, etc etc... its been everywhere with me.  Like I said 11K pics so far, I consider it disposable and will buy an replacement when I drop it in the drink(lake) what have you.<br /><br />At my wedding outside of Las Vegas, up on a Mountain at sunset.  We had 5 people there - My Bride, Me, Limo driver, Minister, Professional Photographer.  She(pro) had 3 SLRs with all kind of lens.  I handed my S5200 to the limo driver and said \"just put it on auto and take whatever\".  We ended with 200 Professional pictures and 75 S5200 taken by limo driver.  The 3 best were from the S5200.  That may be luck, maybe he(limo) was at better angle than her(pro).. But to even compete with a pro is outstanding.<br /><br />We wakeboard and take it every time.  Hand it to anyone and you'll end up with some great pics.  Of course with any digital camera you take way too many, because its free.  It will support a 2gb xd mini only (I think).  I have the original 1gb xd.  You can take 1K pics or so on 1gb.  Video eats up the space.  To the video:<br /><br />This camera takes excellent video.  You get 7-15 minutes with 1gb.  So- if you want to use it for this buy extra xds.  Great Video!!<br /><br />It's tough.  I babied it for a year, got a little looser a 2 years later, then it went wherever.  Now I'm and 11,000 pictures taken.  If I lose it oh well, I'll buy one for 150-200 whatever.<br /><br />I took 400 pictures in Glacier Nation Park this summer on a tour(cool red wagon things).  My brother had his new Nikon SLR.  He took about as many.  If you looked through them you couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />Best camera ever!","I just love it and did not have to get a mortgage for it. The pictures have the high quality I was expecting and the camera is easy to operate. Thank you!","Back around 03 this camara was so far ahead of others  , the pictures I took with mine stand up to 12 megs easy as far as image apperance. The only reason Ive updated was for movies. I still have it and it still works great,25,000 pictures later. The new Fujs have lost the edge they once had.","Gosh, I sure wish Fuji still made this camera. Mine is 7 years old; has taken over 15,000 pictures all over the world, including some extreme shots, and it has always performed wonderfully.<br />I've taken it with me via snowmobile, bicycle, xc skis, snowshoes, Jeep, scooter, etc. I have used it to photograph nature, people, weddings, scenery...<br />It was a replacement issued to me by Best Buy after my Sony Mavica (floppy disc drive!) went kaput. I had the extended warranty, and insisted on a camera with zoom qualities like the Mavica. The Best Buy people handed me this camera for \"free\" in 2004.<br />It's a workhorse. I use rechargeable AA batteries. My 1st set lasted 6 years; just replaced them. It just keeps going and going, and when I need to recharge, I slip the 4 batteries in the wall charger, and away I go again.<br />The battery hatch is now held in place with a rubber band, as I dropped the camera on concrete last year.  : (<br />I wish everything was as reliable as my Fuji S5000. Thanks, Fuji. Well done.","After using the point and shoot camera for a decade, I wanted to try a digital SLR. Once I saw the prices, this was my compromise. For the first year or so, we were really happy with it. The only complaint we have it that it will not take a focused picture with the flash off.<br />5 years latter: four brand new batteries last literally 10 minutes. About half that time if we use rechargeable batteries. I only use the camera if I have about 8 to 16 rechargeable batteries ready to go for a short birthday party. Otherwise, a camera phone today takes pictures of similar quality (without the zoom).","I've had this camera since like 2003 and its still my main camera (I cant afford a new one) and I finally decided to write a little review since I realized how pleased I am with it. I have had it for so long and have used the hell out of it and it is still going strong. Now I see the going price for these is around $170, I would say its still worth as much as a new cameras in the same class.<br /><br />The picture quality is excellent, especially on the highest resolution settings, and the camera is easy to learn what it takes to get a good shot. I went through a stage where I thought the quality wasn't good enough because I've seen other images from high end Canons and Nikons and such -- of course the images are not that level of smoothness and color balance -- but I have still taken countless shots that leave my mouth open because I am so impressed by the quality.<br /><br />The battery life is also very good for this camera, but only after you realize that you need to get good batteries like Energizer e Lithium and such (this camera holds 4). I remember when I finally put in some $17 Energizers, because I wanted to make sure my camera lasted through a wedding I was taking photos for -- I ended up taking over 700 pictures that weekend -- and the batteries lasted me about three weeks!!! I didn't use the flash that much.<br /><br />Another point about image quality: I eventually began using a .45X wide angle high definition lens with macro and I noticed the image quality is consistently and considerably better with each shot I took, and I get a little bit more in each shot. The light quality is better with the lens, thats for sure.<br /><br />I think thats about it. The camera has several settings but its not that complex. You can control all the basics and its pretty logical.<br /><br />SUCH A GOOD CAMERA. I will only get a new one when I get enough to buy a $900 Nikon or something.<br /><br />If you are considering buying a camera for a novice and are spending $200 or so for a Wal-Mart special, I would say get this camera because its so good and worth it.","I bought this camera used, and it is just terrific.  I am a beginner, and I can't imagine learning on anything else.  The guy I bought it from said he broke into photography on it too.  One of the best features is the macro setting for close up.  It takes some practice, but once you accomplish it, your pictures look very professional.  I would really recommend it for beginning and those wanting a camera that takes good close ups.  It also takes great landscape pics as well.","I purchased this camera for my wife for Christmas.  She loves it.  It is very easy to use and takes great pictures even in the dark.  It is the quiickest camera I have seen from the time you turn it on to bbeing ready to take that first picture.  In a special moment, we won't miss out on any pictures waiting for the camera to come on.  To my surprise, I was expecting a camera and memory card.  It came with so much more.  It had a tripod, rechargable batteries with a home and auto charger, and a carrying case.  Great product.  Thanks!","Great zoom. Standard batteries. Easy to use. Even takes decent videos. Lots of features with some I'll probably never use. Priced right.","The pictures come out in really good quality, but the opening time it takes for the camera to turn on and be ready to take the first picture REALLY SUCKS. The LCD screen is also very small, unlike the other high class fuji film S700 which is very large.","I have had this camera for 3 years now.  I had been using a Fuji before and had been happy with it so opted to go with the same brand when I wanted an upgrade.<br /><br />I dont use many of the settings...I'm just an amateur photographer.  I have used the video, which works well.<br /><br />The shutter was quick enough to let me get a shot of a bowler (in the game of cricket), clean bowling a batsman.  Sweet!<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have liked it to be lighter and smaller.<br /><br />The zoom works very well.  A better flash would have been a good feature.  But I am overall happy with my purchase, and it has gone all over the world with me.","This camera is a great next step for someone considering moving up from a simple point and shoot camera.  While it still has easy automatic settings it allows you to have full manual input as well.  I really liked how I can control the ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and can even focus manually (although manual focus is a bit slow.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Manual controls<br />-video time only limited by card space<br />-Great zoom<br />-Great Macro ability<br />-Really good image quality, making solid prints up to 11x14<br />-good feel...solid...can really wrap your hands around it.<br />-Lots of dedicated external buttons to control exposure, ISO, and other settings...no need to hunt through lame menus for most commonly used adjustments.<br />-Uses easy to find AA batteries.<br /><br />Con:<br />-not quite an SLR.<br />-slower manual focus (most cameras in this range don't have manual focus at all)...auto focus is quite fast.<br />-Can't slip it in your pocket.","I recently bought a used S5000. It was a small upgrade. I am very pleased with the photos that I've printed. Although I would highly suggest buying a larger memory card. I don't upload very often so I needed a larger card than my 128MB. I searched to see if I could use a 2GB type M+. I couldn't find any information on the M+ but research said that the M would work. I even called Fuji and they couldn't tell me. I took a chance and it works like a charm. At 3M I can get more than 2500 photos with the M+. Get the upgrade at $25, it's worth it.","I have taken many thousands of pictures with this over the last few years and I am amazed by what a good camera this is. If your a beginner it works great with the auto setting but for more advanced users you can change everything and get the perfect shot. It always takes good shots indoors and out, still objects and fighter jets and takes them very good. Very happy with it and it won't let you down.","Excelente cámara solo que los menú de enfoque digital son un tanto complicados... una camara para principiantes que deseen conocer la fotografia paso a paso y que deseen profundizar...","I've got so many good things to say about this Camera, I really don't know where to start.<br /><br />I bought this camera 3 years ago. I hadn't really had any experience with any Fuji cameras before. I had played around with my friends' cameras before I bought this camera; they had Non-SLR Hi-Zoom cameras that were made for medium duty photography. Many of these cameras were Canons or Nikons with lots of zoom and nice features. So eventually I decided to buy a camera in this same class, just I didn't know which one. So rather than searching for a digital camera based solely on the popularity of the name, I decided to take a shot at this product based on the Specs and Features that it had. At the time this camera had more features, options, and abilities than other cameras in its class. So I decided to buy this Fujifilm S5200 right here on Amazon.<br /><br />3 years later... NO REGRETS. Ever since the first week I received this camera, I fell in love with it and all of the options it had in it. When I want a camera that I can just take some quick everyday pictures, it's GREAT. When I want a camera that I can take some technical, high-quality images, it's AWESOME! The S5200 can be simple and fun for you, BUT also complex and technical if you want it to be so. It is an EXREMELY versatile camera.<br /><br />It has TONS of Optical Zoom, as well as the Digital Zoom on top of that. I must say, if you choose to use the Digital Zoom (and zoom in even furthermore) you will NOT be disappointed. The Digital Zoom processor in these Fujifilm cameras is Excellent in my opinion. I have digitally zoomed into many objects and taken pictures of them that are still very clear and impressive. The S5200 has Digital Zoom with noticeably LESS graininess than its competitors. And of course its Fujinon 10X Optical Zoom lens has beautiful flawless clarity. NO SHORTCOMINGS with the S5200's zoom system.<br /><br />Many options to play with Exposure, ISO, shutter speeds, many flash options, etc. You can also choose to do sound recordings and video recordings! Single Shot, Multiple Shot, and Continuous Shot picture taking modes. The S5200 uses 4x AA batteries, alkaline OR rechargeable Nickel-Metal Hydride. And I can tell you from experience, that the power consumption of this camera is FAR more efficient than its Nikon and Canon competitors. I have gone through days where I took hundreds of pictures (some with flash, some without) and I still had a little battery power left.<br /><br />There are various Automatic Focus modes, as well as Manual Focus whenever you so desire. NOTE: Don't get confused with the Big Fat lens on this camera! The Manual Focus is adjusted electronically with 2 buttons, NOT ON A FOCUS RING (as there is none). Adjusting the Manual Focus with the 2 Buttons works just fine in my opinion.<br /><br />The camera is very sturdy and durable, though of course be gentle with it as you would with all electronics. Nothing loose or flimsy and cheap. Over my 3 years owning and using this, nothing has gone wrong. Nothing broken, nothing loose, nothing cracked. You can buy a nice black leather case made by Fujifilm specially to encase the Fuji S series cameras. Fuji also makes a Wide-Angle Lens adapter for the S5200, if you want to do wide shots of landscapes and such.<br /><br />The final thing I must comment on about this whole experience is VERY important. The camera Drivers and Fujifilm FinePix Software have both performed EXCELLENT. The drivers work great and they never glitched up or caused any problems with my PC. The computer reads the S5200 instantly and boom you're good to go. You can transfer the pictures via Windows reading the S5200 as removable storage OR you can have the awesome, straight-forward FinePix software move them over for you.<br /><br />At first I was somewhat skeptical about the FinePix software. But I ended up playing with the software eventually, messing around with its features and such. I end up finding out that it's actually a very GOOD and USEFULL piece of software. It's got options that let you manage the interfacing of the camera to your computer. The FinePix software also has a great set of features for adjusting and tweaking your photos to perfection. You can view all the technical details of a photo and adjust many qualities of photos easily and quickly right there in the software. What I like most about the FinePix software is the set of tools which greatly help me organize my photos. Rotation, File Numbering, Resolution Adjustments, etc. are as easy as 1-2-3 for just 1 file or multiple files. A surprisingly good piece of software from Fujifilm!<br /><br />5/5 STARS, no doubt in my mind!<br />Thank you Fujifilm for this great product!<br />Thank you Amazon for a great price!","I am using this for the last 2 years.This camera is a great one.Its worth it.<br />If you are someone looking for a sleek camera, pls dont waste time looking at this.<br />But , if you are some one serious about photography, this i sthe one for you.","This is a very good camera, unfortunately Fuji has stopped production of this model... it is very good for starters to learn about photography and slowly move towards a DSLR mode i guess...i have used this camera for last three years and now i have a broken battery lid.. which is due to th eplastic body.. i feel this is the only drawback this camera has other wise this is really a good handy camera....","It might seem a little odd to write a review now (October  2008) on a camera I bought over 4 years ago (March 2004), but I am just so impressed with the Fuji S5000's performance over the years. We have used this camera almost daily in our business (to take product photos) and for personal use, including trips around the US, Europe, and South America.<br /><br />This camera had many advanced features for when it was made that still hold up today:<br /><br />* Sharp 3.1 MP Image (prints up to 8 x 10)<br />* Great 10x Zoom Lens (really sharp pictures)<br />* Movie and Sound Capture<br />* Great Battery Life<br /><br />Sure, you can get higher end cameras now but I wouldn't hesitate to get one of these used for a backup or \"beater\" camera for the kids.<br /><br />Simply a great, reliable camera that has held up well over time.","A friend had this camera - we were so impressed we found it used for about $150.  Shoots pictures FAST and has a great zoom. Since we seem to destroy a camera in about a year - no sense paying $500 for the latest model.","I love this camera.  This camera is the best camera I have ever used.  It does night shots, sports/action shots, zooms in 10x.  I have owed it for over 4 years.  At first I bought it to take photos of my Siamese kittens.  I get perfect shots with no red eyes. The Fuiji lens is terrific for taking pictures of animals w/o eye glare.  This camera also has manual settings for more experienced users.  I am in a college photo class (B & W film) and was able to use this camera to aid in the film shots.<br />I cannot say enough good things about this camera.  We used it to document pregnancy and after our son was born,  soccer games, wildlife shots, flowers and butterfly pictures.  I have used it to take pictures of my  dashboard in my new van and the pictures come out great.  It takes good video clips. I bought a lemon.<br /><br />I unfortunately have to replace this camera.  I paid 380.00 for it new and 99.00 for the 1GB XD memory card. That was over 4 years ago though.  I just order the Fuiji S8100fd to replace this camera. This is more advanced camera w/ 10 megapixels.  After using this camera w/o any problems I will always replace it with another Fuiji.  They are really good cameras.  It has been dropped on pavement and it still worked.  It also fell off kitchen table and still worked. (Not recommended)  It is a pretty tough camera. I have 3 children.  My 14 year old uses this camera also.  I wish I didn't forget thsi camera in the diaper bag with a leaky sippy cup of milk.","This camera just keeps getting better and better the more I learn about it.  The 10x optical zoom is great for theme parks and zoo's and such, or a number of other events and circumstances.  Takes great picutres, and is very easy to use.  Owners manual is helpful and easy to understand.  Highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants seriously excellent personal picutres.","Ok, so the 5200 is 5MP instead of 6 and it doesn't have Optical IS but it still beats my Canon S3IS in 1) Low Light and 2) Photo Sharpness. If you look at my S3 review you'll see that's important to me. I've always been a Fuji FinePix fan for it's sharpness. This is the standard I juge all other camera's by. For some reason, a lot of people don't recognize Fuji. I can't say all of the FinePix line is great, my wife's F470 SUCKS for sharpness. The 5200 is getting harder to find and a new camera generally costs more than the S3. That is Fuji's fault in my opnion. Why they didn't put Optical IS is beyond me, but it is still a great camera.","I have owned this wonderful camera for about a year now, and have no complaints!  It takes amazing photos.  There are so many different settings, from \"portrait\" to \"outside\" to \"action\" that I can capture anything I want with wonderful results.  I have 3 kids that are always moving and I can get non-blurry pics of them!  It's good enough that I've taken wedding pictures that turned out better than the professional photographers!  And the prints?  Wow!  For the price, there isn't a better digital camera on the market.  And the fact that it takes 4 \"AA\" batteries may be a turn-off for some.  But let me tell you, when you're in the middle of nowhere and your battery dies, it's nice to know that a trip to the store can get you up and running again!","I've had the Fuji S5000 for four years now and love it.  In fact, over the summer I purchased the new Olympus 18x optical zoom and took it back as other than the greater zoom I didn't like it as much as my S5000.  When I purchased it it was just under $300 and the best bang for buck in my opinion.  There were other cameras with more megapixels or other features, but I wanted that balance between quality and price and I got it.  This is a sturdy camera that I've taken all over the world traveling with me as well as every backpacking trip, canoe trip, snowball fight, etc.  Just over the weekend it got buried in the snow - I brushed it off and kept snapping.<br /><br />I have to admit, I am starting to look at new cameras because I'd like more megapixels, but all the cameras have to compare to the S5000 as sturdy, quick, and great pictures.<br /><br />This is a good camera that will take nice wildlife photos (not WONDERFUL - that's where the bang for buck comes in - it's still for the hobbyist) - I've got moose, bald eagles, deer and lots of fun ones of the new puppy.<br /><br />I give this camera 5 stars because you're getting what you pay for - a sturdy camera with adequate megapixels and a nice 10x optical zoom lens.<br /><br />~L'aura","I've had this camera for over a year now.  I went from a mediocre handheld pocket sized camera to this and I love it.  It has amazing picture quality and you can do so much with it.  It's amazing for nature pictures.<br />The only thing I would say about this camera is if you get it take the time to learn how to use it.  I went from basically a point-and-shoot camera to this and there are sooo many settings on there I'm still learning (but that's my fault because I've just begun to really sit down with the booklet) and it has so much potential.  The past year I've taken great pictures (compared to the old) but I'm realizing that with all this camera can do if you just know what settings to use you can take amazing pictures.<br />It's really a great value for the price and I highly recommend it.","I have had this camera for 3 years now, it replaced a Kodak digital that broke. I have been pleased from the first day it arrived. It had been through a lot (Key west, Disney, DC, NY etc) of vacations. It has been abused, bumped, dropped, gotten wet, kids sticky fingers and it still works great. If you are looking for a great deal for a DSLR style camera, this is it, look no further, because this camera is IT. This camera can also provide you with a great learning experience, no only will it tell you when the shutter speed is too fast, but it can even tell you if the aperture is not enough to take a excellent photo, and with 3.1 effective megapixels, your photos will print out better than Kodak prints. ...<br />I now have the Nikon D80 and this has now been promoted to teaching tool for the kids to learn photography. I would recommend this camera to anyone wanting a quality camera at a reasonable price.<br /><br />I also recommend getting a 1GB xd card.","I love this camera. When I reluctantly decided to change from film to digital, I found this camera. I have sold many photo's with this camera. It's a better outside camera. Takes awesome pictures. You can't beat the color. Learn all the settings too. Manuel mode is a joy. Great color. Fun to learn to get back to the basics of taking pictures. I wish it was as good indoors with a flash. I am now looking at a DSLR just because of the need for a faster camera with a flash. This will always be my back-up until it no longer works. I highly recommended this camera to anyone. You won't be sorry.","This is a great camera, but I have found out the the flash is not strong enough in dark areas at a distance. I have taken great pictures with this camera and hope to find a stronger flash for it.","Its not an SLR. But you aren't buying an SLR.  Overall its worth the cash.  Better pics can be taken with an 80$ pawn shop film SLR.  But nothing better digital wise without breaking your wallet can be had.<br /><br />i do love this camera.  but once digital SLRs are out, I will dorp it like a bad habit.  Until then, I love it.","It makes really good pictures, RAW of JPEG. You're gonna like it! It's light and easy to simply point and shoot, but if you're into experimenting the creative modes, way to go! I only sold it cause I bought a more advanced one.","this camara is the best i have ever had. now i am having a lot of fun and have a lot of picture and videos to share","Fuji S5200 Pretty decent camera if you can deal with XD memory.<br /><br />The s5200 at only 5 megapixels is getting as one review so succinctly put it, \"a little past it's freshness date\", but the camera does have a few nice attributes and you might be able to get one on clearance, as I did, for a small fraction of the original price, and on that basis you may find it a good deal if you can get past a few minor nags (most notably XD memory).<br /><br />PROs<br /><br />- Snappy autofocus and shot to shot times, even when compaired with other current cameras (a very pleasant surprise for a camera which is a few years old).<br /><br />- Electronic viewfinder with nice diopter adjust.  (I can use it without my glasses, which is good because using it with my glasses let's in stray light, making it harder to see in daylight).<br /><br />- Fuji `Super CCD' has at least a full stop better noise performance and better dynamic range and color than most other inexpensive 10:1 and 12:1 super-zooms (shoot at ISO 400 with ISO 200 or 100 quality).<br /><br />- RAW mode capture can really take advantage of the wide dynamic range of the CCD (at clearance prices, the s5200 is a fairly inexpensive way to get this feature, normally only available on more expensive models).<br /><br />- Good Lens (sharp and not too much purple fringing).<br /><br />- Better Quality at 5MP than many 6MP and 7MP cameras.<br /><br />- 55mm filters screw right on (no adaptor needed like many point and shoot cameras)<br /><br />- If you want a nice 26.6mm equivalent wide angle (instead of the default 38-380), the awesome Kodak \"SCHNEIDER-KREUZNACH XENAR 0.7X Wide-Angle Lens, 55 mm\" sold here on Amazon will screw right on like it was made for this camera (no adaptor of any sort needed). This lens is a bit pricey, but is MUCH better than those cheapy add-on wide angle lenses, and under most conditions gives quality very close to the original lens but wider. (It's about a $110 bucks, but I saved enough on the clearance price of the camera to more than pay for it).  Note that the schneider addon lens has the same issues with partially blocking the POP up flash as were mentioned in it's Amazon review, but works great for really wide angle 'natural light' shots due to the s5200's higher ISO capability.<br /><br />CON's<br /><br />- Larger than other 10:1 cameras that have lens that telescopes into body (big plus however is no worries about messing up lens mechanism).<br /><br />- Really dumb user interface (things you need like FORMAT and RAW buried on sub-sub menus)<br /><br />- RAW mode is a little slow and eats up expensive XD memory card space(4 or 5 seconds per shot and 90 pictures or so per 1GB card) but this is on a par with most other point and shoot models.<br /><br />- Very Small main LCD display by current standards and the alternate EVF can be a bit hard to see in daylight (even though it's still much better then the main LCD).<br /><br />- Supplied RAW converter software is just about useless (but several FREEWARE programs support the camera including s7raw and the famous high quality DCraw command line program).<br /><br />- XD memory<br /><br />What's the bottom line?  Given all the considerable plusses and seemingly minor minuses would I buy the same camera again?<br /><br />SORRY, NOT ON YOUR LIFE!<br /><br />Why? (Probably sounds pretty good right?)<br /><br />I highly recommend you take a pass on the s5200 (and ANY other camera that uses XD), unless you are a big Fuji or Olympus fan and are already stuck with XD memory.<br /><br />The XD memory card comes very close to that old computer programming magazine April 1 issue announcement of the invention of the \"Write-Only Memory\" (a funny April fools joke, but NOT so funny in real life).<br /><br />I have had a half dozen digital cameras with both CF and SD memory cards, and have NEVER lost even a single image, or had a card fail in more than 4 years, but in only about a month of shooting with `XD' I have had images get corrupted or lost a half dozen times and have already had an XD card totally fried when I committed the apparently unpardonable sin of plugging it into a supposedly fully `XD compatible' card reader (That works PERFECTLY by the way with both CF cards and SD cards).<br /><br />Apparently one reason that external card readers work so poorly with XD is that Fuji and Olympus never released the design info, and then to make matters worse, they made incompatible changes like `type M' and `type H' cards (These cards won't even work right in some Fuji and Olympus cameras, so how are the poor card reader folks supposed to figure things out?) I guess the type H cards were to try to be as fast as SD (they're NOT), and type M was just to try to save a few bucks (for THEM you silly ninny NOT for YOU, because XD cards sell for 2 to 4 times what equivalent SD cards sell for).<br /><br />Don't `hot-plug' the memory (which is fine with SD and CF) or you'll loose your pictures (and if you hit the jackpot destroy the XD card completely).<br /><br />Don't try to download with an external card reader, unless you know it works with EXACTALLY that type and size XD card (shouldn't cost more than a couple $40 dollar cards to find out if your reader works if your lucky).<br /><br />Don't even try to download from the camera without that AC adaptor (that they didn't bother to supply) or very freshly charged batteries, because downloading big RAW files over the SLOW USB port takes FOREVER, and if the batteries die, so will the card and your pictures most likely.<br /><br />So, despite my favorable impression of the s5200's image quality, and general willingness to overlook it's other slight imperfection, if I had it to do over again I would NOT buy this camera again knowing now what a joy it is working (or more often NOT WORKING) with XD memory cards.<br /><br />To put things in perspective, if someone told me tomorrow that there was a new Fuji or Olympus camera with an incredible 40:1 F1.4 zoom with flawless optical performance, with a new Zuper-Duper CCD that could shoot at ISO 6000 with NO NOISE, and that it only cost 100 dollars (but that this miracle camera could ONLY use XD memory), then I just might be slightly tempted, but probably would PASS on it.<br /><br />Remember Jack Nicholson's great line in `Terms of Endearment'<br /><br /> -  \"I'd rather stick needles in my eyes!\"<br /><br />That's how much I despise XD memory, now that I have had to deal with it.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are already used to dealing with XD from another Fuji or Olympus product (you're a better man than I am Charley Brown), then I DO recommend the s5200 if you can find one on clearance, because aside from the hated XD memory issues, it performs quite well and can take some really awesome images (especially in RAW mode).","I saw a lot of reviews and finally decide to buy this. Just confirm what the reviews say. Amazing superzoom and the capabilities in auto mode. I have made photos in a lot of different conditions with great results (Dark, in motion, bright, indoors, from the car in motion, etc.). I defintly recommed this camera for an enthusiatic who want to try something between point and shot and SLR. I think this is a great choice also to experiment and play with different shutting speeds and apertures. It's like a mini SLR's with a nice auto mode for times when you do not have chance to experiment. You can even buy aditional lens an filters for more great shots. For me this one works as my first serious camera.<br /><br />Also the compact design it's great because I did not want a camera that made me think if I should leave it at home or take it?<br /><br />Love the short time between shots.<br /><br />Love the batteries life.<br /><br />And love the price.<br /><br />The only cons I see it's the editing software. It is no really good but, you can get one aftermarket..","I usually start by stating in bullet points why I like this camera.=, follow by what I don't like, and would I buy it again?  Blah Blah.<br /><br />This review, I'd start with the little things I don't like, first....<br /><br />1) The built in flash, while not user friendly and bright, IS NOT bright enough for many in door or cludy day shooting purposes.  It would be perfect if the S5000 came with flash shoe adapter.<br /><br />2) Everytime you take out the batteries, it resets itself, no more time, date, month, year and Resolutions.  Have to set all up again.  This camera records in 1MP, 3MP, and 6MP. But once the batteries are disconected, it defaults back to 1MP recording.<br /><br />3) Digital Zoom, a bit flaky and grainy and very obviously digital zoom.<br /><br />Now, what's good about Fuji S5000?<br /><br />Absolutely everything else. ABSOLUTELY.<br /><br />10X Optical zoom, great focussing, lively color,lighting,metering, ISO flexibilty, black n white option, comes with a 55mm adapter ring you can fit with UV, and other great stuff like polariser (which I use frequently).<br /><br />Recently I even added in a wide angle converter (because S5000 angle no wide enough) and it's still taking stunning beauties (outdoors only tho)<br /><br />I even won 2 amatuer award for some pictures I took with this camera.<br /><br />I know you can get it anymore as its an obsolete model, but watch out for Fuji S9000.  It should be the next best thing after S5000.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by S5500, S5100, or S7000.  They higher in resolution but don't take as good photos, my opinion anyway (used them too) but stuck to S5000.  If Fuji comes out with later versions of S9000, I'll get one.  The S9000 is the same bulk and size, and weight as an actual DSLR already but still lack certain SLR functions (ie. lens change, flexible aperture priority, etc), so might as well get EOS400 (Rebel 10MP), if you want to get the S9000","This is a great little camera. The shots are easy to take and view. Great price. Thank you.","This is a very good product. Suitable for an amatuer photographer who wants to excel. This is like a mini DSLR.","Very Big Bang for the Buck.<br /><br />Surprisingly versatile for a consumer level Super Zoom P&S camera.<br /><br />The result right out of the box at default settings are good.<br /><br />If you read the manual, and know something about photography, it really rocks.<br /><br />It is no DLSR, but it is the kind of camera you can hand to beginner and they can do quite well.<br /><br />As they learn more it has the capacity to allow them to grow and experiment.<br /><br />It is light, quite compact and durable.<br /><br />Actually it make a perfect vacation camera for when you want to go light and easy.<br /><br />It made a perfect Gateway Digicam and led me to get my DLSR.<br /><br />But I wll still keep the Fuji for those trips to Miami :)","Beautiful pictures, lightweight and very easy to use. This is also Consumer Reports best buy pick.","I think this would be an excellent camera but I have not had the time to read the instruction manual.  It is not the best if all you want to do is point and shoot.  You need to know a little about photography.  I am a little disappointed with the 10x optical zoom.  I thought I would be able to zoom in close to take photos of birds, etc - but it just doesn't seem to zoom in very much.  It could just be me though because I don't know how to use it except in automatic mode.","This camera has been great so far, after 2+ months.  It does not seem to use much battery power, despite frequent use.  Zoom is awesome.  The prints come amazingly close to the quality seen on the screen.  Not as quick from click to picture as hoped, but still good.  Video quality good.  Quite satisfied.","I got my S5200 last September through Amazon.  I was upgrading from a HP Photosmart 320 (low MP point-&-shoot) and didn't know much about this class of camera.  Most of my camera time is spent getting shots of my 17 month-old son and the HP was not keeping up.  After extensive research, reviewing an endless stream of customer and semi-professional reviews, I took the plunge and ordered this one.<br /><br />I like the construction of this camera.  I found that for the price and features (and % of positive reviews), the closest comparable camera was the Kodak Easyshare Z740.  The Z740 and several other similar class cameras all had the cheesy gray plastic shells that most cell phones have.  This makes them seem flimsy and delicate.  The black, hardened plastic of this Fuji, coupled with the rubberized grip around the lense tube (for lack of a better term) give this camera a sturdier feel and more professional appearance.<br /><br />Since I am not an experienced photographer and only have experience with low-end point-&-shoot cameras, I spent a lot of time with the owner's manual.  I am inclined to figure out most new gadgets with ease, but the many settings and features of this camera are scattered amongst different buttons and on-screen menus in an illogical manner, so I needed help.<br /><br />The auto mode meets most of my needs in good light and is fair in low light without the flash.  Outdoors in sunlight, high speed movement is captured well with no blur.  I tested this by photographing cars traveling 65+ miles on a nearby freeway and experienced no blurring (not even on their wheel rims).  You will need to keep the camera still or on a tripod in low light to minmize blurring and attain an accurate autofocus, but for this price range, it is reasonable.<br /><br />The long zoom is VERY cool and reveals a wide range of details in distant subjects that are hidden from the naked eye.  A full zoom roof shot of a highrise building several blocks away and in the last stages of construction revealed previously invisible construction personnel on scissorlifts, unnoticed ladders, and the a/c unit mounted on the side of the cab of one of the work site's tower cranes.  So cool...<br /><br />While the highest ISO setting is 1600, I have found that for my purposes, 400 seems to yield the best results with the least amount of high-res grainy fuzz or \"noise.\"  Most of my shots are taken using the auto mode with the autofocus, but I am learning more about the benefits of using the manual focus while adjusting the exposure time.  As time allows, I'll learn how to use the manual aperature settings to my advantage.<br /><br />The manual focus is not well designed and kept me from giving this camera 5 stars.  When another button that works like a keyboard's \"shift\" key is held down, the zoom buttons act as the focus controls.  Instead of a fluid transition, the focus advances and retards very slowly in small increments that are audible if you listen closely.<br /><br />The awful decision by Fuji to include an XD memory card that is only 16 pathetic megabytes is very disappointing.  You won't come close to this camera's full potential until you upgrade to at least a 512 megabyte card.  This will yield approximately 220 photos in the highest (non-RAW) resolution settings.  The video feature isn't even worth using until you upgrade this card.<br /><br />The video mode is actually pretty good.  My 512 card allows just over 7 minutes of good quality video with non-stereo sound.  I continue to acquire great and humorous clips of my son being himself.<br /><br />If you are new to this class of camera, I recommend budgeting in a decent but inexpensive case (Samsung from Walmart?), a tripod, and a lense cleaning kit.  My son has a habit of smearing his greasy fingertips on my lense when I loom in too close to get a good shot, so the cleaning kit was a must.<br /><br />If you're a professional and looking for a money-making camera, this camera is on the low end of the spectrum and not for you.  If you are a hobbyist or amateur who is on a real-world budget, this camera is a great investment.<br /><br />I still have much to learn about this camera and its potential.  There are many features that I cannot yet speak of intelligently, but I expect to unlock their secrets and further improve the quality of my photos.  I hope this review helps you.","This camera is great! It replaced a HP 3.1MP that took OK pictures but the backgrounds were dark and people's faces were not the correct color, not so with my new Fuji, my photos are just as you see them.<br /><br />I just wish there were a rating higher than 5!","I cannot believe the quality of camera I got for the price.  It makes great pictures, it's fairly simple to use.  I highly recommend this camera!","I purchased this camera 5 months ago to replace a Sony Digital and Nikon Film Camera, I have not been disapointed. Indoor pictures without a flash, auto focus, natural light, all make this camera a pleasure to use. Outdoor wildlife with the 10x zoom for Coyote and White Tail Deer and landscape mode for scenery is a delight. Battery life with rechargables is 350-400 pictures. This camera is loaded with features for both the beginner and advanced photographer.","Pluses: Great images, quite versatile, best battery life I have ever seen! I think this might be the best inexpensive camera I have owned to date.<br /><br />Imager produces good clear saturated colors.  Zoom is fast and easy to \"thumb\" - auto focus works very well.  Lightweight.<br /><br />But... Needs a big after market xD card.  Not the best speed for shutter delay (press-to-photograph time) but it's better than a lot of cameras in the same price range.<br /><br />Overall, a VERY good buy","for the money this is a good camera but I like my finepix S5000 better maybe after I use it more they may be the same.still a good buy.","I recently purchased my Fugifilm Camera and I am extremely pleased with it. I like the 10x Optical Zoom and the fact it stabilizes the camera and you do not get a distorted picture without using a tri-pod.","Very easy to use camera.  A camera for a step above basic amateurs.","Very lightweight, sharp photos, a lot of versatility and easy to use.  We are very happy with the purchase and would recommend this product to anyone.","Whenever I show people my photos, invariably their first question is: \"What kind of camera do you have?  These are beautiful!\"  My adult children requested the same camera for Christmas this year.  Mine is the older S5100, so I got them the new S5200.  I'm jealous of their larger display screen and the automatic flash!  Theirs even tells you when the camera isn't steady with this cute little wiggly man!  I'm going to order the newer version for myself now.  I can't imagine switching brands.","I bought this camera for my brother in law. The feature set is great and I really enjoyed using it to take photos. Great choice for someone not quite ready/able to take the step to SLR.  The screen is good quality and it takes great pictures. I own a much older digital camera that is a Canon and after using this Fuji I will consider buying one when I go camera shopping for myself again.","Nice camera , easy to use . I'm still studing how to use it correctly. Also , I have a sony camera of 4.1 megapixels and I think the picture itself has better quality....","The camera is great and was delivered sooner than expected. I have no complaints at all.","This is a great camera for the price, unlike the small pocket models this has a good lens to provide real telefoto shooting. Color is excellent and the Auto setup is all most people will need. Still small enough and very light so it's a perfect travel camera. Comes with a 16meg card, about worthless so get a 250 or 500meg card for less than $30 when you buy. Recharable batteries are also a must these days but don't use the fast chargers if you want long life from these batteries.","My company has found a new camera!  We do surveys that are photo-rich and these cameras are phenomenal!  Very fast, lots of options, sharp photos- right out of the box they are very easy to use.","This was my second digicam from Fuji. It was better than the first one I had.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Amazing image quality<br /><br />Easy to use<br /><br />Manual controll<br /><br />Great manual<br /><br />Came with memory card and batteries<br /><br />Very fast, images showed quickly, little lag time<br /><br />What I didn't like<br /><br />Slow start up of 3 seconds<br /><br />As the camera got old it started crashing, it would shut off at random times","New to the digital camera world, but not a stranger to photography. I am impressed with the camera, the price, the quality, and the pictures I have taken with it. I recommend to purchase more memory right off.","We purchased our S5000 three years ago and it has been to kid's events, drag racing, scenic adventures, and even the beach.<br /><br />It can be setup to do simple things or read the manual and you can make it stand on it's head.  I learned how to do macro shots this year and took some beautiful pictures of my wife's roses.<br /><br />There are definitely better performing units on the market today but for the price this unit is still hard to beat.<br /><br />The price of memory has dropped significantly so get at least a 1GB card and you will be able to take hundreds of shots before downloading.","I have an older Fuji and this new one is twice as powerful as that one, but I don't see a great deal of improvement in the pictures.  Don't get me wrong its a great camera and the batteries last a lot longer in this one, but if you already own a 6X with 2.5 MP you really do not need this particular camera.","I paid $225 out the door for this camera and it competes with cameras almost twice that price!  On the automatic setting, it takes incredible photos, but has the capability to go manual if you are so inclined.  For the price, there is nothing on the market that comes close.  The macro on this camera is great and the close ups I have taken even on the automatic setting are unbelievable.  If you are looking for something that is SLR like, but not the SLR price, this comes close.  Of course, the SLR's will take better photos if you are an expert, but if you are an amateur or intermediate photographer and want something that gets the job done, put this one on your list...taking the price into consideration this thing doesnt disappoint.  You will be glad you purchased this one!","I am pleased with this camera.  Its pretty easy to use.  I have virtually no camera experience, save for breaking them.  This camera is easy to operate and is pretty fun to fool around with.  I have used the aperture setting several times to get different focus points on the pics.  The instructions were easy to comprehend.  I have taken quite a bit of Sports photos and I have noticed its extremely difficult to get shots inside a gymnasium.  The shots are usually very blurry and the color just isn't right most of the time.  Fluorescent modes on the camera are helpful, but do not fix the problem.  It could just be me though.","i like this camera very much is easy to use and gets good results","Reviewed most digital cameras on the market today to replace a worn Olympus.  Decided that this camera fitted my needs even though I had never purchased a Fuji camera before.  I bought it before I made a two-week vacation to Greece.  WOW.  I was stunned by the quality of my pictures.  Colors were unbelievably true to nature.  I love to take low level lighting pictures like at sunset, sunrise, etc.  I couldn't believe<br /><br />the outcome.  It gave me some of the most beautiful shots I have ever made<br /><br />with high priced film cameras.  And I did this on automatic.  No more worries about f stops, speed, etc. for me.","I gave this to my wife for her birthday, and so far no complaints at all.<br /><br />The camera has plenty of functions that you can play with, but it can also work in point and shoot situations.<br /><br />Good quality pictures, and it looks and feels top notch.","I'm using it for a few months now; I haven't found a single problem so far. Earlier, I was using an old FinePix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment. This is not a problem any more. Also, I was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom. In general, I was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out :-). Sure, there are better cameras on the market; however, considering the price it is just a great deal.","Wonderful camara, excellent characteristics, has an ample selection of accessories available and protected by one of you lead in manufacture of camaras and lenses.","I went from taking the camera out of its packing to taking professional quality pictures in twenty minutes.  It's amazing!","I will not repeat what other reviews have stated already, all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc.<br /><br />The only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a Rolex watch.  It is HARD even in Manual mode (and I actually have alot of digital camera experience).  Forget trying to focus in AUTO mode, it won't happen.. at least not without alot of tinkering and stress.<br /><br />If you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items (jewelery, insects, etc.) then I recommend buying a digital SLR camera, Nikon D50 is a good one!  This Fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people, cars, buildings, sites, etc.","These cameras are as simple to use as any I have ever seen and the quality of the pictures are as good or better than cameras costing 3 times as much. Great Buy.","I bought this camera about 3 weeks ago.  I get hired by schools and families to take pictures of highschool athletics teams.  I decided to upgrade from my  Kodak C340 to this when I started getting more requests and jobs.  It's got great capture quality, some of my photos the schools have blown up for posters to 20'' by 30'' and the quality is great.  It's manual shutter setting is good for action shots, it does bursts shots which is fine for what I do.  Low light pictures come out fine with the adjustable ISO (goes up to 1600), shutter speed, and other manual control options.<br /><br />Colors are very vibrant and true.  Good battery life, runs on AA.  Very quick start up time, barely more than 1 to 1.5 seconds tops.  As stated in other reviews manual focus is a little awkward to use at first, but like they stated you get used to it.  Another great quality is the cameras ability to capture in the RAW format, and of course you can lower the quality to different megapixels if you want as well.<br /><br />All my research on this camera before I bought made me a little unsure if this was the camera for me, I was considering buying the Canon Powershot S2 IS 5MP Digital Camera.  But the more I researched it, most people seemed to say one of 3 things about the two cameras, they would say: picture quality is virtually the same, that the Fuji had the Canon beat because of it's high ISO capability, or the Canon had the Fuji beat because of the 12x zoom (the Fuji only has 10x).<br /><br />For me the low price on this one made it worth the buy, but if you really want a Canon, this is not the camera for you, because it's not a Canon, and doesn't operate like one.  Thats not a con in my book, but if you have a preference it's definatley something to consider","To get a camera better than this one you will have to spend at least US$ 120.00 more, but will loose some great features (like the ISO range) this one has. If it had Image Stavilization (IS), 12x zoom and a bigger screen, it would beat any camera on the market.<br /><br />PROS AND CONS.<br /><br />I made my own extensive research on this camera, i even posted it in some forums, if you search for this words \"All about Fujifilm Finepix S5200\" you will find it. From all the reviews i had read I recompiled this PROS and CONS from this camera:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-Very fast shutter (true) and startup (true). (Speed is obviously one of the best features of this camera)<br />-It takes very Sharp pictures.<br />-Great low light performance. (it definitely can see more than me in the dark)<br />-Great control of noise on high ISO.<br />-Fast Auto Focusing.<br />-Capable of getting photos of fast moving subject without blur.<br />-Long Zoom. (yes, too bad is not the longest, other cameras have 12x)<br />-Real color, meaning low saturation (distortion) of color. (it's true, some will find this good, others not)<br />-Good ergonomic, the camera feels great in your hands. (And it looks pretty good too)<br />-Light weight. (other cameras in the super zoom category are quite heavy)<br />-Very customizable settings (nice manual control, except for the manual focus)<br />-Many photography modes to choose from.<br />-Low batteries consumption (very true)<br />-Doesn't use proprietary batteries but 4 AA.<br />-Auto focus assist light.(A powerful one)<br />-RAW Mode, for those who like post-processing.<br />-Auto pop up flash. (Some people find this better to be manual)<br />-Good Video recording with sound.<br />-Excellent price-performance relation, a turning point for many buyers.<br />-Well built, great quality construction. (for most of the people)<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-Grainy picture (because this camera likes selecting high ISO in auto setting)<br />-Use XD picture card which is more expensive (Most of times true) and has slower transfer rate (haven't notice it)<br />-No Image Stabilization. (Many people state it's not needed because the high ISO and speedy shutter, my idea is this combination is called Anti-Blur. Others claims I.S. is better than Anti Blur. I suppose the combination of both would be the best)<br />-Difficult menu. (I don't think so)<br />-RAW mode is hided in the set-up menu. (yes, it should be in the F button menu)<br />-Too slow manual focus. (true, it's better to half press the shutter button and let the camera do the focusing)<br />-Bulky. (as most of the super zoom cameras are, but I find it smaller than what it looks in the pictures)<br />-Weak flash. (average)<br />-Small LCD. (I would say average size)<br />-No swivel LCD screen. (Definitely it is a useful option, I think the S9000 / S9500 have something like it, but it's pricy. The Canon's S2 and S3 are the only competitors having this option, but for higher cost and some limitations compared to the S5200)<br />-Viewfinder don't have enough resolution (maybe the EFV doesn't have great resolution, but it has enough)<br />-No flash hot shoe. (being able to use an add-on flash would had pleased some user not happy with the built-in flash)<br />-Only 3 pictures in continuous shot. (It has a burst mode, all pictures you can take, but at a slower rate)<br />-Not great software, specially the CCD-RAW conversion software.<br />-Lag between shot when using the flash. (Like most cameras)<br />-Made in china, for some reason Chinese are famous for having quality issues. Seems like because the globalization we will have to get used to it. Other Fujifilm cameras were made in Japan and showed great quality and durability; Hope this one does it too. (Should it be considered CONS?)<br />-Battery compartment is a little difficult to close. (nothing you can't get used to)","My first digital was an Olympus Stylus 400, and it served me well for about two years... until I went to a convention and tried to take an great number of indoor pictures and use the zoom.  The Olympus was wholely inadequate.  So, I bought the Fujifilm Finepix S5200 and it's a fantastic camera.  It's easy enough for the beginner to use right out of the box and contains enough settings, buttons, and extras to give the no-so-beginner plenty to sink their teeth into.  This is a camera I can grow with as my knowledge and skills increase, and I am looking forward to that.  My partner is an exceptional photographer who uses a manual medium format and he LOVES what the Fujifilm S5200 produces  VERY please with my purchase.","I have been using Olympus cameras forever it seems. I have the highly rated SLR 2100 Digital Olympus. Run a search on that camera on Amazon and see the rating - I wish that Olympus would make that camera in a higher res. - but they don't so I was looking for a 10x zoom with higher res. - I wanted the lens always out - this makes it faster to turn on and be ready to shot - it is quieter and takes less battery not having to turn on and wait for a lens to extend. Also you can view the pictures using the view finder or the screen - I like looking at the pictures using the view finder, in bright light I see them clearly.<br /><br />It took a little while to get used to the settings and the locations of all the features but - after that - the moon is the limit - really I took the camera out last night with a full moon and digitally zoomed in on the moon and got a GREAT picture. It was sweet.... I will have to submit it for all to see.<br /><br />This is not a point and shot camera - you must take your time for the shot - but you can set the camera up for rapid shot and it will do almost as good as a point and shot camera. I set it up for rapid shot when catching action - and I will get some blurry so take enough shots :o) The best camera I have had for action rapid shots is my Olympus 3030 - that camera rocks and with having the SLR 2100 I have the best of both worlds... all but movie with no sound - and the low res. The Fujifilm S5200 5.1 will shot movie with sound and does a FINE job of that - you can not zoom while taking the movie shot - you must set up for that but - the quality is good. Sound is great - no camera noise - But reading a lot about cameras - no camera of this style will allow you to zoom in movie mode while shooting...<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />I like this camera and glad I bought it - I have shots in time that will never again be seen without a camera - my young grandchildren shot in video with sound - and still shots that are GREAT - If you are not willing to spend over 500 or 1,000 dollars for a camera - I would recommend this camera. In fact I am going to buy one for my daughter for her birthday - that is how much I like this camera. But then I am not willing to spend the big bucks for a new camera.  Enjoy!!","This is a nicely designed camera. It's well balanced in the hand and the features are accessible without searching the menu, which means it's faster in the field. I resisted the urge to buy more resolution and a hot shoe because the ease of a built-in flash and the high quality of optical zoom is much more practical. Pixels are nothing without optics! I shoot everything from horses at liberty to paintings for reproduction and so far I've been delighted with the results. Shooting in a dusty, dark indoor riding arena is the ultimate test. I was pleased with the lack of digital noise. I've had my Fuji S5200 for a couple of weeks and am very happy with my choice.","The zoom speed on this camera is tops of all the cameras I have and the software pkg is 10 times better and compatible to all MS systems softwares  I have never had so much fun taking pics for my self this camera is the bomb.","Read all the reviews, and finally considered the Canon S-2, Sony H-2, and the Fujifilm S5200.  Previously had the S5100 and loved it.  The S5200 was my choice and I'm very satisfied.  Great \" blurr \" setting enables great shots from a distance on Auto without distortion. Very fast shutter time is Great for capturing movement shots.  And the colors are unbelievable and crisp.  Great deal on Amazon too.  A great quality camera for less money.","I worked in a camera store. I sold Fuji products and learned to  appreciate their quality and reliability.  My introduction into photography was by 35mm cameras, and I used them for decades. This is my first digital camera. I am extremely pleased with it and wonder if I'll ever use film again.","This is one of the best digital cameras that I have ever tried or sold.","We bought this camera to complement a small 3.2 MP camera that was very portable but not very capable in comparison. We love the S5200's performance. My very first digital was a 2.0 MP Finepix - which is now used by our 7 year old - and it took great photos and lasted many years. Battery use is terrific - our other brand 3.2 MP will go through 4 sets of batteries before we need to replace the ones in the S5200. The video with sound works great and is high quality. If you are looking for a good camera with a great zoom and LOTS of features, and you don't want to pay a ton of money... we recommend the Fujifilm Finepix S5200.","This is my second digital camera, the first having been a relatively ancient Sony Mavica.  The Sony had a 10X zoom capability, a few special effects (which I almost never used), and a flash that could be manually activated.  Contrasted with it, the features of this Fugifilm Finepix constitute a whole new universe for me, yet, with a bit of practice, the learning curve is not at all intimidating.  Set to \"Automatic,\" the camera requires no learning curve whatsoever.  For common, everyday photography, just point and shoot!<br /><br />So far as picture quality is concerned, most of my amateurish shots have turned out far better than my skill as a photographer warrants.  The sole exception to this was a series of distant panoramas I took from a mountain peak at about 6,000 feet above sea level.  The landforms and forests were captured in great color, but the sky was uniformly washed out, more gray than blue, possibly an effect of the UV light at that altitude?  Perhaps I should have used a UV filter.<br /><br />My only other criticism of the camera is that it must be connected to a computer with a supplied USB cable, and all the previously un-downloaded shots will download into whatever directory the user has specified via the software that comes with the camera.  I would prefer to be able to view the shots in Photoshop on the PC and select those to be saved rather than saving everything and then going back to delete the ones I don't wish to keep.  Of course, poor shots can be deleted in the camera before downloading, but sometimes I'd prefer to examine them on the larger computer monitor.  I also just plain dislike having to install additional software on my PC in addition to Photoshop.<br /><br />The old Sony I had was perfect in that it recorded all the images onto a 3.5 inch floppy disk inside the camera.  Inserting that disk into the PC drive enabled me to open each shot directly into Photoshop with no need for any additional software. Admittedly, I had to carry several floppies along with the camera since each one holds only a tiny fraction of what a memory card will accommodate.  It's a trade-off, of course.<br /><br />Since every contemporary digital camera seems to require specialized associated software these days, I suppose it's something one must accept in order to use the new camera technology.  Sigh.  Compared with its more-or-less equivalent competitors, the Figufilm Finepix appears to offer more flexibility at a competitive price, and I am pleased with its overall performance in my inexperienced hands.","Incredible camera for the price. This camera uses 4 AA (rechargeable) batteries.  Amazon should carry the AC adapter, which is needed if photos will be transferred from the camera to a pc using the usb cable. If power cuts out during transmission, data will not be transmitted correctly. The manual states, \"Always use the AC power adapter when connecting the camera to a PC.\"","I'm extremely happy with this camera.  It works as advertised, takes great pictures, and has an almost imperceptible delay between pressing the shutter button and taking the picture.  The 10x zoom allows close ups without being close.  The exposure compensation feature takes three quick pictures at sligthly varying exposure levels so you don't get alousy shot of a special moment.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone.","It's a great camera, that takes wonderful pictures and it's easy to use, besides the manual is a big help to understand how to achive better pictures.","I spent the weekend playing with my camera's features...doing my best to try them all..and taking over a hundred pictures in the process.  Here are my results in no particular order:<br /><br />SUMMARY: What a camera for the price!! At just over $200, it does more than I'll ever need it to.  And it's half the price I paid for my 4M Olympus Camedia C4000Z 3 years ago. I'm still getting used to which functions are available with buttons and which are in the menu. GREAT CAMERA that does almost everything you can with an SLR (except change lenses, which is a hassle I'd rather avoid). HIGHLY RECCOMMEND<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. BATTERY LIFE: good to average<br /><br />2. FOCUS: Fast to focus, except at the outer edges of zoom in low light.<br /><br />3. ULTIMATE CONTROL: You can have as little or as much control over the image captured as you want.  I took one (very dark) night shot of wet leaves lit by my porch light with a 15 second shutter speed.  Of course, you can also intentionally take out of focus shots.<br /><br />4. HIGH ISO AVAILABLE:  Good to have available when you need it. Took one night shot of the cityscape at ISO 800 and got a good 4\" x 6\".<br /><br />5. CONTINUOUS MODE:  Comes in 4 varieties to help you get the shot when your own timing isn't so good.  First 3 shots, last 3 shots, one I can't remember, and Long-period (shoots up to 40 consecutive shots).  Long-period would seem to be an easy way to build a panorama photo series.<br /><br />6. RAW: Shoot in this format is good to have when you don't want pixels lost to compression. All editing must be done post-conversion.  You can then edit the TIFF and re-save it either as a JPEG or TIFF.<br /><br />7. MANUAL FOCUS: In Manual mode you can change anything. I even intentionally took a picture out of focus just to prove I could.  Manual focus is, of course, rather slow (as expected), but is effective as long as the subject isn't mobile. Easier to use with LCD screen.  Even when auto focus failed (!AF displays), I could manually bring the subject into focus).<br /><br />8. WEIGHT: It is incredibly light, and seems lighter than my old Olympus Camedia 4000Z, even though its manual says it's heavier.<br /><br />9. FEATURES: All the features I can conceive of using with several that I've played with but don't think I'll ever use.<br /><br />10. ZOOM: Coming from 3x optical zoom to 10x...what can I say?  WOW!  Be cautious, however at the far end of that range in lower light.  You'll need a steady hand, tripod or to switch to anti-shake mode.<br /><br />11. 2 SEC TIMER: Love that for the tripod/night shot. No long waiting for the shot.<br /><br />12. STARTUP TIME: Starts up almost instantly and is immediately ready to shoot.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. HIGH ISO:  On full auto, camera will select above 400 ISO values. Above 400 pictures become more grainy and 4 x 6 is the largest higher quality print you can get. If you want a high quality night shot, you'll have to select ISO 400 or lower and set it on a tripod/shelf/whatever to get the shot.<br /><br />2. RAW CONVERSION: The provided program only converts the RAW to a TIFF without editing.  Would have been nice if I could have \"edited\" the RAW version and then saved to TIFF just once. Also would have been nice to be able to save to more than just TIFF.<br /><br />3. SLOW MANUAL FOCUS: The pace at which manual focus changes is dreadfully slow.  Don't even try using it on a moving target.  Would be nice if it incremented faster when the button is held down for over a second and then you could slowly fine-tune the focus one button press at time. But not how they implemented it.<br /><br />4. LIMITED SAVE QUALITY CHOICES: My Olympus let me save to TIFF and about 10 different JPEG quality settings, varying pixel density and compression settings.  I used to use the highest quality only for portraits or shot I knew I was likely to enlarge. This camera only offers 5 still settings, only one of which is a 3:2 aspect ratio.<br /><br />UPDATE ON DURABILITY: I have been using this camera for 6 years now and it still works just like new. I have taken it to Costa Rica and travelled cross country several times with it on camp across America trips. It still works just great. Hands down, the most reliable camera I have ever owned.","I purchased the s5200 to replace my aged s304.  Its a better camera  in every way, faster, more features, better zoom etc etc.  It takes the same memory cards and batteries too so no extra expense there either and at $240 a bargain !.  Hope it lasts half as long as my 304 did (which survived being dropped out the window of a train and falling down a staircase !).","After enjoying my Olympus mju 400 for over 3 years, have decided to try out \"prosumer\" entry level units without breaking the bank.  After reviewing the s5200 on amazon and realizing what a bargain the sale price was (definitely a lot cheaper than other brands with similar features here in Manila), i decided to try it out.  I had the unit and a 1GB card shipped to my sister while she was on vacation in OH, and she was all raves about it:<br /><br />- very powerful zoom<br /><br />- light weight and very easy on the batteries<br /><br />- great ergonomics<br /><br />- amazing color and details even on close-ups and zooms<br /><br />- and all for the price of a point and shoot<br /><br />I recently got to try the unit firsthand and have taken very clear shots of buildings about 2kms away and no problems..amazing that 10x is just about the magnification of high end rifle scopes....also great autofocus on macro close-ups on stuff inside the house<br /><br />Still have to start practicing on the manual settings, although functions are buried in the menus and the manual zoom was a bit hard pressing the W/T and +/- buttons simultaneously, but PC interface is a breeze.  I hope to upload some pictures i've taken to the site for comparison.<br /><br />All in all, i'm a happy camper so far! Highly recommended.","I can't really add too much to the great reviews others have already written about this camera. I've managed to take several great shots using it. I recently purchased the close-up lenses to make it work better in macro mode, which I suggest you do as well.","I love this camera. It takes clear beautiful pictures and the shots are never dark or blurry like the credit-card sized cams.  Even at a party at nite, my camera took the best lit pictures with its pop up flash.<br /><br />It doesnt come with rechargeable batteries and the memory card it comes with only holds about 11pics...So if you need to use the camera right away you need to go buy those items plus a charger.  I have been having some issues with the batteries, but I dont think this is camera related.  The software makes it really easy to upload pics.  So far so good.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.","I like the camera - the zoom is the best feature, by far.  I took a shot from a hot air balloon of a hawk at the top of a tree in the distance that was just amazing!<br /><br />My night shots are mixed...  some great, some utterly blurry and horrendous no matter what I've done to change the settings between auto//nighttime//shake//flash//no flash. Those results have been really unpredictable.  Now, that could be because I've only had the camera for 3 weeks and haven't finished reading the really pithy manual they sent.  But, I will say that I have a fair amount of common sense, and that's not helping right now!<br /><br />By and large, the daytime shots have all been stupendous and the jury is still out on the indoor//night shots.<br /><br />LOVE that zoom, though - did I mention that?  Even maxed out, it takes great shots.  And you can't get that in another camera for this money.  It's a good camera - I'm just not sure it'll be your ONLY camera.<br /><br />Oh - I should also mention that, even with the batteries in it, it's very light.  - lighter, even than my Elph<br /><br />Good luck with your shopping.","I bought the S5200 5 months ago, after owning a Canon A75 3MP digital camera. The difference in the picture quality is amazing! So much sharper on the Fuji! So many pictures I took with the Canon were blurry, and I was holding very still!<br /><br />The price has gone down about 50 since I bought this, so it's even more of a deal now.","I purchased this camera for my husband and loves it.  He did plenty of research before he picked this one and left settle hints :).  It has the best lag time for the price range and the zoom is great.  The photos that are taken with it look wonderful.  He doesn't have a single complaint.","Bought the S5200 when my Canon EOS SLR developed a serious problem. Thought I'd try digital for the first time. Camera came recommended by my local camera store owner, so I trusted... Have used the camera for about a month in several settings; graduation using the zoom from about 40 yards, a wedding reception with variable lighting and outside (cloudy conditions). All pictures came out surprisingly good..clear, with good color (zoom worked great!). At least equal to my old Canon SLR and I'm still learning how to use the camera! Half the fun is taking the media to the local pharmacy to choose, crop and develop only the pictures I want! Oh, yea, the video capability is fun also. Allows you to shoot without the person knowing it's video (until you show it! - they think it's stills). So far, I am VERY pleased with this purchase, both from a cost and picture quality point of view.","i luv this camera....i bought it because i luv taking pics and i like the little detail in things....the last digital i bought was ok but this one is the best out of the 5 ive had.....i use to have a cannon that was a film camera but i like this one better it works just as well and i dont have to wait for the film to get developed....that is a big pluse for me....buy this camera....u wont regret it, i promise....","I did research on digital cameras for about six months before I settled on this one.  My considerations were a) image quality, b) price, and c) usability.<br /><br />Let's start with usability:  I mean \"usability\" in the sense that whether the camera had all the features I needed and none of the ones that I didn't.  I know, there's no such thing as too many features, but I'm not a professional.  I know enough about photography to understand the technical aspects of shooting good-to-great pictures, but don't care enough to invest oodles of money into a camera that has millions of features that I'll never use.  In that sense, the S5200 was a good buy.<br /><br />In terms of price, when I bought mine, it was just shy of $300.  I considered it a good deal, since the local camera store sold it for $400 (I know, I should support local merchants, but saving $100 is quite an incentive when you're a student).  I hadn't planned to spend more than $500 on the camera.<br /><br />Image quality was an important consideration, since I often get enlargements.  This camera will let you go up to 8 x 10 (I know it says 13 x 17, but then you run the risk of fuzz) and still maintain perfect clarity.<br /><br />Other considerations:  the learning curve for this camera is a bit steeper for those of you who are just coming out of the point-and-click 35mm and/or disposables.  The manual is helpful in explaining what all the features enable you to do, but it doesn't explain, for instance, that if the A number gets bigger, that actually means the aperture gets smaller.  Still, once you get the hang of it, it's amazing what you can do.<br /><br />Some things are adjusted automatically, others are not.  The ISO number will remain on whatever setting you have it on until you change it, for instance.  This is both a boon and a curse.  If you're shooting a lot of pictures under similar conditions, it's great.  If you're shooting pictures under vastly different conditions, it's a pain.  On the other hand, the aperture and shutter speed are adjusted automatically to what the camera thinks are good for the setting, and you can tweak them.<br /><br />The manual focus is a pain in the ass to manage, because neither the EVD nor the LCD screen are large enough for you to notice any change in the focus depth.  However, the autofocus works beautifully, and I would recommend that you stick with this.","I used this camera on a trip to the west coast and got some amazing shots. I am by far not a photographer, and this camera makes me look like a pro. The video feature is cool...I got my nephew's first steps on it!","I love this camera because of its powerful zoom and other features. But I have to return it to the store now because of the \"Zoom Error\" message displayed on the LCD after I played this camera for 3 weeks. Luckily it is still covered by 30 day return policy. After I searched on Google I found a lot of reports about the \"Fuji Zoom Error\" issue. It seems that the zoom mechanism of Fuji camera is not so reliable.","I received this camera before Easter weekend and had plenty of time to read the manual and play with it.  I think it is a great camera, on automatic it is hard to take a bad picture unless you really screw up and put your finger on top of the flash so it won't open like I did a few times.  It can be as easy to use or as technical as you would like.  I especially liked the natural light feature which allows great pictures inside without a flash. A good buy you won't regret.","I love all the features of this camera--the zoom, all the various photo settings, the ability to change ISO settings.  The CCD is outstanding (**at the lowest ISO setting**), and color preservation is pretty good.  One of the things I really like about this camera is the speed at which you can take repeated pictures.  For a person who has only had point-and-shoot cameras up until now this has been a nice step up and a learning experience.  If you are in the same position I was expect a little bit of a learning curve.  But you should expect that with any camera you buy that is more than a point-and-shoot--this camera is no harder than the next.  I've had the camera for a few months now, so I'm starting to feel pretty comfortable with it's capabilities.<br /><br />The video capabilies of the camera are nice, but nothing to write home about--it won't replace your video camera.  The camera also has some annoying blurring problems with lower ISO settings--so make sure you have a steady hand, or use a tripod.  My one big complaint is that graininess is a huge problem at higher ISO's.  It starts from the moment you move from 64 (the lowest setting) to 100.  Take test pictures of the same object at different ISO settings, throw them into photoshop, and then zoom in about 5 levels or so.  Image quality is outstanding on the ISO 64 pictures, but you get noticeable image degradation by moving up just one ISO setting.  The result is that by the time you get to ISO 800 or even 400 the image has significant graininess.  So noticeable that even 4x6 prints of the pictures look pretty bad (like they were printed on an older color ink jet printer).  In my option a 5 MP camera should not have 4x6 prints coming out that bad.  It's really a shame too because at lower ISO blurring is a problem--too bad there is no image stabilization (luckily I have a surgeons hands--literally).<br /><br />Overall, the camera is a nice, affordable step up for those who have been point-and-shoot people and want to get a little more serious.  It is not, however, without some moderate flaws, which is why I give it only 4 stars.","simply a amazing camera, i had a S5100 before, and the new features of the s5200 are really cool.<br /><br />the new color processor works excellent, also the iso up to 1600 provide a wide range of creative shoots!<br /><br />and, at least  the  antiblur system is simply great...<br /><br />if u are searching for a nice portable and real value camera, this is a excellent choice.!","bought this camera about 2 wks.ago and am impressed. taken about 1475 shots so far and battery life is about 300-400 shots depending on flash used. first off-pictures are very good quality.color is exceptional. works as good as or better than naked eye in low light conditions-just great!!! the optical zoom is very,very good. has a ton of options which take quite a while learning all the symbols. the movie mode has excellent video but the audio i would only rate fair. now some things i do'nt care for: the digital zoom is not very good in resolution but it's ok just to crop pictures. the electronic view finder also needs some clarity. the menu seems a little user unfriendly at first but with some practice is getting better. due to the enormous amount of options it keeps interest all the way up to advanced intermediate photographers. the lcd seems to fade out easily in sunlight even at high settings.  i compared this camera with sony dsc-h1,canon s2is,anpanosonic z-5. these are all good super-zoom cameras.some things i liked on the sony were the 2.5\" lcd and image stabilization. fuji uses an anti-blur mode to avoid camera shake which works well most of the time but not always. when you get out to full zoom it is very touchy and easy to get blurred images. i guess that's why they have tri-pods.overall this camera is highly competitive against the other super-zooms,so you just have to try them out yourself. if you want the low light capabilities then this camera is miles ahead. i bought this camera for 225. with a fuji rebate. this made it a no-brainer for me.","I bought this camera for my wife's birthday and after 2 months of use she LOVES it.  Easy to use, light weight, takes great sharp pictures.  She told me I out did myself with this buy!","This camera is amazing. I attend women in childbirth and take a lot of pictures of babies coming into the world in very low light conditions (candlelight or one lamp). Any other camera I would have to use a flash or settle for hardly being able to see, but this camera really duplicates the light conditions. If I can see, the camera can see. This has resulted in some phenomenal birth photos, and newborn photos, since all the pictures of new babies aren't just babies cringing to the harsh light of the flash. I can capture the softness and beauty of the moment.<br /><br />Another really important thing for me is that there is virtually no lag time between pushing the button and the camera taking a picture. That means I get a picture of the exact moment that I want. This is essential when photographing an event like birth or taking pictures of kids, animals, ect. I have had this camera several months now and the only thing negative that I can say about it is that if light conditions are very low and you are using the natural light setting you have to hold the camera very still if you don't want the image to blur. I have learned to do this so it isn't a problem, but most other people who haven't used my camera before have a hard time taking pictures in low light. That's okay though because they can always turn on the flash and still get a terrific picture! (You would have to hold really still taking a picture with ANY camera in low light.)<br /><br />The zoom is another great feature of this camera. I wouldn't want a camera with any less zoom after using this. It makes it so much easier to take well composed candid shots (especially when using the natural light setting- people never realize you are taking pictures of them!)<br /><br />I recommend this camera to anyone who wants quality pictures! If you are going to invest in a digital camera, you might as well invest in one (like this one) that can take pictures of the same quality (or better) as your 35mm.","All lI can say is WOW!!!.  This is the most underrated and reviewed camera around.  I purchased it to replace the vaunted sony dsc-h1 that was sent back because it was a lemon.  However this is so much more than a point and shoot model.<br /><br />I have owned the whole s series and moved to what I thought was up when I purchased the Panasonic fz 20.  True the Panasonic is still considered the \"Gold\" standard but this little wonder is pure magic in my hands.<br /><br />It is not an easy camera for a beginner to master but once you work with it lives up to its manufactuers claims.  The low light shooting function coupled with and ISO range from 64 to 1600 with the best noise reduction in the prosumer market make it a must have.<br /><br />As with any of this brakets cameras there are trade-offs and there is no sense comparing this to a digital slr as it is unfair but if you want the benefits of shooting in natural light and having a camera to grow with you with a beautiful lens and features not even available on the higher priced models invest in this baby.  For well under 400 little smackers you are getting not only anti shake which in this camera is adjusting the settings so that shake is mitigated by and increase in speed but the natural light function and maual controls that are sophisticated and professional.<br /><br />Though there is no physical manual zoom lens the focusing ooptions on this camera belay that minor loss.<br /><br />All in all a superb camera at an unbelievable price for someone who wants to feel and  experience of working with a range similar in complexity to an slr.<br /><br />Trade off would be the much greater pixel strength of the big guns but try this camera and you might just be surprised.<br /><br />Add to this the 10.7 x zoom and the reach of the digital zoom which is only available in 3.2  pixel strenth plus the 55mm direct access for accesorie lenes and you have a dust free real pro-sumer wonder.<br /><br />My Olympus wide angle which is 55 threaded works beautifully on this baby and I am looking forward to using the telephoto attachments as well<br /><br />THIS IS THE BEST BUY IN THE DIGITAL CAMERA MARKET FOR A SERIOUS AMATEUR OR A RESTLESS PRO LIKE MYSELF!!!!!!","I chose the Fuji S5200 as my jump into digital cameras after many years of using 35mm's.  I read reviews on many cameras and decided on the Fuji.  This camera takes sharp crisp pictures, is easy to use and I am very happy with it. You can read reviews for hours or take my word for it.  This is a great camera.","this  is the best camera ive every owned and i've owned 5 this is the best, has a great zoom and the batteries last pretty long","I bought this camera as my first digital.  I have used it as my professional digital.  While it does have some limitations overall it is superb.  I have used it to take photos that have been published in a national horse publication.  It gives professional results with ease.","This camera is relatively new, so there are not many reviews in cyberspace yet.  However, some diligent searching will reveal a few.  They generally fall into the \"unbelievably good\" category, but when you read the details you find the user has had the camera for only a few days, or it is their first camera.  There are a few quite negative reviews, including some posted images of poor quality.<br /><br />I have had mine for a few weeks, and have mixed feelings about it.  Yes, it does have all the features that others have listed, and it offers very good value for money.  However, you need to understand what it is doing if you are going to take good pictures.  If you just \"point and shoot\", you may be disappointed.<br /><br />The S-5600 has a very long zoom, but no image stabilisation.  Unless you use a tripod, you may find it hard to get sharp pics at the extended settings.  The \"anti-blur\" setting works well, but at the expense of sometimes undesirable ISO levels.  IS would be better.<br /><br />Also, you need to be careful about focusing.  The autofocus sometimes misses small subjects.  You need to diligently use the \"pre-focus\" half-shutter option to make sure your subject is in focus before completing the shot.<br /><br />Focusing would be less of an issue if manual focus was easier.  I would prefer a simple focus ring, like on an SLR.  Failing that, it would be better if you could hold down a button with your left hand rather than trying to hold it down with your right hand while also operating the zoom buttons to manually focus.  Also, manual focus is very slow - you might not think it is working sometimes.  Plan to learn how to use manual focus, and practice using your right hand - not so difficult once you have it down, but again not \"point and click\".<br /><br />Ok, so this sounds like a pretty negative review so far.  Let's look at some of the positives - and there are plenty:<br /><br />- Very good lens system, with huge zoom range<br /><br />- Ability to screw on converter lenses - a wide angle is probably the most useful<br /><br />- Really long battery life - leaves the Canons for dead (always been a good feature of Fuji)<br /><br />- Once you understand and master the controls, ability to take great natural light photos (I find the flash a bit harsh)<br /><br />- Very good movie quality (but no zoom in movie mode)<br /><br />- RAW mode!<br /><br />- Good price!<br /><br />In summary, if you are in the market for a new camera of this type, definitely consider the S-5600, but see if you can get a hands-on trial against a Canon or Olypus equivalent before you commit to it.","I just got this camera today. I have tried a freind's s5100 and it was wonderful. The new one, the s5200, is like what the s5100 was to the s5000. It is an improvement from the s5100 without sacrificing anything, even if that does sound exactly like FujiFilm's advertisements, it's true. The screen is bigger, the EVF is sharper, the macro mode is improved considerably. It is great for a person like me who has suddenly found an intrest in photography. As soppoused to spending $1000+ on high-end SLR's and lenses, this camera has similar quality of pictures as my mom's D70. All-in-all, it is a great, versitile camera.","I bought my camera over a year ago, I have had noproblems at all with it. Its similar to that of a real DSLR in the fact u can adjust allot of the settings, and the body style. But it keeps the point and shoot ideas by having a fixed lense. The 10x zoom is amazing.<br /><br />my only complaints, would be the shutter speeds are limited to 2 seconds. I would like to have had a bulb setting. I wish it did have a detachable lense so i could fit many more lenses and filters among it. Also there is NO hotshoe to put a real flash on it. The flash that is built in, well its a typical flash over exposing or underexposing photos. a real flash you can angle toward the ceiling to create better lighting effects, but thats not possible due to the absence of the hot shoe.<br /><br />somebody was complaining ti was heavy? thats absurd, after holding many cameras, this is fairly light. but still sturdy. and the same perosn also complained about the size. but your not goign to get a camera thats that small with all the options this has offer.<br /><br />If your a pro, I wouldnt suggest this. But if your a ameature like me, its a great starting place, due to the ideas of having a look like DSLR, manual options and auto options. Seems to be the best of both worlds. Hope this can help you all!","I have a fujifilm s5000 which I absolutely LOVE. The s5200 is about the same but has a few more megapixels--helpful if you want to print out larger photos. This is an excellent entry level camera and is just as good to have and hold as your forever digital camera. The design is so friendly and it's quick to grab and pop off some good shots. It's lightweight so wearing it around your neck won't feel like a burden. You might find you'll need a tripod or monopod for those long-range zoom shots however. Even a small amount of \"the diet coke shakes\" can really make photos come out fuzzy. There are some nice inexpensive monopods around which also have a pan head for range of motion. I take these hiking which adds to my self-defense system too. (I could really knock somebody over with that pan head!!) You might also like to purchase a neoprene soft case for your camera. I bought one on eBay for about $20. I carry my camera all over in my purse and having such a case is almost a necessity. I'd also like to recommend the new 1gb XD card. The s5200 can take a film clip. The higher amount of memory is helpful if you'd like to take a few film clips then also shoot a number of photos before clearing the memory card. The camera uses 4 AA type batteries and really sucks up the energy quickly. I went through these rapidly before discovering lithium batteries. These run about $10 for 4 which sounds expensive. However, lithium lasts about 15 times longer than even Energizers do. Lithium batteries are also MUCH lighter weight which is nice when you're wearing the camera around your neck!!<br />I've gotten so many wonderful photos with my s5000 and some are sale and exhibition quality. There are manual options on this camera and you can also buy lenses that are add-on's to the fixed lens. If you want to learn more about digital photography, then this camera is perfect for you even if you don't ever intend to go any further with it. You will be pleased with your results and that's an important part of the learning process. Hope the tips I've provided are helpful and encouraging. I've just upgraded to a Nikon SLR but intend to hang onto my old steady s5000.","I have been using the Fuji S5200 for several days now and think that it is a fantastic camera.  I had been debating between this and several other superzooms.  I chose the Fuji for its ISO capabilities and its real photo technology.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Great looks and build.  You know this camera has quality written all over it from the moment you pick it up.<br /><br />-Fast shot to shot times.<br /><br />-Good auto focus capability, though not the best in its class.<br /><br />-Good movie mode with 640 X 480 capability.<br /><br />-Incredible High ISO capability!  This is where the Fuji stands heads and above its competitors.  You can actually use come pcitures at 1600 ISO with a little work.<br /><br />-Excellent pictures in auto mode for a beginner.  This is a great camera for someone wanting to learn how to use digital cameras.  You can start off in auto mode and experiment with many manual settings.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Manual focusing is awkward to use.  You have to hold on to 1 button and then move the zoom in or out to focus.<br /><br />-The menus are a little more difficult to use than others I have tried, though you get used to it like anything else with practice.<br /><br />-No optical stabilization.  This is not really a con in my book due to its high ISO capabilities but some would argue the point.<br /><br />-No hot shoe.<br /><br />In the end, Fuji has taken and enhanced the S5100 in several ways to create a bargain of a camera the 399.00 price.  Highly recommended!","This camera is great if you don't want a point and shoot and you don't want a professional camera, it is the middle ground camera.  This camera has some great features for people who want a great camera but not quite at the professional level.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- 6-megapixel<br /><br />-LCD works great in any lighting situation<br /><br />- great quality pictures<br /><br />-  easy to use menu screen<br /><br />- great automatic features and also great features for more professional people<br /><br />-great video capability for short videos<br /><br />- adapter ring so you can put a filter on your camera (55mm)<br /><br />- excellent macro performance.<br /><br />- can see pictures and video easily<br /><br />-10x optical zoom<br /><br />- reduce red eye<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- manual focus is hard to use<br /><br />- flash is underexposed so you need a tripod.  Not very good for night pictures<br /><br />-camera is heavy and bulky, so it is annoying to take to a lot of places<br /><br />-camera shuts off after a minute of not being used (this is the biggest reason I do not recommend this product)<br /><br />-camera take 4 double A batteries, which is too many and the batteries die fast.  So if taking camera out for a long time use new batteries otherwise try rechargable batteries( to keep your expense of batteries down)<br /><br />- a little bit more expensive then the camera is worth<br /><br />- features may be overwhelming if you have always used a point and shoot with only a few features","Well,@I am not a pro but I will try to write something about this camera for those who are trying to decide if they will buy it or not...<br /><br />I bought this camera after analysing the reviews of S5200's antecesors; S5000 and S5100.<br /><br />Both were top sellers and every one (or almost) liked their performance. I also analysed if it was better to buy the strong competitor Canon S1 IS. For my need I chose to buy one of the Fujis.<br /><br />After reading some reviews about the S5000, some complaining and seeing that the complaining was much less on the Fuji S5100, I decided that the latter would be a great idea had not I done more research. I saw that the few complainings on S5100 would not (probably) be in its up-graded version (S5200) and some nice features would be included, too.<br /><br />In the site of Fuji I saw that S5200 would come with their newest kinda sensor (5th generation). Also it would come with Anti-blur (comparable to Canon's Image Stabilizer) and with the Real Photo Tecnology.<br /><br />Despite having it only for one week now, I have to say that I am very satisfied with the camera. It was a bit expensive but worth every Yen (I am in Japan, the first place where it had its premiere). I took some shots at night with surprising results, such as those Fuji promissed in their homepage. The Real Photo Tec is really good; instead of a dark and impenetrable background in night shots, you can have a vision of how the party was like. If you know how to use the camera, you can even get many details that I doubt you would ever get with another camera but S5200.<br /><br />The Anti-blur works fine. It is pretty good to take telephoto shots without a tripod and even for moving objects.<br /><br />The ISO have a reduced amount of noise even in its highest; ISO 1600. Unbelievable!<br /><br />The camera is pretty simple to use and the pre-programed functions are very useful with great results. If you just wanna have it to great snapshots, that is the camera.<br /><br />Even if you wanna have a special effect, after reading the manual, the camera does what you want it to. The features are very nice.<br /><br />Everything in the camera was thought, rethought and usually you can have what you want in a fingerful.<br /><br />Cons: I didnt like the difficulty of manual focusing and the EVF (though I dont have much experience with other digital cameras and dont know if it could get much better);<br /><br />The camera could have more options of aperture.<br /><br />Out of the cons, the camera is worth for a non professional like me that are begining with photography and needs some nice features.<br /><br />Some people ask if buying Fuji S9000 would be a beter idea. Need you more pixels, are you a professional (or at least know what White Balance, Aperture, Shutter Speed, ISO, Metering are and what they work for) and have more money to spend, then I would say that it be nice. Otherwise, if you are like me and just wanna practise with a good digital camera that many people will envy for its qualities, then you dont ever need to think about another camera.<br /><br />I may not here be able to say how good Fuji S5200 is but I really love it and would not change it.","I did lots of research before buying a digital camera. I have been beyond pleased with the performance of this camera.  It is difficult not to take great pictures.  Its menu commands are very easy, I have made good use of the manual settings. I would strongly recommend this camera to anyone who wants to venture beyond point and shoot and wants to buy a good quality camera.  The Fuji lens alone makes this camera worth the buy.","This was the first digital camera I had ever bought, so I did a great deal of research before jumping into the new technology. There were certainly cheaper cameras out there, and more sophisticated ones, but the s5000 seemed to be a good balance of costs vs. features, and I didn't want to lay down a great deal of money, until I had figured out from use which features were important (Start up time, for example, was something I had never considered before).<br /><br />I wanted something \"SLR-like\" if not actually an SLR, because that is what I am used to working with normally. Strictly speaking, the s5000 is not an SLR, because the is no mirror and no reflex, you may not get the \"real life\" image of an actual SLR, but there is also no mirror shake or screen blackout.<br /><br />Of course, immediately after I bought this proces tumbled and the higher end digital SLRs are now affordable, but that's the way it always goes. If yo want a camera that is cheap, reliable, makes good pictures, and is a good gateway to the top level digital SLRs, then this is probably the type of camera that you want.<br /><br />On an odd note, I find that when I use it at public events like parades, particularly with the wide angle lens adaptor, people occasionally ask me if I am from the newspaper. I guess the camera looks more pro than it really is.<br /><br />Also, It survived a drop from about 12 inches onto hard tile, with no damage. That's not too bad for a cheap plastic body.<br /><br />It has a number of strengths:<br /><br />The 10x optical zoom is extremely long. (this is really a huge plus)<br /><br />Lens quality is good.<br /><br />Absolutely quiet.<br /><br />Continuous drive features are good, allows a decent (5 frame) series of consecutive pics.<br /><br />Lightweight.<br /><br />Nice sharp macros.<br /><br />Uses standard AA batteries (this is important in the field!)<br /><br />Batteries on full charge last a long time. I find around 400 shots.<br /><br />Remarkably good resolution for 3.2 MP- punches above its weight.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />Storage media is way overpriced.<br /><br />Mode selector dial switches unintentionally.<br /><br />Long start up time.<br /><br />Body is plastic and a little frail. (not too bad though).<br /><br />Manual focus is not actually possible in real life.<br /><br />Viewfinder image quality is nto so great.<br /><br />The 6MP setting is, for lack of a better word, fraudulent.  The camera creates a larger file through interpolation, but the 6MP image is actually of worse resolution than 3 MP image.  I discovered this the first trip I shot, when I got home to PS the images.<br /><br />STRONGEST DRAWBACK!!- almost constant vignetting, this is often fixable in photoshop, but I don't know how the designers let it go to market with that problem.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend it as a good intro to digital, especially at the prices it currently commands.  The sequel (the s5100) appears to have solved most of these problems, but vignetting still occurs.  Value, however, is acceptable.","I have had this camera for about a year now, and I love it more every time I use it. It produces such high quality photos. Most people believe that they need a camera with more mega pixel, but the camera has it all-it has the mega pixels and incredible zoom. I would recommend this camera to everyone beginners and more advance photographers.","If you don't mind it's bulk compared this camera packs a punch.  Absolutely love it for taking macro-photo shots.  Easy to put in all your 55 and 52mm (with adapter) filters that you probably already own.  Using this baby with a +4 magnification filter and you are taking a full frame picture of a dime in focus.  Artistic creativity abounds with full manual control if you so desire, or very sophisticated automatic action.  Have been using for a year and I am pleased as can be.  Lock, load, shoot!","I have had this camera for about 5 months now and am extremely pleased with it. This is my 4th digital camera, and is by far my absolute favorite. It takes gorgeous pictures - I've had many printed and everyone I show them to is amazed that they are from a digital camera. I use it on the 3 megapixel setting, and the pictures are just as nice or better than pictures from my film Canon Rebel SLR. The battery life is great as well - After 5 months, I've gone through the batteries that come with the camera, and am only on my second set of Energizer E2 lithium batteries - and I use the camera a lot. The camera is really easy to use, and although many reviewers have said they needed a tripod to get clear pictures using the 10x optical zoom, I haven't had a problem with them coming out blurry at all just by holding the camera in my hands. There is hardly a lag like most digital cameras have between the time when you press the shutter button and when the picture is actually taken - I've taken hundreds of pictures of my brother's soccer games, and with a little practice, have gotten a lot of great action shots of him. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a better-quality digital camera. I haven't had any problems with it, and the picture quality, even on 3mp, is amazing. This is a great camera.","I bought my Fuji S5000 just over a year ago, and since then have taken well over 3000 pictures - it was my first foray from film to digital and it has made me a true convert.  I was very reluctant to go digital - I liked the reliability of film camera (ie no pictures getting lost on a hard drive or facing technical difficulties trying to figure out how to use it) as well as the quality of the images, so it was going to take a really good camera to convince me that it was worth it.<br /><br />I selected the S5000 for a few key reasons:  it got very good reviews from serious photographers as to the the quality of the images (which are totally justified), it was very intuitive to use (my 7 year old figured it out in about 2 minutes and loves taking and viewing pictures on it), it is very light and easy to handle, and it takes AA batteries (a lifesaver - extras are always available anywhere, and money-saver since I use rechargeables).  An added benefit was the 10x zoom which has been amazing at my daughter's soccer & softball games and other outdoor school events - it is the envy of the parental paparazzi along the sidelines at her games.<br /><br />This camera has surpassed my expectations in every area, prodcucing clear and reliably superb pictures in a variety of conditions.  I have avoided the shutter-lag issue which turned me off to many digital cameras by using the feature which allows you to depress the shutter button halfway to focus, and then pause to wait for the perfect moment with almost no lag time when you ultimately depress the shutter the rest of the way.  Self timer, black & white mode, and rapid shooting (which takes up to 5 picutres in rapid succession) are all very easy to use.  I must say that I have not used the Manual Mode at all, even though that was an important feature to me in selecting a camera.  I hope to master that mode soon, but when you're running around trying to get shots of active kids you are very grateful for the outstanding Automatic Mode!<br /><br />I did upgrade to a larger memory card - 128 mB.  I can take up to about 140 pictures on it, and combined with the 30 or so I can get on the card that came with it I have plenty of room to store all my picutres from a 1 week vacation.<br /><br />Printed pictures come out wonderfully.  I print all my pictures at Costco because they are printed using the same machine as film pictures, therefore alleviating my concern that pictures printed with printer ink and paper will not withstand the test of time.  Plus at $.19 per picture it is way cheaper than buying photo paper and photo quality ink, not to mention a time saver (I take a lot of pictures!). I also feel that the quality of the pictures, particularly the color, is better than some of the online printers like Shutterfly.<br /><br />I have never loved a camera as much as I have do this one, and I only realized this when I thought I had lost it a week ago.  Debating whether this was my chance to finally upgrade to a SLR like the Nikon D70, I realized that the S5000 was the perfect camera for me and that I would be a fool to not replace it with the same thing.  Lucky for me I found it (at the bottom of my kids' closet - don't ask me how it got there).  So the story has a happy ending, and I am contentedly back to taking pictures with my S5000.","I purchased this camera 8 months ago and wish I had checked the price on Amazon before doing so. The shape and style of this camera and its black body make it look far more expensive than it really is and set it apart from many other cameras on the market.<br />But you don't buy a camera for its look alone, or do you? (not a good idea). Having said that in this case you would not go far wrong. The camera is packed with features that will please not only the casual snapper but also those who would like to get far more involved in their photography.<br />The lens is as good as anything in this price range and the zoom is up their with the top range models. If you just want to let the camera make the choices for you leave it on automatic, your photographs will be excellent. If you already have the technical skills or would like to make your own decisions regarding shutter speed, aperture, white balance etc. the camera allows you to do this. The different modes allow portrait; landscape, night shots, I could go on forever. I like to take pictures of my cacti collection and the macro facility is excellent. The camera fits in the hand beautifully and feels like a solid piece of equipment. The only slight criticism I have, is that by the time the camera tells you your batteries are low on power, it is too late to do anything about it, apart from replace them. This is a gem and I doubt you will get it cheaper than on Amazon.","I bought the camera from a camera store after doing some extensive on line research and talking to the clerks about the options that meet my needs best, and I have to say that the Coolpix S5000 has certainly lived up to all expectations! I love the fact that the controls are so versatile and give me all the control over the images that I need to meet all of my amature photography needs! I am still learning how to use this feature rich camera and hope to keep improving my skills to take full advantage of it's potential!<br /><br />The only issues I have had with the camera came in low light situations (Indoors at night), but I am certain that I am not using the settings to the best advantage, so I can't say for sure if it's the camera, or my inexperience with the settings that is to blame. I tend to think it's me...","I bought the FujiFilm S5000 3.1MP in early April 2004 for my honeymoon and then to use on a regular basis for other travel and events.  I spent much time researching various cameras with similar features.  I decided on this camera because it has 3.1MP (a higher MP is only needed by a professional photographer), great zoom options, exposed LCD window, lighter weight, and a nice design. Given that I use the camera in the correct lighting and without a shaky hand, all of my pictures are crystal clear and professional looking.  This is the perfect digital camera to own, and for having it for over 6 months, I am still certain that I made the best buy.  My husband is very happy with it too, and we are both amateur photographers, but since we have an excellent camera, we are often complemented on taking professional looking photographs.","I bought the CoolPix based on reviews from here. It is a fine designed camera, takes perfect pictures and have very flexible lenses. The gadgetry is superb. But:<br /><br />The time delay between the press of your finger and the catch of the scene is so long that is impossible to take snap shots, instant shots. Cartier Bresson will trow away this handsome camera. This time delay is much less in other cameras, like the Olympus D460, which I always have. If you dont need to take that kind of shot, it is a perfect camera for you.","I love this camera. I bought it on my honeymoon, becasue my APS camera died and I had to have pictures of that. Well I was a bit nervous becasue I didn't have much information about it, but the wife liked it so we got it. As it turns out, this is the perfect digital camera for me. It takes beautiful pictures even though it is only 3.1 MP. We have had some develouped at the Kodak digital camera stations and they look just like film. Some of the features that you will love about this digital camera are:<br /><br />1. 10x OPTICAL zoom. Most digital camera advertise how much digital zoon they have. This is a totally useless feature for me. I mean think about it. If you have a digital camera, yours pictures are going on your computer where you have digital phote software to edit or zoom your photos.<br /><br />2. Complete SLR like controls. On most of the digital cameras that don't cost $800 you are stuck with basic controls and options for fine tuning your pictures. Not so on this camera. You can choose a variety of picture modes as well as film speeds, aperature, shuttere speeds and so on.<br /><br />3 The ability to attack filters and adapters lenses. While this feature may not apply to al users, it does increase the overall flexibility of the camera. For example you can buy a 1.5X telephoto adapter and increase your zoom to 15x instead of 10x or you can add a polorize filter for outdoor picturtes.<br /><br />One caution that I have noticed however. If you are using lens adapters or filters (I have both) you need to zoom in a few steps, otherwise the corners of your pictures will be rounded off. I think this may be a design flaw in the off brand wide angle LENS ADAPTER I bought, NOT the camera.<br /><br />All in all its a great camera and great for those who want to move beyond a simple point and shoot and take the step up and have control over their pictures. I love this camera and it has stood up to abuse of the road and everyday use. I would recommend it to anyone as a great buy.","If you are looking for a digital camera that is a few steps above basic but aren't quite ready to pony up $800 or $900 for an SLR, look at the Fuji S5000. It has great features and produces quality prints without costing a fortune. My husband and I got our S5000 in May and we LOVE it!  We had been working with a Sony Mavica, which we enjoyed, but we had decided to get something a bit more advanced.  In the S5000 we found exactly what we were looking for.<br /><br />The S5000 has 10x optical zoom plus 2.2x digital zoom which impressed us.  We had to adjust a bit to using this camera since it does have quite a few more features than we were used to but it has been enjoyable playing and learning.  One thing that has taken a bit getting used to is the delay on the shutter.  When you press the button to take a picture, there is a 2-3 second delay which means you may not get the exact picture you intended. At first this was a bit annoying; however, with some practice we have learned to adjust to this.  This camera has the ability to take MPEG video so it gives us the versatility to make a short \"movie\" and since we have small children this feature has really been fantastic for catching some funny moments that couldn't have been captured with just a single shot alone.<br /><br />One thing I initially was worried about was the quality of the pictures since this camera was \"only\" 3.1MP.  So far, this has not been a problem.  The pictures that we have had printed thus far have been of very good quality.  While the color is not quite as rich and the pictures are not quite as crisp as what we get from our 35mm, they are much better than what I had expected.<br /><br />A couple of things to think about when budgeting for this camera.  First of all it only comes with a 16MB card which doesn't hold a whole lot of pictures and even less if you do ANY kind of video.  You should definately plan on getting a larger card (we bought a 128MB one).  Also, this camera can use regular alkline batteries but do yourself a favor and buy some rechargable ones.  This camera sucks regular batteries down VERY quickly.  We got rechargable batteries but also keep a small pack of alklines just in case.  Finally, I would recommend getting one of the optional kits that are offered.  Our kit came with a carrying case and battery charger both of which are must haves.","I love this camera.  I spent a year looking at cameras and bugging every person I know who had a digital camera.  I originally had a very old Ricoh SLR which took fantastic pictures until the flash went dead.<br />I reviewed the camera on epinions.com, shopping.com, and any other professional camera/imaging site online and it consistently got 5 stars.<br />It's very durable (it fell out of my backpack onto blacktop) and I haven't noticed any problems.  I've had it for about 6 months and I take it everywhere and I've never had a problem with it.  Also, because it's digital (true with any camera) I find I waste a lot less film now, because I can see the pictures so well with the LCD screen, and delete the ones I've taken with the lens cap on by accident, whoops!<br />There are so many features on the camera, I am still discovering them.  It helped me to read one review on epinions.com where one guy wrote detailed examples of what settings he used and the limitations/advantages to each.  Also, I looked at the dcpr review (...)and don't agree with all the comments (it is mentioned that you can't control white balance, but you can, and there are 3, yes 3 different controls for flourescent light - forget the filter! There is also a photo gallery so you can see some examples.  Imaging Resource (...) is also another excellent site for viewing the photo capabilites of this camera.<br /><br />It has a continuous shooting mode, which is great for taking shots of quickly moving subjects (toddlers escaping!) but I also put the camera in the SP mode on sport and get really great shots that way, too.<br />Some other tips by other people:<br /><br />Some tips: 1) use the chrome color setting to get better saturation 2) combine tele and manual focus, if you want to fill frame with your subject, e.g. your kid's face 3)get a UV filter and lens cap put on to protect lens; 4) or put on a polarizer filter to get richer colors ( a must have for seiour scenary phtography); 5) for in-door pictures, better to forgo the automatic settings and use the \"P\"(programable) or \"A\" (aperture priority) to set ISO to 400(800 only at 1M) to ensure maximun shutter speed to avoid shaking,\"slow-syc\" flash mode helps with low light conditions too.<br /><br />This camera isnt' perfect, but as this is my first serious digital camera, I think it's great.  All the pictures I've taken have come out beautifully and getting them developed through Sam's Club was the cheapest and since they use Fuji film - the colors in the photos are very rich.","Very good for amateurs and snap-shooters, lots of features and capabilities that lets you improve your photo skills. Better in close up and macro photos than canon A- series (mainly using flash). A little \"bulky\" for action and outdoors. This is the camera for those who want more than \"point and shoot\", the confortable SRL handling feel and spend less than 300 bucks... and quality pictures and good videos. An 128 xd card (at least) is a real need... Don't forget the batery charger!!! enjoy it!!!","Just bought my Fuji S5000 a month ago and am extremely pleased with it!Out of the box I was taking impressive, detailed pictures!Although daytime shots are taken best with this camera, with some setting adjustments nighttime shots can be pretty good.I have taken most of my shots on the 3 mp setting and they have turned out great.Although in order to use the Raw format you have to use the 6 mp setting.The zoom is great. I used it taking pictures from a moving vehicle and you couldnt even see a blur.I found by reading the book and experimenting most of the problems people have can be overcome.Only cons with this camera is you tend to get a lot of blur on low light shots.  And lastly the included software isnt the greatest","I am on a mission to become a photographer.  I've always loved taking pictures and I want to start really focusing (no pun intended) on photography.  However, I didn't want to start with a $1500 digital SLR and then discover I'm not really as into photography as I'd hoped. So I researched cameras in this price range. The Fuji S5000 stood out as a great starting point for many reasons:<br />1. Awesome zoom.<br />2. Sturdy construction.<br />3. Good for action<br />4. Great price.<br />5. Easy controls.<br />What concerned me were professional reviewers saying that there was \"noise\".  So I looked at betterphoto dot com and reviewed pictures taken with this camera.  I found night shots, shots of fireworks, portraits, action and macro all with perfect detail.  Many of the photo were competition winners.  That was enough for me.  I read a review here saying the noise obscured details.  Huh?  I have taken macros of bees in mid flight with the antenna and fuzz perfectly in focus and clear.  I've taken night shots as well--all lovely.  I don't notice noise except in the lowest light and that was because I hadn't figured out my camera settings yet!  This is the perfect starter camera for me.  We've gotten great action photos, great portraits, wonderful landscapes.  I love it!<br />It does have some \"warm up\" lag time and like all digitals it's got shutter lag (reduced with pre focus considerably).  This means you have to plan your shots carefully, but in order to avoid this you have to go film or Digital SLR and both of those aren't options at this point.<br />Bottom line: Don't compare this to cameras that cost three times as much--it's an unfiar comparison.  I compared it to other cameras in it's price range and class, including the Dimage Z and some others.  The others were very flimsy feeling, awkward to hold, and unimpressive all around.  I'm very happy with my camera.  I'm also hooked on photography and will practice with this camera for a year or two and then invest in a true Digital SLR.  But for a digital with an SLR feel and the ability to take amazing pics this camera is exceptional.  I love it.<br />Get a 512 card--you won't regret it.  A polarizer filter is also a good investment--both to protect your lens and insure good daytime shots.  Enjoy!","I have several Minolta film SLR's but when their digital SLR's didn't allow me to use my lens's I decided to disregard them as a digital option.  After recently checking out a friends Dimage z1 I'm glad now I decided on the s5000 over it. The z1 rattled and the memory card slot didn't function properly. The gears were noisy. The button layout and grip, while similar, were somehow very awkward.<br />None of this is true of the s5000.<br />The only cons for me are the warm-up time and manual focus.<br />I'm constantly amazed at how good the pictures are it produces. I shoot anything and everything with it.<br />While it has a 6mp mode its not from a raw 6mp image but 3mp upscaled to 6mp. I can do that(probably better)in photoshop. You need the s7000 for true 6mp.","I've been an amateur  photog for  70 years and until Santa brought me an S5000 I thought that there was nothing better. The S5000 is better; great color, great prints and no wait. I miss the ability to make time exposures and the time it takes to warm up is sometimes a pain. I'll get used to that. Stashing images on a disc  is a fine way to protect them. No fading. Don't need filters because the computer lets me try many filter effects. Camera is always ready for color or B&W.  Macro feature is useful to support other hobbies( I make ships in bottles). Never run out of film. Outstanding Large prints. If only it was instant on. Oh,well!!!","When I started researching for my first digital camera, there were three main qualities I was looking for: powerful zoom, good picture quality and adaptability (I wanted a camera a newcomer could \"grow\" with). It also had to be affordable.<br />I considered the Minolta DiMAGE Z1 and Olympus C-740 before deciding that the Fuji FinePix S5000 was by far the best value for the money.<br />And I couldn't be happier! The Fuji Finepix S5000 is relatively easy for a digital beginner like me to learn with, but also has enough features to satisfy the creative needs of a more advanced user. Set the dial to \"AUTO\" and you can pretty much just point and shoot. More advanced users can adjust shutter speed, aperture, focus, flash, etc.<br />The camera itself seems sturdy and is ergonomically designed so that it \"feels good\" in your hands. When taking pictures you can easily toggle between the LCD (which is small compared to some models but very bright and easy to see) and the camera's Electronic Viewfinder (EVF).<br />Fuji FinePix S5000 has a special \"Continuous Shooting\" mode that enables you to take 5 frames at intervals as short as 0.2 seconds-perfect for capturing the action at sporting events or getting good pics of moving subjects like kids & animals.<br />Other features include \"movie mode\" (allows you to shoot brief moving pictures w/sound - the length of these movies is limited by the size of your memory card), a macro setting for close-up photography, red-eye reduction, a self-timer & a lot more.<br />I've taken a number of pictures indoors under very poor lighting conditions. With the flash, the resulting picture quality is amazing (you'd think the subject was standing under studio lights).<br />I've had this camera for several months now, had no problems with it, and am very pleased with the picture quality. The best part about it-and what distinguishes it from its competition-is its 10x optical zoom. If extended zoom is important to you, put this one on your short list!<br />Some notes:<br />The included 16MB xD-Picture card will take approximately 19 pictures in 3.0 megapixel (MP) mode, 25 in 2.0MP mode, and 33 at the lowest resolution (1MP). You'll probably want to upgrade to a larger-capacity card. I purchased a 128 MB card, which can take approximately 162 pics at the 3.0MP setting.<br />The camera comes with 4 regular AA batteries, but you'll definitely want to get the rechargeable ones.<br />A tripod is recommended when using the full 10x zoom - although in a pinch (with some practice) it's possible to get clear shots at full zoom without one.<br />Good luck with your decision!","We were previous owners of a Kodak and were looking for a step up from the basic digital point and shoot.  We are very happy with this Fuji model.  The 10x zoom is awesome.  We took it on a beach vacation and got great action shots from far away.  The camera is smaller than you think.  It fits in a palm and is pretty light.  Granted, it won't fit in a pocket, but that is trade between size/convenience and higher photo quality.  The flash is much better than our Kodak; it is much more powerful and does a better job filling in the light indoors.  Indoor pictures of our kids are much clearer and have truer color.  The flash does drain the batteries quicker, but when used outdoors, we can easily get several hundred photos on a single set of AAs.  I don't care much for the included Fuji software; I have chosen to use a third party one instead.","I bought this little gem about 3 weeks ago after doing some research. I was leaning toward the canon a-80 until I read that the Fuji had a 10x optical zoom. I love this camera ! The picture quality is simply awesome. Don't be intimidated with the little quirks like the focus and such, just read the manual that comes with the camera and before you know it, youll be shooting like a pro. This camera is a sound investement for the price. GO BUY IT TODAY !","I absolutely love this camera, I've always read the reviews, and never added one, but the other day I accidentally dropped my camera into a bucket of water. I figured holy s&amp;%t!!! it's lost. WEll, I let it sit for 2 days with some blow drying and I tryed it just now and-------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it started right back up like brand new, I even had to reset the date and all! I've also dropped it on the cement, dirt, kitchen counter, beach everywear! and it works just as it did the first day I bought it. It takes excellent photos for a great price. I've had a few cameras already that I've dropped ONCE, and were RUINED and after dropping my fuji s5000 in a bucket of water!!.......you just don't know how happy I truly am. Even better is the 6 MP option and continuous focusing, and my favorite is the continuous photo mode which when theres no one around and you want to catch a photo of youself with something the self timer also works in that mode....I love it, I bought a replacement camera yesterday, its SOOOOOO going back.. Thanks Fuji I'm excited!","This camera is by far a sleeper value if ever I saw one - for the price you pay, you get a camera which pretty much ensures that the only camera you will buy next is a dSLR.  It covers just about all the little things you will ever need or want in a digicam. The zoom is amazing - my first night, I steadied the camera on my window sill and extended to full zoom and got an astounding shot of the moon - complete with crater detail the likes of which I haven't seen in a medium grade digital camera.  It's compact, fits into my hand easily and the picture quality is amazing - even at it's lowest setting (1MP - 1024x768 res).  My only problems with it are the shutter lag, and the manual focus which tends to be a doozy if you aren't patient and knowledgable.  Also, the lack of the external flash hotshoe is one drawback that nearly made me pass it over.  All in all, I am fully satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for an SLR-like camera.  Amazing!","I am so thrilled with this camera! The pictures are amazing - the detail and clarity is astounding, and the color is beautiful.  You can take color pictures or black and white, adjust the megapixels and ISO - all very easily.  The zoom is extremely strong.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone who is thinking of getting a digital.  I can't imagine owning anything else.","Man, i bought this camera about 3 weeks ago, and I am so happy with it.  This camera is Great.  I love it.  I think I am going to marry it.  I have bought a lot of cheap digital camera's from 1 to 3 mp but this is one is by far the best.  With 10x optical zoom you can hardly beat this for the price.  My only problems with the whole package was the software it came with.  I had a few conflicts with it.  I am using an Hp a520n running xp and the problems came when transferring the pictures to the computer via the included software.  The funny thing is, the computer was brand new too and I was about to go out and buy a card reader for when I noticed that the computer had a 9 in 1 card reader right on the front panel!  duh! So I just removed everything but the drivers for the camera and i transferred the pictures via the xd card.  I also recommend getting re-chargeale batteries for this and keeping a charged set with you if you're going on trips.  It comes with batteries but it used them up in two days. This camera takes some awesome photos, it even makes me look like an experienced ametuer.  GET IT NOW.","well i have had this camera for about 4-5months and it has taken prety good pictures, but recently it has been giving me some trouble....the button to view the pictures has been \"acting up\".....it has gotten jamed or some sort of loose connection.....bottem line is that it's not very durable!!....but the pictures are great.","My husband researched and bought this camera for my Christmas gift.  I had wanted a digital Canon to reuse my investment in my current FD lenses, so I was a little disappointed at first.  Then I USED the camera.  WOW.  AMAZING.  INCREDIBLE.  BUY YOURSELF ONE!!! He saved me the difference in price of $600! I've met several people who also have it and they rave about it.  Read the manual on the advanced features and try them once and you're hooked.  AWESOME.  My friend is a professional wedding photographer and we went to Calloway Gardens, GA, together.  This Fujifilm S5000 digital took better butterfly and flower close-ups (with it's 'macro' feature) than her camera!  The sports program, along with continuous autofocus and continuous shots, makes some GREAT soccer game pictures for all you soccer moms!  :) The pictures are beautiful on-screen and better than my Target developed 35mm prints when printed with a Canon i860 (CR May04 rates it #1 and it is a CR Bestbuy.)  If you are considering a camera, PLEASE try this one on for size.  You will be so HAPPY if you do.","I just got the camera and had to say something about the service.I had been looking around at different vendors. Some kept raising their price and many wanted shipping. Other buyers indicated that clerks tried to sell more stuff. I had good history with Amazon and decided to buy from them. The camera arrived earlier than expected, no hassels from the computer to buy more, free shipping, no tax, I could track the shipping via UPS.I knew when they first tried to deliver!  Everything worked out great.<br />I can not believe the weight of the camera!! It is so light, much more than my SLR. Once I get some shots and see the results, I will write back.","I've used this camera for about 4 months now and I am 100% satisfied. I did a lot of research and eventually made the right choice, given some similiar cameras on the market.  Zoom capability was most important to me, and my expectations have been met and then some.  Also, it's nice to have the feel of the my old 35mm - very comfortable to work with.<br />While the learning curve was steeper than a point and shoot, the manual is more than adequate to familiarize you with the features.  I take a lot of sports pics and use the multi-frame feature w/action setting - always get clear, sharp pics w/no problem.  The digital view-finder has not been an issue for me. It is definietly worth getting a larger memory card from the get-go.  I will admit the manual focus is somewhat clubby, but I get great shots w/out it.  Besides, if you're a professional I'd guess you're not looking in this category/price range anyhow.<br />I highly recommend this camera to anyone wanting more than a point and shoot - great value, great quality, easy to use - I would defnitely buy another Fujifilm camera.  I am extremely pleased!","I did ALOT of research before I bought anything, and when I saw this, it caught my eye.  I love that it actually LOOKS like a real camera, and it performs better than any camera I've ever had.  I've owned mine since the end of February and have taken hundreds of photos that have turned out outstanding.  Everyone who sees them marvels at the quality, clarity, and color accuracy--not to mention the fact that I can get a GREAT picture of a goal shot from the OTHER END of a soccer field.  By the way, all of those pictures I took that people loved--those are all with only 2MP<br />My FAVORITE features of the S5000:<br />  *10x optical zoom allows for EXCELLENT composition (ignore digital zoom though. It diminishes photo quality)<br />  *First-5 and Last-5 modes, when teamed with Aperture Priority at 1/1000 or so, allows me to get the PERFECT shots at sports matches and anything else that might otherwise be missed.  THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST FEATURE OF THIS CAMERA!  I RELY ON IT FOR *ANYTHING* THAT I KNOW I WANT TO CAPTURE, FROM WAVES CRASHING ON THE REEF TO A DROP KICK BY OUR TEAM'S GOALIE.<br />  *It is VERY EASY to use!  As soon as I got it, I was experimenting with the camera in less than 10 minutes.<br />  *Battery consumption is quite respectable, especially for this type of camera.  I use 4x2100 NiMH AA's (I love that it uses AA's) which last easily for hours of taking 5 or 10 shots in a row every couple minutes at sporting events.  I use the flash ALOT, and it doesn't wear too much on the batteries either. (Just watch out for the batteries it comes with... they lasted about an hour after I first got the camera.)<br />  *XD card is great! It's REALLY fast and easy to use.<br />  *Oh yea... finally, THE PRICE !ROCKS! FOR WHAT YOU GET!!!<br />Unfortunately, all cameras have their cons:<br />  *With the GREAT zoom the S5000 has, keeping it steady without a tripod becomes a challenge.  Steadying software would have been a great boon, but it had to be cut for cutting cost and size.<br />  *I !DO NOT! like the electronic viewfinder.  It's hard to use, lags more than the LCD, and is less sharp.  The S5000 should have had a standard viewfinder.  I'd use it alot more and even save batteries from not using the LCD.<br />  *The so-called \"manual focus\" is a joke.  I've found it impossible to operate.<br />PLEASE!!! Don't let my gripes take away from this EXCELLENT camera! Things could always be a little easier or better, but with a camera at this price, of such high quality, and has SO MANY CAPABILITIES, you can't turn this one down!!!<br />Last tips for use:<br />  *You NEED a larger memory card.  At a minimum, 64MB.  I recommend 128MB, though I have a 256MB card.  It works GREAT and holds over 400 shots at 2MP, or 325 shots at 3MP.  With a camera this much fun to use, you NEED space to play with.<br />  *GET RECHARGABLE NimH AA batteries!!! You can't go for even an afternoon without rechargables.  I recommend at least 1800-2100 capacities.<br />  *FINALLY: HAVE FUN!!! THIS CAMERA HAS !ALOT! TO OFFER, SO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS CAPABILITIES! READ THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL! IT HELPS!","I have been looking for a digital camera for about a year, watching as technology improved and prices dropped.  Finally won a gift certificate at work and treated myself to this camera.  Am I glad I did!!<br />I am just an average person, taking pictures of my family, of events, of friends, the usual stuff.  This camera makes it so easy to get professional quality results, I cannot believe it! I will admit, there is a lot about it I have not figured out yet (note to Fuji, a CD-ROM interactive user guide would ROCK!) but it is relatively easy to use with minimal instruction.  And the picture quality is incredible.  Some day I will read the guide and find out all it can do, but even without, I am having a ball!<br />I asked several casual photographer friends their recommendation before I bought and the S5000 was the overwhelming favorite.  The 10X optical zoom is amazing, and the only time the 3.1 megapixels could be a drawback is if I was to blow a photo up to photo size (highly unlikely!).  I was told to go for zoom over megapixels, and I am glad I did.  My first series of photos was St. Patrick's Day parades, and I was able to get some GREAT shots of my daughter's bagpipe band and some shots of her piping in the parade.  Up close & personal while standing on the curb!<br />I was looking at the S7000, which costs about $200 more, but my friends all said don't spend the extra $$, and I am glad I did not!  Even the movie mode is great!  And the sound is good as well.  Thanks, Amazon, for making such a high quality piece of equipment so affordable!","Well,a bunch of techno garbage seems to get discussed in these reviews.Mega-pixels,what does that mean in the real world?Well,nothing to me.I wanted a mid-way camera.Not an insta-matic,but not a Hassleblad.I bought this to make Claymation videos.Also as a general use point and click camera.All I can say is that this camera takes rich,focused,pictures.Its simple to use,and yet allows just enough usefull additives to go beyond rank amateur photography.Is it a pro camera?I dont know.It reproduces what I see acurately and with some filters can do everything I need it too.My grandchildren look like my grandchildren,trees look like ytrees,all in all I think its the best camera for the money.Its both simple and complex,but I can see the use for the features,there isnt much that is useless or overtly goofy.The layout is a little tight,but you can reach all of the needed buttons with one hand.The one complaint I do have is the rather poor quality of the image in the view finder,but the LCD screen is true to sight.If you are a Nikon F2 user,you will probably want a little better quality,but if you had a Pentax Spotmatic,this camera will feel right at home.","I was a little skeptical due to reading that this camera is not efficient when it comes to battery use. I have been suprised in that this has not been a problem, seems to do well compared to others. The camera is easy to use and the photos are very good quality for someone who is not interested in trying to be a professional photographer. The zoom is outstanding and the lag time in taking pictures associated with it being a digital camara just takes some anticipation when using it for action shots such as sports. I simply use the mode to take 5 shots and then delete those I don't want. My only real problems with the camera is that there is no place to mount an external flash, you cannot use different lenses (there are attachments available for some changes) like the Canon EOS or some Nikons,  and that the manual focus is too distracting for me to use. The autofocus does allow two options with one being continuous focus (takes more battery life) or the auto focus just prior to each shot which takes longer to take a photo.<br />For the price, I have not seen a camera that I would rather have. Part of this is because of the optical zoom that it has.","I did a lot of comparison shopping and product research when I decided to buy a digital camera, and this one came out on top. I am stationed in Iraq right now, and I needed something reliable and easy to use here. This camera has done this and more. The picture quality is good at the lower picture settings, but once you adjust the pixels to a higher quality the photos come out amazing. I was especially pleased with the zoom function. When fully zoomed at 10 times the pictures were still clear, even though I wasn't braced with a tripod or anything. The screen and menu are easy to use, and the camera interfaces easily with Windows. I have not even used the included software yet. The only thing I didn't like are the fact that you have to set your zoom before you start recording a movie, and it cannot be changed during filming. The movies come out amazing, though, and the little speaker on the camera is pretty loud when you playback. The 16MB memory card is way too small, but this is the base for most digital cameras anyway. The Xd cards are very small, but are comparable in price with other types. This is an excellent camera for deployed troops or just for everyday use, and you will not be let down with your purchase.","I bought this Fujifilm Coolpix S5000 as a Christmas present for my husband. He has little patience for using complicated cameras. This camera is great for him because he loves to travel the world to go fishing and he wants shots of the scenery, native animals and, of course, those close-ups of the fish he caught. It has multiple features which make it a great choice. We tried the camera out on a day trip to Williamsburg. First of all, the ability to zoom in without losing the quality of the shot is incredible. He took pictures of the flags at the top of buildings 1/4 mile away and details were visible that weren't by the naked eye at that distance. Macro mode worked great. I took extreme close-up pictures of small parts of the Christmas decorations that almost look 3-d. We tried the videomode on a moving horse-drawn carriage that was nice since the clip-clop sound of the hooves could also be heard. Is it the quality of a real video camera - no. But it will still be a nice memory of the trip without having to carry two different cameras. We tried the night-time mode for infantrymen lit only with gas lights. As long as we positioned ourselves properly so the gas lights illuminating the men, we got some decent shots.<br />Taking snaphots of our grandkids (who are active) is never easy with any camera, but at least you know whether you picture turned out so you can take some more. With film cameras, I always took multiple shots to make sure one turned out and then had to pay to develop all of them. My suggestion for shots that you can't live without is to use the option of taking 5 quick pictures in a row. We have used this for taking pictures of blowing out birthday candles. These sequenced shots can be cute for the photo scrapbookers out there!<br />This camera can be used as a point and shoot with ease! Directions are clear and you can take pictures immediately after you you've put the batteries in. However, if you want more from a camera, you've also got it with this one. We kept the instruction book with us as we toured Williamsburg and could easily figure out how to use all of the modes we wanted to try. Many instruction books are not as easily understandable.<br />Do go ahead and buy yourself at least a 128 mg. SD card as well as rechargeable batteries and charger, if you need one. You can even buy filters for this camera if you want to. We plan to invest in some filters before we head out to Alaska this summer.<br />Finally, remember the zoom ability you have with this one for the price! If you are a traveler and like us don't have or want to use the skill required to use a manual SLR, this should get you some shots your point and shoot 35 mm. camera can't get you!","Before purchasing our first digital cameras, my wife and I did a heck of a lot of homework.  We finally settled on the Fujifilm A205 for my wife to carry around in her purse, and the Fujifilm FinePix S5000 for me -- as I am a bit more serious about photography.<br />I wanted something that gave me the feel and many of the features of an SLR, but I didn't actually want to deal with either the price or bother of an SLR.  After doing about a month of research, I purchased the FinePix S5000 and it is the perfect solution.<br />If you read the other reviews, you'll learn about many of the terrific features of this fine camera, but I'll mention a feature I didn't really realize until I brought it home and played with it for a few weeks.<br />The adapter ring that forms the barrel around the lens allows me to use professional filters.  It tells you that right there in the manual that you can use one filter with the adapter ring, but it's buried under all sorts of other technical information.  I'm surprised that Fujifilm doesn't do more to promote this fact because this is a HUGE asset.  The only reason I can think of as to why they don't is because there are so many incredible features of this terrific camera.<br />As for filters, I've since purchased four different ones -- all size 55mm to fit the adapter.  The general use UV filter (mostly for protection) and a Polarizer (to lessen glare on sunny days) were a great place to start.<br />I also purchased two other filters to compensate for indoor light.  The flash on the S5000 isn't particularly strong, so it doesn't work all that well from more than 15 or 20 feet away.  This is important because if you're in a school auditorium (remember, I have 6 kids -- so I'm there often) with fluorescent lights overhead, the pictures can turn out slightly green if taken from a distance.  This does not happen when up close because the flash overwhelms the ambient flourescent light.  But when my kids are on stage, for instance, they turn slightly greenish.  This is no fault of the S5000 -- it's simply a characteristic of any camera taking pictures under most household or office light.  It happened on the time with our old camera.<br />I bought an FL-D filter which dramatically lessens greenish effect from fluorescent light.  I also have an 80A filter that compensates for the same problem that comes when taking pictures from a distance under traditional home-type incandescent light bulbs.<br />I imagine you can use any brand you want, but each of my four filters is a Tiffen and can be bought online or from many camera stores for about $10 to $15 a piece.  This makes the S5000 truly unique.  I have not found another point and shoot (non-SLR) camera that has this capacity to use professional filters.  You can't use more than one filter at a time, but I'm so tickled that we can use any at all that this is a small issue of concern.<br />If you're really ambitious, there all all kinds of filters that do everything from soften a picture to create really neat special effects (like starbursts with every point of light).  This brings an amazing flexibility to the S5000.<br />I also bought a Fujifilm TL-FX9 1.5x telephoto lens which I can attach to the adapter ring, effectively raising my optical zoom from 10x to 15x.  This is a nice feature, but the 10x standard optical zoom is such a monster zoom that I rarely use the additional 1.5x telephoto lens except when I'm watching my kids on stage from the audience or something like that.<br />As noted in other reviews, ignore the 2.2x digital zoom, because you'll probably never use it.  It is disabled when you're shooting at 6 megapixels (if you're confused about the 3.1 mp versus 6.1 mp, read the descriptions about the amazing Super CCD) so I never am able to use the 2.2x digital zoom anyway.  But unless you've had a telephoto lens on your old camera, the 10x zoom will overwhelm you for most purposes anyway.  And if you really need more, buy the TL-FX9 telephoto lens that turns your optical zoom to 15x.  I purchased my TL-FX9 through an outside vendor at Amazon and it worked out great.<br />One last thing, don't forget to invest in a good printer.  All this camera technology means nothing if your printer doesn't do its job.  I bought the Canon i960 at the same time as my camera and couldn't be happier with it when using the Canon Pro paper.  The prints are amazing and truly duplicate the quality of processing you get in most neighborhood retail stores where most film is developed.<br />If you're a serious amateur who doesn't want to break the bank, I highly recommend the Fujifilm S5000.  I absolutely LOVE it.","This camera is a real money savor for a family that can only afford 1 camera! Along with the F5000 (a real bargain now) this camera allows a user to learn photography from full auto to full manual without the high expense of film and processing.<br />You don't even need a Video Camera! The vast majority of video that I take of family and other cute stuff are very short in duration. This camera does 30 frame per second (that means it's like TV, without any jerky movement or lost frames) and the clips are already fully digital and ready to transfer to computer or display to tape. Put a lot of short clips together and you have the same thing you would get from a camcorder only it's all in one camera!<br />Hot Shoe - Unfortunately, the S5000 does not include a hot shoe.  That's the only real problem with this camera.<br />The quality of the photos in the S7000 is tremendous. We stopped doing film photos a few years ago when a local processing company destroyed the only two rolls of a friends wedding back east. Naturally, after that the memories of the trip were gone! They only appologized and moved on! With digital, we have never been disappointed.<br />A major plus of the S5000 is the 10x OPTICAL zoom!  (Ignore the digital zoom, it just degrades the quality of the photo anyway!)  The S7000 has a 6x Optical zoom but twice the photo size.  The S5000 is also significantly smaller than the S7000, and may be easier to use for someone with a smaller hand.<br />Both the S5000 and the S7000 are, in my mind, two excellent cameras for the typical family! And a real money saver! I especially like the little graphic in the viewfinder that reminds you that there might be some camera shake and to hold the camera steady! Very cool camera!","OK, I had to come back and add to this review.  I just printed 8x10's and they are to-die-for!  They are of my sons and I am picky when it comes to hanging pics on my walls.  They better be awesome.  This camera takes wonderful shots.  So to those who said contrary, I think they must be doing something wrong.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br />I can't begin to express my satisfaction with this camera.  It has all the features for a serious photographer like my husband but an awesome auto feature for the moms like me who want great pics of our kids but I only want to turn it on to shoot.<br /><br />In less than 2 hours we had everything figured out and was impressed with how easy it is to use.  My immediate concern was taking indoor shoots - nothing but awesome shots.  My husband was taking pics while driving at 55 mph in his car and even those came out great.  I know it will be worth my learning all of the feature of the camera because his pics can achieve more than mine...but my baby spit-up looks great too.  The continuous shots is great for sports.  I tried it out taking pics of a TV program...it was amazing.  And there are multiple ways to get continuous shots.  The focus ability is amazing.  You can take shots up close, far away and have objects in both places and you can achieve any focus you want (i.e., some objects in focus, all objects in focus, etc).  The zoom is awesome.  ANd you can add a telescopic lens to get 20 optical zoom.  I do wish the camera had the ability to add an extra external flash in case this one dies.  But, some things are worth the sacrifice.<br /><br />The price is awesome.  Why waste money on extra megapixels when the biggest I would print out would be an 8x10.  The optical zoom is what is fantastic.<br /><br />The camera says it can take pics at 6 megapixels - they look the same as the 3 so I don't think it's worth the file sizes.<br /><br />Of course, the 16 meg stick it comes with is useless.  We purchased a 512 and don't regret it at all.  I never have to change sticks so I don't have to worry about losing it, or that I could break it (it is small).  We can take over 600 pics at the peak settings.  600 pics - that's incredible.  Worth the extra $$.<br /><br />I will say the one thing about the camera is the size.  I have small hands and I was looking for something easy for me to hold, easy to carry on vacation, not bulky, etc.  It's awesome for me.  My husband has much wider hands and he manages OK.<br /><br />I researched this camera and others until I got so sick of looking at another review.  This is by far the best one especially for the price.  After we have shown this camera to a few other people, they too went and got it.<br /><br />You can rest assured that the funtionality is all there.  You will not be dissapointed!  Happy picture taking!","I bought this camera about 2 months ago and have been very pleased with it in all but 1 aspect:  it is no good for action shots.  It has the same problem as every other digital camera in that you have to push the shutter button half-way down to lock the Auto-focus, and only then can you snap an instant shot, but on top of that, this camera doesn't take the shot immediately when the shutter button is pressed all the way down, there is a millisecond delay, just enough to lose a good shot.  In addition to this flaw, the Electronic view finder and the LCD both go blank for an instant while the auto-focus is locking, which means that a shot framed a second earlier is lost when the screen goes blank for that short time, and the camera must be refocused.  In combination, these two flaws make it almost impossible to take action shots, even in \"action shot\" mode.<br />Other than that, the colors in the photos are rich and the auto-focus works well.  The details captured are quite nice, and battery life is average.  The video mode is convenient and clear, and the manual settings come in handy for many subjects.  The zoom is great, and even at 10x I still get clear, focused shots.  Macro mode captures excellent detail, and night mode allows for some interesting lighting effects.  Alltogether a very nice package if you aren't interested in taking action shots.  For action shots, you MUST have an optical viewfinder.","Looked for this camera some three weeks.  I like the size and feel of the unit.  Like the interchange feature between the view finder and the LCD display.  The pics are clear and sharp.  Like the large amount of bells and whistles.  These will require much practice, but I think will make one a better photo/tog.","I've had a Casio/Canon QV-3000 since 2000 and really liked it except for the wimpy zoom (3x). I wanted to upgrade to a camera with a better zoom and maybe more MP. I was going to get the Canon Digital Rebel but the more I looked into it the more pricey it became, more lenses and equipment plus a lot harder to use. The Fuji S5000 fit my needs just perfect with the 10X zoom and 6MP. I don't know why they don't advertise this as a 6MP camera because it has a 6MP setting as well as a RAW format! I've only had it a few days and already have taken some fantastic pictures and I'm sure the best are yet to come.<br />Read all these reviews then go out and get one. I'm glad I didn't invest in an SLR because this is a snap to use and the picture quality is awesome!","i just bought this camera about a week ago, and right out of the box, i thought, \"this is such a cool camera!\". i had done some research and wanted a dig camera with a good optical zoom on it, and this was one of few that was over 3X. i got a great price on it (from somewhere else...) and have been using it almost everyday.<br />the good: easy to hold, lightweight, battery life seems good, lots of useful features (once you learn how to use them), zoom is great, movie mode is kinda cool. good shutter speed. pictures are pretty good. overall, it's design and use of use are pretty good. doesn't seem to have a lot of \"down time\" when thinking from one picture to the next. the continous photo modes are cool and some of the advanced features really turn you on to learning more about photography.<br />the so-so/bad: viewfinder (EVF) is hard to see through. better to use the LCD instead. pictures look better and crisper on LCD versus your computer monitor. movies are only available in one resolution setting, which makes a 15 sec video about 5 MB - kinda hard to email that to anyone! difference between 2MP, 3MP and the 6MP are really unnoticable. i didn't find that this camera took exceptional photos (on 2 or 3MP). i owned a 2.1MP kodak dc3400 before this one and felt it took better photos. however, the 4x6 prints i've done look just fine. only comes with 16MB memory card which is practically useless.<br />advice? get the 128MB card, get rechargable batteries. read the instruction manual (at least twice). auto mode works fine, but if you want to take even better photos, learn about the advances features. if you don't want to use advanced features, buy another camera.<br />overall, i am impressed with the features, but not so impressed with the quality of photos. this might go up for auction on ebay...we'll see.","I love this camera, but it's one major flaw gets in the way of total enjoyment.  That flaw is the overly aggressive jpeg compression on standard shots.<br />Great things about this camera:  The movie mode is surprisingly high quality, though low-res at 320*240.  I took it to a concert with a huge xD card and the video and audio quality were very good.  (I listen to a lot of bootleg audio.)<br />It does take very, very good shots.  Make sure you have a steady hand, as the incredible range of zoom, shutter and exposure can lead to blur.  Fuji's non-square CCD technology makes great shots.<br />The features available to control your shots rivals that in digital SLRs.  In fact, I moved to this camera from an Olympus digital SLR.  At the cost, there is no comparison to any other camera on the market in late 2003/early 2004.<br />It takes wonderful low-light photos but you must learn the exposure/shutter features (like on any camera).  The ability to emulate ISO 800 is great.<br />Coming from an SLR, I thought having an electronic viewfinder would be disadvantage.  It is, but this viewfinder has great quality for a pro-sumer class camera.<br />10x optical zoom:  need I say more?<br />OK, so the major flaw.  The jpeg compression on the pictures it takes is way too aggressive.  The wonderful Fuji CCD quality is simply thrown away in 90% of the shots you will take unless you leave it in RAW mode and the RAW mode disables several features.  Sharp details and fine texturing are lost because of the compression.  My last camera had three quality settings in addition to RAW, this has none, well, one, and it's too agressive.  My dream is that Fuji releases a firmware update for this, but I doubt it.<br />Nitpicks:<br />The RAW mode saves in it's own RAW format requiring Fuji's software to be installed.  If it weren't for that RAW format, I'd have no need for more software clutter on my computers.  Other Fuji cameras I have used save RAW as TIFF, so what was Fuji thinking on this one?<br />The included xD card is entirely inadequate.  Again, what were they thinking?  I only used the included card for test shots before putting in larger cards I bought at the same time.  If this was a marketing decision to sell larger cards, the 16MB should have just been thrown in as non-removable base memory.<br />It does seem extremely sensitive to hand movements.  Maybe some mild stabilization would have been a good design, they fit in much, much smaller cameras.<br />The shutter press results in the photo being taken a signifigant fraction of a second longer than I expect.  Though true of many cameras it is particularly exaggerated on this one when compared to my last Olympus.  It is frustrating to take good candids with this camera.  The focus lock (half the shutter button) should actually lock the focus for true instant shots.<br />There isn't a better pro-sumer camera out there in this price range!  But the compression settings don't allow me to give this a full five stars.","With this camera, Fuji apparently decided to put the bucks into features rather than megapixels and to build the best 3mp camera they could -- like building an expensive Audi with a 1.8-litre engine -- resulting in a product that is extremely versatile at the price. Really, few will ever need more than 1mp for typical picture-taking, and the sharpness and accurate color balance this camera produces even at that \"low\" resolution are more than satisfying, even in low light conditions. And, at 1mp, you can shoot and store a number of photos equal to approximately twice the meg rating of your memory card. The lens is sharp and as good a quality as I've seen in any consumer camera, even at its vaunted 10x optical zoom (where you'll need a tripod or other solid brace -- it doesn't have the digital stabilization found on pro cameras). Photos download in a few seconds direct from camera to computer. I like the locked-down flash -- it doesn't fire off inadvertently when you're inside a museum -- and the battery life is as good as I've ever seen on a digital camera. It's unlikely, but should your rechargables ever expire while you're in the field, you can pick up a set of ordinary AAs. The digital WYSIWYG thru-the-lens viewfinder with diopter adjustment is superior to the typical optical rangefinders found in this bracket of cameras. A full range of manual priority settings, the ability to shoot black-and-white and \"Kodachrome\" (color-saturated)photos and a lens hood that accepts standard 55mm filters complete this very attractive package. Drawbacks: the camera, while small, is oddly shaped and is too large for the typical digital camera case or your pocket but rattles around in a 35mm camera bag. The zoom motor is a bit too fast and difficult to fine-tune. And it could use a remote shutter release.","I absolutely love this camera! I did lots of research into the digital camera realm and finally decided on the Fujifilm S5000. This camera takes GREAT pics. It is so easy to use right out of the box. It is perfect for an amateur, but has lots of SLR type features for those wanting to experiement into the technical stuff. I haven't even began to delve into the more indepth features. I have taken all of my pics on automatic. The only thing I do change from occasion is the megapixel quality (1MP, 2MP, or 3MP) and the ISO features (200/auto, 400, & 800). Before deciding to go digital, I was looking at a SLR camera, but wasn't impressed with the picture quality. At first I was hesitant to go digital because I knew that I wouldn't want to print the pics off on my printer and I didn't want lots of pics on my computer slowing it down. Then, I discovered the many online digital photo processing sites (i.e. Shutterfly, Ofoto, Snapfish).<br />While I loved the features of the camera, the deciding factor as to whether or not I'ld keep the camera was how they turned out in print. One word...WOW! These pictures were as clear and crisp as my 35mm camera (which by the way is also a Fujifilm). Also, the pictures that I took on 3MP quality, can be printed off as large as 16x20. I am so excited that I've finally decided on my new camera!<br />As far as the cons I listed...the flash does not popup automatically. However, there is a green blinking light that will remind you that you need the flash. And as far as the 16MB included card. Fuji could have sprung for at least a 32MB card. You definitely will need to get a larger xD style card, however, I found a 256MB card for a really good price (well under retail) on a popular auction site. Some cons I have read is that you will need to buy a battery charger. However, this camera takes regular AA batteries and I am still using the ones that came with the camera. Environmentally speaking, I suppose I should use rechargable batteries. But for now, I'll just have regular AA's on hand.","I bought this camera for almost $100 cheaper somewhere else, but that's not for me to say and ruin business for Amazon. The camera is great and all...but if you are an amatuer like I am the other special features seem almost frivilous. I do love the digital camcorder part a lot though. With my 256mb card I can hold about 15 mins of video or close to 300 pictures. Very simple to hook up to the computer, and I highly suggest getting the lexar flash media reader with it also, which is about $30 on this site, and you won't find it cheaper anywhere else. The software with it isn't so great so I hope you have other editing software. If not, go buy Picture It or something. I don't think that I know how to use most of the camera features yet, but I haven't really tried to either.<br />The pictures come out slightly better than a normal 3.1 megapixel camera that you would buy for $260 in a store. I say for the price of this camera the amount of features it comes with are EXCELLENT. I don't like the auto-focus, it doesn't seem to do much for me. I also don't like the multiple-pictures it can take for when there is movement...I thought they would be nice and crisp or something but you still get the motion blur in it, so if you thought that's what it's about...it's not. It looks like a very big and bulky camera but really, the only thing that's bulky is the zoom lens and extra lenses if you should get them. The zoom is great. I do recommend this camera.","I've purchased a ton of stuff from Amazon.com, but I've never been compelled to write a few words about a product as I am this camera.<br />I had a Sony digital camera I purchased in February of 2001. It was a great little camera. Only 1.3 megapixel, but it did have 3x optical zoom and the ability to add lenses. I had a 2x teleconverter so effectively I could take pics as 6x optical. Optical zoom is very important to me, so this 10x optical caught my eye.<br />I've played with the camera for about a week now and it takes great pictures. I couldn't be happier with the zoom lens, the nice pictures it takes, the ease of use, or the price. I will say I spent about $200 in addition to the cost of the camera on rechargable batteries and memory cards (a charger with 4 batteries, an additional 4 rechargable batteries, and 2 128MB cards).<br />A great point and shoot digital for the beginner with lots of extra features for the more advanced digital camera user. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!","When I received this camera and I turned it on, it was a surprise to see that there was also a 6MP otpion.  Then I read that Fuji uses an great interpolation method to do this.  Even though it is advertised as a 3.1MP it is really a 6MP camera.<br />Great Zoom with a manual focus option, great color capture, and excelent light capturing.<br />I recommend a Tripod since with a 10X zoom causes movement can cause a blured photo.","I bought this camera in October 2003 and was very impressed, it truly was an awesome camera.  I even felt so good about it that I wrote a review.  Now, 3 months later I am regretting my decision to buy the s5000.  In December 2003, shortly before Christmas the camera began stuttering into playback mode while I was shooting.  I immediately became concerned because about 6 months ago I owned a Fuji 3800 that did the same thing before it progressed to turning itself off and becoming generally unusable.  So when this started happening with the s5000 I immediately dug out my warranty card and shipped the camera back to Fuji for repairs.  I have yet to receive any word of it from Fuji.  It strikes me as being too coincidental that both Fuji digitals I have owned in the space of a year have had the same problem.  I never exposed them to extreme weather, they were never dropped, I treated them very well.  I guess I should have learned my lesson after the 3800 but I work in a photo lab and we use all Fuji equipment and I can say with confidence that they make very high quality lab products.  I thought I just got a lemon and it wouldn't happen again.  Well I was wrong.  I just wanted to let you all know about this potential problem so you don't end up in the same boat as I am:  $800 and two cameras out the window in less than a year.  For your own sanity, remember to register your camera and keep your warranty info! Or better yet, spring for the Olympus c750 and show Fuji that poor quality doesn't sell.<br />FEB 10, 2004 UPDATE:  Got the camera back from Fuji on Jan. 27th,  is is now feb. 10th and the camera has died yet again.  Two weeks!  I am sending the camera back and requesting a replacement this time.  I strongly suggest people use caution before purchasing digital cameras from Fuji.  They do not care about the life of the camera, they only care about the sale.  When I called to ask for the replacement they told me I could get a refurbished model.  I did NOT pay for a refurbished model, and they will give me a NEW one before I am through.  I am also telling all of my customers at work not to buy Fuji cameras because of their poor quality.  Please use caution!","Strengths:<br />price! Functionality! High ISO 800 (although at 1M);takes filters;movies smoothness<br />Weaknesses:<br />auto focus and shutter lag are better than average, but still too slow for spontaneity; cumbercum to navigate the menu; manual focus extremely difficult to use;poor build quality;no true wide angel<br />Summary:<br /><br />You can't beat the price-functionality ratio of this thing. ... High ISO comes in handy for indoor photography. You can even take B&W pictures.Pictures quality is good enough. Overall I strongly recommend it. But you read reviews to find out the less than perfect aspects so here we go: 1)build quality--lense barrel is loose, we exchanged the 1st one and the 2nd one was even worse, but it doesn't seem to affect picture quality;2)manual focus too difficult to use,auto focus' generally fast enough but takes some hunting sometimes 3)camera makes an unpleasant high-pitched sound 4)no true wide angel (only 37mm), but that seems like the industry norm 5)shutter lag is quite good but still too slow for taking spontaneous pictures of little kids playing (true for all digital cameras in this price range though).5)ISO800 only available at 1M;6) longest exposure time is only 2 sec.<br />Some tips: 1) use the chrome color setting to get better saturation 2) combine tele and manual focus, if you want to fill frame with your subject, e.g. your kid's face 3)get a UV filter and lens cap put on to protect lens; 4) or put on a polarizer filter to get richer colors ( a must have for seiour scenary phtography); 5) for in-door pictures, better to forgo the automatic settings and use the \"P\"(programable) or \"A\" (aperture priority) to set ISO to 400(800 only at 1M) to ensure maximun shutter speed to avoid shaking,\"slow-syc\" flash mode helps with low light conditions too.","I am a beginning enthusiast but have owned digital cameras for a few years now. This Fuji allows me to point and shoot or have more control over pictures much like a more advanced SLR. The picture quality is excellent and if you do not fall prey to the \"more megapixels must be better\" ideal, then get this camera. I try to explain to people that more MP doesn't mean a better picture within the sizing constraints. Meaning, this 3 MP S5000 takes a better 4x6 and 5x7 than a 5MP camera within the same size. Only if you need to go larger than 11x14 should you even consider another camera. This is a solid camera with great features and performance. The 10x zoom is scary (meaning unbelievable), and the picture's colors are realistic and truer to life than most Kodaks I see which seem to exaggerate colors making a picture seem better than it is. I got this camera for  two hundred less than retail and for that price it is a joke of a deal. Awesome camera for the money. You really would need to spend twice as much to probalby not even get a noticeable difference in picture quality or performance.","I adore my Fuji S5000. I had an OLD rinky-dink Fuji camera with which I was very, very happy for years. When I felt it was time to upgrade, I went with the Fuji S5000 because of the incredible zoom!! I was never a big camera afficionado, nor did I have any idea how to adjust shutterspeed (or why I would do it)....  basically, I just wanted a point and shoot with some room for experimentation. And I got that- set it on \"AUTO\" and it's your basic point and shoot camera. But it's been a BLAST learning to use this camera, and every shot comes out looking like a professional photograph. It takes fantastic indoor photos, and phenomenal, drop-your-jaw outdoor pictures. In fact, two friends of mine bought one after seeing some of my pictures online, and a third is considering it! This is NOT a purchase you will regret.","its a great camera!!<br />If you are looking for good optical zoom(10X) , and great MP(3.1)this is it<br />its a SLR style camera and with variety of functions<br />dont think twice get it!!","I've been looking to upgrade from my low, low quality digital cam for quite sometime, but when I started to do the research, my head was spinning.  So many cameras, so many options, so many pros and cons to weigh out. Based on the reviews, this camera really stood out from the others, but I teetered back and forth for weeks.  The biggest thing holding me back was that it wasn't very compact and I worried that it was too much camera for a non-pro like myself.<br />BUT now that it is finally in my eager little hands, I must say I couldn't be happier!  I'm taking pictures of everything that happens to fall in front of the lens!  You just cannot beat the zoom lens, especially for this price.  The 3-something megapixels is plenty.  You can have as little or as much control as you want...point and shoot or change the settings.  It is so user friendly.<br />And, I don't care that it doesn't fit in my pocket...it fits so beautifully in my small hands AND in my hubby's large hands (he NEVER used our old cam because it was too small for him to hold comfortably).  It feels solid (much sturdier than the Minolta Dimage Z1 that we returned to the store the day after we got it for fear it would fall apart), it's got so many wonderful features I can't wait to explore (I especially like the \"best of 5\" mode for moving subjects like kids and animals), I love that you can take short movies w/ sound, and downloading the pictures to PC is a snap with the included USB cable.<br />Now, it really bugs me when people give any camera a lower rating because the product doesn't come with a large memory card or rechargeable batteries.  From what I've seen, that's pretty typical with any camera you buy, so don't let that stop you from taking advantage of this great camera!  Instead, consider the following when you get this camera:<br />1. Shop around.  I was amazed to find the range of prices on this camera...we're talking $100 difference.  I ended up ordering through Profeel.com and I feel like I got great service and a great deal.<br />2. Fork out the dough for a 128 MB xD card (at least).  I have heard some concerns that taking the xD card in and out of the camera may shorten the card's life.  My solution is to not switch out cards, but to have a card with lots of memory and download the pix to PC regularly.<br />3. Get NIMH batteries and a charger.<br />4. Get a camera case.<br />After that, you'll be all set and taking beautiful pictures!","I am an amateur photographer.  I have used my FujiFilm MX500 for years until I got this camera last year and have not looked back.  It is an excellent buy.  The XD card is much faster than my old SmartMedia card.<br />The Zoom is excellent.  I have taken some great photos of Mt. Fuji from my office in Tokyo and most people would not know that I was nowhere close to Mt. Fuji when I took the photo.<br />The macro zoom on the other hand is not so great, but I have no complaints.  There are enough features on the camera to whet the interest of even the photographers which are more than just amateurs.","You can't get better than this camera for the price!  The picture quality combined with the 22x (overall) zoom and changeable lens makes this THE digital camera to buy.","I HAVE NEVER OWNED A DIGITAL CAM BEFORE BUT AFTER DOING TONS OF RESEARCH I NARROWED IT DOWN TO THE FUJIS5000. FOR THE PRICE,IT WAS FULL OF FEATURES THAT SEEMED PRETTY IMPORTANT IF I AM TO ADVANCE MY PHOTOGRAPHY HOBBY. I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE MOVIE MODE WITH SOUND B/C I DON'T OWN A DIGITAL CAMCORDER. THE PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT AND SO CLEAR THAT IT RALLY TAKES A GOOD EYE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TRADTIONAL AND DIGITAL PRINTS. AS OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE POINTED OUT, THE CARD IS WAY TOO SMALL FOR ANYTING BUT PICTURES. FOR $100 OR LESS(IF YOU SHOP THE RIGHT PLACES) YOU CAN GET A 256MB CARD WHICH WILL GIVE YOU ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF VIDEO AND STILL HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ABOUT 100 PICS AT THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION. SINCE I DON'T FULLY KNOW HOW TO USE ALL THE FEATURES YET I REALLY CAN'T COMMENT ON THEM BUT IT DEFINITELY SEEMS THAT IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR CAMERA TO YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY ABILITY. ONE THING I NOTICE THAT IS SLOW IS THE RECOUP TIME FROM SHOT TO SHOT. THE CAMERA HAS A CONTINUOS SHOOTING MODE BUT IF THE SUBJECT IS MOVING THE PICTURE GETS DISTORTED. THE BOTTOM LINE...AFTER OWNING THIS CAMERA FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF-VERY EASY TO USE, GREAT PICS AND VIDEO AND WOULD RECOMMEND.","I don't think I can say much more then what other reviewers have already said, but I am so happy with the camera I had to say something....  After receiving the camera I was taking pictures in less the 5 minutes.  The ability to have both the point and shoot option as well as the advanced photography options was a big plus for me.  And the features do get advanced, as it will take me some time to learn how to use them all.  In the mean time I will continue to experiment.  The form factor on this camera is outstanging, all the controls are where you would want them to be and are mostly self explanatory.  The picture quality is outstanding as well.  For stills and moving photos the camera has the ability to adjust it self to better settings quicker then I can.  8^)<br />My only complaint is the size of the memory card that is provided with the camera.  With a product of this quality Fuji should step up and at least throw in a 64mb card.  One postive comment on the memory, the xD memory is about 5 times faster in transfering pictures to my PC then the compact flash that was used on my previous camera.<br />I think my loyalty will be with Fuji for the coming years if they continue to produce quality products like this at such reasonable prices!","This camera is definitly a good buy and very simple to use.  It offers the professional options in a manor that a non-professional can opperate.  It is a high quality camera at an affordable price.  Even my seven year brother can use this thing.","This camera is one of the best hidden secrets of the mid-range/amateur digital camera market. It is about as close to a dSLR as you can get without breaking the bank. For one, the camera fits your hand like a glove, with its huge beefy handgrip and thoughtfully placed controls. The 10x optical zoom is stunning. Battery life is amazing, I go for weeks on a pair of 1800mAh rechargeables. Color and exposure are spot on, AF is dead-on accurate and the AF assist lamp is a rarely-found but valuable feature in this market segment. Shot-to-shot time is practically instantaneous. The S5000 can scale from a novice-friendly point-and-shoot to a killer amateur photographer's camera.<br />I have only few quams about this camera. For one, the software that compresses the JPEGs is too aggressive. Images show noise when viewed 1:1, but this isn't a problem unless you're printing photos larger than 8x10; if you are the CCD-RAW mode produces flawless images that can be post-processed on your own. Prints from the 3 MP mode look spectacular when printed in non-enlargement sizes. Next, I would make the LCD bigger, although it is incredibly bright and pretty high-resolution. The EVF needs to have a higher resolution, but it's better than the optical viewfinder found on pretty much every other camera in the market.<br />In all, I strongly reccomend this camera. The professional reviews that I've read tend to put this camera up against cameras that cost it twice as much; that's actually rather flattering for the S5000. It's not a dSLR, but it brings the feel, control, and power of a dSLR to a more frugal, amateur market segment.","I bought this camera about one week after it was released. So I paid $469, but have been using it since early August. All my photos have been excellent, for color and sharpness. I have printed my digital images on Silver halide (AgX) paper and have been impressed with the quality. I have prints as large as 12x18 and see no digital artifacts. While some reviews say that the compression is too much I would disagree. The file sizes are around 800kb and easy to work with and don't over use your hard disk. Don't get caught up in the mega pixel wars, I find a 3MP camera will be enough for your printing needs. I am a research technician in digital imaging and have put the camera through several test for sharpness, grain (noise), and color. So far I can find no fault with this camera for the price range and its features. Another positive feature is its use of power supply, 4 AA batteries. If you are ever in a pinch these can be purchased any where. Battery life is very good, I use the electronic view finder. This takes a little getting use to, but really is fine after using the camera for a short period. If there is one thing that would have been a nice feature would be automatic pop up of the flash when it is needed. Using the camera in Program mode makes it easy for anyone in the family to use, yet the camera has features for the more serious photographer. So if you want a camera with 10x optical zoom, easy to use, no special battery, and the new xD camera card this is a great buy. The xD card really is faster than the compact flash cards so widely used. And if you buy the xD to compact flash adapter you can use the xD card in other compact flash equipment. One final positive is this camera looks GREAT!!!","I've had mine about a week. A co-worker bought an Olympus 740.<br />I can take a beautiful pictures instantly in \"auto\", he has to fuss around with light settings and endless menus adjusting light etc, just to get a comparable picture. His pictures are under exposed and orange in artificial light. This Fuji film camera is perfect every time. I've reached a point where I no longer show him my pictures. It makes him sad. I think he will exchange it for an S5000. The Finepix software included is not as sophisticated as Camedia but, Fuji doesn't install the annoying Quicktime bundle that takes over every aspect of your multimedia software. Some of you will be aware of how difficult it is to uninstall from your system. All Olympus cameras include Quicktime. Beware!<br />Bottom line, buy it. And watch your friends struggle.","Recently purchased this camera and I absolutely love it!  It has been very, very easy to use.  Definately user friendly!  The photo quality is outstanding!  Do however recommend getting a bigger disc - the one that comes with camera will not be enough!  Previously used a HP945 - the Fuji focuses much faster and records much faster!  If your subjects are moving (children, sports, etc.) get the Fuji!  At this price don't hesitate!!","Before I purchase anything with value, I tend to spend way to much time trying to find exactly what I want, then finding the right place for the right price. I have been looking into replacing my digital camera and began my search about 3 months ago. Nothing really impressed me until I came acrosss this most amazing camera.<br /><br /> The FUJIFILM S5000 has been designed keeping in mind the beginner, to the professional. I would not say I am close to being professional, but I do know quality of images. I have an older HP Camera which takes decent pictures, but my biggest issue was taking pictures in a dim room, like a performance or show. This camera can focus and take amazing pictures in dim situations. If it doesn't focus right, you can use the manual focus. It was a little tricky to figure out at first. I actually had to open the manual which I hate doing, but once I knew what to do... its a very simple operation.<br /><br /> To even better convince you, simply run to the mall, and pop in the RitzFilm store. You can ask to see this camera and try it out. You will soon notice another great design layout from FujiFilm for this model. It just fits perfectly in your hand. The layout of each button is just in the best spot for perfect picture taking.<br /><br /> I would recommend this item for anyone looking for an amazing camera with all the bells and whistles.<br /><br /> I love Target and shop here often, but I purchased this item at walmart.com for the reason it was $352.66. Over $46 in savings.<br /><br /> If you have questions, you can IM me on AIM at DeepBlueNY or email me at deepblueny@hotmail.com.","I love this camera! I've been meaning to go digital for awhile now, but have heasitated because most digital cameras don't have the right combination of features for my uses.<br />I got this specifially for a recent trip to Wales & I've not had a second I've regretted it. Especially useful is the continuous shot mode which allows you to rapidly take several pictures in sequence. Since I was watching auto racing this allowed me to get multiple shots of each car as they passed by.<br />I'm still getting to know all the features on this camera, but even at the begining I've had no problems with getting good pictures. This camera is highly flexible & I recommend it especially to anyone who wants a camera that can function as point & shoot but that also has high-end features to allow greater control over images when desired. Of note are its zoom(if you're shopping around, beware the \"digital zoom\") capability and the fact that it can take traditional lenses(it comes with an adapter if you want to use filters, telephoto lenses, etc)<br />This camera is lightweight and seems sturdy (its lived through a lot of hiking through welsh forests with me so far). Its also smaller than you'd think a camera of these features should be.<br />My only complaint: I wish the lens cap screwed on (Mine keeps falling off).","I've had my s5000 for about 48 hours now and I have to say that we are very pleased with our purchase. The camera is easy to use and the pictures have been amazing. I've read a few reviews from some very experienced photographers who have a few negatives about this camera, but for someone like me who shoots pics of my family, car, events, etc. it is the best camera I've ever had. My friends have been quite impressed as well.<br />Oh, and I bought it at Best Buy because they gave a free 64mb memory card with purchase, plus they had 24-mos interest free. Makes this camera very affordable and attractive.","The Fuji Finepix S5000 is a superb digital camera, Ive owned a few digicams, this blows them all away, its fast, has great options, easy menus, and is fairly small.<br />Delivers beautiful images with no fuss.<br />Even gives you the options of Black and White, normal excellent color and last but not least gives you a chrome mode this simulates slides, great with flowers.<br />I cannot praise this cameras enough, its in a class by itself and is not costly.  Buy it, you won,t go wrong.","Great camera for the price. Smaller than expected which is a little awcward for m big hands. but everyting is working great. has wonderful options for geting creative.","I purchased this camera as an upgrade from my Fuji 3800 and while that was a good camera, the s5000 is a great camera.  This camera is truly about the zoom, all 10x of it!  I can easily zoom in on the blue jays in my neighbors trees and when looking at the photo you would think I was right next to them instead of in the next yard over.  I have heard complaints that photos others have taken with the zoom fully extended have turned out very blurry.  I have never experienced any blurriness with this zoom lens at all.  The zoom on this camera is amazing!  Another plus about the s5000 is the styling, it has the look and feel of a traditional SLR which helps traditional 35mm camera users feel comfortable using this camera.  Also the setup is extremely easy.  I had the camera out of the box and operating within 5 minutes the day it arrived. Even though this camera has many advanced features such as manual focus, white balance and ISO controls the beginning user won't have any problem operating it, the camera is fairly self-explanatory in that sense.  One nice feature is the camera's AF illuminator which makes taking indoor shots without the flash very simple and they are usually in focus.  Another great feature is the cameras ability to operate in three color modes:  Black and white (which turns out awesome pics), standard color (usually looks exactly like the real thing), and chrome mode (which simulates slide film and makes the photo much more rich in color).<br />  This camera is almost a 5 star, but I just couldn't rate it a 5 star because of a couple problems.  Most of the time when I am taking pictures against a brightly lit background (whether artificial or a bright sky) there is a noticable purple fringing on the photos.  It is not immediately noticable, but once I noticed it I was not happy with the photos until I edited out the purple in Photoshop. One should also consider purchasing a 256 xd card because of the wealth of photos you will be taking.  On the cameras highest resolution (\"6\" MP) I can fit close to 200 pics on a 256 card.  One other problem I have with the camera is more in the way Fuji marks the camera.  On the side in large print is \"22x zoom\" and this is simply not true.  The camera has 10x zoom with 2.2x digital zoom, and everybody knows that digital zoom doesn't count because of the way it can butcher the quality of the picture.  Also Fuji tends to say that this is a 6MP camera which is also not true.  This is a 3 MP camera with the sensor ability to capture the image as if it were 6MP, the difference is huge and many people could be fooled into thinking that they were purchasing 6MP cameras which is simply not true.<br />  I would recommend this camera to anyone, beginner or professional simply for its wealth of features and its value.  When the camera was originally introduced in the summer of '03 it retailed for close to $600, I have now found it brand new online at several sites for $277, so I would also recommend shopping around before purchasing the camera.","I haven't owned this camera for long, but I've taken roughly 250 pictures with it and they are outstanding!!!  If there are any drawbacks I just haven't come across them as yet.  I do own two other Fuji Digital cameras and a Minolta Dimage 5, but this one is superior to the others - and the others are in the 3MP range as well.  You will need a larger XD card.  16MB just isn't enough.  I can recommend this camera without hesitation.","I selected this model because of the fine word of mouth and magazine reviews. I found that the learning curve for the camera, despite many complex features, was very low and easy to navigate. The photo quality is excellent. The focal range of the lens offers opportunity for shots other digitals don't give, as well as the number of apeture choices. The reason I rated the camera at four stars versus five is the finepix software for downloading the photographs. The program would not recognize the camera even after two installs and my computer is a new PC with Windows XP. I finally had to call a tech friend and we found a roundabout way of retrieving the photos. The camera, when plugged in, becomes a separate drive on the hard drive. If I open the Finepix software, then search for that drive, my photos appear and I can then copy them onto a fixed drive in the computer. I'm very pleased with photo quality and the ability to use this as either a 'point and shoot' camera for fast work or to set your own apeture and shutter speeds.","I've been very pleased with this camera - the SLR feel of it means I don't miss a beat from my normal photo habits, and the results have been amazing. I hesitated because this does not offer a hot shoe for pro flashes, but the pop-up flash  is truly awesome. I've gotten perfectly-lit zoom shots at a rock concert of subjects 15 feet away.<br />I spent more than I'd planned on this for the 10x optical zoom, and that makes all the difference. Closer, clearer shots. The colors are rich, and the special features are not hard to figure out.<br />In short, my 35mm is getting dusty,  and I can't imagine feeling comfortable with any credit-card size camera. Until I can afford the digital back for my SLR, this is the way to go.","I've had this camera for about a month and have had nothing but fantastic photos to show for it.  I am merely a photography novice, but the photo quality, features and zoom can hardly be beat for the value of the product.<br />The Good:  Good picture quality, top-notch optical zoom, easy-to-hold body design, low battery drain when using high quality NiMH batteries, tube adapter and lensecap included.<br />The \"eh\"s: Slight purple glow under certain lighting conditions,  TTL EVF will take a little getting use to, included software is usable, but nothing comparable to IrfanView and Windows XPs built in image handling.<br />The Bad: Included memory card is woefully small, included batteries will last about half of a blink of an eye.","The camera by itself is great. It's good for the begginer and for the semi-pro photographers.<br />However, I will not elaborate on the camera itself, as other reviews are right on the money.<br />I'd like to comment on the fact that you can't go buy the camera and start working. you HAVE to get a bigger xD card, cause 16MB just won't cut it. You HAVE to get rechargable battaries, and I strongly suggest that you get an adapter that will work around the world, not just in your homeland. and keep charging time in mind (you can't go on vacation with rechargables that take 18 hours to recharge!!!)<br />and you absolutly MUST get a case for it.<br />so in short, be prepared to shell out at least a couple hundred dollars so you can start working.<br />on the other hand, most (if not all) of the competition doesn't provide these as well.","I purchased this camera three weeks ago before a major vacation and couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Its my first digital after several years of film photography.  The camera is a joy to use.  I was hooked in a minute on this model.  The manual is easy to understand making operating the camera just as easy.  Automatic, manual, video and other modes make this camera fun to experiment with.  The 10x zoom will blow you away - I got excellent shots of a football game sitting high up in the cheap seats.  Love the black/white mode also.  The camera will bracket for you, let you choose auto, 400 and 800 film speed, and will take five consecutive pictures - allowing you to capture subjects that just won't sit still long enough for the digital camera to finish a picture. Battery life surprised me - lasted much longer than I believed it would.  Picture quality is outstanding.  Installation of software was a snap and downloading of the photos takes just a second.  I am very happy with this camera.","My dear husband, (a pro photographer) clued me into this camera before it was even shipped from Fuji factory. It compares to the top of the line Nikon Coolpix and Olympus high end digicams costing $800-1,000.  But it outshoots all its competitors even though the others cost a lot more $$.  I have been shooting this camera for only 3 days now (it was just released for sale last week) and I love it. My husband loves it and is thinking of buying one for himself even though he owns 3 digital SLR cameras and numerous 35mm Nikons. The photos from the S5000 look fantastic even at the 1mb and 3mb sizes. The lens is really sharp and the 10X zoom allows one to compose just about any photo one can envision. The camera fits nicely in the hand, buttons are intuitive and easy to reach, and one can shoot pics one-handed. It is a much smaller camera than it appears from photos, it is shorter than my cricket lighter!<br />It has a short lag time between pressing the shutter and making the image, as ALL digicams do, but I get around that by using the \"best of 5\" mode...it can blaze off 5 pics in one second, capturing precious fleeting expressions of my 3 month old son that other cameras would miss. White balance is terrific, skin tones look very realistic to life, metering is right on with what a pro photog would select.  You won't regret owning this truly awesome camera. I'm loving it so much I'm ordering a second xd card to take even more pics.<br />Just buy it!!!","Definitely satisfied!<br />At the time I bought this camera (a few months ago), I was a beginner in digital photography. Initially I was looking for Fuji S602. Now I have Fuji S5000. Was it a good choice? Can't say yes, can't say no. There is no perfect camera yet... But I cannot ask for more at $350-400.<br />+: great zoom, burst mode, powerful flash + no red eyes, easy to use, nice colors, great feeling in your hand, movie mode is very good (I would have preferred 640x480), low power consumption, so very good autonomy, many manual settings (for those not happy with auto or predefined modes), RAW mode, can be used as webcamera or video capture device.<br />-: max shutter only 2s, EVF resolution not so high, LCD could have been at least 1.8\", some pictures are noisy (ISO 200 is a bit too high), jpeg compression is quite high (and cannot be changed), low battery indicator is shown only a few seconds before camera turns off.<br />Recommended buys: another XD card, rechargeable batteries, case, tripod.","the s5000 has a very nice professional feel.  it also has 10x optical zoom which is great.  but the superCCD system that fuji uses doesn't give as much detail as hoped for, and in the end, you have to conclude that there are better camers at this price point out there.<br />pros:<br />- 6-megapixel interpolated still mode.<br />- vivid colors.<br />- 10x optical zoom!<br />- flexible: point and shooters have automatic selections and scene modes while creative shooters have plenty of control with manual and priority exposure modes.<br />- continuous shooting mode.<br />- RAW file output.<br />- bright LCD works well even in low light.<br />- xD card features short write times, less battery usage.<br />- non-proprietary batteries used.  this means replacement batteries are as close as the nearest convenience store (i recommend rechargeables though).<br />- good macro performance.<br />- supplied lens adapter gives camera a more professional look and serves as a lens protector.<br />- supports add-on lenses.<br />- unlimited 30 fps 320x240 video.<br />- adapter ring (which doubles as lens hood) included.<br />- low redeye occurrence.<br />- built-in AF illuminator.<br />- not as big or heavy as i thought.  dimensions are 4.4\"W x 3.2\"H x 3.1\"D, weighing 11.9 oz. (excluding batteries and media).<br />cons:<br />- image quality not as good as competition - too noisy and over-compressed.<br />- visible purple fringing.<br />- noticeable vignetting.<br />- lens shading visible in everyday shots<br />- no gain in resolution using the 6MP image size setting.<br />- no direct adjustment for tone or color saturation.<br />- no manual white balance.<br />- limited night exposure capability.<br />- flash exposures slightly underexposed.<br />- ISO 800 limited to one megapixel image size (1280 x 960).<br />- you're on your own when using manual focus - it doesn't show focus distance.<br />- this camera is made of plastic and it doesn't feel very solid.<br />- no exposure info for photos in playback mode.<br />- slowest shutter speed available is 2 seconds.<br />- although i like the fact that fuji uses non-proprietary AA batteries, 4 of these definitely add bulk.<br />- the supplied 16MB xD card is inadequate.  be prepared to shell out a few more bucks for more memory (at least 128MB).<br />- the AA batteries supplied by fuji are not rechargeable so add a few more bucks to your budget to buy a charger and rechargeable AAs.<br />i hope this helps your buying decision.  peace."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-F828","amazon_reviews":["A beautiful piece of equipment.

This camera was the top of the line Cybershot when it came out on the market. It has a 4-color Super HAD CCD. The 4th color is emerald green.  The F828 does things that no other camera can do.  It can focus on the side of a basketball in total darkness using red lasers.  You can program it to search in Night Vision and then take the photo with the flash in normal program or auto in silent mode. The camera will switch automatically.  You will never take a out of focus photo.  The red laser beams freak some people out.  It looks like you are going to fire a gun at them. My wife and I both used these cameras for years. You only need to charge it one time for your vacation.  It uses the same battery as the video cameras a InfoLithium M, so it last a super long time. This camera is made to hold by the Carl Zeiss Lenses and then tilt the eyepiece and viewing screen up.  This is one of the best cameras every made. Sony has a new model, but you can love the F828.  Try to focus in total darkness with your new camera?  Sony needs to just remake the F828 with a CMOS sensor.","excellent, a good investment, money,","I bought it used.  The night-shot function never worked.  Otherwise it is a fine camera, but I particularly wanted the night shot function, and my other cameras work just as well for the other functions.  The zoom factor is so small  it  might as well not be there.  If I had bought this camera new, it would probably have worked fine, but it was out of production. I bought another camera for my general use, and it is so good, I don't use the Sony anymore at all.","it cames just as described, in excellent conditions! I love it. It works very well.","I like very much. ok","My rating of the Sony F828 digital camera, ignoring  it's many features, is based on a it's ability to capture colors in a range that is beyond the capabilities of most cameras.<br /><br />We hybridize tropical waterlilies waterlilies and beardless Iris that can have flowers in the bluish pink, magenta, purple and reddish blue range that out two Nikon Cool Pix and Olympus C-765 couldn't capture. One of the Nikons did a fair job of capturing green and other than red side blue shades and the other did a fair job of capturing non bluish red shades through yellows. The Olympus sometimes was pretty good at capturing both ends of the color spectrum but was terrible in the problem range. In desperation I mounted paint color chips in the problem range on a piece of cardboard and my wife and I went to a Best Buy where a wide range of working digital cameras were on display and viewed the test board with each one. Some may have had color adjustments that we didn't try but without adjustment none seemed any better than our existing cameras and some were worse. In desperation I got my old Pentax K-1000 film camera out of storage and took pictures of the test card with it using Fujifilm 200 in various lighting conditions. The photos resulting, after rather expensive processing, were disappointing because all the colors seemed rather drab and the ones in the problem shades were not all that great.<br /><br />I had pretty much given up on capturing colors in the problem range when I came across a posting on line by a women who was having problems capturing the color of purple flowers but claimed that a friend, using a Sony F828 was able to capture and email photos with proper colors of purple flowers so Sony, having discontinued making them, we bought a used one.<br />Being winter, we have not been able to give the camera an extensive test photographing flowers but the shots of our test swatches and of a full range of Crayola Crayons has been impressive. The camera captured the problem colors on the test card pretty well and we could tweak individual colors by adjusting the color balance but it should be noted that adjusting for an individual color can throw other colors off a bit. In addition to capturing colors in the problem range pretty well, all 24 colors in photos, particularly those in the blue side red through purple range, of the Crayola crayons looked good.<br /><br />Some people will no doubt not appreciate the fact that the camera is big, heavy and cumbersome. Its definitely not one that can be slipped into a pocket or purse but it looks like it will do what we want.<br /><br />Charles Leach","Great camera","best camera I ever try","The camera is in good shape. All possible accesories are included. very good performance. I'm verry hapy with this deal.","Owned this digital camera since 2005. This is a great camera and still takes excellent shots outdoors. The lens is an extremely flexible and bright F2.0 to F2.8, 28mm to 200mm even better than  the RX10 which is F2.8 max aperture. Indoors in dim light the picture is a bit grainy when push to higher ISO, but still acceptable. I think the RX10 is the only fixed lens camera that has a lens that is comparable to the F828. When it is time to upgrade, I will switch to the RX10. For now, the F828 is still a dependable workhorse that churns out excellent photographs.<br /><br />To the previous reviewer, to compare this to a cell phone camera is a real disgrace. I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with a 13Megapixel camera, the picture can not hold a candle to the F828. Factoring the 7x Zoom, the F828 is a truly versatile camera.<br /><br />However, don't ever use this camera for video. It is terrible and SD only.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars for reliable operation, longevity and aging gracefully!","This camera I purchased in 2003 and was stolen in a home burglary.  Although there are newer, shinier, faster, bigger cameras, I loved this camera and replaced it.  The item I received was brand new, in better shape than the stolen one!  The pictures are sharp, and when I took a photography class, the instructor said this was the best camera in the room.  I'm a point & shoot photographer, but it was nice to hear.","I purchased a 828 when they first came out and had a lot of success with making great<br />jpegs, but it was a point and shoot and could not capture some of the things I wanted<br />so I have several high end SLRs and they are the best, but for good still pictures<br />close the 828 is a great camera.<br />This one that I purchased from Amazon seems to be in good working order, I have made<br />some very good photos already and will keep it a long time. Thanks Jim<br />I now know why I kept the flash, tri pod with remote and a few other accessories<br />that I had purchased for the first 828","This is my third f828. It doesn't mean the product doesn't have value. I use my cameras extensively. I have over 30,00 pictures most taken with th Sony f828. So I look for a good buyer from which to do my purchasing The last Sony was from a buyer that stated the quality of the product & he was not lying. I am very happy with my purchase & would buy from him again, if necessary. A five star rating for this seller","This is a replacement for another Sony DSC-F828 camera that I have. It is very useful, it records voice notes wonderfully. I am happy to have found another one.","I see mostly great reviews and a few bad ones.<br />Any one person's opinion is fairly unhelpful.. but here is mine just the same.<br /><br />I have used many camera's over the years and I have some favorites that are upwards of 4,000.00 for the body alone. The joy of using pro camera's is that the clarity and precision is easily duplicated. That said, this camera has given me some of my most shockingly beautiful, colorful, out of this world shots that my other camera's cannot replicate. The night vision setting and swiveling body is something I never saw myself using and then 1 week in I found myself bringing this camera to every single concert and show I photograph, yet again.. because it gets pictures that my other camera's cannot!!! Lets face it, out of all the parties, events, shows, and equally horribly lit places we find ourselves.. this camera always takes amazing pictures without having to bust out the flash! (which I refuse to do) I give it 5 stars because for the money it packs a punch! And It has a couple other magical settings that enable you to light paint your photographs in the most gorgeous way.. It's one bad mammajamma!","This camera was my dream come true. I love to take pictures. The quality of the pictures were the best. The size it was my only concern, to carry in places where I felt more confortable if I have a small one. Great choice!","I have had an F828 for 4 years now and I still LOVE THE CAMERA !!!! I currently also own a Nikon D2X and a Nikon D300. They are also both great cameras but each camera has it's pros and cons.......<br /><br />As for the DSCF828, a Nikon 28-200mm Zoom (f2.0 to f2.8) lens ALONE would cost more than a whole F828. And with the F828 I never get the dreaded \"sensor dust\" that you get with every interchangeble lens DSLR since the F828's lens is not replaceable.<br /><br />The DSCF8's pictures are every bit as good as the Nikon's (and sometimes the color is better) although they may be a few megapixels smaller (but that never bothered me).<br /><br />Yes, there is a problem with ISO and noise in the F828, but I have learned to live with that. If I'm going to shoot at any Hi ISO I wont be using the DSCF828 anyway, or I will use the flash.<br /><br />But my VERY FAVORITE feature of the F828 is the swiveling Lens which has led to many more creative shots than I've gotten with my Nikon's. Nikons \"Live View\" on the D300 cant touch it.<br /><br />So, in summary, each of these cameras has a place in my bag. I LOVE them all and would never give up the F828.<br />I will always have one.","...and I upgraded to the Sony R1 when that came out.  While the R1 have me better image quality, I always miss the F828.  I still do.  As I look for my next camera, planning to a dslr, I still pine for a perfect version of an F828.  Basically that would be a larger info chip to make the image noise not so much an issue.  And, yeah, upgraded MP would be nice.  What I love about the F828 is its flexibility.  Versatility.  It's macro function is amazing.  That's probably what I missed the most going to the R1 (I kept the F828 with me on certain shoots just to give me the option to move in closer).  It is just an easy camera to get comfortable with.  Very light weight. Swivel screen is great.  Great performance with image quality that quickly deteriorates as soon as you push it.","I bought the Sony f828 second hand 2 months ago for SGD$650, which is about USD$430ish. I fell in love with it the first time I held it when it first came out, but it was way too expensive. Now it is mine!<br /><br />The f828 has come down in price, yet it remains very competitive in terms of appearance, features and results.<br /><br />All this previous brouhaha about \"purple fringing\" and \"excessive graininess\" was, in technical jargon, a load of bulldust.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the reasons people had criticisms about it was it's high price. If it had been originally priced 35% cheaper, in line with it's other prosumer contemporaries, maybe it would have fared better reviewise. But then again, Sony has always priced itself higher than other brands.<br /><br />Back to the present though. I've taken about 150 shots and I find it is an immensely versatile camera.<br /><br />It takes two types of memory cards (I have a 1GB Compact Flash and 2 GB Sony Mem Stick Duo primed and loaded), it has a gorgeous lens which focuses mega fast and has a very useful zoom range from wide angle 28mm to 200mm. This is far more versatile than the f828 replacement, the R1. In addition, I love having shutter speed control, manual zoom and focus, manual flash and tilting the handgrip so you dont have to hold the LCD screen near your eyes like a dork.<br /><br />The photos arent bad either. Sony has always had excellent colour and this is no different. I admit that it is not as perfect as a dSLR (I had a Canon 350d prior to this. Pic quality was awesome) but since i rarely print photos, this is not an issue. I usually store pics on computer, burning them onto VCD as backup. If I want to share, I post them online. A lot more \"modern\" people do that than people realise. Not everyone wants to print hundreds of photos which are the size of an A4 sheet of paper.<br /><br />Are there any gripes?<br /><br />A larger LCD screen might be nicer, though I really have no problems with the 1.8 inch one provided. Current digi cameras all have 2.5 inch though.<br /><br />As one reviewer mentioned, it does get a bit heavy if you carry it around for hours on end.<br /><br />The instruction manual could use some improvement. There were a couple of times it would say something like \"press the blah blah button to use the blah blah feature\" without actually specifying where the button was, or how to find the controls for the feature.<br /><br />But overall I like the f828. At it's current second hand price, there is no digi camera which has it's features, and you have to pay a lot more to get superior features plus picture quality. The Panasonic FZ-50 has double the zoom range, but no wide angle and some people still think it has issues with grain. A dSLR with a useable 28-200mm lens costs triple or quadruple the price. (eg a Nikon dSLR with a Nikon 28-200mm lens)<br /><br />I hope some people find my opinion of some use :) Cheers!","I use this camera extensively for field work, and I work for an engineering company.  I travel a lot so I lug this beast through airports and rental cars -- I would not do that if it wasn't worth it!<br /><br />This is the Swiss army knife of cameras.  Over the years I've owned it I've added the remote commander (release cable), a pocket tripod, external flash, and macro lense.  Also an extra battery (I sometimes shoot for hours in the field and take hundreds of photographs, so an extra battery is handy.)  But all this stuff (including the charger & manual) fits into a regular-sized SLR camera bag, so essentially I have a full studio in one little camera bag.  I've used the movie mode to shoot digital video of street conditions and traffic operations (I strapped it to a bicycle once to record bike commuting conditions) in addition to the still mode.  The camera works great for portaits, landscape shoots, long exposures, indoor photos of public meetings -- you name it, the camera can do it. Enlargements from 8 MP are better than anything I've ever gotten with 35 mm and I put them right up there with photos from my Rolleiflex medium format camera (I've had them both done for comparison, and they both looked great -- different from each other, but great.)<br /><br />Downsides?  Well, it is heavy, but I've tried using the tiny cameras as well and they just don't cut it for me.  I'm too spoiled by the infinite possiblities of this camera.<br /><br />Purple fringing -- not an issue.  I've seen it a few times, but it's never of any consequence.  I've also seen it on 35mm slr pictures -- I think it's an artifact of particular lighting conditions with particular lense settings.  Big whoop.<br /><br />High ISO Noise:  I only go above 100 ISO if I absolutely have to, and if I have to go above 200 ISO, I reset to 64 ISO and just use the flash.  The 400 and 800 ISO settings are about useless in my experience -- there is tons of noise.  You can clean the noise up, but when the noise to picture ratio is so high, I find that the cleaned pictures have a definite \"soft\" look to them.  That's going to be good occasionally, but not generally.  For very low-light situations without a flash, I prefer to revert to 400 ISO film.  This is the major shortcoming of this camera, in my opinion.<br /><br />Durability -- let's talk.  I've had the camera sent off for repair once, after about two years of very heavy use (including getting dumped out of a bag into the sand while working in a Katrina rebuild job, and being strapped to a bicycle :-)  The mode dial switch on top got squirrelly, and two screws worked loose and disappeared out of the lense barrel.  So I bought a slightly larger bag (to keep the mode dial from getting bumped in the bag), I routinely check the tension on the barrel screws (they get loose occasionally) and I'm more careful about where I leave the camera.  I consider the camera very resilient for the type of conditions I put it through.  Will it last 50 years like my Rolleiflex?  I doubt it.  Will it last longer than other digicams?  It's already outlived two of my wife's Nikons.  I think it's going to be around a while. I would not be surprised if the camera outlived the digital storage media available for it.<br /><br />What I love about it:  I love the completely silent operation -- great for candids and taking pictures during public meetings, photos at family events, etc.<br /><br />The rotating back is great for the same reason -- you can shoot and no one even realizes you're doing it.  I've really come to love waist level shooting.<br /><br />Complete manual control -- let's me do everything I can do with my K1000 (except for infinite bulb control.)<br /><br />Infrared mode -- produces neat infrared photos with a filter, that in turn make cool B&W pictures.<br /><br />And the lense -- what's not to like about a HUGE Zeiss lens?  Manual zoom control -- yes, the only way, feels like a real camera and not a toy. And no annoying \"whirrr\" when I zoom in and out.<br /><br />I could go on, but those are my favorites.  This camera is as big as a horse, as far as digital cameras go, but it's a work horse, and it definitely pulls its weight.  Not a camera for the faint-of-heart, but an excellent do-it-all digicam.","My company is primarily marketing, graphics and promotion; not a photo studio. But it's a significant, additional in-house service we provide. This met my particular needs for an upgrade from the F707...and, yes, I wrestled with the same issues people have mentioned here. So, this is a pretty detailed, often technical evaluation:<br /><br />ALL-IN-ONE VS. DSLR:<br />*SLR mirror noise is intrusive in many of my shooting situations, i.e., arts events, rehearsals,<br />*I don't need to carry the additional weight of extra lenses at live events,<br />*Dealing with sensor dust could ruin my client's day.<br /><br />8MP NOISE:<br />*Unavoidable with that many sensors on a 2/3\" chip. I shoot ISO64-100, 200 if necessary. I can always clean it up with Noise Ninja if required. I'll take the extra detail.<br /><br />CHROMATIC ABERRATION (CA)/PURPLE FRINGING:<br />*Unavoidable in digital cameras (that purple border around light sources such as bulbs, sun reflections). Pretty bad in this camera.<br />*Solution: I post almost everything anyway. Photoshop CS fix with judicious use of the sponge tool is easy. Lots of solutions posted online.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE CAMERAS?<br />*Canon Powershot Pro1 was the only other competitor for me. But, had no live histogram, nonexistent low-light AF, and half the battery life of the F828. Nikon (8700) lens disappointing @ only 35mm equiv. wide, proprietary front filter mount. Olympus performance was dismal.<br />*Sony R1 (10MP): MUCH bigger sensor/less noise. But, R1's 120mm zoom equivalent couldn't match the F828's 200mm (f2.8 vs. f2.0 wasn't an issue, considering sensitivity of different chips). R1 front filter is 67mm vs. 58mm on the F828, meaning fewer and/or more expensive accessory lens options for the R1 - except heavy, expensive proprietary Sony adapters. Disliked the top-mounted LCD on the R1.<br /><br />WHY THE F828 WORKS FOR ME:<br />*Immaculate Zeiss lens,<br />*Manual zoom,<br />*Same (now) classic Sony swivel body for easy overhead/ground shots...solid, solid, solid,<br />*Fast hologram AF,<br />*Speed or framing (yes!) burst, bracket exp,<br />*RGBe sensor solves the problem of overblown reds in previous models, excellent depth,<br />*Expanded, though still easy, menu navigation/thumbwheel/joystick,<br />*Both CFII media (I use 5GB) & Memory Stick (faster..I use ProDuo 2GB),<br />*Compatable with standard 58mm thread accessories (filters, adapters, etc.),<br />*Simplified single button delete on review or PB.<br /><br />And a note on Sony proprietary flash (i.e., the HVL-F32X):<br />I use the Promaster DX5500 which may be the only other hotshoe mount that talks to the Sony. The advantage is x-axis rotation - which the Sony doesn't have - particularly useful in bounce flash situations.<br /><br />In short, the issue of whether this is a good product or not is moot.  Like \"JohnBoy\" Shultz (see below) would probably say, \"It's a Sony!\"<br /><br />It's a matter of whether it meets the user's needs. You're probably reading this because you're smart enough to research your puchases and evaluate a product based on your abilities and requirements. Despite a few shortcomings, I've found this an excellent \"best of both worlds\" choice.<br /><br />***************************************************************************<br /><br />March, 2011 Update:  Upgraded to a Nikon DSLR a year ago.  Regrettably, the Sony Alpha series didn't have the same bang for the buck.  And, even though only 8MP, the best endorsement I can possibly give over four years later is that I keep this gem as my backup camera.","Just for taking photographs, the Sony 828 is the third best camera I own. But the other cameras do not do nearly as well focusing in low light (where the Sony uses a matrix of lasers) nor do they take short movies like the Sony will for those situations in which you want more than a photo. I can certainly go out and create purple fringing with this camera. And it overall is not as sharp as my others. Nor will it adapt itself by accepting alternative lenses. But it will consistently get excellent shots under non-extreme conditions. And if you need to get a short talkie, this is the only camera in this range that will do it.","Others were telling me to get a camera that can take all the lenses etc.  I chose this one because it did not have all the lenses to haul around!  It has the full range from 28mm to 200mm in one lense. And a good lense at that.  I wanted a manual zoom so I did not have to fumble with a little switch that also drains battery life.  I also wanted to be able to have control of EV, flash, and other features easily, this has a bank of buttons on the side, once learned, easily faciltate control.  In addition it has two separate media chips for continued shooting or separating projects.  And the battery life is outstanding.  And, of course, the picture quality is great; any bigger than 8MP would overwhelm my computer for processing.  There are other great features, but these are biggies for me.","I just love this camera.  I'm a novice and love how this camera takes photos.  It makes me feel like a pro. Shopping for a nice digital camera with all the bells and whistles, this is the one to go with.  I think this camera gives me room to grow.  That's what I wanted.  I would highly recommend this camera!","I started out with a Sony Mavica years ago and now have this F828.  I'm not a professional photographer, but a constant one.  This camera allows me to take great photos of fireworks, holiday light displays, wild critters at night, pets, landscapes, people, sporting events.  You name it and the camera can capture it.  I love the multi-burst feature, which none of my previous cameras had.  The quality of the photos is outstanding for printing, too.  My only negative, and it's a small one, is that this camera is heavy to carry when on an all-day outing.  I know it only weighs a bit over 2 pounds, but after several hours it seems more like 6 pounds.","I owned the 717 model (5.1 mp) and thought it was pretty good.  I have used many types of cameras over the years doing weddings, portraiture, etc.  My favorite portrait camera was the Bronica ETRS which is a big, heavy medium-format film camera.  A few weeks ago I did a photo shoot for a bride using both cameras to compare results.  As I suspected the Sony produced quality just as good up to the 8x10 size.  I didn't try anything larger at the time, but I am told the 717 will produce a good 16x20 print.<br /><br />I saw the 828 advertised and decided to read up on it.  I liked what I read and since the 717 did so well I decided to move up a notch and get the 828.  It was love at first click.  Now I can make even larger prints if I need them, but with 8 mp I get beautifully detailed prints with magnificent color and depth.  It also uses the same battery and storage media.  Having done semi-professional work in the past, I highly recommend it for the money.  The \"point and shoot\" aspects of the technology make it easy to operate for the beginner and, if you want fancy, it has the horsepower to get you there, too.","When i reviewed the (then new) DSCF-505 sony cam, i said it was better than high speed film, but not as sharp as 100 speed. well, now you have enough pixels to fill a movie screen.<br /><br />movies are currently being edited with 4,000 pixels in the wide dimension, the 828 shoots 3264 pixels. for comparison, kodak #5201 high resolution movie film offers 80 pixels per millimeter. The image of a hollywood movie negative is about 24 mm wide, so the resolution of #5201 is about 1920 pixels, if used in a 135 camera the width is 36 mm, so it would be equal to about 2880 pixels.<br /><br />The camera also has features that make it easy to photograph unusual subjects, long exposures, macro focus.<br /><br />yes, you will see the blue fringing at the edges, but you will need to look carefully for it, and i only see it in very close or macro subjects. This is more likely a lens issue.<br /><br />The color is simply spectacular, especially in skin tones. everything except where to point is automated, but every adjustment can be made manually, allowing the advanced photographer complete artistic control.<br /><br />When considering the cost, think in terms of price per picture, the more you take, the less each one costs, since the media is reusable.<br /><br />Be sure to buy extra memory sticks, the file size of a typical image is 3 megabytes.","A little on the heavy side but the infrared mode is really neat.","This a fantastic equipment for those who love serius photography. I recomend this products 100%","I am not a professional. I take pictures for my work. Upload to the web. E-mail pictures and video. This camera makes everything easy. The quality is incredible. I am still learning how to use the features. My brother took some pictures printed out 8 1/2 X 11 and put them in frames. They look professional.<br /><br />I would recommend this camera as this camera was recommended to me.","I was on the process to buy a high-end digital camera.. So I started to look on the internet for my options. Finally it came down to the SONY 828 vs. the canon digital rebel. I finally made my decision to buy the Sony and boy , am I glad that I did that , not only it is an awesome camera for my needs but also it is a piece of beauty ... I will recommend it to any beginner who would like to jump on the pro-wagon .","I purchased the Sony Cybershot DSC-F828  for my wife, and she is writing this review:<br /><br />We received the Sony F828 in record time, great service from Amazon!  I read the manual and experimented with the basic features and read of some of the more advanced features.  We left for an 18-day vacation soon after, and the camera got a 3,500-plus photo workout.  This included multi burst shots of jet ski races in Pahrump, NV; amazing shots of  stalactites and stalagmites using the NightFraming feature in Lehman Caves in Great Basin National Park; magical sunrise photos of red rock formations in Arches National Park; atmospheric but crisp photos of Monument Valley, UT before/during/after an afternoon storm and many others. Not being a professional, or necessarily gifted, photographer did not hinder me from getting many wonderful shots.<br /><br />I am an artist, and tend to compose my paintings through the camera lens. This camera captured exactly what I was seeing, capturing the true colors.  I was able to figure out, through trial and error at times, everything I needed to take the kind of shots I wanted. The manual, in my opinion, falls short of explaining things in more than vague terms, but I think if I can figure out all of these features any person of normal intelligence and persistence (stubbornness) can do the same.<br /><br />The more I use this camera, the more I get excited about having it.  I would definitely recommend it as being a very powerful camera for even professionals, yet manageable for someone like me, who needs the best quality photos in terms of clarity and color possible.","This is a great little camera for folks who want hi quality photos and video capability in one camera. I got one when they were first released and thoroughly enjoyed it until I tried the Canon 10D SLR Digital. Now I have two 10D cameras.  I use  the F828 as a back-up video cam or carry it in my pack when I don't want the extra weight of the 10D. My main reasons for preferring the 10D are: quicker manual adjustments, more intuitive feel, better photos, multiple lens options, great tech support. If I could only have one camera, and wanted to take photos and vids, I would choose the F828. Otherwise I would go with the Canon 10D or 20D and get a stand-alone video cam.","I started off, like most people, with a 35mm pocket camera.  The 35mm produced 2 or 3 pictures I could live with however, it takes more than an hour to see the results.  I changed to the 24mm Advantex system and was pleased with most of the photos shot, an hour or so later.<br /><br />I allways wanted a relly good camera and decided to up-grade to a digital.  I did not want to drop good money into the unknowen so, I started a month long reserch for the perfect camera for me.  I have read more than a hundred reviews from everywhere before it lead me to one model; Sony F828.  For the price, the Sony offers the widest range of functionality and versatility in its class.<br /><br />This is the first digital camera I have ever owned and it took no time for me to learn to use it well, but it did take work.  Most of the Sony features are right at your fingertips.  Other, less traveled features, are only an easy-to-read menu away.  Once you learn the menus and settings on the F828, you can use other Sony cameras (DSC P75,100,150)that have the same system.<br /><br />The Sony F828 has good video and ok sound, too.  I was going to buy a video camera from Sony next.  After useing The F828, I abandond the idea.  This camera is memory hungry in video mode if you want to shoot for any length of time.  The camera offers three video qulity levels; 160, 640 standard and 640 fine.  With a 512 memory stick,  I can shoot 22 minutes of video and sound on standard.  If set on 640 fine, the time is about 5 minutes.  I bought a 4GB Micro Drive and I am now able to shoot video past the battery life and thousnds of photos.<br /><br />A note about accessories:  Buy a good flash for when the need arises.  Do not wast your money on macro add ons or a telephoto doubler. I have thease items and am not happy.  The macro built onto the camera is excellent.  The built on 200mm zoom is great.  The 2x doubler lowers the qulity of the photo and confuses the auto focuse.  If you want a lense accessory, a wide angle lense is the better choice.<br /><br />Draw backs on the Sony F828:  It is not as mobile as my pocket camera and a bit heavy.  Unless you plan to blow up photos and need the advanced features this camera delivers, I would recomend another camera.  The Sony DSC P-100 or P-150 is a good start.  My second camera is a P-100 and it is out of this world.<br /><br />If you do deside on the F828, stand back, your in for a great photo experiance.  Remember this.  The most expensive camera you can buy, is the one that sits in your closet...Walt","I love this camera. Once you learn the different shooting modes and features you'll be taking pro-quality shots. The night-framing feature is excellent for nighttime without the overbright characteristics of using just the flash. You can take roughly 300 pictures using a 1 gig compact flash card at 3264x2448 (highest resolution).<br /><br />I also purchased this with the Sony accessory kit. The extra battery, multi-coat protector lens, and carrying bag have been very useful from the start.<br /><br />Considering my old Sony F505v lasted me 5 years this one will probably last at least 10 more! A decade worth of high resolution memories is worth the price of admission!","I have owned my 828 about a year now and I have been amazed at the bashing this camera has and still does take. Even to the point of 828 online clubs devoted to the pictures and defense of this amazing camera! And yes this camera is amazing. As I have stated in my other reviews I sell cameras for BestBuy as well as work as a professional photographer so I will give you the straight and narrow on this camera. Ready? The fringe thing-I have taken about 2000 pictures with my 828 and in only one of them was I able to reproduce the famed purple fringing effect, this was using a long shutter exsposure on a city street at night, 1999 other shots in as many situations and not a trace. I even tried pointing the camera directly at the lights in the the bestbuy store (you know what those look like!) and guess what? \"Nada\" I just got a great picture of the bestbuy ceiling. So the conclusion on fringe? Get over it, it is such a rare occurance that it hardly warrants concearn. Noise: here is where a tend to agree with most critics your pics will get mad noisy at the 800 ISO setting, but few digital cameras wont, hell even Canon's 20D starts losing luster at a 800 ISO setting and that camera will go all the way upto 3200!! So turn down the ISO and take your pictures or learn to use photoshop or something and fix them. I mean this is a DIGITAL camera right? The thing these bozos don't tell you is that removing ISO noise from an image is an extremely easy thing to do, again, get over it. Having addressed the two main gripes about the 828 what are you left with? Lets start with the four color CCD. I have said this before and I'm saying it now: The 828 has the best color of ANY digital camera out there today! If your into outdoor pics, close ups, night shots (turn that ISO down) your pictures and thier color will be amazing! By the way touching on low light pics and the 828, I do alot of long exsposure shots with the 828 and they are always top notch! Battery life on the 828 is an impressive 240-300 minutes on a full charge! (no kidding)The Lense- the biggest part of the camera and the biggest attraction if you like focusing your camera yourself (with a little digital help). The lense is a Ziess made with little to no barrel distortion (flower lense hood is included! BONUS!!) and quite versitile as far as the focal ranges it will cover, this also brings me to the cameras construction, this baby is heavy but damn! it sure feels good! The 828 is the 2nd largest in its class, so if your into pocket toys you best be looking at Casio or HP cameras (sorry that was mean) The 828 is really a SLR camera with a lense on it you can't take off. End of story. The body reminds me of my Sony F-707 wich I loved ( probably the best 5MP camera ever made) The tilting body is a Godsend for the pro and joe shmoe alike! The eye piece is among the best out there and id diopter adjustable, the LCD screen is a little small 1.8 inches but is extrememly clear and sharp so it works for me. The 828 like its little brother the V3 shoots on Memory stick as well as Compact flash type I & II, and unlike the V3 the 828 can use micro-drives (I have a 4 gig in mine) All the controls on the camera are well placed and easy to master even for the beginner. However I found i got slightly better pictures in the \"P\" mode than in full auto, but a novice should always start in the auto mode. The 828 boasts the same range of shutter speeds and apatures as the DSC-V3 (see my review) wich as I have said before I think is a sane selection of ranges! All your options are useable so play, play, play!! The scene modes are pretty run of the mill: Landscape, night shot, low light portrait, snow, tropical sun, and candle light. The white balancing features are pretty dead bang but watch out for the blues- I leave mine set to auto unless im shooting outside then I'm pretty safe. Sonys X-32 flash and this camera are a match made in heaven but thanks to the ACC port your old one will work too, but I can't stress enough the benefit of Sony's. Sony still has the on board crop feature. (other cameras do this but only Sony lets you  determine the resolution of the cropped image!I have just barely touched on the features and capabilities of this camera ( I don't want to use up all of amazons web space) so let me leave you with these thoughts. Currently I own and run the following digital cameras: F-828, DSC-V3, Nikon 8700, and the Nikon 8800, all four of these are eceptionally high rated cameras, out of all the 828 remains my right hand camera. I will say in all honestly this is not an easy camera to use, It will make you think about your shots, make you work for them. This is NOT a point and shoot camera, it was never meant to be (people who love this camera will tell you this) So why all the bad press? Well, with this camera Sony made an awful lot of professionals toys run of the mill, this camera broke down alot of technology barriers (still does in fact)So alot of people went on the offensive looking for the fly in the ointment, wich can be found with any camera on the market today. So why the fuss? this is a genuine technology breakthru people, the real deal, and there ain't no going back. I apologize for the lack of technical data in this review I love this damn camera so much I tend to spend more time defending it than specing it out! But the proof is in the pictures so with that I'll rest my case. Because the strongest feature of the 828 is the most important one \"the pictures are fantastic!!\" If you want an easy to use camera, move on. If you like to fuss with things and tinker or play with your camera, have fun with your camera, create with your camera then add this puppy to your shopping cart. cause this is your beast.I have heard Sony is working on a successor to the 828 I can only hope it is half the camera! Bottom line... don't believe the hype or sour grapes folks this is the state-of-the art and has been for nearly 2 years. Thanks for reading, good luck in pictures!!","I got this camera in November 04, and have had lots of time to play with it.  I have got some great shots with it.  I am far from being a pro, but who knows!  Maybe after I learn all of the settings and what they all do, I will look like a pro!<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a great camera with lots of features for taking some great photos.","I have been using the F828 for about 2 months and have taken over 1,000 pictures. I do not use the auto mode, and take most pictures in program mode, but I use A,S, and M modes also. I definitely experience chromatic aberrations, usually purple fringe, but sometimes other bubbles and flashes of colored light. It's obvious to me, but people looking at 4X6 prints normally wouldn't notice it. On larger prints however, it would be obvious. It is fairly easily corrected using Adobe Photoshop. I've had maybe 6 shots where the aberration was so bad it was uncorrectable. Despite this problem, I enjoy using the camera. With a little practice, it's very easy to make adjustments; WB, flash, OEV, auto focus method, etc.","perfection fuction, price, design.<br /><br />I think, it's better than SLR digital camera of higher price.<br /><br />I have another digital big, heavy camera which has many fucntional menu. I don't know all performance also carrying is not good.","Ok, this isn't one of my usual hands-on reviews.  I ain't got the kind of money to buy all these cameras and test them.  But I wanted to give potential buyers some help...<br /><br />Should you consider an SLR-type EVF (electronic viewfinder) digital camera or an interchangeable-lens digital SLR for serious photography?  I faced this question and agonized over it for months.  I wish I had come across this brief and very helpful article by Popular Photography Magazine (I'm not affiliated with them in any way):<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The article compares five current-model EVF cameras: Canon PowerShot Pro 1, Konica-Minolta Dimage A2, Nikon Coolpix 8700, Olympus Camedia C-8080, and Sony Cybershot DSC-F828.  It's a very easy read, and at the end the writers give you a helpful checklist for the EVF vs. d-SLR decision.<br /><br />As for myself, I'm going with a d-SLR since I want 1) high-quality lens, 2) lens choices, 3) little to no shutter lag, and 4) accessory choices.  Good luck!","This is a great camera--takes great pictures.  You can let the camera make all the decisions or take as much control of the exposure and focus as you want.  It also will record \"movies\" or sound associated with still pictures.  Add an infra-red night mode and now you know why I give it 5 stars!<br /><br />It's good for someone learning or someone like me, an ex-35mm SLR person balking at the high price of a new digital SLR system.","After a recent awful experience with the Sony Mavica 350, I thought hard about whether to go with this camera or something like the Canon Rebel. Because I mostly use my camera outdoors in settings that cannot be driven to, I decided to go with this \"all in one\". Although it is somewhat bulky, it is lighter for me than carrying the kit I would need for a digital SLR.<br /><br />The Zeiss lens is astonishing. It certainly contributes to the camera's weight, but for me the improved image quality makes this \"weight in gold\", not dead weight. The lens combined with the macro setting, for instance, has helped to make some remarkable pictures.<br /><br />Add to this the bells'n'whistles of the multi-point autofocus (hey, I _make_ pictures; I don't pretend to be an actual photographer, nor do I play one on TV!), the night-shot system, and the slow-shutter noise reduction and I have been a very happy picture maker. It is also nothing short of miraculous, to my thinking, that this camera will take one of the new \"Pro\" memory sticks that transfers faster AND has huge capacity.<br /><br />Picture making is entirely something fun for me; I don't work at it. Consequently, if you are a \"real\" photographer, you would probably do well to heed the technical reviews at this site. What causes me to recommend this camera so highly is that it is easy to use, helps me make terrific images for the Web and printing, and represents for me an excellent value. I don't make that last point lightly because, for me, this was a pretty expensive purchase. But, just as I think every ounce is worth the weight added to my treks in the mountains, so also do I think that this camera is worth every cent.","This is the end-all, be-all of cameras and when I saw it on Amazon for $454, I jumped on it and purchased other accessories.<br /><br />I got the accessories, and an email saying my order for the camera had been cancelled.  It turned out that the order was forwarded to USAPhotoNation, not Amazon.  It wasn't a zShops order, it was Amazon's own internal order.<br /><br />After looking more in depth, USAPhotoNation does this.  Sells cheap, cancells, gets you to call, and they try to sell you overpriced accessories.  Aparently there was some problem with part 2 and they just cancelled the order.<br /><br />Amazon was not willing to work out a deal or compensation regarding the price they promised and for which they accepted money.  I did get a full refund on the camera, but I still have the accessories which I wouldn't have purchased in a split order.<br /><br />As for the camera itself, it has a great optical zoom, takes pictures in low-low light, supports compact flash as well as memory stick pro, has a manual focus ring, and otherwise does all of the things that all of the other sony DSCs do combined into one.  It is a bit bulky, but it's well worth it if you're serious about photos.<br /><br />There are some reports of purple streaks, but this is generally lense flair.  A $30 filter kit will increase the crispness in odd lighting and will also protect your lense from dirt.<br /><br />The camera is a bit bulky, but this is to be expected with a decent optical system.  It's great for those of us with bigger hands as you can get a really good grip on it.<br /><br />So, I highly recommend this camera, but I highly recommend against using Amazon to purchase it.  Go to your local camera or electronics shop and pick one up there.","Before I relate my tale about buying this camera through Amazon (ultimately, I did not, not for lack of effort on my part) let me detail some of what I think is terrific about this camera.<br /><br />I had a DSC-F717 and that camera took remarkable photos. It was intuitive and pretty (silver!) and the buttons were all in the right places. In short order, I felt like a pro taking pictures with it and the results were really good (if you want, email me and I'll link you to some pictures. The only problem with F717 was it was a little cheap in construction so when it began turning on and off randomly (some problem in the hinge I think) it was time to look for a new camera.<br /><br />Since all my accessories are Sony (from the F717) it was natural to look to Sony for solutions. The F828 was the next level and the changes they made appear stunning.<br /><br />Gone is the silver. It is now a serious textured black. No one who looks at this camera wonders if its a toy. They may wonder if its a weapon of some kind but it feels good in the hand. It balances much better than the F717 and the key layout, although I'm still getting used to it, makes a little more sense. No more using software purely to delete pictures. There's a button for that. Same thing for White Balance. WB is the most important feature I've ever found on a digital camera and very few people use it. I use it before EVERY shot.  Before on the F717, I had to look for a button among a nest of buttons. Now, its right on top right near the shutter.<br /><br />Next among cool reasons to like this camera is the holographic AF. This (like the F717) camera prjects a visible grid of laser light to detail the subject being photographed. The focus is tight and pretty.  I haven't had a chance to play with depth of field but if its like the F717, it will be a strong suit.<br /><br />It is also very fast. I can now take pictures about as quickly as I hit the shutter. On the F717, it took time.<br /><br />The only negatives so far is that the camera is heavy. It balances well in the hand, but I have to find a way to carry it thats a little more comfortable. It will work out. I bought the bag (which I'll review separately and that I did buy on Amazon) and it fits into it well, but there's no pocket to hold the charger. Ah well, gotta charge at home and carry batteries.<br /><br />Last, I'd like to relate my experience in purchasing the camera.<br /><br />Amazon listed the camera as $454. This was listed in its main price, not through a reseller, auction or Amazon shop. I clicked buy, checked the pricing and hit Submit Order.  Surprise! It was a third party reseller named USAPhotonation.com.  I got a confirmation that said (pasted) \"we're writing to confirm your purchase of the following item from USA Photo<br /><br />Nation: 1 of Sony DSC-F828 8MP Digital Camera with 7x Optical Zoom [Camera](available to ship by 28-October-2004)<br /><br />Amazon Payments has charged your credit card (DELETED) for this<br /><br />purchase, and the funds have been credited to USA Photo Nation.\"<br /><br />Having checked out resellerratings.com ([...] ) I basically saw that this company seemed to be a bunch of crooks. Out of a rating of 1 to 10 (10 being the best possible) they scored a .64 as rated by 43 people. I wrote Amazon who reassured me.  On Amazon there were no ratings. Apparently I was the first time they'd ever been referred business by Amazon.<br /><br />After a flurry of email exchanges between Amazon and myself, a few fired off to USA Photo Nation, which they never bothered to answer and over 2 hours on hold at their customer service number, they informed me that my order was cancelled and I could expect a refund, which I did get.<br /><br />Amazon seemed to wash their hands of it. I got my money back and the next best price on another camera was north of $900 and they weren't going to supply a camera at the price I was confirmed (by them) because, they said, it was the reseller who didn't deliver the product. I, on the other hand, had NO idea I was dealing with a reseller and would never have used that particular reseller after viewing their online ratings.<br /><br />I bought the camera at a Best Buy. I paid over double what Amazon assured me was the price and I'm pleased with my purchase. I'm a little angry at Amazon however. I've done a lot of business with them over the years and I think their relationship with the reseller does not absolve them of their responsibility to provide what they confirm has been purchased.<br /><br />So, for my review, this is a great camera, one that is heavier duty than my F717 and much faster. But if you are thinking about buying it through Amazon, I'd advise caution. Make sure it isn't a reseller or if it is, that they have reasonable rating for delivering on time what they promise.","There much had been said about this camera's advantages and deficiencies already. I would say that it is the best non DSLR camera an the market. It is very well build, has very nice , sharp , versatile and fast lens.<br /><br />It is very capable camera as long as you understand its limitations, but there's no camera without deficiencies or limitations. The DSLR capable of producing better picture but it is prohibitively expensive to buy such wonderful lens with Sigma, Canon or Nikon. The similar setup will easily brake 2 grands limit.","I did some research as to which digital camera to buy.  After seeing the 8MP power of the Sony DSC-F828 and the Carl Zeiss Lens that offers both Wide Angle up to 28mm and Zoom up to 200mm I was hooked.  My first photos came out remarkable!  More than I could ever ask for.  The next text was on paper.  Using my Canon S9000 wide format printer, I printed out 13x19 photo with absolutely no flaws!!  I would definately recommend this camera to anyone, from the amateur to the experienced!  To view some of my work with this camera, please visit [...]","I bought the Sony 828 in May 2004 to replace the faulty point and shoot digital camera I had.  The beauty of this piece of equipment is that it kindles people like me who used a camera to record a holiday, birthday etc. to take it into the next level.  The package consists of more or less everything you need to start taking better pictures.<br /><br />Three months after the purchase, I have my own website, read about photography every day and completely absorbed by its adventures. I have bought the 1758 tele converter and the F32X flash unit as well.  I still haven't felt limited by the fixed lens or any other features.<br /><br />Including Compact Flash as well as the legendary memory stick trully brought this out of the usual \"Sony\" proprietary syndrome.<br /><br />One draw back is I don't believe that Sony is fully committed to serious photography equipment compared to Canon or Nikons of the world.  This looks like another money spinner that makes them smile.  So the committment for accessories, enhancements will always remain a question mark in my mind. The only other drawback is the time taken to write a raw file (12-15 seconds). A write cache would have made this the perfect camera in this league without costinng the consumer too much.  Next model perhaps?<br /><br />Albeit it is a strong and ergonomically built camera that I intend to keep even if I do buy a DSLR in the future.  Highly recommended for point and shooters who want to take it to the nextt level as well as for pro's who need that second camera.<br /><br />Rivi<br /><br />[...]","First & foremost if you don't understand digital technology, don't buy it!!  To compare a SLR camera to a digital speaks to your amateur, old time status!  It's like comparing apples and oranges.  The ISO has nothing to do with color!!  ISO is SPEED!  To get proper pictures you must light properly...even in this point & shoot world!  This is a broadcast quality camera!  The fact that no one is speaking of it's video ability is sad!  As someone who works in the movie business I see many \"photographers of 20 + years\" get squeezed out for refusing to learn the difference between film & HDTV/Digital video!!  I hate to break it to any SLR to digital users but SONY is the standard for 90% of what you see: Video, Billboard, Print...and Sports Graphics (done on the play station)  If you understand how to expose images on digital format...get this camera...if you are stuck in film quality RECORDED on digital stay with the SLR tiny tin cameras...I just had to chime in since I saw my friends show tonight with 15 minutes...a full segment... filmed with this camera!!  for 1k you can't do better.  Also look up CCD tech, many don't understand it's power!!  REMEMBER PEOPLE...IT'S NOT THE ARROW...IT'S THE INDIAN!!!<br /><br />Take a class...I did 10 years ago!!  digital is not a miracle...you still need to know what you are doing!","I did a lot of homework on the web, shopped around and compared digital cameras for a long time before I decided to spend big $ on this top-of-the-line Sony camera.  Well, I'm glad I did because this is one of the most exciting electronic toys I have ever bought.<br /><br />Unlike many, I'm not at all obsessed with the name Sony and would have actually favored Nikon, Canon or Olympus over Sony in all other price categories (I still use my old Nikon FE SLR and love it).  But this particular model offers the best combination of picture quality, ease-of-use (especially for being quite complex), ergonomics and construction quality.  This last point is one of the camera's strongest assets and in a world of plastic molded everything, it literally blows the competition away!<br /><br />The only down side, one may think, is its hefty price tag.  I personally thought that the price was fully justified the minute I started playing with it and especially at the end of my vacation, when I saw the results on [professionally printed] large format paper - the ultimate test.<br /><br />As mentioned above regarding my Nikon, I try to buy \"quality\" and enjoy it for a long time.  I think I'll be very satisfied with this camera in the long run.  I'm just afraid it'll put the old Nikon SLR out of commission...","Manual zoom ring. Incredible close-ups. Movies and infra red imaging. Two different, seamless storage media. Very robust. Amazing picture quality.<br /><br />Yes there is, can and will be a lot of PF in your pictures ONLY if the subject is of something (such as sunlight reflections on water, or something very bright behind something dark) that will show PF. MOST SUBJECTS will NOT give you any trouble at all, which leads some people to write that PF does not exist for this camera. So sure there are a number of shots where I have some PF. I think most digital cameras would have some degree of PF shooting the exact same subject. Not a real problem for me.<br /><br />A small drawback is the manual focus. Being a long-term SLR addict I found the IDEA very hard to live with, but PRACTICALLY there is NO PROBLEM at all. Out of the 7000 or so shots I have taken using autofocus there were maybe 5 or 6 I had to discard.<br /><br />The small buffer for shooting TIFF is frequently mentioned. While this is fair enough and surely true I think it really only counts for the professionals but it's a non-issue for the average user. There is virtually no loss if you shoot in fine mode.<br /><br />If you are trigger happy be sure to load up on memory. I have a 1GB 40x compact flash and another 1GB memory stick pro for taking short movies (or just more pictures). This way I can make it through a 3 day long weekend hiking around Kings Canyon and come home with more than 500 high quality pictures (3MB files) AND some movies.<br /><br />- Use a filter (a neutral density or polarizer) in bright light.<br /><br />- Use fine mode instead of standard to consume less battery power.<br /><br />- Use manual focus (infinity) only if AF doesn't work (like on clouds).","Ive been doing photography for nearly 10 years. It paid my bills at one point but now its more of an active hobby. Ive also given advice to many people as to what type of camera to buy. I have yet to have someone come back disappointed.<br /><br />I prefer film to digital but digital is cheaper. I didnt want a DSLR ( didnt want to pay 2k for one ). So I started looking at the 8M batch. I did a lot of research and read reviews at just about every site. In the end I went with the sony and I havent been disappointed.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br /> - The pictures are crisp, colors strong and the lens and focusing are fast.<br /><br /> - The 7x zoom range is versatile. The 28mm wide angle is especially welcome to us landscape photographers.<br /><br /> - The macro ( close up ) is jaw dropping. You can get close enough to get the texture on a dollar bill.<br /><br /> - The night framing function is amazing for taking pictures in little to no light at all.<br /><br /> - The scroll button and 'joystick' for menu functions are fabulous and the menus easy to navigate.<br /><br /> - The LCD and viewfinder and bright and clear.<br /><br /> - The manual zoom lens is a VERY welcome relief from nasty electronic zooms.<br /><br /> - The twistable camera body is fabulous if you need to shoot from waist level or at an angle above your head.<br /><br /> - The camera feels fabulous in the hands ( and looks darn sexy ).<br /><br />All in all, the camera is wonderful for an experienced user. An amateur could benefit from learning on this camera as its very user friendly. The seasoned user will be right at home. The professional photographer might consider this a back up camera.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br /> - CA/Purple Fringe<br /><br /> - Noise above ISO 200<br /><br />Yes, as youve heard these do exist. However, they can be prevented and or eliminated afterward.<br /><br />The purple fringe usually happens with big apertures. The 828 has f2 so its going to happen more often. This however, has been blown out of proportion. The PF will very rarely be a serious issue. Stopping down your aperture can reduce it. If that isnt an option you can greatly reduce/eliminate it in post processing ( photoshop ).<br /><br />The high noise at the upper iso's is a common problem in film as well as digital. Unless you are shooting 400+ you wont even notice it on a 4x6 print or on screen. Keep your iso low unless you need to capture something at high speed. There are also several wonderful post-processing programs that can reduce/eliminate the noise.<br /><br />Dont believe the hype about these two problems. A little knowledge goes a long way.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS<br /><br />An amazing camera that will produce amazing pictures and prints. Its very user friendly.<br /><br />I cant stress enough: This is NOT a digital slr. Anyone getting this camera expecting it to be will be disappointed. For the rest of us, its a wonderful addition to your camera family.","I was apprehensive about this camera due to the talk of purple and other 'problems'. I've been using this camera now (july) since May and I've not had any weirdness or problems.<br />I was close to buying the Rebel-- but I went with the sony---<br />1. I now use this camera for video & stills-- No juggling two camera-- which is impossible anyway being a mom with 2 kids! result is that I'm taking way more video and more pictures than previously<br />2. great quality. i do blow up pictures and I needed the 8mp-- I do use the 5mp setting mostly<br />3. the macro is just awesome. i've taken some great close up pictures with this camera<br />4. I love the way I can combine media and flip between compact flash and sony stick.<br />soo-- no problems here =)","I have owened this camera for approx.one month and have taken at least 250 shots +. The only bad photos out of the bunch were due non- auto program and my own incompetance. There is some noise factor @ 800 ISO but is easily corrected with \"Neat Image \".<br />Purple fringing DOES NOT exist on this camera. I have blown up 8 1/2 X 11 pictures and zoomed to the max and saw nothing. I believe Sony corrected the problem with firmware early on, but, the myth goes on.","I BOUGHT THE SONY DSCF707 AND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE. I BOUGHT THE DSCF828 TO UPGRADE TO A 8 MEGA PIXEL CAMERA. THE 828 IS A GREAT CAMERA. IT HAS NOT FAILED ME ONCE. IT HAS MANY GOOD FEATURES AND ONE OF THOSE IS THE 28-200 LENS. I REALLY LIKE HAVING A WIDER ANGLE LENS FOR TAKING PICTURES IN CRAMPED SPACES. THE OTHER IS THE CAPABILITY TO TAKE PHOTOS AT ISO 64. I LEAVE THE CAMERA AT THIS SETTING AND ADJUST THE EV TO GET THE LIGHT I NEED TO TAKE A GOOD PHOTO. I HAVE TAKEN NATURE, PORTRAIT, AND FAMILY PICTURES WITH THIS CAMERA AND THE PHOTOS SHOW DEEP RICH COLORS WITH FINE GRAIN. THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT GIVE IT 5 STARS IS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE AUTO ZOOM. I HAVE HAD NO PURPLE FRINGING. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SHOOT INTO THE SUN YOU WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE PURPLE FRINGING EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY, YOU'LL BE PLEASED.","great camera who's highlights have been well described here.<br />only problems with some minor purple fringing.<br />but how can such a high end camera not have black and white when sony's lower end cameras all have it???","This camera is great, it has a manual zoom ring that, to me, it had been missing from digital photography for too long.<br />The colors are great, I've never gotten any purple flares or anything wrong with my pictures.  Many people have complained about it and recomend getting another camera, I recomend and exchange.  You will be happy with a working F-828.  Mine has been working for months flawlessly.<br />Noise is a normal thing in photography, even 35mm photography has noise at any ISO, but since 35mm would be like a 20 (twenty) megapixel camera you don't notice noise on film unless you get a BIIIG picture, or zoom in on it a lot.  So noise is not a problem with the F-828.  In fact I like the effect of 800 ISO combined with Sepia.  Besides, if you print an 8 Megapixel image at 6 X 4 you won't notice noise even at 400 ISO.<br />I've also heard people complain that at 28mm wide angle the image is distorted.  Of course it is, any camera with a wide angle at 28mm will distort an image.  It is mostly used for landscapes and special effects, some people will even use wider angle lenses.  Most cameras start their zoom at 35mm or 45mm which is less of a wide angle, thats why they have less distortion.  Portraits are shot mostly with zoom 80mm or above so that there is no sitortion at all.<br />This camera is not Professional, but I consider it at least Semi-Pro.  The thing about Professional cameras is; they are serious equipment, so if you make a living out of it, get a Professional camera, but don't expect tu use a serious professional camera to fool around and play.<br />The SONY F-828 can be treated seriously and taken seriously, but you can also use it for your normal life, play around with it, take video (at high quality I find it as good as any DV camera), it's great.<br />It might be big but the bigger lens gives better quality, it might not be light, but weight helps me keep the camera steady.<br />You can trim (crop) or resize pictures you have taken, the only thing you can't do (olympus does have this feature) is copy pictures between Memory Stick and Compact Flash.  Olympus can copy from Dx or Samrt Media to Compact Flash or vice-versa.  But that's just being picky.","I really wanted to keep this camera after being blown away by  predescessor compact version - the DSCV1.  However - the purple fringing is awful.  It wrecks daylight shots with anything other than anaemic sunlight by giving everything (car corners, traffic light metal work etc) a purple \"fringe\".  Excuses can't be tolerated for something that costs 2000 AUD.  It DOES have a great \"overall\" package as some have intimated...but the images really really suck.  Surely it can't be good enough to expect us to use the camera and then have to photoshop EVERY photo taken in sunlight...?<br />I will really miss the manual zoom & night shot/framing feature - it is by far and away the best way to take shots in poor light...but most of my shots are'nt done in this setting - being honest - I just couldnt justify the expense given the truly awful purple fringing I have experienced using this camera in pretty routine photographic settings.<br />I have taken it back and bought the olympus 8080 while I wait for an improved version of this (otherwise) great camera.  And, as good as the 8080 is -I can't wait for an DSC-f838 or whatever which sorts out the major CA problem that the f828 has.  Make sure there is a good return policy where you buy this...I really believe this is a lemon...and you will need it.","This Camera is NOT being marketed as a PRO Digital SLR, if your a pro, buy a Pro Camera!..For 95% of us this an Unbelievable tool for under a grand...Shop around for Memory and It will come in at under a thousand dollars!

I got the Sony F717, and loved it, wanted more Pixels for larger prints so I bought the Nikon...mistake!...I am one of the few reviewers who owns both so let me tell you the Image quality/Fleshtone reproduction/Ease of use/and auto-mode...is MUCH better with the SONY.  I gave my Nikon to my daughter. For a serious tool that you can set on AUTO, for most shots this camera is great. The F828 does a better job at focusing than the Nikon, I couldnt believe the shots I was missing with the Nikon, and the Nikon had a Blue cast to the portrait shots, and I still cant figure out why. If you are reading this and are not a pro but want excellent photos, especially of people, this camera is great!...review the Olympus 8meg...the Canon 8meg...or the Konica/Minolta 8meg...avoid the NIKON 8700, unless you just must have that name brand hanging from your neck...Digital SLR's are still stuck at 6megs which to me is an insult to the consumer, Most of us dont have the discipline to carry around all the lenses anyway, My film SLR with lenses has been in my closet for years since I bought my first Digital. Read the Digital Camera review sites, this camera is listed as one of the FASTEST and BEST cameras ever reviewed...BUY this with confidence...Hope this has been helpfull to most of the consumers, I was tired of the SONY bashing, when to me there is nothing better.","I am not a professional photographer, just a guy who likes to take high quality digital photos.  I have now taken over 400 photos with my F828.  I love it.  The first thing I noticed was how well it fit in my hands.  It is really natural.  The controls are also conveniently located.  I have owned one of the lower end 4.0 megapixal sony cybershots and I found that a lot of the controls are reasonably similar so I had something less of a learning curve.  I find the quality of the images to be stunning.  I have taken shots of everything from the moon (where I could see craters at full zoom), to the outside of my house at night, to many macro shots of flowers, coins and the like, to my daughter twirling a ball on the tip of her finger and they all came out just superbly.  I really love the Carl Zeiss zoom lens which is mechanically operated, not a motorized zoom.  Yes there is some purple fringing in some situations (though rare to my experience) and there is a fair amount of noise at ISO settings at 200 or above.  However, none of this has gotten in my way and is more or less correctable with the right software on your computer.  Sony has done a great job with this camera and I am very happy that I own one.  I am leaving for San Francisco tomorrow and you better believe that I am taking my F828 with me.","Good Camera.<br />No Aberrations at all detectable.<br />Compared it to Digital Rebel (made of Cheap Plastic) and it was no comparision","I love Sony cameras.

We shoot professionally for a conference brochure print publication, inside shooting, no staged shots, using the artificial lighting in the hotel meeting rooms. We also do trade stock shots primarily of landscape scenes in Hawaii, so we push cameras pretty hard.  The 707 was fun, but slow, almost unusable for brochure work, the 717 was a big improvement and the 828 is truly awesome.  The colors are great, the operating system is fast, you will never lose a shot even with indoor sports, the shooting modes help you adapt to any situation.  The 8 Mega Pixel (MP) means you can take a full body shot and if you find you need a head shot instead you have plenty of resolution.  Sony has really worked on the layout of buttons and that is a major improvement, no more accidental white balance disasters.  And the control modes wheel appears to be more robust ( I touched the 717 wheel with some suntan lotion on my hand and it removed all the painted modes ).<br />The 828 is my favorite digital and with 8 MP I can get the speed to print of digital with every bit of the quality of 35mm film at this point.  My wife prefers the Canon EOS-10D with the 828 as her second favorite and to be sure you can put some very fast lenses on that Canon body.<br />My advice to you if you are considering buying is to avoid anything on the low end, if you get less than 5 MP your shots are not worth printing.  Don't scrimp on memory sticks either, you would be amazed at how fast you go through a 128M memory stick shooting 8 MP shots and we won't even talk about TIFF mode.<br />And if you invest the money in an 828, really push it. Read your manual and see what this critter is capable of. Play with the nightshot mode, it really works!  Some of my favorite shots are from a shark tank with nightshot, it looks like I was actually swimming with the beasts.  Try to catch something fast like a bird with the burstmode; what a great way to fill a memory stick with a single button push.  Play with the AE lock, it really takes a picture with dificult lighting over the top.<br />These are great days to be alive, who would have ever guessed we would have tools like the Sony 828 at a sub 1k pricepoint?  Now, I can dream about the 929 30 MP so I can do digital medium format work!","This is by far the best camera I have ever owned. I am a professional photographer living in Shanghai, China. I have to shoot many different types of scenes under sometimes extreme conditions and I am happy, so happy with the 828. My SLRs and my other digital cameras have taken a backseat to this innovative and highly creative camera. If you are a serious amateur or even a beginner who wants a camera to \"grow into\" this is the one. Forget the Canon Pro 1; forget the Nikon 8700. This is the one. Buy it. You will be happy. Even the DSLRs are envious of this camera because of the lens - 28-200 gives you a great breadth of focus and even when you use the digital zoom (2x) it is absolutely clear. I never used the digital zoom on my other digital cameras because of the noise but with the Sony, no noise. The only problem is that there is a lot of noise after iso 200 but so what? I never go past iso 64.","I give this camera 5 stars because I think it does a pretty good job compare to other camera within its range (NOT SLR). I saw too many people expect this camera to be the same performance as the SLR. I do not agree with these people because you need to add around $400 to the Sony price tag (total $1400) to get about the same 8MP camera and lens like Sony offered. Anyways, you can get this Sony camera around $900 or less if you shop around.<br />I haven't tested the noise problem but don't mine at all because it's less than 3% that I will need to do that kind of shoot. However, I read a professional review and show that even Nikon and Canon (8MP) produce high noise also (a little less than Sony).<br />Here are what I like the most about this camera compare to other cameras within the same ranges like Nikon 8700 and Canon Pro1.<br />Full size lens that you can hold like a real SLR camera<br />Long battery life-188 minutes for full charged.<br />Use both memory stick and compact flash (I already had 256MB MS and 512MB CF)<br />Manual control is plenty.<br />Edit on 4/16/04<br />For those who worry about PF, there're 2 suggestions:<br />1. Use the lens at 70mm instead of 28mm or 200mm<br />2. Use higher aperture number F4 or higher.<br />You can read more information about PF at [...]","Fringe, Sminge...you are going to get great shots with this camera!  I read about the purple fringe issue before buying mine but felt safe trying it thanks to amazon.com's generous return policy.  It is now 2 months later and I wouldn't consider giving up my F828.<br />It is true there is purple fringing in high contrast situations (like bright sun shining between small branches in a tree).  In most cases this is only visible when you magnify the image many times on your PC monitor. It is apparent in less than 10% of my photos and I have never needed to correct for it when printing.  I had one instance where it was visible at full size and corrected it easily in my photo editing program - took about 60 seconds.  This is much easier to fix than lens flaring, image softness or the exposure problems you can find in many digital cameras.  Of course, I would rather the camera be perfect but I've been around photo equipment for decades (35mm, medium format, digital) and trust me - there will always be something.<br />The F828 is a delight to use, combines a great lens and body into a well built, reasonably compact package. It has excellent battery life (a huge problem for some digitals) and delivers great image quality. I think you will be amazed at the detail you will see.  You can set it to automatic or use a host of manual features - all of which are easily accessible.  I can't tell you how handy the 828's swivel lens/body is.  My first digital camera had it (Nikon 990) and I considered it a must-have feature for its replacement.<br />Do you need an all-in-one solution i.e. camera and lens together? Are you looking for vastly improved image quality over say a 3-4 megapixal digital?  Do you need it now?  If YES, get the Sony - you won't find a better choice.  If no, you might wait a bit and look at the other 8 megapixal cameras that will be rolling out over the next few months (I've already seen a few but none beat the overall quality of the 828).  If you don't care about physical size, then one of the new digital SLRs from Nikon or Canon might be a good choice - but remember you have to buy the body and lens separately, they are more expensive, and you've got to haul all that stuff around with you - I take my camera on business trips and just don't have the room.<br />Bottom line, don't let all this geek talk scare you.  You might take a thousand pictures before seeing the purple stuff.  If you do encounter it, correcting the image is easy.  ENJOY!!","I normally like to be an early adopter but I am glad I waited since I have seen absolutely NONE of the issues mentioned for this camera.  I have went as far as trying to make the problems occur and cannot do it.  I suggest to most people that they get an attachable flash that has 360 degree pivot ability so as to bounce light where you really want it since the on-board flash is a bit too strong for any real close shots.<br />As a professional photographer, I love this camera!!","I've had the camera for about 2 months now and have taken close to a 1000 shots.  I knew about the fringing and noise, but researched and found that these are problems in all digital camera (some worse that others)<br />The shots I have taken have been great - colors vibrant, clear.  The only time I get a problem with fringing is using the extreme end of the comera's settings.<br />Battery life is great, the camera is quicker than my other digital cameras (I purchased a Kodak DX 6490 right before Christmas and sold it to my sister in law because I was sorely disappointed, prior to that I had and Olympus C-2100 which I still own and really like)<br />One word of advise when getting a camera like this (8 megapix) be prepared for some large files (3 meg per pic)  This adds up quickly - I will need a second hard drive very soon.","I have owned the F828 since 12/30/03, and I just love this camera.  I admit there is still a considerable amount of learning for me to do with this camera.  The Carl Zeiss T* lens is just incredibly, and the 4-color CCD does seem to render colors better. I am consistently impressed by how eye color and detail is captured by this camera.....by far the best I have seen in a \"non D-SLR\" digital camera. OK, now onto the niggles....(1) Yes there is some noise from ISO200 and above, but there are others in this boat also, and there is a noise reduction feature in the \"twilight\" profile. Neat Image software does an acceptable job mitigating the noise in most images. The FujiFilm S-7000 (my previous selection) has a horrible reputation for high ISO noise, and apparently has some real issues trying to autofocus in low-light. Were it not for Howard Creech's appraisal in Epinions, I would have an S-7000 and probably be pretty pissed off. (2) Purple fringing.....stated by so many as being Chromatic Aberration, is most likely due to CCD Blooming. I believe this is CCD Blooming due to overloaded pixel elements dumping onto adjacent pixel elements and you get purple fringe.  I have seen night shots of city waterfront areas, and on \"auto\" there is significant fringing, but in \"aperture priority\", with a small aperture the purple is very slight.  Makes sense......less light entering the lens equals fewer CCD pixel elements overloaded. Also, I recently began using a circular polarizing filter, and this really helps control situations where harsh glare would induce \"the fringe\". The Carl Zeiss T* lens, while not an \"apochromatic lens\", has extremely high optical qualities. If there is some chromatic aberration to blame for the purple fringe, the F828 has nearly every other digital camera as company in that department!<br />I really like this camera, and I feel quite strongly it was the best $919.00 I have ever spent. Sure there are better digital cameras out there, but the F828 offers alot of options for a wide variety of photography situations.","I owned the F717 for a year and then I upgraded to the F828.<br />I have had the F828 for 4 months now and I have taken some very good shots with it.<br />I love the new settings for color. You can have the camera display the \"real\" color or there is another setting that slightly saturates your images. This is called \"standard\" mode. I found I was always saturating my F717 shots via Photoshop so this is a welcome feature for me.<br />Sony's new 4 color processing gives you more realistic color. I have compared may shots from my F717 an I like the color better on the F828.<br />For the first time Sony has included another pic storage option besides their incredibly expensive memory sticks. You can now use compact flash cards. They are about half the price of memory sticks so you won't have to sell your car to get 1 megabyte of storage. You can use Memory stick and Compact flash together. There is a switch to go back and forth between the 2. This means you can theoretically have 2 gigs of storage before you have to change a memory card.<br />Another cool feature is smart zoom. The camera is capable of 8 megapixel photos. I use 5 megapixels generally. Smart zoom will let you add to the 7x zoom if you are not using the highest resolution. It does this automatically. Very cool. So the lower resolution you are using the more zoom you can use.<br />I love the night framing mode. Normally it is impossible to see your subject in the view screen when you are taking pics at night. This camera has infrared so you can see a black and white outline of your subjects when taking pics in total darkness. This really helps frame your subject. The pic you take however come out in color and generally it is perfectly in focus! Then, when you push the shutter button, the camera emits a laser beam on your subject. It lets the camera know the exact distance your subject is from the camera. I have taken some great, in focus shots in total darkness! Before this technology, night pics were never in focus!!!<br />I have read several reviews and slot of people find faults with the camera. I personally haven't run into anything bad yet. But, please note I am not a professional photographer. It's just a hobby for me. I think this camera is perfect for newbies because the auto mode works very well!!!!<br />Dave Morehead<br />trumpet/arranging/composing<br />DaveMorehead.com","After all the buzz about purple fringe on this camera, I was a bit concerned as I began taking pictures with my Sony DSC-F828 in early January of '04. Now it's Mid-March, I've taken it a third of the way around the world and shot close to a thousand photos with it, and precisely ONE had even the tiniest purple fringe. What's more, the fringe ENHANCED that backlit photo.<br />My personal theory is that Sony managed to improve the camera between the time the first review samples went out and when mine was built.<br />On a recent trip lots of great and costly cameras were in heavy use by fellow travelers, including the new Canon Digital Rebel. So far as I could tell, none of those cameras got better pictures of that trip than the Sony, and most of them had to worry a lot more about dust and water, due to their interchangeable and add-on lenses.<br />My one caution is that you can't use the 30 FPS movie mode with CompactFlash memory. That is only allowed with MemoryStickPro memory or a Hitachi CompactFlash hard disk. If that matters, get LOTS of memory, as even 15 FPS used over 100 MB in 5 minutes.<br />One other suggestion: cover the rear LCD display with a clear plastic sheet (such as is sold to protect Palm and Pocket PC PDAs.)<br />Highly recommended!<br />Update: A useful firmware upgrade has since become available at Sony's web site.","I bought this camera Jan. 31, 2004 and I loved it the minute I took it out of the box.  I took about 600 pictures and was very pleased with the out come.  I started reading about the purple and noise problem, I then started doughting the camera.  I used Adobe 2.0 to enhance the photos, they were breath taking.  I had some noise, very little & Purple, very faint.  I still was not happy because everyone else was giving this camera a poor review.  I sent some pictures to the Sony Image station to have some 4x6's printed.  The decision to return the camera had to be made with in 14 days or it would be mind after that.  On the 13th day I took the Sony Camera back to the store.  I ordered the Canon 10D, it arrived 3 days later. I ordered a Canon 24mm-85mm lens.  The pictures arrived from the Sony Image Station, the pictures were awsome, couldn't believe my eyes.  The pictures had great detail and sharpness to them.  I wish I would have kept the Sony Camera instead.  The Canon pictures are not sharp at all, I was really shocked and disappointed.  The Canon 10D has a Idiosyncratic metering problem.  I spent close to $2000 on the Canon with lens. I gave the Canon about 12 days trying different things and contacting Canon, with no prevail.  After finding out about the Metering problem on the 23rd of Feb. I took it back and PURCHASED THE SONY DSC-F828 AGAIN.  The images are super sharp compared to the Canon.  The sony had a little more noise than the Canon but didn't show up in the pictures I had printed.  Also the purple was in the Canon images also. Anybody that ask me I will tell them to try out the SONY and forget about the hype, you know the purple/noise band wagon. Go to this web site and read what a professional has to say about the SONY.","The Sony DSC-F828 is a great looking camera that has a rock solid feel.  Deep rich colors, extremely short shutter lag, and consistently sharp focus.  Picture clarity can be a bit grainy in low light situations, nothing unusual for a point-and-shoot digital camera but may have expected better considering the relatively fast Carl Zeiss f2.0.  Two features that I've found very useful are the rotating camera body to shoot at waist level and the ability to use both a compact flash card and memory stick at the same time.  I can quickly switch from CF to memory stick (and visa versa) and when there's a pause in the action, I can put in a fresh CF card.  Would definitely recommend having both CF and memory stick, one having at least 256MB and the other at least 64MB.  Battery life is excellent, but I carry a spare anyway.  The built-in flash is okay, but an external flash significantly improves picture quality.<br />I considered a DSLR, but the bulkiness, additional cost of the long zoom, inconvenience of carrying and switching lenses, and the risk of getting dust on the imager did not suit the way I would use the camera (family activities, vacation, and some scenery).","This is a sweet camera. It feels totally solid, extremely well designed, and very professional. It reminds me of the first time I held a Nikon F5 or a Maxxum 9. You just have to rotate it in your hands a few times and fall in love.<br />The picture quality is astonishing, as long as you shoot at lower ISO settings. At higher ISO settings, the noise levels are unnacceptable, especially when cameras like the Digital Rebel do so much better at high ISO with their CMOS chips. But, the Rebel does not come with a 28-200 F 2-2.8 lens for $1000. So with those low F-Stops you could afford to shoot at lower ISO settings and have the same shutter speed. Plus, the built-in flash does a remarkably good job.<br />I will buy this camera. I recommend it heartily. You can add filters which is nice, and the manual zoom is so quick. Battery life is excellent and gotta love the dual memory card slots. Only reason i don't give five stars is the high ISO noise problem.","The camera arrived 3 hours ago and is already packed up and ready to be shipped back.<br />I have the F717 and I thought I would upgrade, as I do every year or two, to Sony's latest and greatest.  I LOVE my 717 and didn't even think of parting with it, but thought it would be my new back up camera while the F828 would be my primary.<br />I took some shots with the F828 and was very impressed with the color quality... but noticed a lack of detail on the images as played back through the camera.  Sure it was going to be much improved viewing them on the computer, I downloaded about 30 images taken at the 8MB setting.  I had been careful to avoid the fringing I had been warned about, but the inconsistency in light and, more importantly, image noise was terrible.  I have read the reviews.  I have heard the complaints.  I was sure that my experience with Sony (this is my 7th camera, not to mention audio equip, etc...) and my experience with photography (over 20 years) would make all the difference.<br />I decided to set up the same shot for both cameras (the 717 and 828), in fact, I set up 5 shots and took them on the same setting for both cameras.  The image clarity was unmistakably different, and far superior in the shots from the 717.  I kicked the 828 up to 8mp, thinking that if both cameras were at their maximum settings, the 828 would have to win out over the 717.  Again, very disappointed in the camera's performance.<br />I have, obviously, had very good luck with Sony cameras.  I presently have 3 that I use daily.  This will not be a 4th.  It is on its way back to the warehouse. I'm sorry to say that for the first, and hopefully last time, I am disappointed in a Sony product.  I ignored the \"negative press\" and decided not to hop on the \"negativity bandwagon\"...  I admit when I'm wrong...<br />I'm ready to hop on the bandwagon with the rest of you if there's room.<br />Sorry Sony.  Don't hold it against me.  I'm sure I've put a few of your kids through college.","I would have bought this camera at local retailer, but it was out of stock.  So I went home and started reviewing it more - of course I saw all the same reviews you have concerning the CA and noise.<br />So I grabbed a memory stick and went back to the retailer for some test shots with the display model.  I put the pictures up on one of the PCs on display...the purple fringing around the overhead lights and reflected surfaces was horrible.<br />Just to be fair, I took shots with the V1 and CD500.  Both had purple fringing in the same test shots, but not nearly as noticable.  I've read that most 5X and higher digicams have this problem.<br />The salesman pulled out some pictures they took and had printed with a 4x6 photo printer.  And sure enough, once he knew what to look for, the CA was present in many photos.  There was even a photo (taken outside) of a salesman and a customer in front of a car that just had some installs.  At both points on the fender where the sun was reflecting - purple stars instead of the white ones you'd expect.<br />I didn't really look into the noise problem.  I think Sony should try to improve the CA first.  ---Too many pixels on too small of a sensor.---<br />Love the look, feel, and features.  But I also want acceptable photos without the extra work.","This is a great product.  If anyone got one that doesn't give him great shots, you should try and replace it, you must have had bad luck.<br />When used properly, and when you know what you are doing the camera gives great results.  Be aware that the camera is a little big, and a little heavy, but for me that is good in a camera.  It is harder to make it shake if you are holding it properly.  If you are only a tourist, you may be better of with a smaller model.  I used to make great pictures out of my OLYMPUS 5050, it's nearly professional, but the SONY f-828 is for serious photogrphers.  It's got a great feel like a 35mm and it does give me more benefits than the OLYMPUS 5050.  Be sure to read the manual, there is a lot to this camera, you can't say it doesn't work properly or that it's not as good as other models untill you really know all it's options.<br />If you don't need all its features, a smaller camera would be better, easier, and cheaper.<br />But this camera is worth every dollar if you are serious about photography.  Manual focus and manual zoom justa like a 35mm, and even the autofocus is very fast and acurate.  The way it measures light and flash intensity is great, even flash pictures (with the built in flash) are very good if not excelent.","I recently took this camera on a 3 week trip to Asia. I was most satisfied with its performance. In combination with my Motion Ml300 slate computer, I trot nor 1800 pictures. My problem is I have so many wonderful pictures, it is difficult to pick the ones I want to keep. In a group with 4 and 5 megapixel cameras, its 8mp was an eye opener. It is somewhat largish, but fits well to had. Good battery life. Takes either memory sticks or compact flash . With 2 spare batteries and a 1 GB CF card, it was great!","Love the camera, shot over 700 images with it after i got is, and before i read about this purple crap. havn't seen any of the purple in my shots. maybe its because its winter, and i take indoor pics, or maybe its because i had it less than 12 hours when i bought a UV(0) filter on it. maybe that is the answer to that problem, and if it is, then its not a problem, anyone without some kind of fliter is an idiot. 15 bucks and the lens is much safer.<br />the lack of BW does annoy me, but PS it to BW is easy, or shoot in nightshot with a red filter.  it makes nice IR pics, but i still need a darker filter to do anything outside, its still to bright.","I have been using this camera extensively for two weeks, although it belongs to a friend. I suppose that may make me more objective than someone who actually owns one, because I don't have to rationalize having made a $1000 investment. I wanted very much to like this camera, and there are certain things that I love about it. However, there is no way that I could use this as my primary camera.<br />First, the good. It is absolutely the coolest lens I have ever seen, particularly on a digital camera. The zoom covers almost any shooting situation I would need, from landscape, to portraits, to sports. The fact that you can zoom by turning a ring makes it far superior to the \"fly by wire\" zooms so common on digital cameras.<br />The user interface is great. It is far better than other digital cameras I have owned by Nikon, Olympus, Pentax and Ricoh. I was able to use just about every cool feature without ever looking at the owner's manual. It is very intuitive. It is much easier to use than a Nikon film camera as well.<br />Mechanically, the camera is a gem. It feels about as rugged as my Nikon F5 (although it probably isn't.) It is incredibly solid.<br />It is also very fast, both in the time it takes to turn on and off, and also in terms of delay when you push the shutter. For all intents and purposes, there are no delays at all, except sometimes when writing an image to storage, but even that is faster than on most other cameras. It is just a very responsive camera.<br />Battery life is great. I never ran low, and only charged it occasionally.<br />The movie mode is great. Easy to use, and good quality images and sound. It wouldn't totally replace a video camera, but it would be fine for occasional use.<br />Now, the bad. All the negative things you may have read about purple fringing are true. It is not difficult to find a scene where this shows up in an unacceptable way.<br />The white balance is really off in many scenes I've photographed. Snow looks medium grey. I know that I could probably do better on this if I read the manual, or post processed in Photoshop, but it is disturbing that with the default settings, it records scenes so inaccurately.<br />It is not a great camera for available light. I was not able to handhold it for shots that could esily be done with my Olympus 5050. I think it is partly because of the aperature, and partly because it is an extremely long camera, where any movement is exaggerated.<br />In side by side comparisons, some of the images from my 5 megapixel Olympus are superior to the 8 megapixel Sony 828 images, in terms of color and sharpness.<br />Sony is really on to something here, and it is possible that some of these problems could be fixed in a future version. But I am not planning to buy one of these now.<br />The weird thing is that now the bar has been set very high for what I would want from a user interface and lens. So even if I found a camera with better image quality (which wouldn't be hard), it would not compare favorably to the Sony in other dimensions. This two week testing period makes me want to wait a while for Sony to fix the issues with the 828, or for other companies to catch up to Sony in terms of other features.","I love this camera. I have two children and need a camera that can take good photos as well as good video, the f828 is the only camera can can provide both. 640*480 video at 30fps ,bet you cant find better. The lens has versatility a SLR camera doesnt, 28-200mm it takes two Canon lenses to cover that lenghth. Yes there is noise and purple fringing(sometimes), but if all you want is phtots and no video then you cant loose with the Digital Rebel. But if you want a versatile camera that can handle just about any event, look no further than the F828.<br />sample pics:<br />[...]","I don't own this camera, but have been researching it online.  It seems there is disagreement among reviewers here regarding the alleged chromatic aberration (purple fringing) issue.<br />The most thorough and objective online review site I know of for digital cameras is Digital Photography Review ([...]  As an aid to other consumers concerned about this issue, I offer the following quote from their review of this camera:<br />\"It's a huge pity but the DSC-F828 has a fringing problem. We'll call it 'purple fringing' but it's clearly a combination of chromatic aberrations caused by the interaction of the lens and the microlenses on the sensor and enhanced by a certain amount of blooming which carries the color out further than the original artifact.<br />While worse at full wide angle and maximum aperture (28 mm equiv., F2.0) it is visible throughout the zoom range and at smaller apertures. It's clearly possible to take images which will never suffer from this effect, it does require either a strong backlight or sunlight reflection to become apparent. The issue really is that in a normal shooting situation you would have no real idea if the image had suffered until you return to your computer and view the image at full size.<br />It's also possible to reduce the visiblity of these artifacts with careful post-processing, using specific CA reduction tools or simple color replacement filters. However there is no getting away from the fact that these artifacts should not be there.\"<br />I've viewed about a dozen sample photos that illustrate this aberration, and I agree with the above assessment.  Also, I was not at all impressed with the DSC-F828's noise level in low-light situations given this camera's price point.  There is a lot of potential in this model (8MP, Carl Zeiss lens, etc.), but at the end of the day, image quality is what matters most in a camera.  Sony has consistently upgraded this camera about every 12 months for the last four years (F505 - Aug '99; F505V - Apr '00; F707 - Aug '01; F717 - Sep '02; F828 - Aug '03).  I'm going to hold off until the next iteration which should be due out around August 2004.  Hopefully, Sony will address these issues.","I am an owner of the F505V and the F717. When I saw the F828, I fell in love. They fixed (and improved) many of the things that bothered me about the F717. The swivel is much stronger, the flash pops out much smoother, the menus are animated, the ER emitters are no longer in the lens area (which creates a problem when using filters). Those are just some of the untechnical things that popped out to me.<br />Anyways, I read the reviews and they complained about the \"purple fringe\" which Id never heard about before. I decided to buy the camera anyway.<br />When the camera arrived last night, I took some shots around the house with the F828 and the same shots with the F717. I absolutely need to agree with the reviews about the purple problem. Its super obvious and very annoying. Around the edges of objects (when shooting towards light) have a purple glow to one side. The gold chain holding a light on the ceiling had a red glow to one side of it (I assume that is the purple and gold mixing). Every single shot (shot towards light) had a noticable purple fringe.<br />I reviewed the same shots with the F717. For the first time, I noticed the \"purple fringe\" on my F717. However, it is so faint it is *almost* unnoticeable. So faint, that at normal zoom it would never be seen. Much, much better than the F828.<br />I am not going to be like those who give this product 1 star because of this problem. Its an amazing camera but with a serious flaw. I'll give it three stars, subtracting two for the image quality issues. If Sony releases a new updated version with this problem fixed, I will rush out and get it. Mine went back to the store.","Exceptional, fantastic, more than you can possibly expect for this price. It's not absolute perfection, but how close to perfect do you need to get? Michael Reichmann's reviews will tell you a lot more than I can in 1,000 words:<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />The only thing I would add to his comments is: get a polarizing filter! For $30 you can fix almost all chromatic abberation (CA)and blooming, which most consumers can't even find in these pictures. Thank you Sony for making a digicam that will take filters! And if the high-ISO noise bothers you and you can't avoid using high ISO numbers (why not?), buy Noise Ninja for $29 and clean it up quickly and easily. But these issues only come up when compared to professional digital SLR backs. You won't see the F828 compared to any other \"regular\" digital camera because there just is no comparison. This is, as of January 2004, as good as it gets. Unless you're willing to trade your car for a camera...","I have seen the reports of purple fringing and noise. Here is what I've found. At high ISO settings (above 200) there is alot of noise (big suprise). I usally use the program mode and keep the ISO at 64 and my photos look great.<br /><br />I have not had the problem with purple fringing. I have tried and tried but I can't reproduce the problem.<br />Is it as good as a $3,000.00 digital SLR? No, even though that's what it is constantly compaired to. The digital SLR that comes close in price is the EOS Digital Rebel. But by the time you buy a couple of lenses you are in the $1,500.00 range, that's 50% more and no you can't take a short video with the EOS. And the DSC-F828 color reproduction is better than the Canon.<br />Is it better that other cameras in it's class? YES! I had a Fuji S7000 and had to return it, the photo quality and focusing problems were horrible. If you want to see purple fringing and noise look at a Fuji S7000 photo!<br />The DSC-F828 takes crisp clear photos under all lighting conditions. It's Auto-focus is super fast and accurate. The camera body is solid. The lens has great range and the macro works great. The camera is EASY to use. You can use the infrared setting to take pictures in the dark without flash (yes they have noise) Or you can use the night framing to take a normal flash photo in the dark and they look great.<br />Why 4 stars and not 5? The only drawback is that there is no black&white setting. I like to see what a photo is going to look like in black & white when I'm shooting. And the tech support is weak. I emailed tech support to see if they are going to do a firmware update and suggested a b&w setting. I like to use an IR72 infrared filter. And they gave me a lame response. \"We aren't going to add new chips to the camera.\" Tech support should know the difference between software and hardware.<br />If your going to freak out about a little noise or you want to blow-up a photo to a poster size you can use Neat Image to remove any noise, and it's free for non-commercial use.","I was going to purchase the Sony DSC F717, when I stumbled across a preorder special for the DSC F828 at Ritz Camera - an Amazon partner.  I had used the DSCF717 previously on numerous occosions, (as well as a Nikon DX1), and was shocked at the improvements that Sony made with the DSC F828 model.<br />The processor in the DSC F828 processes an 8 MP image in half the time that the DSC F717 processed a 5 MP image - an impressive technological feat that really pays off when shooting image sequences.  I  have tested the mpeg features and find the clarity of the image and sound output to be professionally acceptable for a multimedia producer. I plan to use this feature frequently.<br />Two really impressive new features are the storage of image data in RAW format and the ability to use microdrives for storage.  Using a 1 Gig microdrive allows me to store over 100 RAW data files.  The benefit of this is that the RAW data can be manipulated to increase or decrease white balance, color, and exposure AFTER the photo has been taken.<br />Add to that the control and range of a manual focus lense,  Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 7X Zoom lens (28 - 200mm, 35mm equivalent), Multi point autofocus, Super Nightshot 0 Lux System, USB connectivity to your pc and many other bells and whistles, and you end up with a great tool that produces high quality pictures, video and sound at an affordable price.<br />As for 'hideous looking purple flares' - one should keep in mind that backlighting distortion and white glare can easily be avoided with a polarized lense filter.  Most professional photographers would recommend using a polarized lense filter at high-altitude, on snow or water, or any combination of snow, water, high-altitude unless you are specifically looking for light distortion in your output.<br />I would definitely recommend this product for the pro/recreational enthusiast who's looking for more than something that takes a digital snapshot without breaking the bank.<br />Boc<br />Get a Life Style at [...]","I have owned the DSC-505, DSC-505V, F707 and F717. I also have the Contax TVS digital, a Sony DSC-V1 and a Nikon D100. I don't know what the reviewers who mention the purple fringing and high noise are talking about. I have done very in depth comparisons with the Contax, the D100 and the old F717 and see nothing but brilliant performance! I spent the holidays at the Grand Canyon and shot several GB's worth on the F828 and the results are nothing short of AMAZING. I have even printed some 42\" x 60\" posters on our HP DJ800ps plotter which look so good that friends are constantly asking for copies for themselves. The manual 7x zoom is a HUGE improvement over the 5x electronic zoom of the f717. Of course the quality of the Zeiss T lens is nothing short of extraordinary. The fact that the camera can use CF cards as well as the MS is also quite a step forward for Sony. The build quality is first rate. One cannot possibly go wrong with this camera. Take my advice and consider the negative reviews as nothing more than sour grapes (probably from folks who can't afford the upgrade and don't want to see others who can have such a fantastic tool)! This camera is so impressive I bought a second one for the family!<br />But don't take my word for it check out images taken with the f828 (Steve's Digicam site has quite a few) and see for yourself what nonsense some of these reviewers are spewing.","Some reviewers have complained of poor image quality with the F828.  Anyone that is concerned can email me and I'll send you image crops that compare an equivalent fraction of an image taken with the 8 MB F828 to the 5 MB F717.  To clarify, I've cropped a portion of an image taken at the same place and time by both cameras in order to make the image small enough to send by email.  The F828 file is ~8/5 the size of the F717 and therefore covers the same amount of the cropped image with respect to solid angle.  This way, you can judge for yourself.  I already have and did before buying - not a bad idea when plunking down a grand.","The camera takes GREAT pictures.  Better than my (now retired) Nikon SLR ever did.  I've stepped up from a 4.1 MP camera and the difference is noticeable if not AMAZING.  Color like nothing I have ever seen.  Anyone who has purchased this item needs to sit down and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!  After reading, spend lots of time practicing w/ the camera and all of it's settings.  Take advantage of the fact that this is digital.  No wasted money and time on film developing! It takes time to learn how to apply all of the features and settings.  Rome was not built in a day.  Good luck w/ your purchase!  Give it time!!!","The more I use this camera, the more I love it.  My first impressions were that the F828 is a great looking and solidly built camera that takes outstanding pictures. Shutter lag is extremely short such that it can catch the action before the action moves off the frame.  Recycle time between shots is very fast. Recommend getting the 12x CF card which is a big improvement over 4x, but not noticeably slower than the 40x.  Zoom range is more than adequate with a surprisingly good wide angle and good macro feature.  Battery life is excellent but since it's a proprietary battery, it would be a good idea to carry a spare.  As far as the storage media is concerned, Sony did right by having the F828 accept compact flash.  I find it useful to have both a 256MB CF card and 256MB memory stick pro loaded in the camera at the same time.  I can fill up my compact flash and switch to memory stick with a flick of a switch without missing a beat.  The built-in flash is fine for fill-in or close indoor shots, but I would highly recommend the Sony HVL-F32X flash.  It makes a huge difference and would be money worth spent.  I also expected faster shutter speeds from a camera that sports a fast Carl Zeiss lens.<br />Leaving the exposure and aperture on automatic produces great resolution and color.  I did get caught up with being concerned about purple fringing and noise after reading dpreview. In a few photos, I did notice some purple fringing, but I really had to zoom in about 4x and look for it on my 17\" LCD.  Otherwise, it's barely noticeable on a very very few pictures and non-existent on most.<br />Great camera and have absolutely no regrets about buying it.","Sony has significantly upped the ante with the new F828. Not only has the CCD been upsized from 5 to 8 MB, but the lens zoom range has been increased from 5 to 7X. The wide angle end is now equivalent to 28 mm on the 35mm camera scale, which will be a significant advantage to people taking landscape shots or group pictures indoors. Test bench, indoor flash and non-flash outdoor images showed that the optics and CCD changes have resulted in improved image quality compared to all 5 MB models we've had in-house.<br />The F828 is roughly the same size as the F717, so this isn't going to fit inside a small purse or shirt pocket. This is more like the size of a typical 35 mm zoom and is intended as a camera for those interested in high quality image capture. I'll be trying to find a buyer for my F717...","The Sony F828 is an outstanding product for its price/quality/capability relationship. I have used all kinds of professional and semi-professional digital cameras over the years. Go ahead and compare it to a product 5 times its price and it will obviously come short. It does not replace a professional product, but for an ambitious amateur photographer and computer expert like me, who knows how to deal with the intricacies of a digital image, this is as good as it gets.<br />The camera is solid, easy to use, identical in operation to all Sonys and works like an normal SLR. The image quality is outstanding, when you know how to use it and where the limits of CCD capturing are. If you have to work a lot in very low light conditions there is no substitute for highly sensitive film material.<br />I flash everything and while the in-built flash is good, I would recommend to buy the HVL-F32X which is an excellent product and add-on. Learn to use the flash in every situation, even in bright sunlight to add clarity and to brighten the foreground against the background glare. I have used the flash for macro-photography and being able to shot with a hundred different camera and flash settings and then immediately check the outcome on my notebook is just incredible.<br />I have used the ability to shoot a series of 7 images and it is simply stunning. This is the first time I have seen this work really well in a digital non-pro camera. I series-shoot everything now, then just delete the rubbish. With the CF and Sony slot you can have up to 2GB of images, in highest resolution this is 500 pictures! You do need 50 shots for ONE great photo.<br />The zoom lens is excellent too and the camera is very pleasant and professional to hold. It has a great balance. The digital viewfinder as well as the LCD work perfectly. Color quality is typical Sony high-end quality and the color-tone is easily adjusted to your preference. One of the best features is the battery stamina (also typical Sony). With the standard battery I get 3 hours of continous use even when I use the flash.<br />Overall, this is the first camera that truly substitues my previous high-end SLR set.","With the admission that I'm biased to Sony because I hate the color calibration in most other digitcal cameras (which tend to be cooler in color, than the Sony-- which has been known to be a bit 'technicolor')-- its true that I would look forward to this camera simply because its got a bigger digital image and the color I like.  After getting one-- its better than just that.  The camera is truly a compilation of all the technology that Sony has developed to date as well as an advancement.  Its fast, has more responsive autofocus and exposure than previous models (I've owned both the V1 and the S85).  The color of the new 4 color CCD is impressive-- and it generally makes things look great.  As for overall image quality-- so far so good.  I've had good luck with both natural light and using the flash.  The only time you'll probably really notice that you're using a digital camera is in the dark-- when the image can get a bit powdery... like digital grain.  Then again-- there are so many tools present in the camera you can use to make your dark lighting situations  brighter-- that you may never have the opportunity to experiment without those in low light like I like to.","I just received the F828 from Amazon the day before Christmas. What a wonderful surprise gift when I didn't expect it for another month. The camera I own I would compare this to is the Coolpix 5700 and there truly is no comparison. Virtually no shutter lag with the F828. Can't believe how quickly it writes to my old CF card. Love the fact I didn't have to buy a memory stick. First Sony that will record on a microdrive or a cf card. Color is awesome. Even when shooting some Christmas photos and probably needed a flash or tripod sense some of the photos were blurry being hand held at a slow shutter speed, the color was absolutely awesome just set on auto white balance. The camera feels wonderful in my hands. Bigger than my 5700 but feels more stable and not too heavy. Love the mechanical zoom. I love the 100 degree rotating body. Haven't even had a chance to take bigger than a 5 megapixel photo yet but so far I love this camera. I just played around with night framing and shot outside in the dark and the photo looked like daylight. My Coolpix 5700 is going up for sale.","After a long wait, this camera finally shipped before Christmas.  The color is great, a high quality lens, the camera is fast, and EIGHT megapixels, well that's just AWESOME!  The 7x optical is also plus.  I pondered purchasing a Canon 10d until I read about Sony's 8mp f828 due out in November.  Despite the delay (and it's already on back order again) it was definitely worth the wait.  At $999.00 it is an incredible value.  At this time, you can't get close to 8 megapixels at this price. The body has a nice feel and is comfortable to hold.<br />I planned on purchasing a digital SLR, but I did not want to get locked in to only 6mp just yet, when eight was around the \"affordable\" corner.<br />I was using a nikon 5700, but returned it - focus was painfully slow and lens started to make a grinding noise when zoomed out.  It also had way too much noise.  The lens was qualtiy great along with the zoom, but it didn't make up for the negative aspects of this camera.<br />The color on this camera is remarkable.  As a graphic designer, I work with professional photos and Photoshop a great deal.  We all know that Photoshop is a huge plus in the digital darkroom, but it DEFINITELY helps to start with sharp photos with a lot of pixels and great color.<br />For the non-professional to consider: often digital photos have too much noise and not enough pixel information - something even Photoshop currently can't do miracles with.  I often hear consumers comment they don't need five, six or more pixels, because they won't be making such large prints these cameras offer.  However, after a photo is cropped of unnecessary background, your image needs still needs a lot of pixels to enlarge that portion.  That is a problem with 4mp and below.  Five is acceptable, six really good.  Eight -awesome!  In the next two years we'll all want 11mp or more, but you currently have to shell out $8,000 just for the camera body!<br />There is also low noise with the f828, a problem with many other digital cameras.  I absolutely love it!  The color is so true to life.  Beautiful!  You can photograph fast-moving children and pets with wonderful results and get great indoor shots as well, an area the other cameras in this price range generally fall short.  This camera truly sets a new standard, and considering it's very reasonable price tag, definitely worth it!!!"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot A80","amazon_reviews":["Works just as good  as the same model my wife bought","Works as I anticipated.

The flippy screen is awesome, though I don't use it as much as I thought I would. Easy to use, easy to get good shots, highly recommended!","I love this camera, recently had problems with one I had for about 8 years and bought a replacement used model.  Buyers should be aware that the Canon A80 had a problem with it's image controls failing which was supposed to be fixed by sending the camera in.  I was not aware of this until contacting them recently.  If the camera is bought used, you should make sure the fixes were made prior to buying or your camera may fail as both mine did.  Parts are not available anymore to fix the problem.","I purchased this digital camera as my first experience with the 'digital' world of cameras and photos.  Loved the digital end of taking and having photos.  Purchased rechargable AA batteries for the camera as I apparently loved to take photos... more and more and more.  I did experience an issue with the battery cover not closing all of the way, causing the batteries to not be able to power the camera and had to return it three times for repair. I was not 'rough' with the camera as any camera I have had has been a major part of my life. Unfortunately, it was never actually repaired when I returned it to Canon so needless to say I never used the camera again.  I did get to use the camera for about 2 years though but in the era of items of higher quality and expectation of 'life' of product, I was disappointed it didn't last longer.","The Canon Powershot A80 has been used by my family since May 2004 when I bought it for $349 at Best Buy.  It has provided years of beautiful pictures that are sharp, clear, vivid, and color-accurate.  I compared its photos to two newer Canons (S2 IS and 1400IS) for indoors and outdoors photos--the A80 always had the best photos.<br /><br />This camera was a gift for my father's retirement in 2004--both parents enjoy using it despite being somewhat fearful of new electronics so it is easy to learn and use.  The LCD screen is only 1.5\" but it is a flip-out so you can easily get strange angles.  The screen is tiny by 2011 standards so I wouldn't recommend this for people who are hard of seeing.<br /><br />Its battery consumption is normal.  It takes four AAs, adding weight to the camera.  The weight helps me hold the camera steadier.<br /><br />The only problem we had with this camera was a defective CCD sensor that was repaired by Canon free of charge.  Sending it in for repair was easy--Canon emailed a shipping label, we dropped it off at a FedEx, and it was mailed back within two weeks with a repair and cleaning service document included.  The CCD problem surfaced in 2008 or so--the LCD screen gradually showed more and more pink/purple blobs over the image.<br /><br />I would still buy this camera if 3X optical zoom was enough and you did not need Image Stabilization.","Good old fashioned camera. It has a manual view finder that Cannon has taken out of their later models.<br />Photographers need to frame their pictures.","This camera took the best ever photos but after two years just quit.  Never dropped or mistreated.  Camera store quoted over $100 just to see what was wrong with it.  That did not include actually fixing it.  So sad - it did take such wonderful photos.  Then purchased PowerShot S2 IS.  Images not as good as A80.  So sad.  PowerShot S2 IS quit after three years.  Changing over to Panasonic.","I have had this camera since 2005, and taken some of my best pictures with it.  To me it's very simple to use, and I like to play with the settings until I find something that fits my needs.  I fell in love with the \"sports\" mode (and I'm not into any sports really) because it was awesome taking pictures of my 3-year-old at the time.  The colors of the pictures are very true to the real thing, and the swivel LCD viewer is the best when you want to take pictures without being too obvious of what you're doing.  It's also a life saver for short people like me (5'2.5\") because you can lift up the camera, tilt the screen and take pretty pics from above (again, also very handy with little ones!).<br /><br />This camera has survived lots of trips and many many many drops!  The top part started to come off a while ago (maybe a year or two after we got it and used it a lot), and the metallic cover of the shutter button completely fell off (don't know where it could be!), but even with all these issues, the pictures are still really great.  I have moved on and got the Powershot S5IS (which takes nice pictures, but I notice the color a bit off compared to this one), so I gave this camera to my daughter (now 7).  She likes it a lot, and sometimes lets her little brother (only 2) use it!  The pics are hilarious, but the best part is that the camera is still taking really great pictures and nice video (no zooming or image stabilization during video though) even after all these years.<br /><br />Hopefully I can get my new Canon T2i soon (need the money to get it, just a very minor detail!),but in the meanwhile I am having fun looking at the pics my kids take with THEIR camera.","I got this as my first digital camera in June 2004.  Recommendation was from Ken Rockwell ([...]  Have been very very satisfied with it and it has produced 1000s of wonderful photographs for me.  4 Megapixel is all you need for 95% of the time and it has a larger sensor than most newer compacts, giving cleaner photos.<br /><br />It takes CF cards (interchangeable with my dSLR), 4 AA batteries (easily available anywhere, giving it more flash power & longevity) and fits the hand well.  I prefer it to my SD850 because I can also manually adjust everything.<br /><br />Two years ago, the CCD gave out.  Canon arranged to replace it free of charge (FANTASTIC SERVICE!!!), thus giving this old camera another lease of life.<br /><br />Its now my vacation/outdoor/rough use camera.<br /><br />Update Aug 2013:<br />The camera is still going strong.  I fitted it with a 1.0GB card and gave it to my tech challenged dad for his summer vacations in Europe and the US. Explained how to change the batteries and to keep it on the Green Auto at all times.  He came back with 150 fantastic pics with virtually no mishaps.  My kids have also been using this to learn photography as it allows one to start in full auto and then progressively take control.  And no one has any problems with just 4 Megapixels!!!<br /><br />What a fantastic camera!!!  Canon, you really need to make more like these rather than all the super small auto cameras today!!!","I got this camera as a graduation gift 5 years ago.  Since then I've taken it everywhere with me and it's been dropped, soy sauce has been spilled on it (made the lens sticky but eventually wore off), and it's been to countless concerts, road trips and even over to england with me for a month.  I've taken more pictures than I can count and have never had a problem with it!<br /><br />The swivel LCD screen is what really makes this camera special.  Throughout my 5 years I've seen only a few people that have the same thing.  It makes taking a group picture quicker and I never want a camera without the swivel screen!<br /><br />This camera is very dependable, very unique, and very easy to use.  There's a lot of picture options for those who have a more in-depth knowledge of cameras, and if you don't know much, just leave it on a setting and the pictures come out wonderful!","I bought this camera new in 2004 and I haven't had a bad day with it since. My oldest son dropped it on a concrete sidewalk at one point and damaged the case but it still works like a charm. My only complaint is the relatively small screen. Hard to see in daylight especially full sun. However the picture quality and ease of use and the durability makes it easy for me to recommend.","I purchased this camera back in 2004 for $350 from Best Buy.  It has served me well through the years, and while it still works I am now in the market for something smaller & newer and am having trouble finding something that I think will live up to its standards.<br /><br />One of my best friends liked this camera so much she bought a newer almost identical looking version of a Canon in 05, unfortunatly her lens shutter was broken by her kids a few months ago, but she too really liked the camera and will be inheriting mine if I ever can replace it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />I love the flip out screen, this is not a feature you can find often on newer cameras, probably bc it requires a larger camera size.  Its really handy if you are someone like myself who doesnt like to ask strangers @ Disney World to take my picture.<br /><br />It runs on AA batteries!  New cameras seem to only run on the rechargeable lithium ion batteries (again to make the camera more compact), which normally I would prefer, but I am about to go to Europe for a month and I hear that finding a reliable power converter is difficult, so most likely I will have to take the Canon with me there.<br /><br />It has a viewfinder!! I hate that new digital cameras that arent SLRs dont have a viewfinder!  I may not be a photographer, but I dont wanna just use the screen either!<br /><br />Easy to use, although there are a LOT of features on it which I have never even tried to mess with.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Battery life.  This I think is due to the age of the camera, bc I dont recall having such issue with it in the past as I do recently.<br /><br />Start up time.  It always seemed a little slow to start in picture viewing mode but now the camera is older it also is slow in picture taking mode & to view pictures takes almost a minute.<br /><br />Size, but for the time period when it was made, it was considered small then.<br /><br />It uses Compact Flash cards not SD.  Poor Canon made the wise choice back then to go with CF not SD for it's memory, this has since changed, but it sucks for people stuck with their older cameras to have to pay more money to get outdated technology.","Over all I think this is a pretty good camera, I got it in the beginning of 2004 and have used it and dropped it many times... it didn't stop working until earlier this year when I dropped it on a concrete floor and it has since refused to turn on... I was very abusive to it, so I expected it to one day just die and it did... over all I took very good photos with it, it was a bit slow after taking the picture, but over all pretty good... top of the line for 2003/2004... now a days I just got a better and faster one for 1/2 the amount I brought this one for...","I've had this camera for around four years now. It's been taking excellent photos the entire time. The reason I got this camera is because the PowerShot series was (and maybe still is) the only series of low-mid-range cameras that actually have manual focus abilities. In fact, this camera has a full range of manual settings: ISO, aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and of course focus. All of these work well, and are reasonably easy to access. It also has automatic settings, of course! The only annoying thing about it is the fact that the videos are limited to about 2min 30sec.<br /><br />The other awesome thing about this camera is a feature that's now VERY hard to find: The rotating LCD screen. You can take photos at any angle. The only cameras that have this now are the Powershot S5 and TX1, which are very large and very expensive, respectively.<br /><br />It's a shame they don't make a camera that's exactly like this one, but with updated higher resolution...","I got this thinking it would be substitute for SLR.  I needed to decrease bulk and weight on trip to Europe.  It was successful for that but it lacks in ability to capture special shots.  It is ok for occassional user.  Operations not much different than SLR.  Close up and telephoto add on lens are a joke.  You can buy smaller cameras to accomplish decreased size, but go with SLR if want flexibility.","I have taken countless pictures of 6 grandchildren for over 3 years without a single problem!  6 yr old granddaughter loves to run around taking lots of pictures with it and have to say this is NOT a fragile camera.  Want to find another to give to an 8 year old for Christmas.  LOVE this camera... especially like the vari-angle LCD monitor.  It really helps to keep the monitor from being damaged.","I have used this camera for about 3 years (i've taken close to 1500 photos and about 30 video clips) and its still the best camera I've ever owned! Durable and utilitarian, it satisfies all amateur photographic needs (takes zoom, panorama, night shots, b/w, sepia, self-timed.) The video function though limited & grainy is useful for short recordings. The screen is small, but that's a minor disadvantage. It's a little bulky, but still small enough to fit in your pocket (a big pocket), though it is heavy. The price is very reasonable. Battery life is only adequate (4 AA).<br /><br />Two absolute additional accessories and add-ins- the Samsonite camera case (see my other reviews) and a larger memory card (at least 512 MB). The 32 MB card that comes with the phone is useless.<br /><br />Highly recommended....","I have always brought Canon products because I find them to be good quality products for the money. This camera is no exception it take superb pics (it is just awesome) and it is worth the money paid. Need a great digital camera try canon, you won't be disappointed.","We love our A80, so when the LCD screen cracked after a fall, we were bummed. We decided to send it in to Canon through their online repair service system. It was GREAT! They charge a flat rate of $108 no matter what the problem is. They replaced the screen, and I just got it back today ... about 1 week after they received it. I wish I hadn't waited a few months to do it.","This camera is almost perfect. I have owned this camera for almost 2 years and it performs as promosed so far. It is a little heavier than other models, but the use of AA batteries is one of the best features! So no complaints.<br /><br />However, the image quality is a little weak when using with the flash. But I suppose you can't really ask that much at this price range and it seems to be a weakness for most digital cameras anyway. The flaxible viewing window is also excellent and Ii is clearly visible outdoors. Although the viewing LCD is a little smaller, but it also helps on the battery life, so again, no complaints. The image quality is in general pretty good under normal light conditions. The only drawback is that the nine-piont focus cannot be manually adjuested.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent and durable camera.","This camera takes terrific shots and is easy to operate.  The memory cards are affordable and the feature set is robust enough even for advanced photographers.  The swivel screen is a nice addition and I have used it more than I thought I would.  The only thing I would change would be to increase the display size to that of the competition (this kept me from giving it 5 stars).","Lifelon Canon customer (I have had an EOS SLR for about 10 years now with no complaints).  This camera is absolutely wonderful, but I'm concerned about the quality.  I've had it about a year, and it's been great up until recently when the lens got buggy.  The memory card door and battery doors are now loose, and the lens  has trouble sometimes closing.  At this point in the digital camera game, I'm ready to upgrade to a digital SLR, but I'm ready to look at brands other than Canon.","I bought this camera over a year ago and I have taken some totally awesome shots with it. So far I have shot about 5000 pictures, and it still works like brand new. Everybody in my family wants a new camera so they can take pictures as good as this camera. Canon has been in the photography business for years, and they know what they are doing. As long as you choose a Canon, you will be in good shape. The rest is up to features.<br /><br />I have used the movie feature to record my cousin's play. They say you can't use the zoom while you are recording, but if you zoom before you start recording it will stay zoomed.<br /><br />I very seldom use the fully auto setting, instead I use the Program AE and keep the ISO set at 50 with the flash off. Make sure you always set your white balance before shooting pictures. If you do this, your pictures will look as lifelike as possible.<br /><br />The only drawback about the camera for me is the small maximum aperature size. When zoomed out all the way it's fine, but when I zoom in I have lost shots because I couldn't use a flash and keep the same look to the pictures.","I've been very happy with my purchase of this camera.  This is my first digital, which I researched before buying.  I used to own a Minolta film SLR, which was also a nice camera.  But, this Canon for \"normal\" prints (5x7 or so) is about as good as that Minolta was.  And because it's digital, I'm saving $$ over a film camera.<br /><br />I expect this to be my \"bread and butter\" camera.  The everyday, pictures of the nephew and niece camera.  When I can afford it, I'll get a digital rebel.<br /><br />Also when I can afford it, I'll get a Canon printer.  Maybe two: one for the desktop, and a second portable one.  Seems to me that a portable printer with this camera is about as close to a Polaroid as the digital world has to offer.<br /><br />It will take you some practice to learn how to hold the camera steady.  Two tricks I've discovered.  1 - buy a little tripod.  For about $10 you can get an 8\" or so tripod which is great for estting the camera up on a table or car or whatever.  2 - use the 2 second delay so that pressing the button does not interfere with the shutter's movement.  I'm not at all sure this \"problem\" is unique to this camera, I suspect it's true with most digital point-and-shoots.<br /><br />This camera is not very big, in fact it's smaller than many film point and shoot cameras I've seen, but I've found that some people prefer something smaller.  I'd suspect the Elf would make most people happy.","I've had my A80 since November of 2003 and I'm still happy about my choice.  There are so many positive things about this camera that I don't know where to start.  The colors are extremely vivid, the macro is crisp, the flip out screen is an added bonus plus the camera gives you so many choices for every picture taking senario that it makes for a great picture no matter what.  The digital zoom doesn't pixel out like most so it's great for closeups.  It's one of the only cameras out there in it's price range that has the option of a lens upgrade.  I've read most of the reviews and as for the negative ones: Read the manual.  Study the camera.  It's been over a year and I'm still learning.  If you're looking for a basic point and shoot this isn't exactly the camera you should choose.  The salepeople will tell you it's a great camera for a newbie but it isn't.  The construction is better than some of the reviews.  Mine has been dropped probably 50 times and I haven't had one thing go wrong.  I've found that it works best with a Canon printer as well.","Great pictures, many features, overall easy to use.  The flip out screen was very convenient on vacation when having to shoot pictures over the heads of people in front of me.  I just flipped it out and tilted it.  Great camera!  The Powershot A95 is the more recent upgrade so you might want to look into this model as well.  Only drawback-- it is a little heavier than some other models since you use 4 AA batteries.  The perk to that would be that these batteries can be found anywhere (even out in the middle of no where) which can be a plus when on a long trip.  Love it!","I have been using this camera for 10 months now.  It has given me no trouble at all.  Batteries last well.  There is enough sophistication built in if you want to be more professional.  But it is also very user-friendly for the novices.  The quality of photos is exceptional.  The reversable LCD is good because a) it conserves battery, b) it protects the screen, and c) it allows you to take selfportraits without the guesswork.<br /><br />The ability to take 3 minute movies with sound has proved invaluable for documenting classic moments at Madonna dance parties.<br /><br />The camera is light, and not too big.  Sure, there are smaller ones, but for the price and the feautres, I for one could not ask for more.<br /><br />All in all, a great camera.<br /><br />My one tiny gripe is that I wish I could make the flash less bright.  At times, the flas can wash out an image, but I find that if I use the high speed setting without flash, I can get a great picture 80% of the time.","I have owned this camera for over six months now and I am very impressed.  There are a ton of features to customize nearly every aspect of your shot composition.  However, there is a very easy to use point-and-shoot mode as well that functions well.<br /><br />This four megapixel camera produces images that are beautiful.  They are of such quality that enlargement prints of 8 x 10 or even 11 x 14 are possible with no image degredation.<br /><br />This camera does pack a lot of features into a fairly compact package.  I really like the fact that this camera uses AA batteries.  I purchased some rechargeable NiMH batteries and a quick charger and I have been VERY impressed so far as to the battery life of the A80.  I have taken well over 100 shots most with flash and the LCD display illuminated and the batteries still had juice.<br /><br />A wonderful feature on this camera is the flip out LCD display.  This may be the most underrated feature on the camera.  The display is capable of flipping out, rotating and pivoting so you can hold the camera in all sorts of creative positions but have the display adjusted so you can see it.<br /><br />The image quality that this camera produces never fails to impress.  Nearly every time I am showing someone some shots I took with the A80, they make comments like, \"How come my camera doesn't take pictures that good?\".  Colors are rich and the contrast is very good.<br /><br />There are only a couple of negative points about the A80 that I have discovered.  There is a slight delay between the time you press the shutter button (button to take the picture) and the time the camera actually snaps that picture.  It's probably less than 1/2 second, but occasionally when I have wanted to snap a quick shot of something moving, it was unable to capture it in time.  Not a huge problem, but if you plan to shoot a lot of action pictures, this may be a consideration.<br /><br />Overall, I would definately recommend this camera.  Comparing features, picture quality and price, the Canon A80 is a fantastic value and should be considered by anyone interested in a low-mid range digital camera.","I love this camera!!! It took me a long time to get up the nerve to invest in a digital, but I have no regrets about this one in the least, and I am thrilled at my picture quality. A couple of things: I haven't tried it with lenses yet. A friend has the A70 and has used a macro lense on it; she didn't think it worked as well as it should... I don't know if Canon A80 will have similar issues, but the macro shots on the A80 without lenses are good enough I don't think I care! Plus, even the capability of using additional lenses on a camera this size and price blows me away. The flip-out screen is Worth It. Yes, that cute little addition is actually worthwhile. Go for it. The automatic setting on this is great -- I haven't improved on it (but will try the P setting adjustment mentioned in another review - thankyou!), but the landscape, portrait, and different color settings are great additions. I've only had this camera 9 months, but I have already learned a ton about photography, and this camera challenges me to keep improving! It has plenty of room to grow on! This camera is easy to understand, very adaptable, allows all the control one can expect in a camera at this level and then some -- and most of all, makes beautiful pictures even with no effort at all. Buy It! Buy It!","I shopped for weeks to find an affordable digital camera that would perform well, and I found it with the A80.  It is a nice compact size, easy to understand, and performs well.  And you can purchase additional lenses for even more features.  I would recommend any of the \"A\" series Canons.","When i received mine it was made in China. The earlier models were from Japan and they are different. you can tell just by comparing the two. Performance so far OK","I love this camera.  I bought it for myself about six months ago.  It takes fantastic pictures, great video with sound.  I'm a (very) amateur photographer, but this camera has encouraged me to learn more.  It has so many features, and is virtually idiot-proof.  I love the optical zoom, the flip-out LCD screen.  Everyone I've used this camera around always asks to see it.  Both my brothers bought one after seeing the pictures I took of their kids after our last family gathering.  I give this camera my highest rating!","This is by far the best digital camera I have ever used. I also bought the underwater housing. This camera is great for underwater pictures and the quality is excelent.","From an amateur who has never had a digital camera before, I LOVE the A80! I purchased the camera to simply take pictures of our new baby and easily email them to family and friends.<br /><br />Initially, I appreciated the auto-focus feature, swivel LCD screen and 4 mega pixels to print great large-size photos (up to 11x14\" photo quality).<br /><br />After owning the camera for 5 months, I've discovered many more features worth using -- portrait mode, night scene shooting, short videos (a few minutes long with memory card upgrade), black and white, and even manual exposure shooting.  The cons of this camera are few (see below).<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />* Easy to use for an amateur, but has additional features for more advanced photographers<br /><br />* Lightweight, extremely portable and feels solid<br /><br />* Great swivel LCD screen changes the angles of the shot without moving the camera itself<br /><br />* Can turn flash and red-eye mode on and off quickly<br /><br />* Has a \"one touch\" close-up focus mode<br /><br />* Has a self-timer mode (2 and 10 seconds)<br /><br />* USB hook-up to download your photos to your PC is simple (even for computer-challenged folks)<br /><br />* The bundled software is decent enough for the average person's purposes<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />* You will need to upgrade the low-space 32MB memory card to 256MB CompactFlash card (budget approx. $50-$70 for this)<br /><br />* The pause between shots (called \"recycle time\") seems long when trying to capture several shots quickly<br /><br />* Does seem to eat regular batteries quickly (needs 4 AAs).  I advise buying rechargeables.<br /><br />* Does not come with a camera case<br /><br />I did a lot of research and recieved glowing recommendations from several friends when buying this camera.  I would definitely purchase this camera again.","The A80 is a wonderfully simple-to-use digital camera, yet has all the manual adjustments a semi-professional (or serious amateur) photographer could ever want.  I bought this about six months ago as a replacement for my Canon A40, which also produced amazingly good quality pics, but is only 2.0 megapixels.  The A80 is 4.0 MP, which gives you the headroom to create slightly larger prints, at least up to 8 X 10 with excellent quality.<br /><br />Canon has rethought the user interface on the A80, and the camera is simple to use.  The \"Auto\" setting works quite well for many occasions, but there are plenty of setting for special situations, or complete manual control if you want it.  There are even two user-customizable settings.  Forget the 32MB CF card the camera comes with- get yourself a couple of 256  or 512MB cards, and you'll be set for a week's worth of vacation snaps.<br /><br />The A80 uses a lot of battery power, so a set of alkaline AAs should be used only as emergency back-up. (It's also handy that they're sold in every store all over the world.)  But get yourself a set or two of Powerex 2300 mah rechargeables and a MAHA charger, and you will get 800-1000 charges on each set.  For about $50, you'll have battery power for at least five years!  Get your batteries from Thomas Distributing (easily found on the web)- they are good people and very knowledgeable and reliable.<br /><br />Using the camera with the LCD screen shut off saves a lot of battery power.  Good for when you're being touristy and don't need to review every shot.  The swiveling LCD screen is very handy for shooting over crowds, pets and small children, and the inevitable self-portrait.  Its nicest feature is that it swivels closed so the screen is shielded by the camera body.  Get some of those little plastic protectors anyway, for $5 the LCD screen will remain in like-new condition for years.<br /><br />The Canon A80 is an EASY-TO-USE camera, shooting EXCELLENT QUALITY pictures in AUTO mode, with complete MANUAL ADJUSTABILITY.  It is highly recommended for anyone.","I did a lot of research on the internet prior to purchasing my first digital camera and I'm glad I did.  I highly recommend this camera to anyone, whether a seasoned pro who wants a nice, pocket-sized camera or a beginner who needs a little experience taking quality pictures.  I highly advise anyone who hasn't owned a digital camera to take a lot of shots before using it for something important.  I found it to be quite different from a film camera and it took a little getting used to.  Once I got the hang of it, however, I was glad I took all of those \"wasted\" shots.  I recently returned from a trip to England.  All in all, I took anywhere between 500 and 600 pictures, but some of the shots are so amazing that they could be postcard material.  My neighbor, who is a professional photographer, was so impressed with the color and clarity I was able to get with this little camera that she is thinking about getting it for the times she doesn't feel like lugging her heavy camera equipment around.  The only down side to this camera is what I feel to be a slow \"reset\" after each shot.  I couldn't really get a quick sequence of shots on some things that I really wanted to, but luckily the quality of the pictures I did get almost negates the necessity for it.  I've had this camera about 3 months and I still have many gadgets that I haven't discovered, but so far I've been impressed.","I got this Canon A80 about a month ago. I was a little disapointed a litlle bit because of the pictures quality comparing to my Olympus (C5050). After trying many difference shooting modes; manual, Tv (you set the shuttle speed and the camera will select the proper aperture), Av (apeture priority), and Auto, the pictures are good but not great (pictures came out like the 35mm Canon Sureshot instead of SLR quality like my C5050). Yesterday, I set the camera on the P mode (program)and adjust the exposure compensation by +1/2, BANG!! voila the photos came out perfect awsomely colorful and details (very close to my C5050!!). This setting also works exellent with backlight; I use this mode a lot to shoot the travel photos because it give my kid faces more relaxing look (the flash fire up automaticaly!!). Mission acomplished!!! I just got an awsome back up. The Con. on this camera is the 9 point auto focus system; sometime it locks on the wrong subject; but this is only a minor thing, you can do the half click again until you have it right. I give this one a 5+ for the picture quality. This camera required a learning curve but so does my C5050. If you don't have one yet, this will be the great choice.","I love this camera since it has all the features you would want..<br /><br />The swivel screen helped in a lot of ways to take pictures from different positions.<br /><br />Pictures are crisp, clear<br /><br />Gives decent battery life<br /><br />Has lot of options to customize and get great photos","I bought this camera little over a month ago.  I am very happy with the results.  For best use, i recommend buying rechargeable batteries, such as the ones from energizer, 8 total.  They last a long time per charge, and you always have an extra set.  If you plan on taking large pictures, i also recommend buying a larger card, i have a 256MB, but 128MB does the job fine as well.  I have heard some concerns about the rubber part of the USB connection, and its really no big deal if you take care of it, it plugs neatly back into place.  I also recommend buying an USB card reader, such as the dazzle.  This helps you not drain your cameras batteries while downloading pictures onto your computer.  There are two problems with this camera, neither of which are a problem.  First, it is fairly large, compared to the elf and other cameras, but it is not HUGE, it is smaller than a typical film camera, yet 100000 times better.  The only other problem is sharing the pictures, if you have a slow connection.  to solve this, just take smaller shots, simple as that.  All in all an awesome camera, especailly for the price<br /><br />to see some of the work ive done with this camera, i have them uploaded onto this website: [...]","I bought this camera in December 2003 -- and I am so glad I did!  I have shot hundreds of photos with this camera -- and the best thing ever is NOT paying for the ones that suck.  (DELETE!)  I love the quality of this camera, and the size is pretty good.  I didn't get to hold it in my hand until I bought it -- and sometimes wish I'd opted for the Powershot just so it would fit in my pocket without a bulge (I'm sure my cargo-pants-wearing boyfriend would appreciate my being able to carry my own camera as well).  That being said -- the only complaint I have -- is that it takes too long to snap pictures.  I've missed tons of shots because the camera can't move fast enough.  A friend has an HP digicam, and if she presses it half-way it focuses -- and then presses again, it takes the shot IMMEDIATELY.  I really wish this one did that.  But now I know what thing to look for when I upgrade someday to an SLR-style digicam.","I feel like I'm the last person to convert to digital cameras, but I'm glad I waited and found the Canon Powershot A80 at supersale price. I knew there had to be a catch, so I did my research and checked up on reviews by both customers and professionals. I wanted something easy to use, but not something cheap that would only last me a few months. My studies showed that there was no catch, this camera had the features I've been looking for but could not afford. This was definitely the right choice for me.<br /><br />The 4.0 megapixel A80 is the perfect camera for a beginner who does not want to look like one. In addition to its sleek style, it's easy to use (point and shoot) but also has features that I yet have to learn. I'm very impressed with the quality of the photos as they came out bright, sharp and vivid. I don't understand the complaints about the battery life (from many reviews) as I've taken over 100 photos during my vacation and I'm still on my first batch of batteries (love the AA batteries!). Just be sure to turn off your camera when it's not in use. I also enjoy the tilting/swivel LCD screen which allows you to shoot from different angles. All my friends seem to envy that feature in particular. It's also small enough to carry around but not too small that it would be easy to lose/misplace. It also has a movie mode with sound, but I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />The only cons I have with the camera (but I can live with) is that the monitor seems too small and it's hard to see images in daylight. I wish it had more zoom as well. The CF door seems very fragile and each time I open it, I feel like it's going to fall off.<br /><br />Other than that, I highly recommend the A80 to those who are new to digital cameras but would like the extra features of a more advanced camera. Wonderful, brand-name camera for a low price. Look out for bargains!","This camera is pretty much everything you will ever need for 98% of all your picture taking needs.  The picures are crisp and full of color.  I was highly impressed by how the auto focus fixed lighting problems and knew when to utilize the flash or not.  Wonderful feel in the hand and the LCD screen on a swivel is one of the best features you'll find on a digital camera.  Finally you can take a picture of yourself and a friend (while pointing the camera at you) and you can see exactly what you are taking.  Marvelous!<br /><br />The software for this product is all self-activating.  You plug your camera in, download you pics, and then manipulate them if you wish.  So easy its scary.  I was looking at the Casio line for is small size and couldnt be happier I went with the Canon A80.  I was worried about indoor pictures coming out darker (as with the apparent problem with the Casio line), I NEVER had a problem.<br /><br />I am sure people could come up with this and that for why one camera is better than this one, but for the money and the tools, this is the BEST overall camera, period DOT.","Absolutely great user friendly camera.  Pictures taken are nice and crisp and colorful.  Very nice for a beginner.  Software is very user friendly also.  Lightweight, easy to carry.  Love it!!","First of all i want to thank Amazon.com for there reliable shipping. This is my first time ordering online and was hoping i could get my Canon A80 on my Son's Birthday, and Amazon didn't disappoint me. All of the good review for this camera are all correct and much more. I love the display view and also the type of shooting modes and functions. The 3 minutes video record is also good enough to manage all my clips, aside from other camera who only offer 30 secs clips.<br /><br />All in all if you're looking for the best brand and model + affordable price, i recommend you this Canon A80.","This is an excellent camera. The only reason I give it fewer stars is because of potential quality issues (yet to be determined). Canon recently changed all production for this model to China. The general perception is that Made in Japan is of much better quality. Regardless as to the truth of the perseption, it is very true that things made in China are made at a much much lower cost to thing made in Japan. So far my camera has functioned well, however only time will tell. I feel cheated since all my research (online, in stores, etc) was based on the Made in Japan version. People will tell you they are identical, however that is usually not the case. Even if the parts are the same the quality control usually differs.<br /><br />I feel cheated by Canon and retailers by this change. The main point is to realize that if you are ordering a new one now that it will be Made in China.","My new Canon A80 showed up at my doorstep the day before hurricane Charley did the same thing.  Fast delivery and timely.<br /><br />I can tell you from experiance that is does a fine job in low light and catches the action of wind blowing outside of a window during a hurricane.  Excellent value and very good results.  I needed something in place of my Nikon D70 for trips where I didnt want to carry a larger bulky camera but one that was reliable and very good.  The A80 did the job just fine.  Very happy with it.  The software works well and is easy to use.  Impressive images and the price is less than 1/2 the cost of the last point and shoot type camera I bought 4 years ago.  I'd recomend it to anyone who wants a great point and shoot.","This camera is absolutely amazing.  Whether you are a point and shoot person or a budding amateur, this camera is for you.  The camera has preconfigured settings for different situations (i.e. Portrait, Landscape, Night time, etc.) and the menus are easy to navigate as well.  If you're becoming more of an amateur photographer, there are also custom settings that you can save.<br /><br />The image quality is superb and the flip out screen has turned out to be surprisingly useful.  You can take your own picture or lift the camera above your head (like at concerts) and still be able to see what your shot would look like.  The LCD is a bit small, but it still gets the job done.<br /><br />All in all this camera is extremely useful, easy to use, and worth the money.  I highly recommend it.","I ordered the camera on the 1st of August and it arrived yesterday. Really very quick. Camera is really nice. Taken a few pictures and looks really good. Also you need battery charger, just to let you know.","ok, so I read all the reviews and decided to go for this camera. I could live with all the shortcomings - small lcd, heavy etc - except camera/picture quality.<br /><br /> I received the camera and found it was \"Made in China\". now I read some of the earlier reviews which warned against this one and had recommended \"Made in Japan\" but of course, I did not have a choice here. anyway, the camera was good in every respect except a small dark spot in the LCD which turned even darker and smaller - very noticable when zooming. it was almost like a dust spot on the lens! except the lens was clean and I double-cleaned it. it was like the dust spot was inside the lens. and must be quite some dust as it was very noticeable in every picture. (...)<br /><br /> I have requested a replacement and hope that the new piece is better - given all the home work I did on this model, I really want this to be good!<br /><br />UPDATE 08/07/2004: Amazon promptly shipped me a replacement camera.  and even though this one is also made in China, the lens dust issue is not there in this piece.<br /><br />There is an occasional \"vignette\" issue i.e. if you take a picture against a white wall or sky, the corners come slightly darker than the center.  I am told (by researching the web) that this is even an issue in semi professional cameras, so given that I must say this camera does quite a good job at it.<br /><br />The flip out LCD is good, but resolution is poorer than other 1.5\" LCD, for example the one in the S400/410 series.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate the camera 4 stars, however, somehow Amazon does not allow me to update the rating. but then I would also rate my Canon S400 a 4 stars as well.  given the price, this would be a 5!","I shopped around for months and have had this camera now since February.  It has been fantastic!  I love the size (not too small or large). The features are so neat. I have even used the tilting lcd screen much more than I ever thought I would. It is great to hold over your head when you aren't tall enough- you can capture that shot without pushing through the crowd.<br /><br />  I print my pictures through York- they have come out fabulous!  I haven't been disappointed yet and I've been shooting tons of pictures in all kinds of light- action and portrait.<br /><br />  The AA batteries will not last long so you'll need a charger,but that was a very small investment.  I put in the rechargable batteries and took probably 500 pictures before they had to be charged again.","Ordered the camera on July 25th and arrived on 29th. Really very quick. Camera is really nice. Taken a few pictures and look good. Main drawbacks are CF card, which is 32MB which comes with the card. need atleast 256MB. Also u need battery cahrger. Instead of 4AA batteries, Canon can give atleast 4 Ni-MH batteries.","I have had a Canon s100 2.1 megapixel for the past 3 years and loved it, but wanted to get something that had more manuel controls, better resolution etc. I made the mistake of trying a Sony DSC W1 first, I was solid on all of it's features and 2.5\" LCD, but returned it after 3 days of shooting very soft/fuzzy pictures. So I went for the Canon A80, $100+ less, loads of features, great pictures! The A80 doesn't have the big LCD but does have one that flips out and rotates 180 degrees so you can always see what your shooting. Also, if you have small children that you can never get to look at the camera, just flip out the screen so they can see themselves, works AWESOME. I have only had this camera for a few days, but the first couple of dozen pictures have been great. Plus you can get wide angle and telephoto lens that you can attach with an adapter. The other great thing with the Canon is the software, it is simply one of the best in the business, the Sony's is terrible. I could not be happier with my purchase now.","My only regret is that the Amazon price fell $55 in the 2 months since I bought it from here. But I suppose that's just the way it goes with technology (though a $55 drop in 2 months (about 17%) is a bit drastic even for technology).<br /><br /> Technically, it's a great camera. Snap it up for $275, which is what it's going for now. Great pictures, easy to use.<br /><br /> You should also get a case for it, and you should get rechargeable lithium AA batteries. And you need to get a 256MB Compactflash card - the included one is absolutely irrelevant, and is only good for about 20 pictures at the good resolution.","After using the A80 for about 2 weeks, I am very happy with my purchase decision.<br />  The nicest things about this A80 camera are:<br />  1) The canon lens give very clear pictures with good natural color [especially in day light];<br />  2) It uses AA type battery for power. Although the alkaline battery give poor power, the high capacity AA NiMH rechargeable batteries last at least 200 picture talking with LCD on.<br />  But in emergency situations, (you have choice) you can pick up some AA alkaline batteries in gas stations or supermarkets;<br />  3) Its metal case is good to hold and look at (most digicams, under $300) don't have enough metal on them.<br />  4) Canon A80 can allow us to get the lens adapter and matching lens to do wide-angle, closs-up shoot;<br />  5) Its 270 degree swivel LCD screen is very very useful when shooting pictures at some odds position, like shooting an object behind a crowd of people or fences;<br />  6) Its 4.0 megapixel resolution and 3X optical allow user to print good clear pics at least 8x11 size. for a camera under$300;<br />  7)A80 has extra mode like: aperture priority, shutter priority, and full manual mode to shoot pics. They are very handy for advance skilled users to take pics in all different situations;<br />  8) A80 uses Compact flash memory card, CF card is the most popular flash memory card and you can always get CF card at very good prices online.<br /><br />  I use windows xp to install canon A80 software and driver, never have problem to download or what so ever. If people blame on Canon A80 driver or software, they should fix up their windows xp before bashing the camera.<br /><br />  My suggestion for all A80 owners: Get a CF card with at least 128MB capacity or 256MB if you plan to travel with A80 for days.<br />  Always use NIMH rechargeable battery to save money in the long run. You can get 4 AA NiMH batteries and fast charger from Walmart or Target for around $20.<br />  I owned Canon A40 before, I loved and used the old A40 for 2 years. But this new A80 is a gem, and the $280 I spent on this camera will give me years of pleasure.","I bought this camera as a present for myself Christmas of 2003. I've been very pleased with it since then. I really have never taken pictures before other than straight point and shoot standard cameras. This camera allowed me to switch to digital (which I love) and try out some of the more advanced settings. While I haven't ventured too far from the preset options, I do enjoy being able to zoom and flip a switch to get the camera ready for a nighttime shot or an action shot. Two things that I've realized I didn't know enough about before purchasing the camera include:<br /><br />Zoom: The 3x zoom doesn't zoom nearly as much as I thought it would - but that is an error on my part, not Canon's.<br /><br />Action Shots: I took some photos at an indoor basketball game and was disappointed in the quality of the photos. A friend of mine who understands much more about photography explained some various things to me that once again, points to the fault lying with me and my expections.<br /><br />I have been very pleased with photos that I have printed on my fairly inexpensive inkjet printer. I'll even frame a couple to put up.<br /><br />I would purchase this camera again and recommend it for people looking for a digital camera (possibly even a first digital camera) to take the majority of 'standard' shots.","When I bought it 3 months back, everything looked good...now, my pictures come dark under indoor lighting...after doing some checks, I found that the flash is not working...it works ok in outdoor day light...now, I have to see, whether I can get this fixed under warranty...By the way, I am surprised that the price dropped from $350 to $270 in 2 months, on Amazon! Any particular reason!!<br />I am yet to test how the digital prints are...when, I got some 10 prints printed in a small shop, they were not as good as the non-digital camera prints...also, they are not as good as they look on the camera LCD screen...I don't know whether I can expect atleast same kind of prints as non-digital/film camera.","I initially had the Nikon Coolpix 3100 and had a warranty and the front of the lens broke off so I went back to the store to exchange and I was told that it was no longer sold.  The new model was 3200, well I spotted the Canon A80 Power shot and I ran home to read reviews on the camera before I bought it.<br />It's a little heavier than the Coolpix, but it has so many wonderful features.  I did a comparison of the two and I feel as though the Canon is a wonderful choice.  Not being a professional photographer, I wanted a camera that I could just aim and shoot and get quality pictures without a lot of work.  My Canon also has a lot of scenery modes which have helped me tremendously.<br />The quality of the pictures are awesome and you don't have to put a lot of effort into it.  My boyfriend took some pictures in the park and it was like the color was just coming through the camera.  My one negative is that some of the indoor shots are a little dark, but you can learn to adjust your settings and lighten them up.  Also, the software is wonderful.  I am having a ball making online movies and albums and just being creative.<br />This is definitely a wise choice that will make the user happy.","I paid about $270 for this camera. Really nice picture quality. You can use rechargable AA battery for this camera, which is nice. Outdoor pictures are great, but sometimes the indoor picture is not that bright. Overall if you are paying less that $300, it should be a good deal.","Nemrég vásároltam meg a gépet több operatõr kollegám tanácsára, és nem bántam meg. Nagyon pontos gép. nagyon szépen dolgozik. Érdemes a legnagyobb pixelszámmal dolgozni.<br />Viszont zabálja az elemeket, érdemes mielõbb 4 tölthetõ elemet vásárolni,<br />és egy 512MB os memoriakártyát.<br />Két hetes nyaralásom alatt rengeteg fotót készítettem, és még maradt is hely ezen a nagykapacitású kártyán.<br />Magyarországon jelenleg a készülék 69.000Ft-ért+ÁFA vásárolható meg. Ezt azért érdemes tudni!","I knew nothing about digital cameras, but after researching and reading many reviews, I decided on this one.  I was also considering a Nikon and the full Kodak package with the printer dock.<br />One clear standout feature is the LCD screen.  I almost never even look through the viewfinder anymore.  It allows you to take shots with much more ease and more quickly than you would with just a viewfinder.<br />Another thing that's good is that you can use the auto feature if you don't want to have to worry about any details, just want point and shoot, or you can switch to many other modes if you want more control over things, as you learn how to use the advanced features.  Thus, no matter how skilled you are, you can have great pictures.  I also like that there are all sorts of easy to use effects, like sepia and black and white, panoramic/stitch together.  You can be pretty artistic right away.  You can also take 3 min. movies with sound.<br />The software is easy to use. You just install it on the computer.  The cables come for you to connect the camera to the a USB port, and when you do that and turn on the camera once the software is installed, it instantly recognizes the camera and asks if you're ready to download pictures.  Once you do, they are saved to a folder and you can view them, manipulate and edit them, and even send them directly to an e-mail message.  The program interacts directly with my MSN browser automatically.  You can also create little booklets and albums and cards and things with the other software that comes with the camera.  I can't wait to get a color printer cartridge and some photo paper to see how that works. You also get a cable to view your pictures on tv.<br />BTW, a friend of mine has the Kodak system and is generally happy with the camera and quality of pictures, but said that the software often messes up on their system.<br />I don't know if all software does this, but I like that you can take some pictures, download them, take some more pictures, and the software knows only to download the new ones even though the others are still on the card.<br />Picture quality is typically excellent.  I took some very casual pictures of my son just fooling around the house, and I was amazed at the clarity and color that was captured.  His skin looked beautiful, and his pink lips and each long eyelash were captured stunningly, making me wish he didn't have on a juice-stained shirt.  He seemed to look better on the picture than I even noticed him looking in person.  I am sure that soon the house will have professionally developed photos of him all around it that I've taken.<br />I'd highly recommend the camera to anyone who likes ease of picture taking and good results, plus the ability to grow as a photographer also.  You will not be disappointed.<br />One thing that I was concerned about after reading reviews was that the battery compartment hatch might be fragile.  It isn't, you just have to follow the arrows telling you how to open and close it, because you have to slide a lever over and THEN lift, and there's a little spring so that when you close it, you have to push and then slide back over.  It is different than other compartments, but you have to follow the instructions, and it's not hard at all once you do it once.  Don't let that scare you.  It isn't flimsy at all, and it's not going to break easily.  You just can't be ham-handed with it and forge ahead without noting what you need to do first.<br />I would buy the soft case for it, available for under 10 bucks I think on this site.  I didn't go for the full kit because I found a fast charger that was cheaper, and NiMH batteries from anyplace will do.  I have 8 NiMH batteries, and I keep one set charged and in the front pocket of the case and one set in the camera.  These batteries last a good long time, but using the movie feature can eat through them more quickly.<br />I'm totally satisfied with this purchase.","This camera takes pretty good pictures once you figure out its unique quirks.  Moving from one digital to another does take time to figure out the camera and how each camera will meter a scene.  In manual mode this camera can't take the same beautiful pics as my Olympus C-2100UZ, but if I tweak the settings to compensate I can get shots just as good (without the long zoom of course).  The automatic settings work extremely well, and I'm happy with them.  This camera has some unique features that make it stand out tall for me, being compact with a little heft it feels like a camera and yet fits in a cargo pants pocket.  The camera uses AA batteries which are a big plus for me, as these are very generic and I could always buy or borrow when I run out.  All the cameras in my house use AAs, so that reduces cost right there, and we never have to worry about one camera running out.  The flip out LCD has gotten me some pics that I otherwise would've never been able to take... very nice.<br />But the camera does something else, that I never thought I could say of a many digital cameras.  It can take a licking a keep on ticking.  I foolishly one day was walking with the camera strapped around my wrist and the camera went flying through the air, a mere 2 weeks after I bought it.  It landed in the middle of the road, and I heard a crash and I had to look away as I thought there went a few hundred US dollars.  When I picked it up, there were a few visible dents and the camera looked like it wanted to rest in peace.  The body pressed basck into place with a few finger presses, and the dents remained on the edges, but the camera started with no problems to either the lens, internal electronics, CCD or the LCD.  That flip out LCD comes in handy at times like these to protect your screen.  The Canon kept on ticking!  For that alone, I'll give this camera 5 stars.","The A80 is an impressive camera, but most typical snap shot users will find it a bit frustrating.  First, it takes a long time to get an exposure reading and focus in AUTO mode. And for those who are trying to shoot children, this will be a BIG problem.  Secondly, when shooting an MPEG, you get lots of time but the zoom doesn't work during shooting and the exposure doesn't change if the lighting does.  You would expect a camera this expensive and sophisticated would have these features.  It takes great pictures and the software is good.  Buy a 256K compact flash card or you will be running our of space a lot.","I purchased this camera a few days ago and so far, it is really nice.  It seems well constructed, though it is smaller than I thought it would be.  I am by no means a photographer, but the auto modes seem to work just fine for me.  The camera seems fairly simple to operate, yet there are a good many functions for the photo enthusiasts.  The video mode isn't the greatest, but this camera wasn't made for high quality video.  The only thing that disappointed me so far was the fact that you can't get the date/time imprinted on the pictures.  If you use the software that came with the camera, which isn't the greatest, you can print out the pictures with the date/time below the image (like a postcard or something), but I would prefer it on the actual image.  Overall, though, I love it so far.","Delightful gizmo! I have had this for 6 months now. I am not a fan of teeny tiny electronics. This does have a bit of size and weight (when you put the 4AA batteries in) but thats why I love it. Everything works so well, the colours are vivid and rich, taking video and pictures is a breeze. My printer reads my CF card so I just remove that, upload my pics to my desktop and we are ready to go again. The little flip out screen is great. No more scratches like you get on the A60 (which I used to own). There are loads of features packed into this device and if you want to know what every last thing does, read the manual that comes with the camera. Everything is clearly explained in there. Just to get up and running though, just put in some batteries (included), the CF card (included) and hit that on button! Hope you have as much fun taking pictures with this as I do.","As with most electronic equipment, price points make all the difference between relative consumer evaluations. That said, given the price point of the new(er) Canon Powershot A80 digital camera, most recreational users will not find a much better camera with the multitude of features for the price. And, consumers seem to be proving Canon right given the immense popularity of the A80, an enviable successor to the extremely popular A70.<br />The basic A80 package comes decently loaded, but you'll definitely want to spring for a few goodies (upgrades). The basic package comes with the camera, cabling (A/V and USB), software (for photo manipulation), and a 32MB CompactFlash card.<br />The first few items I purchased (actually concurrent with the camera purchase) were:<br />- a 512MB CompactFlash card,<br />- Canon A Series Accessory kit,<br />- Canon conversion lens adapter (for peripheral lens transition),<br />- Canon wide converter (wide-angle lens), and<br />- Canon tele converter.<br />While most recreational photographers will easily be able to get by with the standard A80 bundle, I would recommend strongly the Accessory kit and wide converter (which will require the conversion lens adapter). The Accessory kit has a custom-fit A Series case, but more importantly, it has a compact battery charger and 4 NiMH rechargeable batteries. Inasmuch as AA alkaline's life expectancy is relatively short, rechargables become a must. The wide converter translates into much better landscapes and group photos. The A80 comes standard at 38mm, while the wide converter improves this to an advertised 24.5mm, a significant improvement. And, while the memory upgrade and telephoto addition can wait, the others, at least in my opinion, really make the A80 sing.<br />Some of the really cool features of the A80 include: the swiveling LCD (a fabulous addition to the A Series), a built-in lens cover (eliminating the need for a lens cap), and, of course, the infamous Canon lens expandability. For you skindivers, Canon offers a waterproof case, allowing you to take your A80 up to 40 meters underwater (advertised).<br />For me however, the nicest convenience is the fact the A80 is PictBridge-enabled allowing direct printing to photo printers (supporting PictBridge-which most photo printers do these days). If you haven't seen the direct photo printers yet (printing directly from your camera to a photo-quality printer), take a look. They'll knock your socks off!<br />Canon's software bundle appears to be at the head of the pack, which includes access and compatibility for both Mac and Win users. Mac afficionados will love this and feel less discriminated against to boot!<br />The absolute only issue I have with the A80 is the lack of compatibility with an external flash unit. The onboard flash is...adequate.<br />All-in-all, the A80 is a little hotshot in the mid-priced digital market. I am really enjoying this camera and, although I'm certainly not a professional, I always want to shoot the best photo possible as the moment is lost if the need to \"reshoot\" arises.","I'm a total amatuer, but have been using digital cameras at work for several years starting with the Sony Mavacia with 640x480 max resolution and most recently using an Olympus 3.2MP camera.  I'd refrained from buying a digital camera, limping along with a point-and-shoot 35mm instead because the resolution didn't seem great and the prices seemed too high.  With the birth of our first grandson though, I suddenly felt the need to own a digital camera!  Without too much research I bought the A80 and I'm totally satisfied with my choice and maybe even a little pleasantly surprised by some of the extra's.  First, just so I don't forget--it takes great pictures!  Really great pictures...I feel like the only limitation is my own ability to completely use all of the available features.  If you're reading the other 50 plus reviews you'll see a lot of technical info, so let me just hit my own personal highlights.  It doesn't come with a bag...but I got a great small Samsonite camera bag with snaps and straps and pockets and zippers for less than $6.00 at Walmart.  Any digital camera will eat batteries--go rechargable.  The best I've seen are 2300ah NIMH batteries, you'll need 8 and a charger {Walmart again} which will pay for themselves in a month or two (and trust me, when you do break down and buy it you're  really going to kick yourself for all the money you've been wasting on regular batteries).  The memory card they provide is too small, but at the second highest resolution, it will get you started with 30+ pictures and act as a interim backup.  I like the 256mb size as an upgrade, and will eventually buy a second one as a backup.  Sandisk had a price for well under $50 and a lifetime guarantee--so the backup card could come in handy if yours ever fails!  The camera comes loaded with features, including manual shutter and aperture modes and more automatic and manual modes than you will learn to use in weeks if not months or years of ownership.  In the meantime, just setting it on Auto or Nite mode makes you look like a freaking genius anyway.  The flip-out LCD screen is one of those things that you don't know you need until you have it, and then you wonder how you ever did without!  It protects the delicate screen when not in use, rotates so your wife can take centered pictures of herself (instead of the off-center ones she usually got with a regular camera), and it is great for candid pics when you don't want to spook the subject by looking directly at them with the camera or when you want to alter the angle of your photo to get a bugs eye or birds eye view.  The USB connection to my computer is a huge improvement over the floppy disks the Mavacia used and even a full card of 256mb downloads quickly (plus you can upload pictures to transport them to another computer).  The included software for cataloging and modifying shots is adequate and actually quite an improvement over what I've seen in the past.  Considering that it's free, I'm not complaining.  {If I want better software, I'd rather choose what I want anyway.}  I started this review by noting that I'd been holding out for a high resolution camera with a decent price--I got that and more.  This is the perfect camera for an amatuer like me, and it will tide me over quite well until the price of a 10MP digital SLR gets down to under $400!  And best of all, the pictures of my grandson make a great screensaver slide show!!!","I know nothing about photography, but wanted a camera that had some 'advanced features' but was also very simple to use.  This is that camera.  The picture quality is wonderful at the highest resolution - you won't be disappointed.  Friends that see my pictures over the net (I've never tried to PRINT or DEVELOP any yet, so I can't attest to that - however, I imagine the prints should look exactly the same provided you choose a decent development shop?) usually say first - \"WOW, that picture quality is amazing.\"  When they know the picture is one that I took with a digital camera, I suppose they are trained to think this is going to be a 'so-so image.'<br />In fact, many of the pictures that I take seem to turn out better than the original scene.  I don't know how to describe this, and it may just be b/c I'm not a camera or photo buff, but the camera sometimes seems to add a 'gloss' to the pictures that makes them seem more professional.  Point being, I love the images!<br />As another reviewer said = \"Grab this camera, a camera bag, 8 AA NiMH batteris and a charger, a >=128 MB CF card, some lens addons, a tripod, and a digital photography book, and you've got yourself a relatively complete digital photography setup.\"<br />I purchased all these things for an additional $100 after I got the camera and I do feel now that I have a complete package and ready for any shot.<br />Be warned though - this is not 35 mm and digital cameras won't be for a long time.  You can still tell quite easily the difference in picture type.  That isn't to say, however, that the picture quality is worse, but it is simply *different*.  I wish I could elaborate better.  Personally, I will always prefer being able to take 100's of pictures without worrying about film costs, development costs, etc to knowing that I'm shooting with 35 mm.","I got this camera from OD. It has got nice features. It takes good pictures in low light. I love the macro mode in the camera.<br />It eats battery power. You need plenty of backup when you go on vacation.","I looked for two months comparing many cameras and this rose above all the others in it's market. This is very user friendly and worth every penny. I bought this for my wife on Mothers day and she loves it. Thank you for reading and please help others by keeping all of our write ups short sweet and to the point, most importanly is honesty. Thank you","Now I'm new to photography, but I began with my ideal set of features without looking at what cameras were out there (too many to count). I set pretty high standards for myself. They were:<br />1) 3+ MP<br />2) Great in low-light/no flash situations (i.e. weddings)<br />3) CF Flash 1 & 2 (least proprietary, many uses)<br />4) AA-battery standards (least proprietary, many uses)<br />5) Highly compact/light enough for my pocket<br />6) Point and Shoot<br />7) Manual controls so I can grow into taking pictures<br />8) Swivel LCD (Candid shots that you'd never get otherwise)<br />9) Minimal shutter lag (works like non-digital camera)<br />10) Good Construction<br />11) 10x Optical Zoom<br />12) Optical zoom focus (rotary like professional cameras)<br />13) 640x480+ DV video<br />14) Waterproof<br />15) Made in Japan (best quality control process, I think)<br />16) Camera doesn't limit speed based on brand of memory card<br />17) Nice web sites demonstrating how to use the camera best<br />18) Wireless/Phone connectivity<br />19) Hot shoe<br />20) Lens thread for lens filters<br />21) $350 or less<br />Now, I went to the list. I bought this camera after months of research, comparing all sorts of brands from Sony, Kodak, Olympus, etc. So now, I'll address all the features and how this camera stacks up.<br />1) 4MP: Perfect<br />2) One of best in low-light/no flash; I generally don't like the lighting with flash even on professional cameras. I've gotten great dim pictures of animals sleeping with this. Note: Must be steady [See Recommendations]<br />3) CF Flash 1; That's still good & cheap, but not as fast as CF2.<br />4) 4 AA-battery; A number so heavy, but multi-purpose<br />5) It fits my pocket, but it's a bit heavy with the batteries<br />6) Yup, but I think Sony does a better job with auto mode<br />7) Few cameras have manual and I'm still learning with this. Note: Having a manual mode means that there's a fairly steep learning curve, but fortunately there's auto if needed<br />8) I can't tell you how many candid shots I've gotten with the swivel LCD. It's a must!<br />9) Arg. This camera has lag. Maybe 1-2 seconds worth. No camera for this price seems to minimize this. Maybe in a few years?<br />10) Alright, but batteries/CF door a bit flimsy<br />11) 3x optical zoom so that's just fair<br />12) Uses digital motor to zoom, which is slow. Not available on consumer cameras though.<br />13) 320x280 video mode, 3min max is ok, but even the A70 had 640x480 so this is just bad<br />14) Even with the so-called waterproof case, this is just bad. Just avoid moisture or get an el-cheapo camera for water situations (what I did)<br />15) Yup. Land of the Rising Sun. High QC<br />16) Actually improves based on the memory card<br />17) Yup, there are plenty of sites that demonstrate hot to optimize the manual modes<br />18) Probably not in the near future<br />19) Nope.<br />20) Yes, so I can possibly apply a UV filter or whatnot<br />Recommendations:<br />-Tripod<br />-Rechargeable batteries<br />-256+ CF card, 512MB /1 GB recommended<br /> (I know a lot of people like the 256 MB card, but once you get into this camera, you can finish off a 256 MB card in one night i.e. 200 pictures + 3/4 video clips)","I take alot of photo's, and have had an Olympus for the past 3 years. The Olympus 2.1 has never let me down so I was hesitant to not buy another Olympus. But when I started my search for a 4 Megapixel camera the Canon A-80 caught my attention. Just about every review I read was positive, and it had features no one else had. After I bought this camera I saw what everyone was raving about. The picture quality is second to none. I've taken pictures outside,inside all lighting and even on the auto mode they come out flawless.<br />It has a solid quality feel. The swivel display is super, you'll wonder how you ever got by without one. I was at a concert and took pictures over everyones heads with it. I could never had done it with a standard display.<br />Buy this camera, you won't be disapointed. I'm sure this camera will give anyone years of great photo's. The only things I bought was a camera bag ,256 flash memory card and rechargable batteries. Get those few items and your set to go.","I bought the A80 and it's a great camera. It is so easy to use, I'm relieved. In the past, I've borrowed my dad's ($900. plus Nikon), and my sister's $600. plus whatever) and they took great photos, don't get me wrong, but ease of use did not exist. The A80 is fabulous. I took it out of the box, got it ready and the camera is so self-explanatory, it was great. I had great photos emailed to friends the hour after I got it. One problem was the movie mode didn't have sound. Turned out I got a defective camera, BUT...I called Amazon and they sent me another one right away. I needed it for vacation and they had it to me in two days. They are the best customer service ever. I'm very happy with my A80, and with Amazon. Thank you.","I shopped around for a digital camera for a few months, 4+ megapixels is the way to go, other cameras looked nice but were too pricey, ergonomically awkward or confusing to use.  Not so with this little gem!  The canon A80 has all of the features I wanted, it is small (hand size), easy to use, takes HIGH quality pictures and gives me confidence to experiment and enjoy photography without wasting money on film & developing costs.<br />The A80 is very simple to use, the menus and function screens are navigated with ease.  The camera offers a wide variety of modes for every situation and setting.  The A80 can take movies, landscapes, macros, portraits, high speed action pictures, photo-stitching-panoramas, and many more.  The A80 comes with software for both PC and Mac.  Although I tend to use the iPhoto program that comes with my Mac.<br />I did buy some rechargeable batteries and charger, and a couple extra memory cards.  The A80 uses 4 AA batteries, you should get some Nimh recharge batts as back up.  You might also want an extra memory card, the camera uses Compact Flash (type 1) cards, this type of card is inexpensive compared to other flash storage cards, a 256mb card is a must in my opinion since the A80 is sold with only one 32mb card.<br />The A80's only drawback is that it does not come with a camera bag, it has a camera strap, but no bag, so I had to buy my own.<br />Overall, I have to give this camera 5 stars, it does everything as advertised, and the picture quality is FANTASTIC, simply follow the directions for each type of picture you are taking et voila, HUGE digital prints, the detail is phenomenal!  This camera is worth every penny!  SImply put, this is the best camera I have ever owned.","I have owned this camera for about 4 months now and have shot well over 1000 photos with it.  It's my first digital camera, and it has exceeded all of my expectations for a reasonably priced digital.<br />You see, I'm a film person who prefers his film cameras all manual for the control it gives me.  So, as you can imagine, I have been very skeptical of digital.  I held out for several years before buying a digital camera in part for this reason, and in part because until recently I could not find a digital camera that met my needs at the price I was willing to pay ($300-$400).  The Canon A80 is that camera, and I'm very happy I waited for it.  Since your needs may not be the same as mine, I should explain what I wanted in a digital camera:<br />at least 4 MP<br />full manual controls along with the automatic ones<br />compact size (I take most of my photos while hiking)<br />reasonably rugged and well built (for the same reason)<br />excellent optics and picture quality<br />uses AA batteries<br />good battery life<br />A fairly tall order, but the A80 fits the bill.<br />It's small and fits really well into my hands, making it easy to handle even one-handed.  I considered the Canon S400 and S50, too, but their proprietary battery and less ergonomic shape (and the lack of manual controls on the S400) tipped the balance in favor of the A80, even though the A80 is slightly larger.<br />The A80 takes great pictures on program or automatic settings, but allows full manual control, too.  I have found, to my embarrassment, that I actually use the manual controls rarely (they are rather cumbersome on the A80--lots of buttons to push--but I'm still glad I have them).  Shutter lag is minimal compared to other digital cameras I have tried out, and the automatic focus works very well.  The A80 also takes spectacular closeups in macro mode.  The flip-out LCD has turned out to be far more useful than I expected, and also protects the screen when folded in.  I do not care much about, flash, indoor shots, or moving subjects (I shoot mostly landscapes) so I can't say much about them, except that it is nice to have these capabilities, and I have gotten a few great shots of wildlife with the A80.<br />Battery life is excellent.  I use 1800ma NiMH rechargeable AA batteries in it, and though I have shot all day on more than one occasion (250+ shots), I have not yet run out of power in the field (I always start out the day with a fully charged set of batteries).  The fact that it takes AA size batteries makes for cheaper batteries and greater flexibility when your rechargeable NiMH batteries run out of power and you have no charged  replacements.<br />My only quibble is a tendency to blow out highlights (bright areas) of some photos, and some purple fringing where dark areas meet much brighter areas in a photo.  I understand there are adjustments one can make to avoid both, but I have not yet achieved this level of expertise.<br />In short, this was a great choice for my first digital camera.  I'm having a lot of fun with it and discovering that in some respects digital gives you even more control over your photos than my old all manual Nikon does.  I've found the photo software Canon includes to be quite adequate, though you'll want Photoshop or equivalent for more complex work with your photos.","I have only had this camera for a few days, but have tried to use as many options as possbile to test it out.  It has tons of features that must be for more professional photographers, but perhaps I'll learn how to use them sommetime.<br />It takes great pictures.  The zoom is great, even the digital zoom.  The pictures are clear, all the way to 11X.  On the \"auto\" setting, pictures don't take long to take or save.  I have tried some of the other settings (the ones I don't understand) and they can take a little longer, but it's not that much of a hinderance.<br />I love the flexible LCD.  You can protect it when you want, or have it exposed while taking pics.  It also easy to take those impromptu shots of you and your friends while you are holding the camera because of the flippable LCD.<br />All in all...this is a great camera.  I use to have an Olympus CamMedia 3.2 MP, and I thought it was a great camera, but this one is much better.  Stronger case (metal), better features...just get it.","Canon makes the best digital cameras in this price range, no doubt.  I purchased this beauty before studying in Mexico for three months.  As a student, price was a large factor.  I wanted more than just point-and-shoot.<br />I took 700 photos in Mexico.  The camera never missed a shot.  Photos all come out so perfectly you don't even need ot access the many manual options.  The only manual option I used was the black-and-white, which took black-and-white pictures and gave me control over exposures and the like.  My black-and-white prints look better than my friends', who used 35mm cameras.  My color prints, well I blew a bunch up to 8x10 and they are absolutely perfect, amazing considering I wasn't even using the highest-quality option!<br />I love the swivel-screen.  When traveling alone, you can have the screen on the front of the camera and take a picture of yourself.  It was also helpful for seeing over large crowds.  The camera is NOT heavy, I don't know why so many reviws say that.  It's heavier than other digital cameras, yes, but I like that it feels SOLID.  I have picked up many digital cameras that felt flimsy.  This one is solid metal, very strong.  I love that it uses AA batteries, because if your batteries run out its always easy to find more.  If you use energizer e2 batteries the camera is very light.  Batteries typically lasted me 2-3 weeks, and I was taking hundreds of photos.<br />There are a few cons to the camera.  The screen is hard to see in direct sunlight, and it feels a little too small.  Also, I find that the knob on the top to choose picture-taking options moves too easily - I often moved it unknowingly and then took a photo on the wrong setting.  I also find that the auto-focus often focuses on the wrong object.<br />Still, I would buy this camera again.  My friends' cameras simply did not compete.  I had so many more options, and my auto-shoot's pictures were just better.  When we compared prints, you could not tell mine were from a digital camera but there's had imperfections.<br />Buy this camera.  If not this one, stick with Canon.","I am a mom of a toddler and also a scrapbooker so I wanted a camera that would take excellent pictures.  The Canon A80 is a bit more than I needed~ I am a point-and-shoot person and didn't care to get involved in manual modes.  The Canon is fairly small and easily fits in my diaper bag~ it is a bit heavier than some other cameras but this is due to the fact it takes 4 batteries, which are well worth their weight in battery life.  Even in auto mode I can take excellent pictures~ I've taken close up shots of my pets that just blow me away with how detailed they are.  The colors are gorgeous and true to life.  This is my third digital camera (had Kodaks before) and I can honestly say the quality of the pictures far surpasses the other two cameras I have owned (the CX6330 and the DX4900).<br />I do have a few complaints, though~ first, the flash is a bit TOO powerful.  When I take pictures of my toddler (my main photo subject) I have often gotten shots where her eyes are half-way closed, resulting in a kind of 'drugged out' look.  It was suggested to me to turn off the red-eye reduction (a preflash which could be making the subject blink) and this has helped somewhat, but I still get an occasional 'drunk' look.  I have compensated by staying farther away from my subject and using zoom.  The flash output can be adjusted but ONLY in manual mode, which I find irritating (I think this should be something you can adjust in auto mode as well).  The only other option is to turn off the flash, which is not always possible indoors.<br />My other complaint is the shutter lag~ there is a LONG delay between the time you press the shutter button and when the shot is taken.  This can be avoided if you press the shutter button half-way and do a 'focus lock' first and keep holding it half-way until you are ready to take a picture.  The problem with this is when you have a toddler that is on the move you don't want to be chasing after her and worrying about doing a focus lock; also often you have just an instant to take a picture before a toddler moves her head/walks away/etc and pictures have been lost due to this shutter lag.  While all digital cameras have some shutter lag, the Kodaks I owned were MUCH, MUCH faster than the Canon, with almost no lag whatsoever.  I wish Canon would improve upon this!  If Kodak can do it, I'm sure Canon can.<br />There are a few ways to try to speed up the shutter~ by turning off AIAF autofocus system, turning off red eye reduction, turning off the flash, or going into manual mode (I learned on a camera site how to go into manual mode and program 'snap mode' which has a faster response time)~ however these all can compromise the picture, especially in low-light conditions.  It can result in blurry pictures.<br />Aside from those 2 complaints, I am very happy with my Canon A80.  I've resigned myself to learning the manual stuff so I can have control over the camera~ I know once I am comfortable with the different settings I will probably be able to overcome the issues I've had, however I really would have preferred to stay in Auto mode.  It doesn't make sense to me why in Auto mode you cannot even adjust the color settings (vivid, neutral, etc.), however you can adjust these in the P mode or in manual mode.<br />I seriously considered returning my Canon to get another Kodak b/c of the two issues above, but I honestly find the quality of the A80 far superior to the Kodak line.  I did a ton of research on camera review sites, as well as looked at many picture samples from Pbase Photo, and the Canon just takes breathtaking pictures.  As I'm growing in my knowledge I'm finding I'm taking much better pictures and working through the few problems I've encountered with shutter lag and flash output.<br />Oh, one more thing~ the battery life is outstanding.  I use my camera a lot (!) and I am just in awe at how long it lasts before I have to recharge the batteries.  It is simply amazing!<br />All in all, I think this is an excellent camera for both beginners and pros alike.","In a nutshell....this is a great camera. Let me start by saying that I am a \"film\" person so was skeptical to begin with about digital. I have tried many (friends, work, etc...), shopped around, looked at more and finally just bought this one and what a buy it was! I cannot tell you how happy I am with this camera. Easy to use, takes a terrific picture and has made taking pictures a whole lot more fun. Do yourself a favor an get this camera. Great buy for the money!","I've been very satisfied with Amazon.com and my Canon digital camera. Amazon's prices were lower than the local stores with a great deal on a memory card too. I received the camera very shortly after I ordered it.<br />The Canon Powershot A80 has great resolution and holds tons of pictures. I love how the screen rotates out for better viewing. The camera has many manual features for the more advanced photographer. The photos upload quickly to the computer and is very simple for anyone who isn't very computer literate.<br />The only complaint I have is that the flash seems to be a bit bright at times. Many peoples' eyes in pictures are squinted because of the bright flash. I might try taping a piece of tissue paper over the flash. But that's it. Everything else seems to be great. I'm very happy with the camera.","Disclaimer: Before I begin let me say that I love taking pictures but am a total amateur and will not be able to explain the fine technical diffrences.<br />I have had an A80 for 4 months now. I got it for a cheaper price than Amazon through bizrate.com at a NJ camera store. I made sure it wasn't one of the bait and switch stores through user rating and reviews. They did ask me to buy accessories but when I declined they just sent me the camera the next day. I had an A70 for about 8 months before I got caught in heavy rain and the camera CCD was damaged due to the water after giving me about 3000+ good pictures. So I went to buy another camera and thought of buying another brand and model. However after some heavy research I came back to Canon as I love the Photostitch and the other manual and photo modes. So I bought the A80 and here is the difference between A80 and A70 through the eyes of an amateur.<br />A80 is heavier than the A70 and the corners are less well rounded. Its squarer and is surprisingly heavier than A70. But you get adjusted soon and I like the weight as I don't carry it in my pocket anyway.<br />The plastic parts of A 70 have been replaced by metal in A 80 which explains the weight and it has a more solid feel to it and is more resistant to scratches.<br />The flip out screen is a good addition and I have twisted it in another angle about 25% of the times. For example when you want to capture a group of people from the outside. Then you can hold it above your head to get the center of the group and still compose your shot as you can see the screen. Or when you are taking pictures of kids and don't want to neel on the ground. You can just lower the camera in your hand and twist up the screen. The same goes for landscapes. It does allow for more creativity in composing shots.<br />The rubber flap which covered the outlets for your cable has been reduced to about 1/5th the size. And there is a better navigator button which allows you to scroll through pictures/menu etc. In the A70 the 4 buttons at the back also serve as the navigator buttons. Now they need not.<br />And the on/off button which was very flush with the top in A70 is more raised in the A80 and more easily found in dim light. The picture modes have not changed much over the A70 except there are now 2 more modes C1 and C2 which can be customized to your liking.<br />The biggest difference however is in the 9 point AiAf autofocus. I see that the indoor pictures taken by A80 on Autofocus are 'harsher' than the A70. Outdoors I do not see a big difference and the pictures taken in daylight are as clear as the A70 but the indoor pictures are quite different. The white is whiter than it was in pics taken with A70 in autofocus, if you know what I mean.<br />Overall, I like the A80, especially as I got it for only a few bucks more than what I bought the A70 for (from Amazon). But I haven't quite figured out how to use it to its full advantage especially indoors. And I do prefer Canon A80 over what was available in the same price range.","I can't say enough about how much I've enjoyed this camera.  I actually lost it for two days (note: don't put digital cameras in checked luggage) and decided that I'd use the airline settlement to upgrade to a better camera.<br />After comparing to many of the 5MP cameras in the $500+ range, I realized that the A80 matched those cameras feature-for-feature in nearly every category (except MP of course)!  Just when I had resolved to re-purchase the very same camera, the airline found my bag and I got my killer camera back (everybody wins)!<br />My favorite high-end features:<br />* Picture stitching (make one HUGE picture by combining several individual photos) right on the camera<br />* Multi-point auto-focus - note that you need to pay attention to where the camera tells you it focused -- you may need to adjust your shot<br />* Corrections for white-balance, EV compensation<br />* Nice tight macro shots!<br />* It's not a digital camcorder, but with a large memory card, the camera takes a pretty decent full-motion video<br />and most importantly ...<br />* Put the dial on \"P\" and it takes perfect pictures 99.9% of the time!<br />Other features I like:<br />* The folding LCD is great - protects it from scratches, allows you to hold the camera at funny angles but still be able to see your shot<br />* Uses 4x AA batteries.  You can find AAs just about anywhere, and you don't have to carry around a charger!<br />* Heavier construction makes for a nice solid feel -- doesn't feel cheap.<br />Minor gripes:<br />* The little viewfinder is pretty much worthless as far as I'm concerned.  You just gotta use the LCD.<br />* People have complained in other reviews about shutter lag -- it's true, but you can learn to compensate for it.  Keep in mind taking a picture with this camera is a two-step process:<br /> 1. Frame up the subject and hold the button half-way down to get the picture and the focus set<br /> 2. Once #1 happens, push the button the rest of the way down to fire the shutter -- it's almost instant.<br />I've decided the delay with this camera is the focus time and/or exposure calculation.  Once you've got the green focus boxes on the LCD, you're ready to rip!<br />* The multi-point auto-focus sometimes makes \"interesting\" choices in what to focus on.  If you have a tough time getting it to focus on the right thing, you can always scale back to center auto-focus and force it to focus on what you want it to<br />* The LCD is great, but they really coulda made it just a little bigger ...<br />Your first three purchases after this camera should be:<br />1.  LowePro z10 camera bag.  Perfect fit and it only costs about $10<br />2.  A 256 MB (or larger) CF card.  Save the 32 for trips to the drug-store when you order prints<br />3.  8 rechargeable NiMH batteries.  It's a little bit of an investment, but you can take TONS o pix (and review 'em over and over) on one charge!","Have spent quite sometime reading from the net on which camera to buy, finally made up my mind and got my A80, worth every cents spent. Image quality is excellence. Great features. Only thing is the lack of RAW option, but personal view, I think it has enough features to play / explore / experiment or simply to learn photography with it.","Took the Powershot A80 on vacation and took over 200 pictures on the first set of batteries.  There have been absolutely no dissappointments with this camera, outdoor, indoor, portrait, every picture is great. I could not recommend it more.","I had to purchase a digital camera in a hurry for a school project.  This camera was easy to use.  The pictures were easy to load into my computer.  I especially liked how it takes regular AA bateries.  Rechargeable batteries are recommended.","I will not address photographic quality because I believe that it is very good, but I was confronted with a significant, in my opinion, constructional defect. Namely, I found the CF card door being very flimsy. My camera was in my leather bag, but under what I consider a very small impact, the CF card door cracked. So, think twice before buying this camera, especially if you have young children around!","For a camera in this price range it offers quite a number of features, including those found on the more powerful G series. While it's probably too big to fit comfortably in a shirt pocket, it is nonetheless a lot lighter to carry around than the G series.<br />I've taken a large number of shots with this camera, and I have been pleased with the results. The quality is very good, the only problem is that jpeg compression tends to obscure minute details, and it is missing the RAW/uncompressed images options. That is not much of a problem until you start to do a lot of editing of the photos, and each successive save as a jpeg results in further image degradation. This is exacerbated by the fact that the unit has a weak flash which means you'll use the higher ISO settings, leading to the use of noise reduction software.<br />The pros of the camera:<br />Relatively small<br />many G series/EOS series features<br />excellent picture quality<br />conservative ISO levels<br />relatively \"smart\" camera in auto mode<br />flip-out LCD<br />Lens add-ons<br />The cons:<br />no flash hotsync, so can't use a good external flash (granted some good flash units would probably approach the cost of the camera itself)<br />smallish LCD, though not a problem for me<br />Tight viewfinder, I actually find it hard to use the viewfinder to compose shots, since it is not TTL<br />manual focus is a hassle<br />movies limited to 320x240; the A70 can do 640x480<br />optical zoom limited to 3x<br />limited to f4.9 at full telephoto<br />poor auto-white balancing except in daylight, but it does have a custom function for those who absolutely need white to be.. well white.<br />bundled photo editing software is very limited. I think even Jasc Paintshop Pro would've been a better choice, if not some Photoshop variant.<br />minor quibble:<br />no raw image capture mode<br />There are reports that Canon cameras tend to blow out the highlights, but the fix is to use center-weighter metering instead of full metering.<br />Grab this camera, a camera bag, 8 AA NiMH batteris and a charger, a >=128 MB CF card, some lens addons, a tripod, and a digital photography book, and you've got yourself a relatively complete digital photography setup.<br />If you desire more SLR features without the hassle of interchanging lens, there are the Powershot G3 and G5 from Canon; C-5060 and E-10/E-20N from Olympus; F717 from Sony; and the Coolpix 5700 and 5400 from Nikon. The current crop of 8 MP cameras suffer from increased noise and image distortion, according to recent reviews.","i was initially set on buying the canon powershot A70, but that was until the A80 came out. upon seeing its vari-angle flip-out LCD plus 4.0 megapixels (compared to the A70's 3.2 MP), i was SOLD on the A80. i got the camera for christmas 2003 and i've been really satisfied with it. i love the flexibility the LCD gives you-- i've been able to take great angled shots which i probably would have trouble doing on a camera without a flip-out LCD. the LCD may be a little small compared to other cameras but the display is very sharp and that makes up for its lack of size. the flip-out LCD feature is also very convenient as it protects the monitor from dust and scratches when it's not in use as you can fold the monitor against the camera body.<br />image quality is superior-- one of the best i've seen for digital cameras in its class. the images are very clear and sharp. i use the camera for everything-- the lowest resolution (640x480) for wacky, fun shots with my friends, and the highest res (2272x1704) for graphic design work (i'm a student graphic designer)-- posters, magazines, layouts, webdesign.<br />the powershot A80 is a great deal too-- rarely would you find so much powerful features for a camera in this price range. actually, when people see my camera, they assume it's really expensive but when i tell them how much i bought it for, they're really amazed. i guess they're not expecting a camera with superior features selling for much less than what they expected.<br />all in all, i'm very happy with the A80. the only negative thing about it that comes to mind is the lack of battery power indicator. i use rechargable NiMh batteries that last me a long time (i went on a whole-day shoot with the LCD turned and at the end of the day, the batteries were still going strong), but i don't really know when they're running low on power until a little blinking battery icon shows up on the LCD display-- a minute or two before the camera dies on me. it would've been nice if canon put a battery life indicator so you aren't caught unaware.","Pros: Great pictures and quality made<br />Cons: none<br />Ease of Use: Excellent - It is easy to use right out of the box<br />Durability:  Excellent - Virtually indestructible<br />Portability:  Excellent - Tiny, and always functional<br />Photo Quality:  Excellent - Pictures are professional grade<br />Lighting Conditions:  Use inside & outside, with or without a flash. (The flip out LCD is a plus for overhead shots)<br />I would recommend this camera primarily for anyone.<br />Comments:<br />This is an amazing camera that never fails to come up with a great picture. I am far from a pro. but this camera's function and quality enable me to take shots that look good anyway.<br />It even has a quality mic. that allows you to record and add sound to a picture and the software that comes with it is the best I have seen yet! (Thank you Canon)<br />I upgraded from the Canon A70,(sold it at Amazon Marketplace),mainly for the fold out LCD and I am very happy I did so.<br />Also,I teamed the A80 up with the Canon i860 printer and the results are out of this world!!","You just got to hand it to Canon to come up with the best package cameras in the market today. The A60, A70 and A80 provide huge feature sets at a very competetive price.<br /><br />Regarding the camera, my A80 let me just say that it performs admirably.I was initially choosing between the A80 and also the excellent  Canon S45, but decided on the A80 for the foll reasons:<br />1. Superior handling - the A80 just FELT better to hold in my hand, due to its protuding grip, than the S45. However, i recommend you try both cameras out before you buy. You might prefer the S45 instead.<br />2. Flip-out-and-twist LCD - The A80's real ace over the S45. Initially, i thought it to be a gimmick, but i found out that the LCD is really useful in everyday situations, e.g. taking photos of kids from a low level without breaking your back. BUT, the A80's LCD is also a bit dissapointing, as it has only a 1.5\" size and 67k pixels, compared to the S45's 1.8\" and 100k+ pixels. See for yourself, and decide if you are comfortable with the A80's LCD. I wear glasses, but have no problems with it.<br />So the choice is yours. Both cameras are priced about same right now, i think.<br />Back to the A80, here are its pros and cons:<br />Pros:<br />1. Good handling and feel, Sure , it may not be as small as a Pentax S4, but come on, the camera is more 'prosumerly' oriented. Is small size is what you look for, you'll HAVE to give up on many advanced manual controls.<br />2. Good quality images. People in forums have complained about purple fringing and excessive red-eye on the A80. I find a bit of fringing too but it is not that noticable. And redeye? I've seen none of it even with flash shots.<br />3. AA batteries seem to run on and on and on...... 2100 mAh cells lasted about a week with 30 or shots a day with LCD turned on.<br />4. NO E-18 errors which plagued the Canon A60 and A70!<br />5. Flip-out-and-twist LCD. Really useful.<br />Cons:<br />1. people say the the CF card door is flimsy, but in fact I find the Battery compartment door to be even more flimsy. I wonder when the springs will break off.<br />2. Shutter lag: This plagues almost all comsumer digicams. I've learnt how to handle it thought, by adjusting my timing, but it still annoys me.<br />3. A bit low quality LCD as i mentioned earlier. Some of you may find it to be a problem. It works fine with me.<br />So, all I can say is that the Canon A80 makes a very strong case for itseldf in the 4 megapixel comsumer camera market. However, if price is a hassle, you can also try out the 2MP A60 or 3MP A70, good performing cameras in their own right. In the 4Mp category, also be sure to check out the A80's competitors i have listed below:<br />1. Canon S45<br />2. Nikon 4300<br />3. Pentax S4<br />4. Kodak DX 6490<br />5. Canon S400<br />6. Sony P92 ( a 5MP model)<br />7. Canon S50 ( also 5MP)<br />For the Canon A80, i recommed the following accesories, which should be definitely bought:<br />1. 128 MB ( at least) Cf card. 256 MB is a good size.<br />2. 2 sets of rechargable Ni-Mh batteries, (each set having 4 batteries)of about 2000 mAh and a fast charger.<br />3. Camera pouch/bag. The Lowepro Z10 which i bought for the A80 provides a snug fit.","This is an amazing camera that never fails to come up with a great picture.  I am far from a pro. but this camera's function and quality enable me to take shots that look good anyway. It even has a quality mic. that allows you to record and add sound to a picture.  The only gripe I have with it is that in order to actually use it for more than a day you have to purchase expensive rechargable batteries.","This is a my first digital camera.  I did a reasonable amount of research (prices, reviews, features, etc.) before purchasing and this camera has exceeded all my expectations.  With a new baby and family around the country, I needed a digital camera to quickly share all those new baby pictures.  The pictures are highly detailed at 4 megapixel.  I also was looking a camera with movie-making features, and this one easily makes movies (I made a movie before opening a manual).  I also bought rechargeable batteries and a battery charger and a 256M memory chip as others have recommended which have been very helpful.  My regular batteries started fading after a week of use and I have never exceeded 72M on the memory card.  Another feature I found to be cool is the panoramic feature, which was easy to use with the included PC software.  Some reviewers have mentioned the flimsy memory card cover, but that isn't an issue for me - I never remove the memory card.  I thought the price was reasonable. I believe this A80 is newer model, and I didn't want to have it be outdated in a few months.<br />Highly recommended!  5 STARS!!!","Canon has brought out excellent lenses and quality based cameras in the past. The Canon PowerShot A80 is another great advancement. The A80 is produced with Canon's latest DIGIC image processor and iSAPS technology; a technology that is exclusive to Canon. Producing clear cut images and rich colours, the A80 is a great digital still camera for any individual. Today Bytesector takes a look at the new features and aesthetics Canon has put into the A80......full review @ Bytesector.com","I did a lot of research prior to purchasing the Canon A80 digital camera.  I read a lot of reviews, many right here at Amazon.  I also looked into lens quality and the quality of electronics.  I read consumer report's test results.  The bottom line - as with most things in life \"you get what you pay for\".  You can find cameras with more than 4MPs, however, my research indicated that the picture quality may not be as good as Canon's 3MP A70.  Digital picture quality is a mixed bag of tricks.  MPs are one part of the \"picture\" when determining what quality a digital camera is going to deliver.  I will give you my advice in each of four major purchasing catagories below.<br />Retailer:  If you take nothing more from this review, please listen to what I have to say here.  The cheapest price is not always the best deal!!!!  In fact I would go so far as to say that the cheapest price may be the worst deal.  While searching for the best price on an A80 I called four of the cheapest retailers listed at sites like Pricegrabber.  EVERY store I called was either out of cameras (surprise, surprise) or the price quoted was only good if the camera was purchased in a overpriced package.  The \"cheap\" store would then proceed to try and sell you what \"they had\" - not what you wanted.  After four attempts at the cheapest price, I went back to Amazon and found a price of $359.00.  This price was $50.00 or more than the cheapest price, but they told me if the camera was in stock and gave me a delivery date.  I actually purchased through an Amazon affiliate.  I received the product on time and in good condition.<br />Camera brand:  I touched on this above.  Again, the cheapest product is not always the best buy.  Don't be fooled into believing that MPs alone or a fancy zoom equate to good picture quality.  If you don't plan on spending in the $300 dollar range, plan on mediocre results.  Now...many people will argue that a $100 camera will deliver good results - it depends on why you are buying digital.  If you are buying digital to replace conventional cameras, why would you want anything but great quality.  You cannot go back in time and take another picture of your child at age 2.  I went digital to begin replacing my conventional cameras. Canon is not the only good brand, but it certainly rises to the top of the heap in the quality for dollars catagory.  I would stick to companies that make photography their business - Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Minolta, ect.<br /><br />Camera model:  Do your research and have a clear picture in your mind of what you need a digital camera for.  A digital camera is like a computer - it's great when it works, but a nightmare when it doesn't.  Again, don't always look to the selling price as the determining factor in selecting a model.  If you stick with a major manufacturer you are less likely to get junk or poor service, regardless of the model you pick.<br />Many people stress out over the choice of an A70 or A80.  I don't think you make a bad purchase with either product.  I decided that, for an increase of $80, it was worth the upgrade to the A80.  Your own budget may make this decision for you.<br />Price:  I discussed this many times over.  Don't let anyone convince you that a $100 dollar camera takes the same quality pictures as a $300 camera.  Buy smart and buy for the long run.  Buy quality and service.  Do your research - read Amazon reviews and search the web for independent reviews.  Pick up a Consumer Reports magazine.<br />My opinion of the A80 - Well...after about a week of playing with it and reading the manual(I'm not finished yet) I believe I purchased a quality product with features typically found on high-end cameras.  A word of caution - don't fool yourself into believing that you can move from \"point-and-shoot\" to this camera without first educating yourself.  I think many people foolishly believe that perfect pictures can be taken by simply pushing a shutter release button - not so in the real world.  If you educate yourself about the functions of camera parts and read Canon's manual carefully, I believe you will find the A80 to be an excellent product.<br />I hope this helped.","My fiancee bought this camera for me for Christmas, and after 5 days, I am absolutely baffled at how I ever got by without it!  This is plain-and-simple the best digital camera I've ever tried, and it is all I need and more.  If you're looking for a HIGH QUALITY digicam, and don't mind spending a little more money, the A80 is definitely for you.  4 megapixels, optical zoom, enough control over you photos to make a photophile out of anyone!  Great job Canon!","I'm cheap, but I don't buy cheap junk... I just look for quality deals. After weeks of research, reading reviews and going to stores to look at digital cameras, I had no doubt about purchasing the A80. I really enjoy photography but my wife doesn't, so our main concern was to find a camera that would be simple to use for her, yet still allow me some freedom in composition. Unlike a lot of gadgets out there, I WILL use every feature on this camera. Compared to my old Fuji (digital), which I really liked, this camera is faster, a lot more powerful, the pictures are great, and if they're not, the camera will tell you what's wrong with it (histogram), so you can make adjustments and take your shot again.<br />The only complain I can make about this camera is that the rubber cover for the USB/DC connection on the side of the camera is rubber and it is always sticking out. I'll probably just end up pulling the darn thing off.<br />I think Canon really got ripped off on this deal. Either that or they really know how to do business, because they have one very happy customer who will probably come back again.","This camera is more than I could ever want. It has full manuel controls and a 4 MP resolution. The flip out LCD is not a gimmik, it protects the smallish screen and allows you to put it at different angles so glare isn't a problem. The picture quality is exellent, and it is priced well. One note, though, get a camera case and rechargebles for this camera. Ni-MH battaries cost 1.5 cents per 100 photos while alkalines cost $2.20 per 100 photos (according to consumer reports).","I never write reviews, I just pick up my products and use them!  I'm making an exception now for not to do so will be (1) a great injustice to Canon Powershot A80 and (2) a great injustice to prospective consumers, who like me just a few weeks ago, shopping for a digital camera. I've had this camera for 3 weeks, I've taken over 600 pics and I just get dazzled by the quality of the pics, the ease of use of this camera, and its portability.  My son is only 7 years, he takes pictures like a pro!!  I'm still in the learning phase of this camera, and I'm yet to discover anything bad about it.<br />The pros; ease of use, different shooting modes including complete manual mode, flip LCD(a dynamite; you don't have to keep the camera at eye level to  get a good shot and it prevents the lcd from scratch!), crisp image, customizable my camera setting.<br />The cons; for me, only the 4 battery usage which makes it slightly heavy, maybe canon can find a way to reduce it to 2.  The cons I've read from some other reviews include:<br />1. LCD not large enough .... I say get real, its only for preview, not a theatre screen!<br />2. Power cord and battery charger not included ...... get real, then the price will approach $500 and you will whine!<br />3. CF card case appears flimsy ..... lies, lies, lies, unless you're expecting it to be made of concrete walls!<br />My advice; you want a super camera at budget level, you can't go wrong with A80, if money is not a worry check out Canon G3 or G5.  However, to really enjoy this camera, you definitely need to get a power cord, rechargable batteries with a battery charger and CF card of at least 256MB.  Want to be adventurous, then get other accessories like a tripod stand, accessory lens and an underwater case!!","Had it for a few days and it has fulfilled all the criteria of what I was looking for except one (but we get to that later).<br />I wanted a 4MB camera with a good lens and a brand with a good reputation for good pictures. I also wanted an automatic camera, but one which I could control everything manually if I wanted. I also didn't want to have to worry about lens scratches or LCD scratches. I wanted a camera that could fit into a jacket pocket. Finally, I wanted a rechargeable Lithium battery.<br />I have a Canon point and shoot film camera and was always impressed with the quality. As long as you are not getting into German lenses like Leica and Zeiss, Canon and Nikon are the best. I happen to be partial to the Canon but it is a preference thing.<br />Canon has been tinkering with digital models for sometime so I figured they worked out all the kinks. And so far it's been great. The image quality is fantastic. I bought it for a magazine project and plan to blow up images to 8x10. I have been in publishing long enough to know what I have seen so far is going to look very good blown up. For vacation shots, etc. it is all you could want.<br />But one should not mistake this camera for a vacationers point-and-shoot. It can be that, but if you know a little about photography, you can get some creative, unique and professional looking results from this model. It takes some learning because there are sub menus and settings but the basic principals of photography are intact.<br />The lens folds away when the camera is off and the swing out LCD snaps, face in, to the body. This is the only model I know that has this and I read a lot of reviews where people were bothered about their LCD getting all messed up.<br />All the online reviews about this camera (not just Amazon but CNET and others) are excellent (pretty much the case with most Canon models) and the price is right in there with the competition.<br />I just wish the batteries were rechargeable like on other Canon models. Everyone knows these things gobble batteries. But realizing the rest of the camera was what I wanted, I figured some rechargeable AAs from Radio Shack would take care of the problem. Of course, I have the usual complaints about the small memory card but every camera has that problem. Memory is so cheap, when will the manufacturers figure out that their customers want more?","We recently took this camera on vacation to Disney with us and we loved it! The only complaint I would have is that it does not take good night pictures you might as well forget using it at night, the flash makes no difference. Even if you do get a picture that comes out light enough , the eyes are always bright red! Other than that very easy to use, great size, has an awesome 20 second movie feature also. We would hightly recommend this camera......lots of times it will go on sale with a free 64m update.","A80 is a great digital camera. From other reviews, you might have read its great features. I would like to address some issues that were mentioned in other reviews:<br />1. Weight and Size:<br />Depending on which digital camera you used before: if you used a heavy one before, this one is as light as a feather. But, if you used a \"credit card sized\" one, this A80 will be big and heavy. A80 is not very light, but not heavy at all. It fits nicely in a lady's palm. It will not fit into a shirt pocket. What'd you expect for a 4 Megapix camera?<br />2. Speed:<br />Not as fast as a SLR, but among the fastest group in digital cameras. It can be easily controled...another plus.<br />3. Media:<br />Compact Flash is the mainstream. Olympus uses XD. There is hardly any card readers for XD media. Although Olympus also produces great cameras, I don't want to touch XD since I'll also be using CF for my PDA and MP3 players.<br />4. Power saving function:<br />A70 has a bad function: the power saving function cannot be controled by the user. If you turn on the camera and not use it for a while, it will turn off automatically. A80 corrected this by putting in another function for you to turn the power saving on (not off!). You will never have to worry about it.","Well I originally had the A70 which i loved - perfect pictures, vivid colours, great focus and all in all a great cam... well worth the price and way better than competitiors ! but it got stolen so i decided to look at some competitors...<br />(...)P>Now I have the new A80. The specs are available online, so i wont describe them. But I must say I love the more compact design and the swivel display, which tucks in neatly when you arent using the cam. You will not appreciate this until you realize the amazing number of scratches your display gathers over a period of time. Really neat... Yes, its heavy (like the A70) but i guess a small price to pay for the brilliant snaps that it takes...<br />so all in all a great buy for anyone..... Am yet to see a better cam in this range...  :)","After too many battery-busting Olympus digital cameras, my husband (a former professional photographer) and I (all thumbs) switched to the Canon A80. He likes the flexible LCD, so that he doesn't have to use the tiny viewfinder and can even compose from chakhra level (he claims the pictures come out better). I like the fact that I got nearly 100 shots off of one set (4) AA batteries and that the image quality is excellent.","There are many cameras on the market today. By saying that this is the BEST, is saying too much. This is an excellent camera and there are others that are on par. Just like in sports there is not ONE great athlete but many great athletes. I have owned this camera for 2 weeks now. I am a beginner at photography. I don't know how to adjust the shutter speed or what ISO is. It doesn't matter I will learn. This camera is full of features for beginner to vetran.<br />Weaknesses from other posts:<br />Flimsy memory cover<br />Small LCD<br />Poor images<br />Wrist strap<br />Must buy batteries and more memory<br />Camera is heavy<br />1.)Duh of course you need to get rechargable batteries and a recharger and more memory. What do you think you are buying? A CAMERA, any camera you buy accesories not included. This would only jack the price up and with so many aftermarket parts consumers would rather choose thier own extras. I baught the 128mb cf card and the case with recharger for $100 extra. Oh well<br />2.) The compact Flash case is not flimsy, IT SNAPS IN PLACE just fine.<br />3.) Camera is heavy!! LOL this isn't a pocket cam. This is a 4.0 MP CAMERA, its got b*lls what do you expect some lightweight crap that can't take good pictures. Stop whining and go lift some wieghts or something.<br />4.) NO neck strap. I agree a neck strap would be nice. Again you are buying a CAMERA, don't expect extras tacked on without a price jump.<br />5.) Small LCD. That is the best one yet. You gotta be kidding me. The LCD is .2 to .3 of an inch smaller than other competitors. Can you really tell the difference? WHY did you buy a digicam??? SO you can take your pictures and put them on the computer to look at. So you can take multiple shots of the same thing and not worry, cause you can take 1000 pics and still have enough room. SO you can take your pics to a computer and ALTER them and PRINT them. DUH, an LCD is just to get an IDEA of what it will look at. NO LCD can give you a a full blown up picture. Stop saying it is to small. LOL<br />I think this camera was well worth my money. The included software is decent. IF you like to manipulate your photos get Adobe or a better phot publisher.<br />PICS LOOK SWEET. READ YOUR MANUAL BEFORE YOU WHINE ABOUT PICTUREs looking bad.<br />Awesome camera go buy it. It isn't the top of the line and it isn't at the bottom but it perfect if you don't want to go broke and if you want to PUBLISH TIGHT LOOKING PICS> Thank you ; )","Had the A80 for 2 days. This is my first experience with a Digital camera, and I chose it after reading the reviews here. It took me 10 minutes to plug in the 256M SimpleTech card (bought separately), and the 4 batteries, and to start taking pictures.<br />Downloading pictures to my Windows XP based PC took no time. Just connect it to the A80 (USB Port) and the PC automatically connects and asks you if you want to download pictures. Very easy. If you have a Windows 2000 or Win 98 based PC, I think you have to load the software provided.<br />I still need to read the manual to check the various settings and to be able to use all the features. Cannot compare to other cameras, since it is my first experience; but so far I have no complains.<br />The quality seems great. Made in Japan.","Great camera.  Good solid feel in the hands and the photos look great. I upgraded from the A70 and I'm glad I did.  I love the swivel screen - it's really useful.<br />Pros:<br />Feels solid.<br />Great photos.<br />Menu easy to navigate.<br />Swivel screen excellent (but a bit small).<br />Tons of manual controls.<br />Cons:<br />A bit heavy.  This camera is almost the same size as the A70, but it's significantly heavier.  Too heavy for most pockets in my opinion.<br />LCD a bit small.  But this is not a huge issue in my mind. It's very clear and the swivel is great.<br />Lag time a bit long.  You have to wait an extra second for the camera to actually take after you press the button.  However, I think the lag time is about average compared to other cameras that I've used.<br />Despite my negatives, it's a great camera that I highly recommend.<br />Dec 29, 2003... I wanted to add a bit more... I just got back from a two week vacation in Central America.  This camera did great! The quality of the photos is excellent.  The battery life is great.  I brought two sets of rechargeables  - the first set lasted 10 days and next set is still going strong.  It traveled well, it is sturdy... The more I use this camera the better it gets.","This nice little camera does everything the G3 or G5 does, in half the size.  It does not have a hotshoe, but that is no problem when you consider the size.  It is fast, light, sturdy, and easy to use.<br />It takes great pictures and for the price...it is hard to beat.","This canon A80 is a great digital - producing great pictures and the swivel LCD viewfinder is handy. The manual contols also give this camera more flexibility than just a point and shoot camera. The camera is small though on the heavier side with the batteries but I like the design and that later I can add a zoom lens. Its a great little camera for its price and it beats all the previous power A's in its class with its new design and 4 megapixels!! Cool camera and alot of potential for learning digital photography!!","Well, I've been a purist 35mm SLR user for a while now and the expense of getting films developed was getting tiresome.  After 2 months of research, online, in stores, borrowing various other types of camera I've finally plunged into the world of digital with the A80 and it's been worth the wait.  I can't see how digital can improve anymore.  I had narrowed the selection down to the A80 and the S50 (DSLR not necesarily being out of my price range, but more than I was willing to commit to for the first digital).  The S50 and A80 are very comparable, but I chose the A80 for the following reasons:-<br />1) It felt better to hold, as a right hander, the grip is very comfortable, the S50 felt like holding a brick, no ergonomics.<br />2) Easier Controls.  The menu controls are more intuitive and seem sturdier than those of the S50.  The A80's 4way button is a lot larger and easier to use than the S50's 'nubbin' along with the other buttons.<br />3) The flip out screen.  While at first I thought it was 'gimmicky' it has proved to be a very useful feature, enabling excellent framing at angles other than eye level.<br />4) AA batteries.  Need I say more???  Much more practical.<br />5) I wasn't so sure about the sliding lens cover on the S50.<br />The only things that made me even consider anything else:<br />1) 4.0 Megapixels.  I was worried that the 4.0 megapixels wouldn't cut it for enlargements, but I've just had a 10x8 printed on the 2nd highest resolution setting and it's perfect!  I have no doubt I'll be able to go up to 11x14 if necessary.<br />2) RAW format.  OK so now I know that I can enlarge as much as I can with the A80, I'm not worried about being able to record in RAW format.<br />3) The S50 has a slightly larger screen, but the A80's flip screen more than makes up for it's SLIGHTY smaller size..<br />P.S.  The A80 can record video in NTSC and PAL, useful for me with relatives on both sides of the pond<br />I'm very happy with my A80 and would highly recomment it for first time and experienced digital users.....  Good price too.","Canon A70 was the biggest hit since it hit the shelves.<br />So everyone had high expectations about Canon A80. I think everyone should be more than satisfied with Canon's new model. If A70 was the best compact camera in it's class, then A80 is the best of the best. If you try the camera I am sure you will agree with me.<br />I don't want to talk too much about the techical issues, you can read it on the official pages and on several digicam review sites.<br />Let's talk about what made me return to Canon, may be it can help you decide if you are new to digital photography or just have a dc of another brand and cannot decide.<br />I had the following cameras in order: Canon A40, S40, S400 then switched to Minolta F200 and finally returned to Canon A80.<br />I would like to explain to you why I went from one to another and why I think that A80 is the best of all.<br />First, I need an entry level quality digital camera at a low price, I got the A40. Then I would have liked more megapixels in a more compact metal body, I got the S40. Then I went for a subcompact light weight dc with brand new technology (DIGIC) and fast performance (S400). Then I realized that I miss manual controls and need sharper pictures and got a Minolta F200. Finally, realized that F200 has a very high battery consumption and an extremely high noise even at ISO100. I bought an A80 this week for several reasons: I saw some pics and used some cameras of differend types, and think that Canon is the BEST in the compact middle-range category. All the reviews and tests I've read about A70 was positive, so I had no doubt that A80 will be even better. One thing I was unsure about is the quality of the LCD on A80. S400 had sharper and darker LCD, but A80's is still better than average and I think satisfies most people. Don't bother with the resolution of the LCD if you read different numbers on web pages, it is nice and clear.<br />The flip-out and twist LCD is a big advantage to others: not only you can use the LCD when shooting over people's head or on the floor, but the monitor can be easily protected from scratches. I can't explain how big this advantage is till you see and try it yourself. Good work Canon!<br />If you know Canon digicams, then you know how fast are Canons. A80 is no exception, this is by far the fastest camera I used beside my S400. If it is up to Canon, you won't miss an important shot!<br />And there are all the things you've already read about: 4MP,3x optical zoom, full manual control, AF-Assist lamp (great!) etc, etc. You know it! :)<br />Some questions and answers:<br />- Shall I upgrade from A70 to A80?<br />My answer is: YES. The more megapixel and the new flip-out LCD worth that plus. Also, the construction adds more quality feel to it (there are more metal).<br />- Shall I go for A80 if I have no digicam yet?<br />If you can afford, definitely. But consider that A60 and A70 are also excellent machines when you are on budget.<br />- Shall I change to Canon from a different 3-4-5 megapixel compact digicam?<br />Definitely yes. May be some other cameras are better in some issues than Canon, but all in all Canon makes the best consumer cameras to date. Usability, image detail, low noise, faster than average performance are important things and A80 has it all at a very good price.<br />One very important thing: don't let you fooled by the sharp pictures of Minolta and Fuji. They have a very high noise that are annoying. I tried to remove the noise with some photo editing software, but the result was a washed picture in all cases. Some say that Canon has no sharp pictures. This is true, the competition may be sharper...BUT! you can always add some unsharp mask with the right software and make Canon images look excellent. Unfortunately, you cannot do the opposite with those \"sharp but high noise\" cameras. Keep these in mind always!<br />Another thing: chromatic abberration and blown highlights. Yes, it's there. Not always, but there. And it were there in my S400, S40, A40 and even my Minolta F200 images as well. It is there in almost every compact digital camera. This is NOT an issue, though some are complaining about it continiously. No camera is perfect and no will ever be.<br />Decision is yours. Take it in hand and you'll never want to give it away! :)","Whether you're looking for a professional or amatuer digital this is a great digital camera for the price. In addition to 4 mp capablilties this little marvel also boosts a strong enclosure unlike other digital cameras in it's price range. It's a great value for the price. You can take simple point and shoot photos or play around with the limitless settings to capture the moment. I have not use the panoroma feature but it sounds interesting and I plan on learning how to use it as soon as possible. I just bought the camera yesterday and I was impressed with the level of detail once I view my photos on my pc (you can also connect the camera to your t.v. but I haven't tried this yet).<br />This camera will not replace my 10 year old trusty Minolta automatic/manual camera yet, but once I figure out all the settings it might make some sense to leave the Minolta at home since I'll be able to blow up my photos to a large size.<br />............<br />sample photos taken with the A80.<br />I looked at digital Fugi, Milolta, and Nikon and I loved the A70. The store had sold out (apparently so did many others!) so I had to spend an extra hundred. I'm sure I'll make this money back with the amount of film processing I'll save this holiday. I'm glad I got this camera over its predessor because it comes with the latest USB (faster downloads) as well as the latest compact flash card (32 instead of 16mB) although I bought a 128 (and will probably buy another 128). The 4mp photos require alot of space.<br />I also tried a 30 sec (up to 3 minutes) mpeg and the camera was very intuitive. I took 70 shots in and outdoors and 3 small movies 1 hour after charging my batteries (not included - I bout a 30minute Energizer charger kit). The software for the photos is easy to use. The movie editting software doesn't appear to be that great. I don't plan on recording movies extensively with this camera, but it's nice to know this feature is available if I left my Sony Handycam at home.<br />I look forward to taking many photos with this camera and recommend it to anyone whose looking for a camera that doesn't feel like a toy and will challege any photo enthusiasts out there with its many features and manual controls. To save a hundred go with the A70 - also a great product. The A60 will soon be discontinued I believe."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 2100","amazon_reviews":["Seems to work fine so far.

I'll post a review after I've had time to try out my new camera -- when I finally decide. Still doing research...","I have owned this camera now for 3 years and it still amazes me how great of a little camera it is. By now its considered an old camera but i tell you the truth this camera is such a great point and shoot camera thats its worth getting. Also i will share with you all that it was very difficult to find a replacement for this camera due to the fact that it takes such phenomenal pictures. Its best pictures are taken with a lot of light however so just be aware of that. Highly recommend this great little camera","I got this 2 or 3 years ago, when I was in year 7. I begged and begged my parents for one and they agreed on getting me this - although I was hoping for something more funky looking. But after I had it, I just absolutly loved it! :) It's great!<br /><br />It's very durable. Let me tell you about how I've trashed this so far..<br /><br />-I had my camera in my school bag (without the cover) and somehow the batterie flap broke and couldn't close properly anymore. I had to send it in to get it fixed (1st time)<br /><br />-I slid my camera into my back pocket and I didn't realize that while doing that, the camera had switched itself on. So out the lense came. Then stupidly, (I don't know why I did this.. ) but I sat down. And oops.. I took my camera out of my back pocket. The lense was crooked. And it couldn't close properly. So in it went for service again. And btw, that did not come cheap. (2nd time)<br /><br />Since then I have been handling my camera very carefully. I'm such a klutz!<br /><br />There are some cons though...<br /><br />-reacts a bit slowly now<br /><br />-turn button, which means camera turns on, when sliding into pocket<br /><br />...but I think that it's that way, because of my misshandling.<br /><br />All in all: It's a great camera. And perfect for klutzes. Look what it's been through with me! :)","Reviews of this camera, as late as the Fall of 2004, seem to place the Coolpix 2100 above all its competitors (2 Mpxl, non-SLR).<br /><br />My two complaints: there is no manual focus (but you can use the focus lock, half-depressing the shutter switch, to \"lock in\" a focus range - except in macro mode), and a wimpy flash (really only good to 6-8' (2-2.5 m). A separate flash is the answer here.<br /><br />The battery issue mentioned by others below is troublesome, but not really a big problem. In short, rechargeable batteries are a must, but they tend to carry a lower voltage, which the camera battery meter reads as being \"nearly empty\". So, like a car with a bad fuel gauge, you eventually learn to disregard the \"low battery\" warning, and always carry a backup pair of charged batteries.<br /><br />I've shot - ready for this? - over a hundred flash photos in a row from a single pair of rechargeable AA's. Pretty good lifetime! But the meter claimed they were low after the first 5-10...","I received this camera for christmas. I've never used a digital camera before so I was a little intimidated at first. I soon realized that I didn't need to be intimidated. It is so easy to use and small enough to fit in my pocketbook. I can now take pictures at any time and it is so easy to transfer the pictures onto my laptop. Since getting this camera, I am enjoying taking pictures as well as sharing pictures with my friends and family.","I have been using a Nikon Coolpix 950 (2MP) camera for several years and decided to buy the 2100 as a gift for my wife around 12/2003 from Amazon. I had been satisfied with the quality of photographs for the 950 and am now also satisfied with the 2100. For about 1/6th of the price and less than 1/2 of the size, the quality of the 2100 is nearly identical. As an all-around point-and-shoot for a very good price, the 2100 is a winner. However, my suggestion is to use only disposable or rechargeable Lithium-based batteries and not NiMH.<br /><br />I hesitated writing a review until I could figure out a problem with rechargeable batteries. The disposable CR-V3 lithium battery is excellent and can easily last a few months and a few hundred pictures. Flash recharge time is acceptable (although when you have infants or toddlers who don't sit still it might not be!). But when I used high-capacity (2000 mAh) 1.2V rechargeable NiMH (nickel-metal hydride) batteries, the flash recharge time was poor and it would take many seconds to be able to take the next picture. A low-battery indicator would be displayed too soon even if the batteries had enough of a charge, suggesting that the lower voltage (2.4 V for NiMH versus 3.0 V for the disposable) made it difficult for the camera to sense the true strength of the charge that was left. Even worse, the short shelf life of even fully charged NiMH batteries rendered them almost empty, at least as the 2100 saw them, after two or three weeks of no use so we would have to keep swapping in fully charged batteries. The 2100 did get a firmware upgrade that mentions addressing problems with NiMH batteries, but our camera was shipped with the latest. So after numerous attempts at using various brands of rechargeable NiMH batteries, which is the kind that is popular for digital cameras, I was discouraged.<br /><br />Then I found the \"RCR-V3\" battery on the web, a replacement for the CR-V3 disposable. Thomas Distributing sells a couple brands that will cost upwards to $40 including the charger and shipping. But now I can say it was worth it. With the RCR-V3, the low-battery indicator does not show up prematurely, the flash recharge time is as short as the disposable CR-V3, and the shelf life of the rechargeable is excellent for more than a month. We have the NEXcell brand, but I think any of the brands would work well. Now I highly recommend this camera, as long as it is using lithium based batteries.","I really offer this for someone who wants to buy a party-recording device, or a tiny automatic machine. No manual focus, no manual aperture, but easy-to-use, handy machine. There are some good pre-programmed modes available also. 40-50 pictures can be made with well charged batteries. Good and user-friendly sw also included.","I bought the 2100 to replace a stolen 3MP Sony P-72. I loved the Sony, and the jury is still out on the Nikon. I like the size & feel of the 2100, but find that images often appear \"soft.\" The camera doesn't seem to do as well in bright sunlight, and certain colors, such as magenta & hot pink lose definition. Otherwise, picture quality is good. Though the Nikon is a solid deal at $150, in retrospect, I should have spent the extra money and bought another P-72.","THE NIKON 2100 IS THE EASIEST TO USE I'VE EVER USED, MY WIFE AND I HAVE 4 DIGITAL CAMERAS TOGETHER.WE BOUGHT THE NIKON FOR A DISNEY TRIP FOR THE COMPACT SIZE.THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES(SHARPNESS AND DETAIL) WERE DISAPOINTING,BUT CONSIDERING WE PAID $150.00 AT COSTCO I SUPPOSE IT WAS A GOOD BUY.I JUST WISH I HAD SAID SCREW THE SIZE AND CARRIED MY CANON G3 OR MY OLDER OLYMPUS D-460, BOTH SURPASE THE NIKON FOR PIC QUALITY.","The thing I love most about this camera is that it is small.  It is great for snapshots and party pictures.  If you are an inexperienced photographer or just like taking simple pictures, this camera is for you.  It adjusts light settings and such based on what situation you are in.  It even has guides for where to place people in photos- I personally do not use these but they can be helpful to some people.<br />And, it even plays a cute ringtone when you turn it on! Thumbs up!","There is nothing wrong with the 2100 except for the very noticeable delay between pics. The camera's digital processor takes about 5 seconds after a photo is snapped to ready itself for the next one.<br />Otherwise, the optics, the 3X optical zoom and the 2 megapixel resolution are fine for anything from Internet apps to 8\" x 10\" print enlarging.<br />It is competent, not spectacular, but it gets the job done at an agreeable price point.","There is nothing wrong with the 2100 except for the very noticeable delay between pics.

I was most impressed with the nighttime shots.  Using the nighttime portrait setting, (holding the camera especially still) everything in the picture came out brilliantly--especially the background. Very easy to use, light & small.  I think the Canons have a better user interface, but you can get used to this camera pretty quickly.  It eats up battery life a little more quickly than the Canon, but when you use rechargeables & have spares handy, it's all good.","This is the first digital camera I have ever owned, and I have been very pleased with it.<br />It is very affordable and offers all the basic features necessary for taking everyday photos and enjoying them as prints and on the computer.<br />The camera is small and designed to fit easily in your hand. The controls are easily accessible and easy to understand.<br />The only drawback I hace noticed is that the battery life is a little on the short side. However, I bought a 4-pack of rechargeable batteries and with 2 in the camera and 2 backups I've never had any problems.","This little camera is perfect for the amateur photographer. It is easy to use and creates excellent photos of remarkable quality. The addition of the optical zoom to a 2 megapixel camera allows for a great deal of flexibility without compromising on the definition of the final pictures. It is small (it slips easily into a pocket) but the control buttons are readily accessible and just the right size for the average finger. The softwear for downloading to a PC is also very user - friendly.<br />And best of all - the unbelievable price! This is the best value-for-money deal to be found anywhere on the net.","First I'll tell you what I use this camera for, and then let you decide if this review is even relevant for you.  I am a freshmen in college.  I carry the camera with me wherever I go, and just take pictures of anything I find interesting.  I am not a professional photographer or anything of the sort.  I use it for fun and so I can remember things down the line.  That said, here is what I find are the positives of this camera:<br />1.  It's small.  I can fit it in my pockets easily.  Also, the switch is designed so that it doesn't easily go on or take pictures in my pocket.<br />2.  It's easy to use.  The automatic mode takes great pictures most of the time, and it's easy enough to turn the flash on/off or change the exposure if I need to.<br />3.  It has optical zoom.  Don't be led in my digital zoom, it's pointless.  Digital zoom just enlarges pixels.  Optical zoom will actually zoom in on the subject and give you the high res zoom in you want.  Optical zoom is a must.<br />4.  It has video.  True, no sound, but it is a nice feature to have.<br />5.  LCD screen/menu system.  It's always nice to be able to review pictures.  Don't try and save money on a camera without a screen.  You can use it to see what your pictures are like, if they are blurry or not (you can zoom in on your previews to check out the sharpness of them), etc.  Also, screens provide a better idea of the picture you are taking than the optical viewfinder.<br />6.  The upper wheel makes it very easy to change modes on the camera.<br />7.  The USB cable makes transferring pictures fast and easy.<br />8.  It runs on double-A's.  I use rechargeable NiMh batteries.  They last a good week or so before I need to recharge them.  I take at least 10 pictures a day on them with flash and screen on, if not more (it's a digital camera so you will probably end up taking 4 pictures for every 1 you keep).<br />9.  You can take rapid pictures easily, hold the shutter button slightly to focus, press down to take, repeat.<br />Now, here are the negatives, most of which are only minor:<br />1.  The only flaw I would say I really care about is the exposure time for night shots.  I can't really say it's any better with other cameras, but if the object is out of range of the flash or you can't use the flash for some reason, it will come out a little grainy or blurry.<br />2.  The resolution is 2 megapixels.  More than enough for most computer desktops, but if you want to cut out and enlarge portions of it, you're going to be limited because once you start cropping there isn't much left to crop.  Think about spending a little more on the 3100, same menu system and case but more resolution.<br />3.  It takes a couple seconds to turn on.  I've missed a few pictures because of this, but it's nothing much.<br />4.  Sports/action shots sometimes come out blurry, but this is expected with entry level digitals.<br />5.  Somehow from being in my pocket all the time without a case it got dust inside the viewfinder.  If you use the viewfinder a lot and plan to keep it in your pocket, I recommend a case.  I don't use the viewfinder however, so it doesn't really matter to me.<br />That's about it.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase.  Some other smaller cameras are coming out now, but for the price this can't be beat.","My husband is about to travel overseas for an extended time and needed a small camera which would be easy to carry and especially easy to use, as he's never used a digital camera before.  I'm the techie in the family, so I have to teach a TOTAL non-techie to take and then transfer pictures to his laptop so he can burn them to CDs. Included with this camera is a video on CD that explains how to use the camera and its various modes and settings.  That was extremely helpful to my husband and he was taking pictures immediately after watching the video.  VERY HELPFUL!<br />The next step was installing the software so we could transfer his pictures to the computer.  Using Windows XP the software installation went smoothly, but when we plugged the camera into the USB port it was listed as an \"unknown USB device\" and was not recognized properly.  Some quick research on the internet identified this as a problem with motherboards using the VIA chipset (as ours does) and suggested a Microsoft patch to fix the problem.  After downloading and installing the patch and restarting the computer, the camera was correctly identified and works perfectly now.  If you need the patch, go to Microsoft's<br />site at [...] and enter \"KB822603\" in the search box.  It's only 342KB and you'll need to restart after installing.<br />We are totally pleased with the picture quality and color!  The pictures he's taken using auto mode have been crisp and clear, and now we're experimenting with some of the scene selection modes.  I took a macro closeup of our African Grey parrot from 5 inches and it's crystal clear, with every feather perfectly defined.  We took some zoom pictures of deer in the snow in our backyard at approximately 75 yards right before dark using the dusk/dawn mode, and all that was needed was to lighten the shot a bit using the included software. Our regular 35mm camera can't even do that. Both outdoor and indoor shots are consistently good and the flash works nicely.  Red eye is easily fixed using the software, which also allows changing the brightness and contrast, adjusting the color RGB balance, and resizing the picture. There is also an \"autofix\" option that works well.  My husband learned the software in about an hour (which is a major miracle!) and can now take photos, transfer them to the computer and tweak them to his heart's content, all without further assistance from me! :)<br />I've set the resolution to \"PC\" so the pictures display at 1024x768, and with a 64MB flash card I get 278 pictures.  The included 16MB card gets 69 at that resolution.  Since we don't need prints larger than 4x6 that resolution works for us -- we prefer the shots to be full-screen on our computer monitor and burn them to CDs to use for slideshows on TV using our DVD player. There are higher resolutions available if desired, like 1600x1200 high resolution for larger photo prints.  Also, there are a variety of compression options available when saving pictures, which is helpful when emailing from a dialup connection so you're not sending huge files that take forever to download.<br />The included CRV3 battery is still going strong after several hundred shots with the LCD monitor on continuously.  I bought rechargeable batteries but haven't needed to use them yet.  My old 1MP digital camera with no zoom and no preview screen was much harder on batteries, and if I didn't remove the battery when the camera was turned off if was dead the next day.  The battery door on the Nikon 2100 feels flimsy, so I'd recommend pressing the battery into place and holding down with your finger until you can slide the battery door closed.  I wouldn't pressure the batteries into place using the door.<br />I like not having a separate lens cap to fool with, as the built-in lens cover automatically opens when the camera is powered on and closes when it's powered off. The camera is light and fits comfortably in your hand.  The LCD screen is bright and easy to see, especially when scrolling through menus.  We didn't have any problem seeing the screen outdoors in full sun, even with the sun's reflection on icy snow from a recent storm.  The camera goes into standby mode and the LCD screen turns off automatically after 30 seconds of non-use and then takes about 4 seconds to wake up, but that's the default setting which can be changed to longer intervals if desired.<br />Holding the shutter button down halfway focuses the shot and when the button is pressed fully down, there is a quiet but definite  click so you know the picture has been taken.  It takes only a couple of seconds for the camera to refocus so you can shoot again.<br />Good price, ease of use, excellent pictures, and Nikon quality -- what more could I ask for?  I recommend this camera without reservation and am completely happy with it in every way!  In fact, I like it so much I ordered one for my brother last night!<br />Might not be the best choice for a professional photographer, but for everyday use at a reasonable price, it's awesome!!!","I received this camera as a christmas present and the setup was so easy that about 2 minutes after I opened the box, I was taking pictures.  Lots of modes allow for beginners to have the help they need with correct flash and shutter speed for nearly every situation.  Pictures are so easy to transfer to the computer, and it's amazing how big they are.  And if not perfect, the programs that come with the camera are so easy to use that nearly every shot will look like you had taken it perfectly.<br />The only bad thing is the battery.  The original lasted about a week after continuously taking pictures, after which I got a NiMH recharger and set of batteries.  Those don't seem to last too long in the camera so far, but perhaps after longer periods of recharging that will change.<br />Otherwise, a wonderful camera.  4/5","Received this camera as a Christmas gift and really enjoyed using it. It's light, small, easy to use (throw the manual away - that's just too confusing)Great pictures and video but no sound? If there is I haven't found it yet.<br />BIG problem is the flaky connection to a PC and the even flakier Nikon View software. I still can't get either to work reliably so I am going to return it tomorrow, Shame really, but Nikon should think about shipping some decent quality goods if they want quality reviews.","I have watched the digital market for a couple of years waiting to buy a camera.  After Christmas was finally the time for me.  After researching extensively, I selected the Coolpix 2100 for its price and features.  I came to the conclusion that at this price point, you can either get a 2 MP camera with some features (i.e. scene modes, optical zoom, Nikon lens, etc) or get about a very basic 3 MP camera or one with a no name brand.  I have played around with the camera for awhile and I like the results.  Pictures are sharp.  The auto mode does a very good job of making the puctures turn out well.  If you want a camera that you can just take pictures with without having to fool with much, this camera is for you.  If you like a little more control, there is a manual mode which offers limited options.<br />I would suggest buying a 128 MB CompactFlash card (it holds about 130 high res pics and about 250 next-to-highest res) as well as some good NiMH batteries (the higher mAh the better.)<br />Overall, this is a great camera which is easy to use and takes good pictures.  Unless you're an avid photographer or a professional, this camera and 2 MP resolution is all you need.","I have been unable to download my pictures directly from my camera to my PC.  I get an error message that the \"USB component in unrecognized.\"  I called the 1-800 number on the box the camera came in.  The man I spoke with was very polite and helpful; however, he said that my camera was not compatible with Windows XP home, and that I would have to buy a card reader.  This took some of the fun out of it for me, that I couldn't directly link my camera to my computer.  And my computer is only 1 year old, I would expect things to be compatible.  But otherwise I LOVE the camera.","For $200, this is a great camera.  Minutes after unwrapping it, I had it all figured out.  It's packed with features but still very easy to use.  The scene modes are very helpful in taking sunset shots and close ups.  The software that comes with it is also very easy to use and I had no problems connecting the camera to my computer.  The pictures turn out very well, although they sometimes turn out a little dark--but the software does a good job fixing any color problems.  Also, the battery life is decent in comparison to other digital cameras, so no gripes about that.  Just make sure to buy some rechargeable batteries as this camera doesn't come with those.  I highly reccommend this camera.","I just bought the camera today and I'm really happy with it.<br />Few weeks earlier, I bought the Sony DSCP52, played around with it, and then decided to return it.  Sony does have a lot of features (and SOUND with the movie), but there are 3 important factors: the cost of the memory card, the size, and weight.<br />PROS for Nikon 2100:<br />===================<br />1) Supports compact flash memory cards.<br />-This makes a HUGE difference as it will save you a lot of money.<br />2) Small compact camera.<br />-Unlike the Sony DSCP52 that makes your hand feel tired after holding it for too long with one hand.<br />3) Weight.<br />-Very light<br />4) Doesn't use a proprietary battery like other small cameras.<br />-Mine came with the nikon coolpix rechargeable Ni-Mh70 batteries (these ones are really good ).<br />5) So many modes to choose from depending on your situation.<br />-I don't know which other camera in this class comes with this many modes (like ones for fireworks, sunset/sunrise, beaches, etc.)<br />6) Image transfer.<br />-This was pretty quick and easy. Installing the software doesn't take too long either.<br />CONS:<br />====<br />1) The manual is just way too confusing.  It's kind of hard to follow, and I'm eager to discover all the wonderful things and features that I can use with the camera.  I guess it takes a lot of time.<br />2) No sound with the movie.<br />3) Gets scratched easily + not very solid built (I'm always scared of damaging the battery door).<br />4) When turning LCD mon on, it takes a few secs (though this is tolerable).<br />Overall:<br />=======<br />Note: I'm a beginner at taking digital pictures; this will be my first digital camera!  But as a beginner, I find this camera to satisfy more than enough for my basic demands.  I have yet to try out the sunrise mode, but so far the ones I've taken in my room look really good.  I compared the pictures to the ones my friend took (Sony DSCP72) and they do look relatively the same.  So unless you really need to print out huge pictures, 2.0MP is adequate.","I bought the camera after significant research in its category. The camera is functioning very nicely. The quality of pictures is also excellent. This camera clicks very good snaps at in low light (night / indoors).The wide variety of photo modes makes it very easy to capture the scene just as thought. The snaps are good too. I like its design better than the Kodak and Sony cameras in the 2-3 MP range. Its definitely worth a buy.","I just bought this camera on Christmas Eve. I was in a hurry as I'm going to Ireland tomorrow, needing scenary shots and good color I picked this one. I had an HP 2.1 megapixel camera, that zoomed 4X and had also movie option with no sound. I wanted movie WITH sound as I've not had sound ever with my old one. I went down in Megapixels with this camera, but it was a good price like everyone is saying. I'm still learning it, there are a LOT of options, which I still need to get down.<br /><br /> My only complaint which I feel is huge, is the candid shots. I was trying to take a pic of my neighbor's cat for her, and everytime he would move his head, that's when it would snap the picture. So the delay is actually longer than my older camera. But other than that, its good so far.<br /><br /> The display on the LCD does go off after a short amount of time. Kind of annoying. The battery I had no problem with, I think lids of batteries are probably all flimsy, but this one is just like all the rest. I ended up buying Energizer 2 double A's to replace the battery that came with it because the Target guy said the manufactuer's battery wouldn't last as long as 2 double A's. I also threw in more $$$ for a 128 MB card for the space alone. I had a 64MB card before and it goes fast if you are not careful.<br /><br /> So far so good. I don't like the LCD going off on me, and I REALLY don't like how long the camera takes to take a picture for candid shots, but the pictures that I did get, are well worth the money. Also, another reviewer said that the flash is good, it's almost too good, sheesh. It's very bright. Some shots were too white, I'm sure there is an option for this somewhere and it only happened a few times. My old camera didnt' have a good flash on it, so on this one I noticed the flash RIGHT AWAY. I'm pleased with it for the price, I'm going to keep it.","I purchased this camera for my daughter who is currently serving in Bahgdad and she was thrilled with it.  It has held up better that other brands that are in those tough conditions and she loves the way the pictures come out.  She says that it is very easy to use and that alot of the other soldiers she works with plan on getting the same camera after seeing how well hers works. I am getting one for my other son in Bahgdad and for my son in school.","For a 2 megapixel camera the Coolpix 2100 is about the best you can get for the money.  It doesn't have all the features of some cameras in this price range, mind you, but it does what it does quite well.<br />I've been taking photos, I suppose you could say \"semi-professionally,\" for more than 20 years.  I still prefer my mid-end 35mm Nikon SLR, but I had a need for a moderately fast digital camera to use for posting to web sites and to email friends.  Generally speaking, you don't need too many megapixels for this kind of use.  And for this purpose, the 2100 is just about perfect.  It takes very good close ups (perfect for auctions) and the exposures are generally pretty good.<br />What it does not do well: Very limited manual controls (is that even needed in this price/megapixel range?), not too good at red eye reduction, and its movie mode is a total waste given that there's no sound.<br />I looked at several other cameras in this price range and I decided on the Nikon because of how it felt, how it functioned, and the quality behind the product.  The Canon A60 is functionally a far better camera with a great movie mode with sound.  However, having tested it personally, I found it to be far more complicated than it needed to be.  It also just didn't feel right in my hands.  You put these two cameras hand in hand and you'll see the difference.  The Nikon is just made to be held.  I don't know what the Canon folks were thinking: It feels like a block with a raised hand grip.  Also, the Canon just didn't feel well made.  The limited research I did with the sales clerk and a search on the Internet indicated that Canon has some quality issues with the A60.<br />If you can spend more money on a camera and/or you're looking for something you can use for enlargements then you'll want to look elsewhere.  Nikon, Olympus, Sony and others have better cameras for less than one hundred dollars more.  But if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive camera to use on the Internet this will do you just fine.","I bought this camera 2 weeks back.I have taken pictures using all the scene modes & the pictures have turned out to be very clear & neat.This camera is very easy to use &  very handy due to its small size.<br />I even took the prints in all sizes till 8x10\" .Simply too good<br />I strongly recommend this camera.","I had an old hand me down Kodak digital camera, and I mean old...the high res on it is like 150 pixels.  It is fine for on-line pics, but I have been waiting til digitals came down in price to purchase one I thought would last me a long time.<br />After reading a lot, I decided on this camera.  My only reservation was whether or not to spend the extra money for a 3.2 megapixel.  It seemed for the money, this was a better choice than a low end 3.2 camera.<br />I have been very pleased with it.  The menus are very intuitive, the delete is quick and easy to discard a shot.<br />There are enough settings on this to satisfy an amateur photographer.  I am a gardener, and the macro did a great closeup on my roses.<br />Print wise, you will see no discernable difference on this camera on pics up to a 5X7 than off a traditional camera.  I didn't find an 8 X 10 to be of a quality that I would want, but, then again, I didn't expect it to be.  How often do you print 8 X 10's anyway?  If that is what you need, you probably need to move to a 3.2 camera, but for snapshops and 5 X7's you will be thrilled with this one.<br />Some reviews (and the Nikon manual) say you should only use Lexar and Scandisk memory.  I purchased a Viking 128 mg card Amazon had on special to go with this, and it is working perfectly fine for me.","I'm a professional photographer who still enjoy film work best. However, I wanted a small, easy to use camera that I could slip into a pocket and not worry if it gets broken or stolen. It's not the hottest camera, but it's plenty hot for casual point and shoot work.","The LCD screen QUICKLY turns off using the \"LCD SCREEN OFF\" button right under the screen... this same button will also disable/enable the helpful on-screen information (how many pictures you have, what size, etc.).<br />The battery is NOT hard to install, not sure what you are talking about, I had it in and running immediately.<br />If you would learn how to use the camera, a light press of the shutter button focuses the camera on the object, you can hold it here all day, then, when you decide to take the picture, a full press of the button takes the picture INSTANTLY.<br />It's a shame people give negative reviews about such a great product.<br />If you are looking for a wonderful camera at a budget, this IS the camera you need, does EXCELLENT video and picture quality.<br />TONS of features, nighttime pictures, etc.. but also a simple setting for normal use... you can even EASILY edit pictures right on the camera.<br />I got the case and rechargeable battery set which works great, never need to worry about batteries.<br />I did a print of 8x10 with the 2 megapixels and the picture looked just fine, unless you are directly comparing the SAME picture side by side with a higher megapixel camera, you won't notice ANY difference, it looks awesome, this will do 4x6 and 5x7 prints nice and clearly.<br />The camera is small and is a blast, I LOVE it and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a digital camera who isn't looking for \"super awesome professional sharp clear pictures\".<br />This will do prints wonderfully.","This is a great little camera.  So tiny and lightweight.  Has great optical zoom and so many quirky features that are fantastic.  Perfect for a beginner user.  Just point and click!  Easy to learn.  Can take anywhere.  Get this camera if it's your first digital camera.","2 megapixels is great, particularly if most of your work will be on screen.  Did not give it a five only because there are too many features to learn right way.  As I get more familiar with them, I am sure I will like them.  I bought the camera after much research.  One of the best deals out there!","OK, I admit it - I was first drawn to this camera because of how small and cute it is, and how it fits ergonomically in my right hand. At first I was considering the 3100 until ultimately, I decided 2MP was all I really needed. I'm only looking at pictures on my computer, emailing/posting them on the web, and printing 4 x 6. The $100 price difference was also a factor - It's not that I can't afford to spend more, it was more like...is it worth spending so much money on a point-and-shoot digital camera? Especially when you have to factor in an extra $150 or so for accessories. Plus, digicams are changing so rapidly, I'll probably want another one in a couple of years. (However, if you want more flexible printing options, you'll probably want a 3MP or higher).<br />  Now that the price dropped, it makes the camera even more worth the price! I also considered other brands, but decided on the Nikon because (1) I've had other types of Nikons in the past that have captured memorable photos and are still clicking; (2) the Nikon digicams use the more common (and cheaper) CF memory cards; and (3) have the option of using two AA batteries.<br />  I picked up some Duracell 2050 mAh NiMH rechargeable batteries that came with a 30 min charger, and they work great. I was worried initially, because of all the negative reviews about battery power I've read about online. And it did seem to drain the batteries more on first use (maybe because it was charging the internal clock battery?). But now it works great. The features on the camera are also a plus - it's so easy to use. It took me just a couple minutes to figure out all the functions. Though you don't get shutter or aperture priority (just buy an SLR if you want that!) the modes more than compensate. I especially liked the macro feature and the white balance. And there doesn't seem to be a problem focusing in low light despite the lack of an AF assist lamp.<br />  The only downsides I can think of (which are really minor) - maybe a little too small for a man's hands; not all the scene modes are really that useful; some parts of the body are a bit too plasticky (but who knows if this will be a problem in the future or not).<br />  In short, great pictures, great features (that both the beginner and the amateur can appreciate), really easy to use, easy to transfer to my computer, and affordable!","Easy to use, lots of options. I have taken more than 400 photos in the last 6 months and the battery is still working!","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera! Everything about it is wonderful, from the basic point-and-shoot to the more specific scene modes. I am NOT very good with technology, but this camera is simple, and even i can take great pictures. With all the different settings, you're sure to get the results you want. The most fascinating mode to me is the Fireworks setting. Wonderful, colorful pictures like you see on TV were taken by ME!! This is by far the greatest camera money can buy. It's so easy! And a big plus was the online features you can get at Target's website, like photo albums, editing, and 4x6 glossy prints for only $0.29 each! I LOVE every little detail about this wonderful, beautiful, small and easy-to-use piece of equipment, and the masterpieces it creates. BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!","I just wanted a lightweight digital camera which takes excellent quality pics and I'm not disappointed. The size is great. It's very easy to operate for a novice like me and still takes excellent pics. The pics at night come out great too which is a big plus. Overall, it's worth the money and with the great deal at Amazon, I'd say buy it!","Just entered the digital camera world with this little gem, and absolutely love it!  It has so many great features for the price, the zoom is adequate for taking some great pictures.  I like the fact that you can delete pictures quickly if needed, no having to go through some menu to get the picture deleted.  The screen is large enough to read everything well, and the movie feature is really cool.  You can view your pictures on the TV if you like, and the time it takes to download to your computer is minimal.  The camera also doesn't drain your batteries very quickly.  Overall, a great little compact camera to start out with!  I would highly recommend it for any beginner just looking for some great photos!","I bought this camera to replace my beloved Sony Mavica that finally gave out. The \"bang for buck\" with this digital is unparallel, and of course everyone knows Nikon makes a great camera! At the time I was on a tighter budget so this camera fit my needs but it is more of a \"beginner\" \"point and shoot\" type of camera. It has several modes all of which are again geared toward the novice photographer, going into the menu inside each mode allows for some minute tweaking.<br />My one major gripe is the complete lack of focus when working with fur. I hobby breed chinchillas and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a decent shot of one of them with this camera. I have many other pets I try and photograph but it is extremely difficult. I much prefer my old mavica in this respect as I could get crystal clear pictures of ALL my animals without any hassling with the camera. That is not to say that I haven't gotten some great pictures of my furry companions with a bit of patience!<br />However, there is alot of positives! This camera does take excellent macro shots, it also takes great scenery and people shots, and it works brilliantly at night as the flash sensor is excellent and the flash itself is very powerful and bright. The functionality is excellent, and with the help of reading the owners manual you can unlock many of this cameras better features.<br />This camera uses a new battery called the \"CRV3\", many leading battery manufacturers now make this compact but powerful battery. I use my Nikon frequently, pretty much everyday several times a day, and I get GREAT battery life. I am not throwing batteries in every few days like some of my friends have to do with their \"AA\" powered cameras. I did buy a Energizer replacement battery rather than a Panasonic (which is supplied) and I have been very happy with them.<br />To address some of the other reviews:<br />The battery cover DOES feel a bit flimsy, but after you get comfortable handling the camera you learn how much pressure to use. I like to push the battery into the socket fully and then slide the cover over, this helps with not putting so much pressure on the cover.<br />The LCD monitor has a dedicated button right below the LCD screen sandwiched between the delete and menu buttons. One touch and it instantly turns the LCD screen off.<br />Bottom line - If you are a beginner to the hobby or just want an affordable digital to take pictures of friends and family this is an EXCELLENT, AFFORDABLE choice!","I bought this camera to replace my beloved Sony Mavica that finally gave out.

It's small, lightweight and has more features than you can imagine.  With the Nikkor lens, the pictures produced are not only sharp, but effortless to take.  I will always make Nikon my first choice from now on!!!","This camera is one of the best out there i think that it is worth 250 dollars and think that everything about it is great.This camera has evreything from a built in video camera to 9 different scene modes and an LCD screen.One other GREAT featuree i found in this camera is that it does not delete your pictures even if the batteries all of a sudden go dead or even once you've transfered the pictures to the computer they are still in the camera.","I wanted to spend less than 300 dollars on a digital camera that I could use to share and view pics through my computer. So I immediately decided that I did not need any high megapixel camera because I wasn't planning on printing any of the pictures I would take. So I shopped around for a small camera and found this \"cute,\" as most girls would say, camera. The following is what I have to say: 1. I am impressed with the quality of pictures in low-lit (almost completely dark) indoor areas for such a cheap camera. 2. The included Panasonic CR-V3 battery lasted two months while taking over 200 pictures. 3. Weighs only 5.3 ounces and it is only 3.4 inches wide. 4. 3x optical zoom.<br />The camera's performance for its price is exceptional. If you're looking for a camera to have fun with, buy this one.","The pros definitely make up for the cons. It's an outstanding product, takes top quality pictures and is very easy to use. Of course you'll need an additional memory card.","Exelent, It's the best digital camera to find in 2.0 Mpx, gives a lot for the money you pay, many features, easy to use and exelent pictures.","I have had this camera for over 2 weeks now and I find this perfect. I had tried the A60 earlier but that one was giving a green hue even in bright light and lotsa pictures weren't giving true colors. (PL. don't buy the A60).<br />So i returned that and got this one instead. It has been a splendid journey so far. the picture quality even in low light is good. the scene modes are very useful.<br />Pros<br />- Good quality and sharp pictures<br />- various scene modes help compose pictures in different lighting situations.<br />- Low light (indoor) and night pictures pretty good<br />- easy to use menus<br />- Can use multiple batteries, 1 CRV-3 battery or 2 AA batteries<br />- Very compact and light<br />- Uses an inexpensive memory card<br />Cons<br />- Battery consumption<br />You may wanna invest in re-chargeable batteries and a higher capacity memory card. JUST BUY THIS CAMERA !!!","I did a lot of research when looking for a basic digital camera, and was still surprised at how small this thing is!  I was used to digitals being roughly equal in size to regular point 'n' shoots, but this is about 1/2 the size.  No complaints - its easy to hold and does wonderful things.  Amazing!<br />The Coolpix 2100 does everything I wanted a digital camera for:  Instant pictures, archiving capability, the ability to throw out pictures I don't want, etc.  It is definitely easy to carry around, making picture-taking much more possible.  I only rated it a \"4\" because:<br />1) If I really wanted great pictures, I would have wanted more megapixels (my choice).<br /><br />2) I was disappointed that it only came with a non-rechargeable lithium battery.  While researching, I saw somewhere a spec that claimed that this camera came with a rechargeable battery and a recharger.  This must have been from some other country, because the camera in the US seems to require new power sources when the supplied battery runs out.<br /><br />3) The supplied photo-management software may be good, but it is not intuitive, and I have not yet totally figured it out.<br />Having said this, the Coolpix 2100 is a sweet little camera, and is easy enough to use that you will be taking pictures right away.  Good Nikon quality in a small package.","Pro's<br />1. Has all the desirable features like video out, only 2 AA batteries etc.<br />2. Nice looking and very small in size with good grip. Light weight too.<br />3. Uses inexpensive CF cards, not expensive sticks!<br />4. Easy menus and scene modes to use.<br />5. Competitively priced.<br />6. Superb macro pictures and good low light/night shots. It could focus in pretty low light without any AF assist light, because of a bright lens.<br />7. Good battery life on just 2 AA's. (unlike 4 on some models from Canon, HP and others)<br />8. Inexpensive accessory kit is available right here on Amazon! It has a very fast world charger, 2 NiMH AA's and a custom case.<br />Con's<br />1. Reliability is doubtful and battery door is very flimsy.<br />2. Movie mode is bad, no sound and movie sizes very small.<br />3. A bit on thick, making it slightly tougher to pocket.<br />4. No rechargeable batteries or charger in the box.<br />5. Need to read & remember manual for proper use of so many scene modes like \"museum\"!<br />6. Weak flash and redeye.<br />7. Worst of all it doesn't work reliably with anything other than Sandisk and Lexar CF cards. Weren't these cards made to a standard?<br />Its not the best but for its price its definitely worth considering. Esp if you like its its picture quality.","Pros: Very compact design, great picture quality, compact size, comfortable in the hand, customizeable scene modes, 2-megapixel resolution for prints up to 8 x 10 inches<br />Cons: Problems when using with LCD monitor off, scene modes can be a bit too customizeable, and distract you from the shot<br />Summary: I had an option at the camera store between the Nikon 2100 and an Olympus model that was 3.0 megapixels. They were both priced the same and basically had the same specs. It boiled down to \"ease of operation\". To delete a shot with the Nikon 2100, you touch one button. On the Olympus model, you have to navigate through the menu and it's quite aggravating. That's just one of the many features that Nikon has added to the 2100. The menu is quite user friendly and the camera is very easy to use. A part of me was worried getting a 2.0 megapixel camera, but there really isn't that much of a difference between a 3.0/2.0 on a 4X6 picture. One other note, and this may seem elementary: the camera looks great! Very sleek and compact.<br />There are some downsides: the flash seems a bit hot and the shutter is quite slow - you can't snap the shutter like you can on an SLR, causing you to miss some of those moments that happen in the \"blink of an eye\". BUT, for the price and the great quality, you can't beat it. And the biggest PLUS? NIKON! It's all about the NIKON quality - far and away the best brand!","i was reading the reviews below and noticed someone else had a problem with the memory card as well.  just wanted to share my similar experience, though i DID use one that was recommended (SanDisk), however, found that it STILL took a long time to save each picture, so the wait time between taking pictures was just too long for me.  this was very strange to me as i tried the same memory card in other cameras and it did not have this issue.  i've sinced bought the same brand memory card as the starter card (Lexar) and have had no problems.  so now i love the camera.  it is the perfect size, great functionality with lots of options, and for a great price.<br />PROS:<br />- great size<br />- great shape<br />- lots of functionality, including black/white, sephia colors, multi-shot mode<br />- very easy to use, though i don't use the scene modes much...auto and manual work just fine.<br />- accurate & crisp picture quality<br />- can use rechargeable AA batteries<br />- great value<br />CONS:<br />- picky about memory card.  seems to only like lexar so beware!<br />- no sound with movies","Pros:<br />The instructions are very easy and well-laid out. I bought this camera at a store where the sales person tried to get to buy an on-line manual for about $40---I am glad I did not since the camera comes with a great hard-copy manual as well as an on-line guide that I have not even tried out yet<br />I had a problem with the camera (see con below) and I called the Nikon 24 by 7 tech support service center.  They were very helpful in trouble-shooting with me on the phone.  The gentleman was very service oriented.<br />Con:<br />The camera is very finicky about the memory cards uses. The store where I bought the camera sold me a 128 M memory card, claiming that they are all very universal.  Wrong.  The instructions (inside the box) for memory cards clearly indicate the tested and recommended brands.  The card I was sold is not on the list, and because of this, I get intermittant results.  Sometimes the camera works with the card, sometimes I get an error message that says \"You can Not Use This Card\".  When the camera is in this mode, it will not work at all.  I tried the smaller Nikon storage card that came with the camera, and it works consistently. If you buy this camera, be sure and buy only the cards listed by Nikon.","I looked at and tried out nearly every 2 MP camera that I could find.  The Nikon's optics are superb, it is VERY easy to use, the software that comes with it is excellent, and I've been loving every second of it.<br />Compared to every camera I've used, this camera beats them all.<br />Have fun!!!!!!!","I upgraded this camera from a Canon A200. Operation wise, the menu system of the Nikon was much more intuitive and easier than the Canon. One thing I hated about the Canon is you have to install software drivers just to have the camera be recognized. However with the Nikon first thing I did was put in the batteries, CF card, took some shots, and plugged into my computer via the USB cable and I was able to see it as a removable drive, and then drag and drop my pictures onto the desktop. It is truly plug and play and you don't need to install any software for it to work.  The battery life is also very very good with a 1600mA NIMH rechargebale, I already took 200 shots with LCD and have yet to recharge them. Anothing area where this camera excels is its lens, the Nikkor lens I found to be much much sharper than the Canon lens, which are known to have softness as one of its characteristics.  The zoom lens adds a lot of versatility to the camera. One favorite thing I like was that there is only one connector for both the TV out and the USB upload, as they use the same interface on the camera. This is more efficient than having a separate hole for USB and another hole for TV out. Also this camera seems more efficient in utilizing Compact Flash space. For example, I can get 155 shots on a 64MB compact flash on Normal mode, when an average 1600*1200 picture is only around 400k, which is less than about 500k for other cameras. I've noticed this exists in other Nikon models as well from online reviews that I have read. All in all, to sum it up, this camera is relatively small, have sharp lens that display excellent detail and accurate colors, and is very easy to use. One more thing I like to point out is that even due to a lack of AF assist lamp, the camera does well in low light situations. Perhaps it doesn't need an AF assist lamp, which is why it was left out in the first place. It takes pictures in the night without flash as if it had night vision technology integrated, I was surprised how well night shots turned out for a relatively inexpensive camera. One thing I would improve for this camera would be user selectable ISO in manual mode, this would lessen a little bit of noise in low lighting situations, but however being a 2MP camera, the noise are not noticeable to the naked eye. I would recommend this camera to anyone on a budget, but demands sharp and true colored pictures.","I upgraded this camera from a Canon A200.

I could put it in my jeans pocket and take it out with me everywhere on my travels. It took fantastic shots even in low light and the print quality was superior to some cameras even over 4 megapix. Disappointingly, it quit in the middle of my European Vacation in July '05 with a black screen that never went away. I can view the pix on the memory card but can't take any new pix.<br /><br />Sadly it seems that this problem is par for this camera. It dies about 2 years later. Be Warned!","This camera looks really nice, takes good pictures, and is excellent value for money.  On the downside, the little tune it plays when you turn it on is annoying, non-rechargeable batteries get used up very quickly (so buy rechargeable ones), and most significantly, it is very easy to mess up the camera if you get any dirt (or sand) into it's workings.  I took mine to the beach once, didn't do anything particularly reckless, but a couple of grains of sand got in, and the zoom no longer works at all and the lens cover won't close.<br /><br />I would still recommend this camera, but just be careful with it...","Wow....when my digital camera was stolen, I decided to go with something smaller and easier to carry in my purse all the time so I'm ready for any photo situation.  This little camera is almost as good as my previous bigger digital camera as far as picture quality but it has even more features.<br /><br />I love the simple menu system.  I know some don't like it but I'm no photographer....I'm a point-and-shooter.  I need the simple menu system to figure things out.  If I choose to use the various features, that is.  The menu system is simple, very intuitive, and is a no-brainer for someone like me.<br /><br />The photos are great.  I invested in a 1Gb memory card so I have plenty of space for pictures.  So I normally use the Fine picture setting at the best picture quality (1600x1200) as I can store almost 1000 pictures at this setting.  As a test, I have also taken a few at the Standard setting of which I can get 1800 photos on one memory card.  Both print well in up to 8x10 size photos on my Epson printer.<br /><br />My previous camera did video but did not have sound.  I love having the sound feature.  I videod my husband giving a speech to a conference last night.  I have 10-minutes of video, the picture video quality was just as good as from my video camera and I was presently surprised that we were able to capture his speech even though I was toward the back of the room (about 60 feet away).  The speech was very clear and easy to hear.<br /><br />It's fun playing with some of the other features like putting a picture within another picture, etc.  Although I haven't used many of these yet, it's nice to know they are there.<br /><br />And I love not having a proprietary battery as I have a home battery charger plus a car battery charger so I can always have AA rechargeables ready to go.  Or, in a pinch, use regular batteries if needed.  This will be nice when going on longer hikes when power isn't available to re-charge.<br /><br />There are certainly other cameras out there with more mega-pixels but, for the average point-and-shooter like me, I'm convinced this camera should satisfy all your needs.<br /><br />The only downside that I have found, and this can easily be corrected with photo software on your computer, is that the flash works well inside only on closer shots.  Photos taken from a distance, or in a very large room do tend to be a little on the dark side.  This is a minor problem, IMHO, and the small size outweighs the lack of a bigger flash.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for something inexpensive, easy to use, and tiny enough to fit in your pants pocket or carry in your purse without adding a lot of weight or bulk, this is the camera for you!!  Enjoy.","I was really stuck between this and a coolpix 2200, which my friends all have, also I had a Coolpix 4500 which I really loved. Upon first using the X20 I was initially dissappointed by the grainy image that showed on the LCD (There is no viewfinder.) However after depressing the button for autometering, then taking the picture the result was fantastic, even though the object was only inches away from the camera, (a feat my coolpix has never been able to pull off!) The lens conver, (which retracts like a G5 CD drive cover,) is also very clever, and nullifys my worries over having to buy a case. Overall the camera seems well designed for sticking in a pocket and going, and pulling out a snapping great pics/small movies at a party or whatever. Also pictures can be taken more quickly after one another than with the 4500.","I have owned this camera for a few months now, and am essentially satisfied with it. The small form factor means that it goes in my pocket, on my bike, wherever I might want a camera, and I carry it more often than my compact 35mm. The internal lens is great because it has 3x optical zoom but no need for a lens to stick out or move in and out. You can actually take a clear picture right through a screen door by placing the camera directly against the screen (try that with an exposed lens!)<br /><br />However, there are many aspects of it that could be improved. First, the time to focus is slow, at least a second or two. The camera is quick to \"wake up,\" but actually taking a picture is much slower than a film camera, and therefore I often miss quick action shots. Second, the menu interface is poor. Navigation is hit-or-miss with the small directional buttons, organization is apparently arbitrary, and there is no way to force the camera to stay at ISO 400 speed. You can set that speed, but turn the camera off and you have to press menu, enter, down, enter, up, enter, and menu again to set the speed and return to picture-taking mode. It's a joke. At least the flash mode can be set without entering the horrible menu system.<br /><br />The final gripe I have is that the pictures look very digital. They're reasonably sharp, especially for a camera with such a tiny lens (unavoidable in this form factor), but the colors seem a little warped, as if the RGB sensors were misaligned. This mainly shows up as a textural aspect, but if you zoom in it becomes obvious. A digital camera can only capture colors that are combinations of red, green, and blue (roughly half of the whole spectrum), so you will never get something that looks as good as film (which covers the whole spectrum). However, the Dimage X20 seems worse at this than most.<br /><br />One feature I like very much is the TV output. Even if you have no access to a computer, you can display a slide show to a TV using the included cable. Very convenient. Another feature that may not matter to you but is nice to have is macro (close-up) photography. The Dimage X20 can focus on something 3 inches away, compared with 18 inches for most cameras, enabling you to take pictures of small items like insects. This camera can also take video, but only at a fixed focus, and the quality is pretty bad. I don't use the video feature except in bright daylight with a subject that isn't moving much.<br /><br />Battery life is also good. I use rechargeable NiMH batteries (US$2.50 each at Wal-Mart), and they easily last for 150 pictures or more. Even better, when they run down to 25% you can just recharge them and always have a full battery. I much prefer this to the proprietary batteries that many cameras have. Yes, they last longer (typically they are Lithium) but if you are going to be away from a charger for two weeks the universal availability of AAs cannot be beat. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to lay out $40 each for replacement batteries that can only be used in one camera.<br /><br />To summarize, I am pleased with my Minolta, even with its limitations. Probably I will get a digital SLR as an alternative to this camera, when I want to be able to easily set exposure time and all that stuff.","Bought the camera for a bike tour and carried it with me everywhere I went.  Great camera and great pictures.  Easy on and off, easy to download.<br /><br />Being such a small camera, it fits either in a shirt pocket or bike jersey.

I could put it in my jeans pocket and take it out with me everywhere on my travels. It took fantastic shots even in low light and the print quality was superior to some cameras even over 4 megapix. Disappointingly, it quit in the middle of my European Vacation in July '05 with a black screen that never went away. I can view the pix on the memory card but can't take any new pix.<br /><br />Sadly it seems that this problem is par for this camera. It dies about 2 years later. Be Warned!","This camera looks really nice, takes good pictures, and is excellent value for money.  On the downside, the little tune it plays when you turn it on is annoying, non-rechargeable batteries get used up very quickly (so buy rechargeable ones), and most significantly, it is very easy to mess up the camera if you get any dirt (or sand) into it's workings.  I took mine to the beach once, didn't do anything particularly reckless, but a couple of grains of sand got in, and the zoom no longer works at all and the lens cover won't close.<br /><br />I would still recommend this camera, but just be careful with it...","Wow....when my digital camera was stolen, I decided to go with something smaller and easier to carry in my purse all the time so I'm ready for any photo situation.  This little camera is almost as good as my previous bigger digital camera as far as picture quality but it has even more features.<br /><br />I love the simple menu system.  I know some don't like it but I'm no photographer....I'm a point-and-shooter.  I need the simple menu system to figure things out.  If I choose to use the various features, that is.  The menu system is simple, very intuitive, and is a no-brainer for someone like me.<br /><br />The photos are great.  I invested in a 1Gb memory card so I have plenty of space for pictures.  So I normally use the Fine picture setting at the best picture quality (1600x1200) as I can store almost 1000 pictures at this setting.  As a test, I have also taken a few at the Standard setting of which I can get 1800 photos on one memory card.  Both print well in up to 8x10 size photos on my Epson printer.<br /><br />My previous camera did video but did not have sound.  I love having the sound feature.  I videod my husband giving a speech to a conference last night.  I have 10-minutes of video, the picture video quality was just as good as from my video camera and I was presently surprised that we were able to capture his speech even though I was toward the back of the room (about 60 feet away).  The speech was very clear and easy to hear.<br /><br />It's fun playing with some of the other features like putting a picture within another picture, etc.  Although I haven't used many of these yet, it's nice to know they are there.<br /><br />And I love not having a proprietary battery as I have a home battery charger plus a car battery charger so I can always have AA rechargeables ready to go.  Or, in a pinch, use regular batteries if needed.  This will be nice when going on longer hikes when power isn't available to re-charge.<br /><br />There are certainly other cameras out there with more mega-pixels but, for the average point-and-shooter like me, I'm convinced this camera should satisfy all your needs.<br /><br />The only downside that I have found, and this can easily be corrected with photo software on your computer, is that the flash works well inside only on closer shots.  Photos taken from a distance, or in a very large room do tend to be a little on the dark side.  This is a minor problem, IMHO, and the small size outweighs the lack of a bigger flash.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for something inexpensive, easy to use, and tiny enough to fit in your pants pocket or carry in your purse without adding a lot of weight or bulk, this is the camera for you!!  Enjoy.","I was really stuck between this and a coolpix 2200, which my friends all have, also I had a Coolpix 4500 which I really loved. Upon first using the X20 I was initially dissappointed by the grainy image that showed on the LCD (There is no viewfinder.) However after depressing the button for autometering, then taking the picture the result was fantastic, even though the object was only inches away from the camera, (a feat my coolpix has never been able to pull off!) The lens conver, (which retracts like a G5 CD drive cover,) is also very clever, and nullifys my worries over having to buy a case. Overall the camera seems well designed for sticking in a pocket and going, and pulling out a snapping great pics/small movies at a party or whatever. Also pictures can be taken more quickly after one another than with the 4500.","I have owned this camera for a few months now, and am essentially satisfied with it. The small form factor means that it goes in my pocket, on my bike, wherever I might want a camera, and I carry it more often than my compact 35mm. The internal lens is great because it has 3x optical zoom but no need for a lens to stick out or move in and out. You can actually take a clear picture right through a screen door by placing the camera directly against the screen (try that with an exposed lens!)<br /><br />However, there are many aspects of it that could be improved. First, the time to focus is slow, at least a second or two. The camera is quick to \"wake up,\" but actually taking a picture is much slower than a film camera, and therefore I often miss quick action shots. Second, the menu interface is poor. Navigation is hit-or-miss with the small directional buttons, organization is apparently arbitrary, and there is no way to force the camera to stay at ISO 400 speed. You can set that speed, but turn the camera off and you have to press menu, enter, down, enter, up, enter, and menu again to set the speed and return to picture-taking mode. It's a joke. At least the flash mode can be set without entering the horrible menu system.<br /><br />The final gripe I have is that the pictures look very digital. They're reasonably sharp, especially for a camera with such a tiny lens (unavoidable in this form factor), but the colors seem a little warped, as if the RGB sensors were misaligned. This mainly shows up as a textural aspect, but if you zoom in it becomes obvious. A digital camera can only capture colors that are combinations of red, green, and blue (roughly half of the whole spectrum), so you will never get something that looks as good as film (which covers the whole spectrum). However, the Dimage X20 seems worse at this than most.<br /><br />One feature I like very much is the TV output. Even if you have no access to a computer, you can display a slide show to a TV using the included cable. Very convenient. Another feature that may not matter to you but is nice to have is macro (close-up) photography. The Dimage X20 can focus on something 3 inches away, compared with 18 inches for most cameras, enabling you to take pictures of small items like insects. This camera can also take video, but only at a fixed focus, and the quality is pretty bad. I don't use the video feature except in bright daylight with a subject that isn't moving much.<br /><br />Battery life is also good. I use rechargeable NiMH batteries (US$2.50 each at Wal-Mart), and they easily last for 150 pictures or more. Even better, when they run down to 25% you can just recharge them and always have a full battery. I much prefer this to the proprietary batteries that many cameras have.

My friends and family can't believe that the great pictures came from this camera. I have printed all of the pictures on my printer a (deskjet 842) and they turned out awesome. This is my first digital. The zoom works fantastic. I have taken some awesome pictures at the Denver Zoo where I used the zoom and they are cool! I am in my mid 40's and if I can take great pictures with this than any one can.<br /> The downfall is the batteries.... It eats them like there is no tomorrow. (no matter what kind)","I have had this camera for 8 months and I like it. I wanted a camera that was small and not expensive and this one was the best for me. I gave it only 4 stars because I have to modify the flash settings too often in order to get the best quality pictures.","When I purchased this camera I was looking for something compact and affordable. I already own a Fuji S5000 (great camera), however the camera is a bit big and heavy to take everywhere.<br /><br /> I looked at Cameras by Casio, Pentax, Canon and Fuji. I found the x20 to be my best match for value and size.<br /><br /> The camera:<br /><br /> Build quality - 4/5 (sturdy, but my sd cards tend to get jammed slightly in the unit)<br /> -<br /> Speed - 5/5 (very quick, from power on to taking pictues)<br /> -<br /> Features - 5/5 (It has enough features to be a good PShoot, I didn't want any manual features to clog up the interface. I use the Fuji for that)<br /> -<br /> Battery life - 3/5 (Using 2300 NIMH batteries it doesn't very last long. When compared to my Fuji which does take 4 batteries it still can't last 1/4 of the time)<br /> -<br /> Use - 4/5 (taking pictures is great. Only problems are that the flash must be suppressed every time you turn it on, no memory.)<br /> -<br /> Pictures - 4/5 (the camera takes great pictures for what it is, PShoot. I was able to take several macros without any problems.<br /> -<br /> Video – 4/5 (the video is very good, however its not quite as fluid as I would like it to be. It is slightly shopy if you move the camera around, or if your camera moves.<br /><br /> This is a great camera for a portable point and shoot. You can take this camera just about anywhere, and not miss shots. I was looking for a case for this camera, even though target doesn’t have to many cases I found an accessory case and it fits the camera perfectly for $5.00!<br /><br /> I would suggest getting at least a 128mb SD card and two pairs of 2300 NIMH batteries.<br /> Overall I give this camera 4/5. This camera is great for a backup/portable camera, however if you just looking for a single camera to do all of your pictures you may want to look elsewhere. For the same price you can find a camera that will take better pictures with more features if size isn't critical.","This is by far the best camera that I have had yet. I have been through 3 digital camera's in the past 6 months. The fujifilm was good, but not enough for me, then I went with a off brand camera thinking that it might be better. I was wrong. Then I got the Minolta X20, man was I in for a surprize. The best option is by far the way you can change the Pictures from black/white to blue. For those extreme people you can even do pink. The camera options are easy to use, set-up is a breeze. I can't really think of one bad thing to say about it. The picture quality is great and the price is better. I got mine for little under $200 brand new. So I got lucky cause they usually go for at least $250.","I originally bought this camera to replace my fuji digital that broke.  I chose it because of its size and quick startup.  The camera was great until a recent vacation.  The automatic lens cover slipped off of its track.  The camera also lost its optical zoom capabilities (probably what led to the lens cover not closing).  I am now in the process of sending the camera back for repair under the 1 year warranty.  However I would still recommend this camera.  It's easy to use and it starts up really fast.  The picture quality is great for a 2 MP camera.  My only recommendation would be to handle with care.  Allow the camera to fully start up or shut down before pressing any other buttons.  I believe what led to my problem was that I pressed the power button as the camera was shutting down.  Consequently it got stuck in the shut down process and lens didn't retract causing the cover to get stuck.  If you allow the camera enough time to complete it processes you should be fine.  And what makes this camera a better choice than say the small sony cybershot is that it uses SD memory which can be used in a number of different devices (across a number of brands).  Sony's memory stick limits you to sony devices when it comes to sharing memory.","The Minolta Dimage X20 is great.  For its size it offers very impressive features.  The 3x optical zoom is excellent because its internal so you don't have to mess around with a lens slide.  It doesn't even look like this camera could have a zoom lens but Minolta did a wonderful job.  I don't miss the viewfinder in my old digital camera at all.<br />It takes good quality digital photo's if you're not a professional. I think the majority of the people buying this camera will be happy with the quality. Its also very easy to use.  It has a good graphical interface system so you'll get used to changing settings in no time.<br />With a 256mb sd memory card I can record 12 minutes of video and audio in Quicktime.  The included 8mb memory card isn't enough in my opinion.  Minolta should include more memory.<br />Its very small in size so its easy to take with you pretty much everywhere.  You may want to use a small case as it can get scratched or damaged if you rough it up.<br />If your only going to use it for small sized pictures and prints its perfect because most likely you won't be needing anything better than a 2.1 mega pixel camera anyway.<br />Overall a really great camera for the price and I'd highly recommend it. Its selling for well under $200 everywhere I've looked!","within the warranty year, this is the second time I'm sending it in for repair. The design is great, small to fit in the pocket, we got a lot of mileage with it, and always gets compliments, but the quality of pict is not good enough for good prints and too many weird things have happened with it. I hope the 3 pixel one is better, because it's fun to hold and have, if only it worked better...","I bought and then lost this little camera on a trip to Tokyo, Japan. It is quite a lovely little digicam that looks cool and works well. The positives are that it is lightweight, easy to use, easy to transfer photos, simple to handle and the quality of the photos is great for a 2 MP camera. If you are looking for a camera that will take large-print pictures, this is not your camera because come on! don't spend money on a 2 MP camera if you want 5 MP quality. The options for taking the pictures are very fun to play with. With a large memory card, you can store a large amount of snapshots.<br />The drawbacks include short battery life. The camera just drains the two AA batteries too quickly. The setting have to be reset everytime the camera is turned off. The shutter release time is bit slow.<br />Buy this camera if you only wish to spend under $200 on a digicam that takes nice, but not exceptional, quality pictures. Definitely shop around and if you can afford the extra hundred, look into getting a higher MP camera. This probably would make a nice gift for a teenager or child. Minolta has the sleekest designs around.","I bought this little beauty because it was the smallest 2Mp camera I could find, that still has<br />some sort of zoom. the features are nice and I like the quality of the prints it makes. Since i've gotten this thing, I've taken about 2000 photos, and lots of movies.<br />CONS:<br />the delay before and after taking the picture can be trying on your patience. It waits about 1 1/2 seconds to TAKE the photo, then 3 seconds to save it, before you can take the next photo. Also the Timer is a bit strange. It takes the photo, then automatically returns to Single shot. So.... If you don't like the photo, you have to go clicking through the menus again to take another photo. It sucked when we were trying to get a bunch of Halloween photos with everyone in them.<br />ALSO!!!!! The battery dies in COLD WEATHER!!! I charge the battery full, then go snowboarding. I take 3 photos and then it tells me that the battery is Exhausted. Grrrr....<br />If you keep the camera under your jacket (close to your body) it will last longer. That reminds me.....  the battery light is stupid. It is a full batter symbol, without bars. Instead, it changes color to let you know the battery life. White is FULL,  really light gray (off white) is half full. And RED is you got a few seconds left.<br />Despite the short comings of the camera, I take it everywhere, and shoot  a lot of photos. Get the leather pouch, and get yourself a good size memory card. Get it on line. You can find them for 1/2 the price you'd pay in a store. It comes with an 8Mb card.<br />yeah. 8 Mb. You get to take FOUR photos with that. Get a 256.<br />Oh, the movies are decent for web, but to put on a DVD, they are a bit grainy. What do you expect? It's a Picture camera, not a Movie camera.<br />have fun!","after lots of research and thinking i decided to buy this little gem, it performs better than i expected (only because some bad  reviews i read), picture quality is excellent, ease of use is great, the only \"bad\" thing about it is the lcd and only outdoors in a bright sunny day, almost can't see what's in the frame(maybe i should increase the brightness?? )...<br /> It feels very solid, not flimsy at all... did i said that the picture quality is excellent? well it is, it put to shame a friend's Sony 5MP monster...  and shutter lag hasn't been a problem, my favorite feature is the multi-frame, lots of fun with that one... :-)","I bought:the camera (Dec 2003),a 128mb card and the $9 travel case and i couldnt be happier ! I love my new camera .Literally ,after just opening it and turning it on i was taking pictures .And the same for saving them on my computer.<br />This camera has everything: A zoom that doesnt show, lens cover, size: Super SMALL even with the carry case, fast start up, Video w Audio,webcam,etc. You can read all the great features above but overall its the best buy i have done in a long time because it is very well built ,SMALL!, and also very stylist so everyone will notice this great gadget.<br />That little mirror on the front is excellent for pics w friends.<br />The shutter lag is the only thing i have against it(about a sec tops).But not in a bad way because i still LOVE my new mini cam.And Minolta is a very good company.<br />The delivery was EXC and the camera 10x more !!<br />Great Buy !<br />I researched for about 6 days for the best ,Cheapest and smallest cameras with  lens cover and video and etc ...And i really think i found it !<br />Must have:Rechargable batteries and charger .(also 128mb card and a case!)<br /><br />update (Dec 19, 2005): a few months ago, my camera stopped working. It started showing weird lines in the screen and now it is black and it doesnt take pictures. I believe the light chip died. It lasted for 2 years...","Es una camara muy practica y la calidad de las fotos es excelente","It's exactly what I wanted. Small enough to have no excuses to leave it behind, minimovies are in Quicktime MOV format with audio, images sometimes are soft but the colors are great and the low-light pictures have no noticeable noize.<br />The GUI (graphical interface) is very easy to understand and allows for quick settings changes. For such as small camera a viewfinder is not missed. The LCD screen is bright and clear.<br />It's great that it uses AA batteries resulting in more options for rechargeables and chargers.<br />It's not a professional camera but it's perfect to capture everyday life (^_^)!","i have had this camera for 2 weeks now, getting from Dell home, i think the price is alright but the images were blurry.  I think you need to hold the camera real still when you take pictures.  Also the flast seems to go off too easily.  It seems unnecessary in areas which has ample light for flight to go off.  Of coursee can be manually overide but each off / on requires resetting again, seems very bothersome.  I am still learning how to use this camera so watch for more comments in due course.  It is best to buy a case for this early on cause it could easily get knocked around and scratched.  For power, for sure use NiCd for digi camera type, they seem to work the best.<br />Updated Nov 16, 2003 I now have this camera for a few more weeks.  The rechargable battery I use is the NiMH type 2100 mAH, this is the type which works the best as it lasts a long time, I also got myself a 256 mb SD Media memory card.  This camera has some interestig features such as movie with sound, 9 minishots onto one pictures so you can get somee pretty funny situations / faces.  You would need to be grapping this camera tight when you shot to get better picture otherwise it gets fuzzy, and you need to get a soft case to put it in so that it does not get scratched up especially the screen on the back.  Annoyed at the auto flash, it goes off even under outdoor lights and I need to find ways to stop the flash going off, I have been shutting it off manually but each time turn off / on I need to do this again, perhaps I have to read the manual further......I have revised this to 4 * , more satisfied than 3 weeks ago","the Dimage X20 is the little brother of the Dimage Xt. the main differences between the two are resolution (2MP for x20, 3MP for xt), the x20 does not have an optical viewfinder, the x20 uses AA batteries.<br />pros:<br />- 2MP resolution, 3x optical zoom.<br />- about the same size as the xt with dimensions of 3.4 x 2.6 x 0.9 in, weighing in at 4.1oz.<br />- generally good photo quality, low noise levels.<br />- automatic white balance performs well.<br />- AF locks rapidly and decisively in good light.<br />- short shutter lag in good light.<br />- fast startup.<br />- fast shot-to-shot speeds.<br />- ability to record in movie mode until memory card is full.<br />- all metal body feels solid.<br />- 1.6\" LCD is bright and fluid.<br />- uses non-proprietary AA batteries (i highly recommend rechargeables). this means that in a pinch, replacement batteries are as close as the nearest convenience store.<br />cons:<br />- some purple fringing.<br />- corners are soft.<br />- some vignetting.<br />- above average barrel distortion.<br />- some redeye occurrence.<br />- no manual controls.<br />- no optical viewfinder - this makes it tough when you use this camera with bright sunlight.<br />- RAW and TIFF formats not supported.<br />- no AF illuminator - this would really help shutter lag when using this camera in low light.<br />- scratches easily.<br />- 8MB SD card provided is inadequate so add $$ to your budget to buy more memory.<br />- only 2 AA non-rechargeables included; again, add more $$ for some rechargeables and a fast charger.<br />the X20 is a great looking ultracompact camera but the quality of the images you take could be better. if you want a pocketable camera for web photos and small prints, consider the X20. if you want larger prints and like the design of the x20, try the DiMAGE Xt. if you want manual controls, you'll have to find another camera altogether, as none of the X-series cameras have them.  i would recommend the optio s or casio ex-z3. for even better image quality (in a slightly bigger package), also consider canon's sd100.<br />i hope this helps you with your buying decision. peace.","I have the X20 for about a week now - and it doesn't dissapoint me.  This is my 2nd digital camera. I choose it because it's small size, and the fact that it uses regular AA batteries so you'll always have a backup for power.<br />Picture quality is good, though the flash lacks power; indoor flashes do look a bit pale (compared to Canon A20). Outdoor seems to overexpose a little bit. Outdoor shots can be hard because the viewfinder is missing.<br />For my goal - point and shoot - very good camera. Don't expect top-of-the line image quality - but for it's size it's definitely acceptable"]},{"name":"Minolta DiMAGE G400","amazon_reviews":["This is a really easy to use little camera and does a better job than my cell phone.

Minolta has a great history and they did not let me down with this model.  It has the features and quality of even the most advanced, much more expensive cameras.  I don't know how they did it.","Since making a foray into digital photography a few years ago, I've been waiting until technology and price converged with a camera that offered enough over the 1.3 MP camera I had been using to make it worth the jump. My requirements were good macro to short range (a few feet) performance, high image quality and color rendition, fast startup and pocketable.<br /><br />I chose the Minolta after considering similar models from other manufacturers. The protective, sliding style lens cover was the type of design I preferred, with a sturdy, stainless steel body. It's a newer model with faster startup than the G500. This, for me, plus the smaller size outweighed the increased sensor resolution (and price) of the latter.<br /><br />The camera startup time (well under 1 second, essentially instantaneous) is one of its strongest features. Opening the lens cover is tricky, however. It's easy to smudge the lens if your fingers slip. I've found that using my index and middle fingers to slide the cover using the \"ears\" on the \"chevron\" part of the cover, while holding the camera with my other hand, avoids lens smudges.<br /><br />For most candids and point-n-shoot situations it was best to use full auto (usually with flash disabled). Switching between auto and manual takes just a few pushes of the mode and navigation buttons, and comes quickly after some practice. Thankfully, there are dedicated buttons to enable macro mode and setting the flash modes, which are retained across power-ups.<br /><br />The manual camera mode with auto flash exposure and 100 ISO setting gave the best quality, provided that there was enough time to compose the shot. However, the auto-focus often fails for closeups (3 feet or less). Reviewing the images after shooting was mandatory for closeup shots. If only there were an easy way to manually focus.<br /><br />The camera delivered what I expected regarding image quality. The color rendition was superb. However, examining images, one looks more critically for shortcomings rather than strong points. Highlights and colors tend to get blown out easily in contrasty, sunlit scenes, and I used -0.7 EV or greater underexposure compensation to avoid this. Consequently, shadow areas can be noisy.These limitations are true of all consumer digicams, however. There are many sample photos to be found on pbase; navigate to the camera-specific gallery for the Minolta G400. Some photos are posted at full resolution so you can have a good look.<br /><br />The camera uses the same battery as the new G600 model. That's good, because it will insure a supply of replacements on the market when the time comes to replace the battery. Buy an extra battery, keep one in charger and one in camera. Swap them when your memory card fills up.<br /><br />Two unfortunate notes regarding my experiences with the camera:<br /><br />- If kept in a snug pocket, it's easy to snag the lens cover \"ears\" when quickly withdrawing the camera, causing the camera to switch on while still inside the pocket. This apparently happened one time too many, and the lens became frozen in the closed position. Fortunately, Minolta's warranty service was very responsive and I received the camera two weeks (the standard estimate is 4 weeks) after returning it for no-cost repair.<br /><br />- I splashed it with (black) coffee.

It's very small and durable. Very easy to figure out for the most part.

Upgraded memory to 256 and been able to store about 170 pic's on fine setting. Well worth the money.<br /><br />p.s. I live with my Grandma","I've had my G400 for approximately 3 months and I'm fairly pleased with it. I am very pleased with it's quick start up, low shutter lag time, and quick flash charge, which is something that can be an issue with a lot of other digital cameras. I'm also very impressed with the battery life (approximately 185 still pictures according to the specs). The only thing I do not really like is the fact that you cannot use special effects after you've taken the picture, you have to set it before you take the picture. There aren't very many editing options on the camera itself. Although having a good photo editing software would probably do the trick.  I actually was given the new Olympus Stylus Verve as an early Christmas present and was not satisfied with the picture quality at all compared to my G400 (so I returned it).  Althought the G400 does have difficulty focusing in low (to almost no) light, I find that most of my pictures still come out clear anyway.  In some situations, I found that using the viewfinder (turning off the screen) works a little better when in low light. I use a 256mb SD card for the camera and it can hold approximately 120-130 pictures at the highest resolution (4mp fine).","I'm a college Freshman who wanted a decent beginner's camera to experiment with photography.<br /><br />I poked around review websites for cameras in this pricerange, and came up with the Minolta G400.  I ordered it over the other cameras primarily because of the awesome startup time (1/3 that of other cameras in its price/feature range).  I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />The camera is small, light, and feels very durable.  The sliding lens cover makes me feel comfortable toting the thing around and handing it over to other people.  The batteries charge fast and last a while, and they're very small, so carrying an extra one around with you is hardly any hassle at all.<br /><br />The pictures look awesome, and the available manual control lets you take pictures in a variety of lighting situations, assuming you have a steady hand.  I was primarily interested in using the camera for purely digital work--editing in Photoshop, using in other digital projects--and the camera is amazing for that purpose; the full 4 megapixels aren't entirely necessary for that purpose.<br /><br />I enjoy taking close photos, capturing small details, and the camera handles this great.  The flash works really well, from what I can see, and I took a couple hundred photos without seeing any reduction in battery charge (about one-third were taken with flash).<br /><br />I recommend this camera to anyone interested in getting their feet wet in the digital photography racket; it's small, cheap, and relatively feature-rich.","This is a really easy to use little camera and does a better job than my cell phone.  I am happy with it.","Even though this is a basic Point 'n Shoot Camera, the pictures are great. On top it uses a SD Memory Card and the size / shape / form-factor makes it very easy to carry around all the time. I used to be able to slip it into my jeans pocket.<br /><br />Unfotunately after about using it for about 14 months or so, the lense got stuck and I have not been able to get it fixed :o(<br /><br />On the other hand, using this for over a year I got hooked on Digital Photography and got myself a Nikon D50 as a replacement ;o)<br /><br />- manzoor","In agreement with other reviews. This camera has great features -- too many to even list. It has aperture priority and speed priority, color, b&w, sepia etc. Takes crisp, clear true-color pictures. Quality is great.<br /><br />However, the lens mechanism has frozen in the open position after about owning it for one year. You can get it to close if you pull the battery out and turn it back on - but you have to close the cover very quickly to keep in in - it then registers an error and shuts off.<br /><br />Too bad -- $325 is more than I wanted to pay for one year - didn't think I'd need to upgrade so soon and don't want to spend another $100 - $140 to repair it. Haven't contacted Minolta yet, but don't want to throw good money after bad....","Pros:<br /><br />Tiny, Tiny, Tiny<br /><br />Fast, Fast, Fast<br /><br />Great manual features<br /><br />Nice lens<br /><br />Solid build<br /><br />Great quality photos<br /><br />Long battery life<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Only 3x optical zoom (thats standard, but more is always better there)<br /><br />no RAW format (for those true pro photographers)<br /><br />I have loved this camera, everyone who sees it is impressed with the quality and speed with which it performs.  Minolta has a great history and they did not let me down with this model.  It has the features and quality of even the most advanced, much more expensive cameras.  I don't know how they did it.","Since making a foray into digital photography a few years ago, I've been waiting until technology and price converged with a camera that offered enough over the 1.3 MP camera I had been using to make it worth the jump. My requirements were good macro to short range (a few feet) performance, high image quality and color rendition, fast startup and pocketable.<br /><br />I chose the Minolta after considering similar models from other manufacturers. The protective, sliding style lens cover was the type of design I preferred, with a sturdy, stainless steel body. It's a newer model with faster startup than the G500. This, for me, plus the smaller size outweighed the increased sensor resolution (and price) of the latter.<br /><br />The camera startup time (well under 1 second, essentially instantaneous) is one of its strongest features. Opening the lens cover is tricky, however. It's easy to smudge the lens if your fingers slip. I've found that using my index and middle fingers to slide the cover using the \"ears\" on the \"chevron\" part of the cover, while holding the camera with my other hand, avoids lens smudges.<br /><br />For most candids and point-n-shoot situations it was best to use full auto (usually with flash disabled). Switching between auto and manual takes just a few pushes of the mode and navigation buttons, and comes quickly after some practice. Thankfully, there are dedicated buttons to enable macro mode and setting the flash modes, which are retained across power-ups.<br /><br />The manual camera mode with auto flash exposure and 100 ISO setting gave the best quality, provided that there was enough time to compose the shot. However, the auto-focus often fails for closeups (3 feet or less). Reviewing the images after shooting was mandatory for closeup shots. If only there were an easy way to manually focus.<br /><br />The camera delivered what I expected regarding image quality. The color rendition was superb. However, examining images, one looks more critically for shortcomings rather than strong points. Highlights and colors tend to get blown out easily in contrasty, sunlit scenes, and I used -0.7 EV or greater underexposure compensation to avoid this. Consequently, shadow areas can be noisy.These limitations are true of all consumer digicams, however. There are many sample photos to be found on pbase; navigate to the camera-specific gallery for the Minolta G400. Some photos are posted at full resolution so you can have a good look.<br /><br />The camera uses the same battery as the new G600 model. That's good, because it will insure a supply of replacements on the market when the time comes to replace the battery. Buy an extra battery, keep one in charger and one in camera. Swap them when your memory card fills up.<br /><br />Two unfortunate notes regarding my experiences with the camera:<br /><br />- If kept in a snug pocket, it's easy to snag the lens cover \"ears\" when quickly withdrawing the camera, causing the camera to switch on while still inside the pocket. This apparently happened one time too many, and the lens became frozen in the closed position. Fortunately, Minolta's warranty service was very responsive and I received the camera two weeks (the standard estimate is 4 weeks) after returning it for no-cost repair.<br /><br />- I splashed it with (black) coffee. After drying for several hours, it returned to life, but remained flaky. I sent it back, and the repair wasn't covered ($160).<br /><br />Pros: super fast start-up time, good color fidelity, low levels of compression artifacts in midtones, one-button selection of flash and macro modes, sturdy, compact stainless steel body, relatively easy to navigate menus.<br /><br />Cons: unreliable autofocus if closer than 3 feet; lens cover can snag on pocket, leading to unwanted camera activation and possible damage.<br /><br />Since purchasing the camera, the price has dropped considerably, making it a terrific value.","This camera has been great and takes accurate, true to life colors.

It also has a continous shutter mode where you can take shots in quick succession for sport events.<br /><br />The main complaint I have is that night pictures of the outdoors are extremely blurred (you need a tripod to stabilize the camera otherwise the pictures are useless) and often don't have sufficient brightness in the images. I was also disappointed that the software has no support for stiching images together to create a panoramic photograph.","I've had this camera (Konica Minolta Dimage G400) now for over two months and I'm very happy with it. The camera was actually developed mainly by Koncia before Konica and Minolta merged. It's basically a rebranded Konica Revio KD-410Z.<br />I've  compared with three coworkers who bought the Sony DSC-T1: The Sony is about as fast, smaller and sleeker, but performs much worse in low light conditions.  I've seen quite a few pictures that were shot indoors and the flash didn't manage to properly light the scene. I don't think that should be happening with a camera that sells for $150 more than my camera.<br />To nail this problem we took photos with both cameras under identical conditions. The G400 picture is slightly underexposed, but not bad considering it was almost dark in the room when I pressed the shutter. The T1 on auto setting on the other hand was underexposed by about two f-stops. Setting the T1 to ISO400 helped somewhat, but made the picture very noisy :(<br />What tipped the scale for me is the overall quality of pictures and the absolutely amazing speed of the camera. In general I found that people talk too much about megapixels.What matters much more than actual megapixels (once you've moved past two megapixels) are the optical properties of the camera like lens, autofocus system, etc. The pictures I've taken so far were almost all very crisp with radiant colors. The colors were usually a bit too warm and could sometimes benefit from a bit of adjustment in Photoshop, but were excellent otherwise.<br />Overall I'd say the camera has some flaws but is a very nice little point and shoot camera that offers lots of manual adjustments when you're ready for them. And given the current market prices for this camera this is one of the best buys out there. That's why I'm giving it five stars despite having some flaws.<br />Oh, and I forgot to mention: Don't fall for this camera's big brothers the G500 and the G600! As I understand it, they don't have the fast passive autofocus system the G400 has and the G600 even has a crippled movie mode.<br />And while we're speaking about the movie mode: 320x240 at 15 frames per second is not quite state of the art anymore and shouldn't be a factor in your buying decision of any digital still camera. If you insist on a decent movie mode, go and buy a digital camcorder. You'll have a lot more fun that way with ample storage space and a working optical and digital zoom.","This is a nice camera but mine broke after 2 weeks of ownership. The lens failed to deploy and the lcd saie error moooc ???????? Target gladly refunded my money.<br /><br /> When the camera was working it took good pictures but did have a bit of a focus problem. I foundthat it took the best pictures on night mode with the flash on all the time. The color was good and the camera is verry conveinent to use and cary. It aquires the image fast and recovers quickly.<br /> I will get another from target as soon as one arrives.<br /><br /> Vince","I am very, very pleased with my purchase of the Minolta G400; it slides into a pocket effortlessly, offers fairly powerful manual exposure control, good battery life and the fastest startup time I've seen in any digital camera.<br />I've used a Minolta S404 for all my previous digital photography, so I was looking for a small camera I could keep in my pocket.  I confirmed its usability as a quick snap-shot camera at a wedding I attended yesterday; you really can turn it on, take a photo, and turn it off in under 2 seconds.  The incredibly fast startup time makes the G400 an outstanding camera for capturing precious, unbelievable, fleeting moments.<br />Auto-focus in low light takes more time than in bright light, but the longest I've waited has been a little over a second.  Overall, the G400 focuses much faster than my Minolta S404, which took one second in the best case.<br />Battery life is good; the included battery lasts as long as my S404 with 4 AA 1900 mAh rechargeable batteries.  I'd encourage having a backup, though, just in case.<br />I agree with previous reviewers: Canon's panoramic assist mode is nice, but I can live without it.  The on-screen menus are different than any camera I've seen, but I understood it pretty quickly.  Being different is not always horrible.<br />Amount of manual control elevated the G400 above the Pentax Optio S4/S4i and Canon S400/410/500.  The S4i's incredibly small size (hides behind a credit card!) certainly intrigued me, but its startup time was slightly longer (two seconds, from what I read) and it did not have manual shutter speed control.  The S4i does have some manual control, but the G400 has pretty much the maximum manual shutter and exposure control available in a consumer camera.  It does not have custom white balance, but I've never used it, so it wasn't an issue for me.  I also wanted a tripod mount, a feature missing from some super-slim cameras, but available here, though it's unfortunately made of plastic.<br />Picture quality is wonderful.  Skin tones look good and flora detail is really nice.  I took a photo of a tree outside my house and literally did a double take when viewing it on the computer; the leaves looked amazingly crisp.<br />The Minolta G400 disappears in your pocket and frees your mind from thinking about your camera.  Highly recommended for all photographers, beginner to advanced.  The only worthwhile camera is the one you have with you, and the G400's size makes it ridiculously easy to carry.","I was trying to decide between this camera and the Canon S400.  I chose the Minolta G400 and don't regret it at all.<br />The main reason to choose this camera is its speed, weight, AND price. This camera is MUCH faster than the canon. The startup time is practically zero, there is virtually no shutter lag, and the shot to shot time is fast as well. I found the canon S400 to be much slower.<br />The autofocus routine is good.<br />It is also much lighter (in weight) than the canon which is nice.<br />The Minolta also has much more in the way of manual control.<br />The one thing that I wish this camera had is the panoramic option where you can stitch several pictures together using the LCD viewfinder (the canon has this feature). But I can do this with my computer later so this is not a bid deal.<br />Some people have said that the menu system is not organized well - I agree, but it is really not that bad.<br />I like that the battery charger (which comes with the camera) is external to the camera so I can charge a battery while still using the camera (I have 2 batteries).<br />So with the exception of the panoramic feature of the canon S400, I could not find a reason to spend the extra $ to buy it over this Minolta G400. And now that I have it, I am glad I got the Minolta.<br />My feeling is that the reason the canon S400 is so popular on Amazon is that people see that other people have bought it, so they buy it.<br />P.S. the Minolta G500 is actually an OLDER model than the G400 even though it is a 5M pixel.","I had a Olympus D-360L prior, an excellent camera, but no zoom. I looked at the Canon S400, Pentax 555, Sony T1, Kyocera 300L.  The Pentax had speed issues, the Sony was expensive, the Kyocera had no optical viewfinder and I did not like the split LCD, lens system which I thought would be  difficult to control / coordinate.  The Canon was almost my choice, but it was a little slower, more expensive, and the Minolta supported SD and memory stick formats.  I have a Sony Clie SJ-22 that I wanted to display pictures with, using memory sticks.<br /><br />The Minolta is tiny, I can fit it into a case intended only for memory cards (Lowepro).  It is also lightnening fast, I cannot see how much faster a camera could be.  You slide the door, bring the camera to your eye, align the image, and shoot, there is no delay, another picture can be taken with only a 1-2 second (roughly) delay at normal settings.<br />The directional and telephoto buttons allow you to magnify and move the image on the LCD, the image moves on the screen without any blurring.  The display of images is very fast.<br />The issue of autofocus in low light is somewhat apparent, but actually not that much different than my Olympus.  The camera does seem to struggle a little in low light,-some autofocus delays, some exposure issues, but to me these are almost imperceptible, and I suspect they would be to most people.  I suspect most compact digital cameras struggle in low light situations.<br /><br />Overall, outdoor picture quality is excellent, indoor is very good. Relative my olympus, there is not a huge difference, until you start to magnify images, and the greater resolution is evident.<br /><br />There are small issues with opening the camera cover, initially I found it a little difficult to get a good grip but I now have no problems.<br /><br />The menu system is not the best in terms of organization, but it is redundant (the same settings are available on many screens), and I have not had problems quickly changing settings.<br /><br />This is an excellent, compact, fast camera that unlike my old Olympus D360L, I can carry everywhere, in my shirt pocket if I want.  It may not be a good choice for someone not used to digital gadgets, but anyone with experience with computers or PDA's should enjoy this camera.<br /><br />Update 12/05:<br />I feel even better about this camera now.  I've traveled all over the world with it, and it has performed well.  The selection button on the back has started to loosen, but otherwise no mechanical problems at all.<br /><br />I've used the video function more than I though I would initially.  Since I can carry the camera easily, I can catch unexpected events-the Air Force Thunderbirds flew over my car in Maine and I caught the event very well on the camera.<br />The voice recorder allows you to annotate your photos.  You can document entire trips with just this camera alone.<br /><br />Update October 2007: My G400 was stolen from my house <sigh>.  A great camera, it was still working well when it was stolen-except for a single loose button. I used it all over the world. If you see one, used, for sale in eastern or central Massachusetts,call me.","Photography has been a lifelong hobby of mine. I love to take candids both indoors & out and I have always wanted a camera that was small enough to take anywhere, fast enough for candids, with high image quality and manual features beyond a point & shoot. I have finally found it in this camera. I have already taken hundreds of pictures and the quality has been great. But I was perplexed why many reviews complained about the poor ability of the camera to focus indoors while others have said they get perfect results.<br /><br />In fact the autofocus light does continue to blink annoyingly on most indoor shots, even in good lighting, indicating that the autofocus is not locked . But the camera allows you to take the shot anyway and the results always appear to be in focus.. I tried shots even in total darkness (using flash, of course) and the results are fine, despite the fact that the autofocus indicator says that focus in not locked.<br />How could this be? To see if the autofocus was really working in the dark I tried a simple test. I took a picture in a poorly lit room with the focus light indicating focus was not locked and another of the same subject with the lights turned up, allowing me to lock focus. Much to my surprise I found negligible difference in sharpness- This camera's autofocus in low light actually exceeded my expectation. But you need to get past the fact that the camera is indicating the focus cannot lock and simply look at the results.<br />Pros<br />Very small & light weight<br />Super fast response: opening, closing, and shot to shot<br />Well priced<br />Packed with manual features<br />High image quality: very good sharpness and excellent color accuracy<br />Easy to use - Menu is a bit complex but fine once you are used to it<br />Cons (All minor issues)<br />Poor Minolta customer service<br />No printed manual<br />Camera front is easily scratched","Several camera forums and users speak of difficulty focusing in low light.  Mine focuses perfectly in near total blackness and in all shades of darkness to bright light--  It focuses in all modes equally well.  It focuses perfectly every time.  I can't get it to not focus perfectly.  Are we talking about the same camera?  Is there a quality control issue with this camera?<br />This camera has nearly every manual feature you can ask for.  The blue light that someone complained about can be turned off (but yes--it does nothing).  Someone else complained about not being able to date stamp the pictures.  This is wrong.  Page 98 of the manual explains how that is done.  Another complaint was with Red Eye which is a given with tiny cameras where the flash is right by the lens.  Just turn on the red eye reduction setting and that fixes that.  You can even adjust flash brightness and LCD brightness.  The manual is quite large because there are so many features that most people aren't aware of because they haven't taken time to read it 3 times.  It takes 3 times because there are so many custom settings available.<br />Pictures inside and outside are crisp and vivid.  (Angel mode with correct white balance make very beautiful skin tones. . . .)<br />Do I have any complaints?  Yes:<br />1.  Lousy tech support (called them before buying the camera.  They were worthless.  Have not needed to call them since)<br />2.  Manual is PDF on CD.  Have to print it off.  Bummer.<br />3.  Navigation through menus is funky. I agree with previous reviewer that your hands are moving all over the place in order to navigate.  But after awhile you get it down.  Part of the reason you have to read the manual 3 times is to understand the navigation and setting selections.<br />No camera is perfect.  Everyone has complaints on one thing or another.  The best camera is one you have with you when you want to take a picture.  That usually means small enough to put in a pocket so it is wherever you are and fast enought to turn on and take a picture in a flash before the moment is gone.  This camera does it in 1.5 seconds.  And of course it must have great photos or why even own it?  This is the camera--very fun and fast.  Just wish that menu system was a bit easier. . . .","Pros:<br />Recognized as a generic mass storage device under Windows XP - No drivers from device vendor required<br />Small size.

This is my fourth digital camera in five years.<br />Picture Quality:<br />----------------<br />Pros:<br />For a 4MP camera, I'd say the image quality is excellent. Crisp, clear, excellent exposure, accurate colors, and low noise. I'd say it produces images better than my older 4MP Sony S85. You can customize the color balance, saturation, and sharpness settings.<br />Cons:<br />None really. I'm happy with the image quality given it's resolution and price.<br />Handling & Feel:<br />----------------<br />Pros:<br />The camera is about the size of a deck of cards. The all metal body feels solid. Slide the cover open to power up the camera. It starts up almost instantly. You're ready to take picture in less than a second. The lens instantly retracts when you close the cover. The menu is easy to navigate.<br />Cons:<br />The body is flat, so there is nothing to really grip on to.  If your hands are sweaty, you can't get a good grip on the cover to open it, so you end up grabbing it from the end. If you do this, you'll end up dragging your fingers across the lens as you're trying to open the cover.<br />Performance:<br />------------<br />Pros:<br />Low light autofocus worked well. No complaints. It defaults to 6 feet in total darkness.<br />Cons:<br />The G400 is supposed to have a special hybrid autofocus that Minolta claims will perform in less than .25 seconds.  My camera was probably defective since the autofocus averaged .75 seconds. I returned it, but I would probably give this camera another chance.<br />Conclusion:<br />-----------<br />If I wasn't expecting lightning fast autofocus, I'd rate this camera five stars.  It's small, easy to use, and takes great pictures. However, I specifically purchased the G400 because I was looking for lightning fast autofocus. In that regard, my camera was not functioning properly.","The G400 is a small, fast camera that performs quite well outdoors.  It does not focus well in indoor lighting, though - struggling to get focus lock in moderate to low lighting conditions.<br />Size wize, the camera is very pocketable. It's not quite as small as the Pentax Optio S series, but it's one of the smaller optical zoom enabled cameras out there.  Its construction is quite solid and the camera has a good 'feel' to it.  The menu system isn't what I'd describe as intuitive - it's actually close to cumbersome, but it's not too bad to navigate through (though you will find your hands moving all over the place to press different buttons, as opposed to having everything on a 4-way 'OK' controller like most digicams).<br />Outdoors, the camera really shines.  Startup time is tremendously fast - the camera is ready to shoot before you can get it up to your face.  Auto focus time is quite quick, especially in good light.  Shutter lag with prefocus is non-existant.  Total shutter lag with autofocus is quick - under a second in good light.  Shot to shot time is good, too - even flash recycle time is quick - 2-3 seconds.  No lost shots waiting for startup or flash recycle.<br />Image quality is very nice - colors look realistic, low noise (for a small camera) and good resolution.  It's no SLR, but you're not going to stick an SLR in your shirt pocket, either.  There are trade-offs to get this to this size.<br />Indoors the performance is not so good.  The camera fails to lock focus in most 'normal' lighting situations.  Continuing to take the picture without lock will usually result in a decently focused pic if your target is fairly close, and there is a manual focus mode as well as 'scene' modes that set a specific focus range.  However, it is frustrating for the camera not to lock when other cameras in its class can.  The flash is quite strong and shots made with flash are quite good when in focus.  However, if you are primarilly looking for a camera for indoor snapshots, you should look elsewhere.  If Minolta could improve this aspect of the camera, they'd have a superb product.  As it stands now, they have a nice product that works great in good light.<br />Pros:<br />Fast start up, focus lock and cycle time<br />Solid construction<br />True 'pocketable' size<br />Good battery life<br />Lots of options / manual controls<br />Strong flash<br />Very nice image quality<br />Cons:<br />Poor moderate to low light focusing abilities<br />Cumbersome menu<br />No printed manual included - only on PDF (yuck - 200 pages of PDF?

The pictures are great and it includes alot of extra features. I like the way the LCD doesn't turn on at start up because it really saves batterys. I found using Photo Cell Batteries will last way longer. Also I like how after you take the picture it pops up and lets you preview and/or delete if you don't like it without having to press extra bottons. The optical zoom is pretty helpful but the digital zoom ruins the picture. It has many extra features like Macro and many other things. It is so easy to use and they software is phenominal.IT is the easiest and most productive of all the others that I have expirienced. I would defiently recommend this camera","im 15 years old and been taking pics most of my life.  i bought this camera at Target for $300 and have been happy ever since. i use NiMH rechargeable batteries with 2100 mAh.  there the best rechargable batteries ive had. i got 134 pictures using the flash and lcd screen for most of them(hint: only use the screen when your taking pics, dont have it on the entire time). the best part is the Auto feature it has, all i do is point and shoot, the camera chooses the best settings for the enviroment your in.  you can use manual controls which i only use some of the time. the flash is a little slow, it takes about 2 secs to flash and take the picture. this camera takes awesome pics and when i show them to people, they're amazed and ask me what kind of camera it is.","This camera performs excellently and is an amazing value.  I have read many complaints about the battery life, and I haven't had a problem at all with mine. I think it is quite easy on the batteries compared to many cameras I have dealt with.  I have never used alkaline batteries with the HP935, so I don't know how it would do with them. I use rechargeable NiMH batteries, because they save you so much $$$.<br />The other thing people complain about is that it takes 5 seconds from the point when you touch the power button to the time it is ready to take a picture.  I can't believe that anyone would actually be upset about a measley 5 seconds.  I have an Olympus SLR camera and it takes that long for the flash to power up and the lens to extend and everything to be ready on it as well.  Why is 5 seconds so horrible?<br />I love the feel of the camera in your hands, it is substantial enough that you can feel it there and hold it still, but lightweight enough that it doesn't tire your arms when taking many shots.<br />The optical zoom is really great, but the digital zoom is only okay.  The screen tells you the MP size you are lowering it to when you use the digital zoom, which is nice.  All in all, digital zoom isn't very good on any camera, so don't expect much out of it!<br />I love the video function and the fact it records sound, too.  The speaker for playback sounds a little scratchy, but when you play it back on the computer it sounds fine.<br />You can turn off the LCD display to save batteries if you want, and it will automatically show you a quick preview of the shot you just took.  I love that!  Also, the optical viewfinder is big enough that it is easy to see out of, a feature that I have a problem with on many other digital cameras.<br />I think that the optional dock is a waste of money, because you can easily upload your pictures onto the computer using the USB cord that came with the camera.  As far as the advantage of the dock charging batteries, you can get a great battery charger with 4 batteries for around 15 bucks and you can have extra batteries always charged and ready to go, and that is a lot cheaper than the 80 or so dollars that HP wants for the dock which only comes with 2 batteries anyway.  Skip the dock and save some $$$$!  Use the money you save to buy a bigger memory card, you will need one!  The 32 MB card it comes with fills quickly, about 23 pictures on the medium compression 5 MB picture quality setting.  You will want another card if you like to take lots of pictures.  I have a 256 MB card and that works great for me.<br />The quality of the pictures the HP935 takes is superb.  I am just thrilled with it.  It is easy to use and a wonderful value.  I got mine on buydig.com and they were really nice to me, and everything came as promised.  They have the best price I have seen online, even after you add shipping and handling.  I definitely recommend this camera!","I was a skeptic when HP came out with their line of cameras, but since I work in electronic retail I got a chance to play with it (and all other cameras) before choosing to buy it. Here's my list of reasons why I purchased it over other cameras:<br />- 5.3 megapixel<br />- 21x total zoom<br />- Automatic controls<br />- Video recording up to 90 seconds<br />- Consecutive shooting<br />- Pentax Lens<br />- Price was lower compared to most other 5.0 megapixel cameras<br />To me, these were a lot of features for the price.  Better zoom than most, if I need to get in close on a subject (of course optical is better than digital, but you will be spending quite a bit more for a camera with a higher optical zoom.  Best suited for \"professional\" photographers).  I can take video for longer bursts compared to most cameras (which are 15-30 seconds).  I have the options for manual controls.  On top of that, it has automatic settings, easy to use and navigate (simple layout, not too many buttons to confuse people, menu system is self-explanatory and easy), great color accuracy (though sometimes it's slightly muted) and can record audio clips for pictures. You can change the camera setting to \"removeable drive\" so you can put the pictures back on the camera.<br />Of course there are always cons, but only a few consistent ones.  It does have a shutter delay, but all cameras do (prime the focus to get around it.  Works with all cameras).  It's a little slow to save pictures, but if you press the shutter within 1 sec of the last picture, you'll take another (the consecutive shooting feature).  Keep in mind that this is a 5mp camera so larger files will take a little more time to save. It has only a few auto-modes, the macro shooting doesn't work well, the flash is excellent up to about 10ft only, and your choice of file size is either 5 or 1 megapixel (but the 1 megapixel pictures are quite good too). It's true that this camera loves batteries, but I can fill up 128mb card with 5mp pictures and video on one pair of rechargeable (anything else will get drained VERY FAST) AA and still have some juice left.  People who use the LCD screen like a CRUTCH will have less battery power. LCD screens in general don't show well when used outdoors.  I don't understand people who try to use it when it won't work well at all, or who even complain about it (and not just on cameras).  Slow startup time?  I'm not picky about the difference between 2 and 5 seconds.  Bad video?  It's a CAMERA, not a camcorder.<br />Reviews that complain about the printing, connectivity, card-errors, software, etc. either got a lemon, didn't do something,  have pc issues (I have lots of customers with pc issues on a weekly basis) which can interfere, or had expectations past what the camera can do.  Otherwise HP's software for their products is the best for ease of use and compatibility. If you're looking for a \"professional\" camera, this may not be it and you might want to spend a little more in a different brand.  But for most people who aren't \"professional\" photographers, then this is a spectacular buy. If I had to choose a different camera instead of this HP, it would probably be either a Canon or a Sony, since they have some great cameras. Probably a Canon though, since I like the manual controls and since I don't prefer the shape of most Sony DSCP cameras.","Back at the start of November 2003, I wrote a review of another HP digital camera, the HP Photosmart 435, a 3MP model. That review was hard to write, as I have had good experiences with HP products for a number of years, and the 435 was simply the worse HP product I had ever used. To give a fair review, I had to score that camera very low, and a part of me just could not reconcile the fact that HP had made a bad product.<br />With the HP Photosmart 935, I feel that HP has vindicated the trust I have always felt for their products. While not perfect, and in fact flawed in a very few places, the HP Photosmart 935 is a great camera, one I would happy replace my aging Kodak with.<br />The HP Photosmart 935 is a 36-bit 5.3 -megapixel digital camera sporting 3x optical zoom lens, using a 7.6MM - 22.8MM Pentax Zoom lens. It also has 7x Digital zoom, which for any serious picture taker or photographer knows to avoid like the plague. (Digital zoom is worthless if you want quality pictures.)<br />The 1.5 inch backlit LED (521x218 pixel) digital viewfinder is remarkable in its clarity, but suffers from the same ailment most viewfinders on digital cameras does, which is blurry and hard to view from any angle except right behind the unit. Not a criticism of the 935, but simply pointing out the need for better LCD's in all digital cameras.<br />The controls are easy to use, in both settings and operation. Too many cameras try to pack as much controls as they can on the top and back on their digital cameras, and while there are quite a few on the 935, all buttons and controls are easy to use and in appropriate spots, rather than a hodgepodge of tiny buttons clustered together. Kudos to HP for understanding that a degree in engineering should not be needed to simply change shutter speed, or even turn on/off the viewfinder to save battery life.<br />Speaking of battery life, I found that the HP Photosmart 935 goes through them like there is no tomorrow. A brand-new set of Duracell batteries (the 935 uses two AA for power) only lasted for fifty pictures before running too low to allow the viewfinder to work. While battery life can be prolonged simply by not using the viewfinder, getting close to 250 pictures before needing a battery change, I found that the 935 still used up batteries faster than any of the previous digital cameras I have used. I do applaud HP for using standard AA batteries rather than the more expensive, and harder to find, CR-V3 variety, power consumption may be an issue. Look for rechargeable batteries for this unit.","I think it like is in between. But it's like seem great!!!","I have been using this camera for a week and like it very much. I was looking for a good quality point-and-shoot camera that I could carry around more easily than by bulky Sony camera. The HP 935 is intuitive and easy to use, takes nice photos, and is quite compact. I like the LCD screen, which is brighter than others I have seen, although, as others have noted, it sucks up a lot of battery juice. The viewfinder works great too though, so you don't need the screen unless you want to review what you've shot.<br />Mine came with the dock, which I haven't used, except for charging the batteries, and viewing photos on a TV (the dock has composite video output). I pull the card out of the camera, and plug it into a card reader on my Mac - so I have no knowledge of the software that came with the HP.<br />Good value, compact, great photos!","This is a very good camera with an easy-to-use interface. It has very good quality and helpful features. It does guzzle batteries, but you can solve that easily by purchasing a AA recharger. The only bad thing is the lack of carrying case, but those are a dime a dozen.","I am not a tech-person so I have to pass on that this camera is a non-tech person's dream. Very easy to get started - intuitive interface that meant I could start taking photos (even having NEVER used a digital camera before) after reading the most basic info in the users manual which I'm grateful for as I received this camera for a Christmas present and wanted to use it right away.<br />I don't think you can get a 5.3 megapixel camera with a Pentax lense that compares to this camera for the price. Good value in my opinion.","I find this camera very nice to use and not complicated, although it does have several very decent features - good zoom, picture modes, menu system, etc.  You MUST get the dock.  It's worth the money.  I bought my set in a store as a package deal.  Nice going HP!","Excellent service... thank you Digicam + ...<br />  You did exactly as promised... you even sent it<br />  priority mail ... i got it within 72 hours...<br />  You get 5 stars in my book ...<br />  Highly recommend ... great price,great service.<br /><br />  satisfied customer,<br />  c.e. copeland","The HP 935 is one of the less expensive 5 MB cameras on the market and overall is a very good value.  But for another hundred or so bucks, you can choose between a few cameras with better image quality, larger zoom range and better exposure flexibility.  For example, I'd pony up the extra bucks for an Olympus C-50 or the HP 945 if I was going to bother buying a 5 MB camera.  Those two measured similarly on the test bench and both had better image quality than the 935.  Our C-50 has had constant use since its purchase and is doing a great job.","First let me say I read all the poor reviews (mostly because of battery life) and I haven't had any of these problems myself. I am not sure if HP 935's had a defect which they have since fixed? Anyway, I acknowledge the problem, but have not expierenced it myself. I was able to take 70-100 pictures before charging my batterys.<br />I bought the HP 935 just a few weeks ago and I love it. It is simple to use, but at the same time takes great pics! I also bought the docking bay and it makes it very easy to upload / print / edit pics.<br />The only complaint I have is the fact that you can only take pictures in 1mp or 5mp. There is no way to take 2mp,3mp or 4mp pictures. That doesn't really bother me, but it is a small disadvantage.<br />For the money this is a great buy.<br />As far as accessorys go get some NiMH batterys, some extra SD cards,  the camera dock and plenty of ink and photo paper! You are going to be printing beautiful photos right away!","I recently upgraded from an Olympus 3030 to a 5mp camera. After looking around, I bought the HP based on some samples pictures that looked clear, sharp and full of colour.  The 3X zoom is good and the controls are easy to use.  I mostly use it as a point and shoot but the manual in the camera has already made me a better photographer since I learn soemthing while taking the pictures. The style is the ebst but it an easy to sue camera that takes great pictures.  I read other reviews about battery life but have not had the same problems.  Highly recommended!","HP's new 5MP, 3x zoom digicam offers point-and-shoot ease to value buyers.  this camera will provide pictures for large prints or cropping.  uses HP's instant share system, making printing and sharing photos very simple.  however, performance lags the competition.<br />pros:<br />- accurate color reproduction<br />- very good auto white balance<br />- consistent contrast and wide dynamic range<br />- low noise at ISO 100 and 200<br />- good flash performance (limited range though), good exposure, good contrast, no color cast<br />- uses HP's instant share system makes it very easy to print and share photos<br />- easy to use interface<br />- clear full text message display<br />- has excellent in-camera manual that provides help each setting<br />- control over image parameters (tone, color, sharpness)<br />- audio clip recording<br />- optional dock provides additional functionality<br />- excellent battery life<br />- uses non-proprietary AA battery - just make sure to buy rechargeables<br />- includes a remote (for viewing images only)<br />- USB connectivity<br />- compact 3.8 x 1.8 x 2.6 in and light 9.9 oz<br />cons:<br />- extremely slow processing and file write times - this is a deal-breaker for me<br />- artifacts show up when you enlarge photos<br />- no AF assist lamp so you'll need some light for this camera to focus<br />- unimpressive macro performance<br />- no manual exposure mode and limited preset exposure modes - only 3 built in (sports, landscape, and portrait)<br />- aperture-priority mode only allows two apertures<br />- slow start-up: almost 5 seconds<br />- slow auto-focus with shutter lag in the 1.5 second range<br />- shot-to-shot time runs 2 to 3 seconds with no continuous-shooting mode<br />- dark and slow frame rate 1.5-inch LCD is difficult to see outdoors; what you see is jerky<br />- limited flash range of 8.2 feet<br />- only two image size options<br />- the supplied 32MB SD card is inadequate; be prepared to shell out more $$ for more memory<br />as indicated, this camera is very easy to use but the processing and file write times are glacial.  for the same price, a canon s50 will provide more flexibility and manual control yet still be a perfectly good point and shoot camera.","I have gone back and forth on buying a digital camera. I was going to buy the G3 via Cannon however the cost was [$$] plus it had only 4 mp. I wanted a good camera because I was going to Alaska to fish and hang out in and around Prince William Sound so I decided since Alaska has no sales tax, I would buy it in Anchorage. I went to Best Buy and the price was the same as Los Angeles so I went to Costco. They have the G3 but only via online so I was dissapointed but on the rack was the hp 935. It had more mp and seemed so easy to work. I bought it for less then [$$] and got the memory card and went out on my cruise. I took over 100 pictures in the best picture format and when I got home and printed them, I was so excited. Pictures I took looked so awesome. I was so thrilled. It is an easy camera to use. Sure others are better but for this price and mp, you cannot find a better camera. I stayed home this weekend and hung my pictures all at 8 x 10. I can go bigger then that but I need to get a new printer.","Well, what can i say. It's really a fantastic camera. i took only 50 pics in these 5 days, and the camera works great. Fast fast and fast. You can see the pictures really fast on the LCD, and just plug it in to the 8886 Digital Camera Dock and click the button. That's it, it dowloads the pictures and store them into  dated files so you can remember when you took them. You have the option to delete the downloaded pictures or leave them in the camera.<br />The menu is easy to use and i didn't even open the manual. I bought the SD256M-P card and now I will store 97 pictures @ 5.3MP.  I am waiting tomorrow to see how the new card will do and then will let you know if i have problems. i know there was the same card for less in amazon, but i spent more and bought the new one, with the -P in the end.<br />I bought also a Tamrac 5692 - Digital 2 Bag for the camera and I am set.","I bought this camera after seeing it on the Oprah show as one of her Favorite Things for Spring and now I know why.  It is a great camera!!  This is my first digital camera and when I was shopping around this was definitely the easier camera to use.  The LCD screen is great and when you choose an item or change a selection the camera explains in a sentence or two about the new selection and hints of when to use the setting.<br />This camera is not the smallest on the market but it is small and it is actually lighter than my friends Canon PowerShot 400.<br />I just got back from a trip from Colorado and my pictures were beautiful.  Very clean and crisp.  It was excellent during the day and in the evenings with low light.  It is a very quiet camera which was great when I hiking so I didn't disturb any wildlife.  I couldn't be happier.<br />I would definitely recommend and the price on Amazon is the best around!","An awsome camera. The only bad thing about it is, it drains batteries very quickly when using the live view.  Make sure to buy a more memory for it. The 32 meg that comes with it holds less then 16 pictures on the best quilty.","Just look at the options then compare this camera to any other with the same options.  You will be hard pressed to find a better camera for the price.  I have owned many HP products and I am not disappointed with this one.  Very easy to use, great picture, and outstaining quality when you print on a photo printer.<br />... Nice camera which price is unbeatable on any web site.<br />BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!","this camera is worth every bit of the money.it was up and running in less than 5 minutes.it had no software problems whatsoever..the software installed in about 4 minutes or less.on an hp 9995 with windows xp.it takes awesome pictures and they are real easy to unload into the computer.and with the easy share option its easy to share the pics online in a matter of seconds.this is a really easy camera to operate.you cannot find a better deal for the money for a 5.3 mp camera. i highly recomend this camera.  ps. my camera came with the 2.0 software.so you dont have to worry about the problem described in the other reviews.hp already took care of it.","... Personally, I think some of the HP Cameras are ugly...but I dont sleep with it,<br />and who can beat a 5.3MP DigiCam with a MSRP of [the price] ? I have mine on Windows XP>> NO PROBLEM. With a 128MB SD Card I get 48 High Res(5.3MP) Pix(I only take High Res)(1.0/5.3MP switchable) Recommend a 256MB or higher<br />card. Batteries? ,about the same as my Kodak, just use 1800MAH or higher,(2200MAH now available from MahaEnergy) have spares and limit viewscreen use as with all cams. Features... lots. Dock is great... [the price] EXTRA(MSRP). My Excellent deal... Provantage (ohio) Camera & Dock Bundle BOTH(look-up thier p/n  Q2218A)... smooth transaction. About the Cam Bag not included..so what<br />I spent [price] on a nice bag that fits in my Briefcase. OVERALL>>><br />Ugly...Performs...Unbeatable Value as of this writing. OH ,BuyDig<br />offers this cam for less than provantage BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE DOCK even though ad says so.(JERKS) KODAK...I still love ya, I just needed a 5MP NOW, for under five bills... and you didnt have it. My MLS Photos are now better than 95% of the others.<br />SWEET.","This is a really great camera.<br />I used to have a HP 318 which was awful.<br />I is rather heavy on the batteries (2xGP1800mAh) but the lcd display is really great but you can easily switch it off. It kinda just shows the image after it has been snapped which is nice. It is a really heavy and solid camera. The HP has the nice feature of quickly deleting the image while storing it. At 5MP i did not see much difference in the compression algorith between the * ** *** modes the files sizes being 512k, 1.2MB and 2.4-3.8MB only saw distortion when I zoomed in 6x.<br />You can store upto 208 photoes at 5MP and 1*, which is great size for emailing. The video mode is not great but only for close proximity videos(130k/sec). Just a note on the CD install, copy the HPSW dir to your PC and ecit the ini file to remove the last . after 945 otherwise the install will fail, HP has posted a update CD which can be ordered. There is also newer firmware for the camera posted 31/04/2003 which fixes some images. One really cool undocumented feature is this camera is also USB Flash Drive.<br />PS this camera is is a USB 1.1 device but USB2 interface compliant. Perhaps there will be a firmware update later.<br />I wish it came with a camera bag.<br />Cheers","Okay now this is a smart camera.<br />I used to have a HP 318 which took really bad pictures compared to this baby. At 5MP the images are huge(resolution). HP have definatey improved there compression algorithm(***) as the differece betwwen the 500k(*), 1200K(**), 2.4MB(***)images is very small (5MP). I had to zoom in 6x to see any difference.<br />The *** images were between 2.4 and 3.8MB get a little large to mail. I was able to store 208 pitures at 5MP at one * on a 128MB SD card<br />My main grouch with the phone is that it eats batteries for breakfast, I use GP 1800mAh's and each pair lasts about 4 hours, but then again I am using it constently. The drain is primarly from the magic lcd display that is really bright and clear, also well protected from the scratches. Now the video mode is really really bad don't even try take scenic\\panaramic shots as it does not have enough detail. It's okay with close up personal messages less that 2 or so meters. This baby has enough manual settings to make your head spin but none of your settings will beat the 'auto' setting which is always brilliant! Overall pics are really great. This camera is a really good buy. Pity it did not come with a bag to protect it, it is also nice heavy camera and is very solid. PS it does not have a USB2 interface it is however complaint with a USB2 host adapter but maybe there will be a firmware upgrade.<br />PS the CD that came with my install has a broken .ini file, youll need to copy the hpsw dir to your HDD and edit out the last . in the camera models not to install correctly.<br />Personally dont even install the software on XP.<br />Cheers<br />Eric"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot G5","amazon_reviews":["I bought this camera years ago and I was impressed with it then. I moved up to EOS, but I am not always able to carry around that camera. So, I went back to this one as being close to EOS but not quite. It is only 5MP but the quality is still amazing for a camera this old. I had forgotten about the movie function and I am glad to have that option even if it is only for three minutes max time. The manufacturer and user manual still claim that this takes up to a 1GB card. I have a 32GB card in mine and it works fine. I have a 1GB and a 2GB as backups. Overall, it is a great little camera for when you want more than an Elph but do not need as much as an EOS.","I am going on memories here but will get the used G5 soon-Most of the G series I have owned have been great. I have  a g1x and converted it to IR and miss the plain g models. I ordered a g9 to convert to full spectrum IR-and still miss my G5 from years back. There is something to be said for ccd sensors and larger pixels as the g5 has. Maybe I'll convert the g5 and keep the g 9 for carrying. I love Canon. Also have a 5d mk 2 . for real serious shooting.","A little 1990's but a great deal","Excellent camera.  Shipped as promised.  Thanks!","Still working good. It was taken care of very well.","Its 2015, and ive just bought a Nikon Coolpix for general use as I was disappointed with the lack of zoom on my camera phone.  Im told, even now, the lenses and sensors are still much better on a camera, even point and shoot than any phone. So, Nikkon Coolpix for a few hundred hit the mark. However, this Canon STILL blows even the Coolpix away, and any smartphone for sheer quality of those 5 megapixels. Today, im on 20MP, but its all noise. Just go check out the camera review archives and the sample pics, youll see what I mean – theyre so crisp and the colours great.<br /><br />If you want more than a pocket cam, these are going for a song, still great for doing what its supposed to – taking good quality pictures that you’ll love on the PC screen.","A++++++!","I bought this camera years ago and I was impressed with it then.

I have taken so many pictures with this one. It is absolutely great camera for beginners. I still have the camera with me even after 7 years.","This purchase was requested by a friend living overseas.<br />I ordered it for him and had it delivered to my house, because I wanted to prepare it for a long journey and make sure that will not get damaged on the way.<br />The package came well wrapped, so I didn't really needed to put any additional cushions into it.<br />I cannot say how the camera performed, but my friend called me two weeks later and told me that the camera arrived in a great condition, actually looks like new, had all parts as described and the performance is outstanding.<br /><br />Another great purchase at Amazon!!! Thank you!","I bought this camera new in 2004, I like it then and I like it now. It may be getting behind in technological terms, but it is still capable of creating fantastic photos. This is my travel camera, I own several cameras and as the user name implies, a nikon user and huge nikon fan. But Nikon still to date has not made a point and shoot camera that a DSLR user who wants more control should buy. Luckily Canon has, in the Powershot G series cameras.<br /><br />I have used this camera since 2004 and it has been trouble free and never once has it not performed like it should. It gives me lots of control of my photo shoots, has RAW abilities, takes pretty good photos, and is very easy to use.<br /><br />I would recommend anyone who is looking for a camera that will give you the control you like, without having to take your SLR everywhere, look into the G series cameras. If you don't mind some older features, the G5 will do very well for you. Right now they can be found for around $125 or so on ebay, which I think is a real bargain for what you are getting in return. I plan to keep this camera until it just dies, or there are no more batteries, CF, cards or accessories available. That is another thing, you can still readily find all the accessories for this camera, and find them at a very reasonable price.<br /><br />I do not agree with others who have complained about the picture quality or excessive purple fringing, neither have ever been a major problem for me, and I am very picky about the quality of photographs I make. If the photos were not up to my standards, i would have tossed this camera a long time ago and moved on. This a is very nice camera, even today. You don't keep and use something for 6 years if it is not up to standards. Look into the G5 if you are looking for a useful camera that will give you control over your photos, and you can leave that DSLR at home from time to time.","Using the G5 as a backup gives good quality images and allows for raw image capture. I really like it because it is a point and shoot with all the features of a professional SLR. Great camera even better price great deal for me.","It's been a number of years now that I've had my G5 and I've been very pleased with it. At the time I purchased it, it was the only camera with all the features I was looking for. The pictures are very sharp, the colours amazing, and the battery seems to go on forever! I absolutely love the swivel LCD screen and use it all the time (it was the only camera I knew of that had it at the time of purchase and one of the big reasons I chose it). It not only allows for unusual photos but it protects the screen as well. The remote is also very handy! The manual is well thought-out and easy to use. It doesn't come with a case but I was able to find one (Lowepro) at a local drugstore that fit the camera, battery, remote and a couple of memory cards quite nicely!<br /><br />My only complaints are that it sometimes takes a long time to focus-if it does at all-when the subject is low contrast (mind you, even some of those shots come out beautiful in an abstract way). It's also a bit big to carry with me everywhere so I've recently purchased another smaller Canon camera (I'll review that one once I've had a chance to play with it). Also, the design for the memory card slot needs to be redesigned as it's very difficult to get the card out (the 'door' does not allow you to get a firm enough grip on the card... and I've got tiny hands! It must be even more difficult for those with larger hands). Other than that I've been very happy with this camera.","I can't yet afford to buy this camera but, I used it for work when my company provided it while I was in Afghanistan. I used this camera to take shots from a blackhawk and was very impressed with the quality of the pictures. It did get grainy when I used digital zoom but, I have yet to use a camera that doesn't. When the price drops to my price range, I will definately buy one for personal use.","This is a very nice camera. The battery life on this lasts for several hours. The picture quality is excellent. It is fairly easy to use provided you actually look at the manual. It does take crystal clear, vivid color photos. I had used the one my husband borrowed from work to take pics of our new grand baby. My photos actually came out BETTER than the ones a professional photographer was paid to take the studio!!<br /><br />It is well worth the list price of around $800. If you can find a deal like I did then I would strongly advise you to grab this beauty!","I bought this camera used in the spring of 2004.  Since then, I have taken over 10,000 photos on many backpacking expeditions around the world.  If the camera died tomorrow, it would have been well worth the money invested in it - but it still is ticking and takes photos today just as well as it did when I first purchased it. It's sturdy body and ease of use really made this a great camera.","I have been really happy with the overall performance of this camera.  I love being able to change how many pixels I want for my photos.  I frequently will use the 5 pixel function so that I can later crop photos as necessary.  Sometimes I wish that the camera were smaller.  Also, we had to send the camera back to the manufacturer because the battery closure warped and the camera kept losing power.  They fixed it quickly and for free.  I was happy with the service.","I bought this camera after reviewing several other camera in the same price range. This is a great camera with most of the features I was looking for including a handy remote to take picture of the whole family. I love it...","I've been using this camera for 3 months, and have clicked about 1600 photos as of yesterday. Here's my take on it.<br /><br />- The lens is amazing. Fast and crystal clear. In digital cameras, the lens quality is more important than the mega-pixels beyond a certain point - for me personally that's 3.2MP<br /><br />- The battery lasts forever compared to other cameras in this range.<br /><br />- Tons of features, with amazing customization and configurability. I've taken beautiful photos in extremely low light conditions to very still pictures in high motion environments.<br /><br />- Very capable.<br /><br />- The package comes with everything you need. All the cables, remote control, charger, ac adapter etc... The only thing you have to buy is a big memory card.<br /><br />- The software drivers are nice, but the rest of the software is pretty useless. Download picasa ([...]) - it's better than iPhoto and is now free.<br /><br />- It is big and bulky (smaller than an SLR, but bigger than the S50). I bought this instead of the small S500 - at the time they cost the same; and have no regrets. The capabilities are worth the extra bulk.<br /><br />Read all the reviews of the purple fringing and chromatic aberrations. Here's my take<br /><br />- all cameras have them<br /><br />- personally, I've never noticed it.<br /><br />- the pictures look great when printed out or on the screen.<br /><br />- if you really want, you can fix them using software.","The lens seen through the view finder I knew about before purchase so I cant complain about that.<br />The Selector icons (auto, portrait etc.,)wore off after only a couple of months!! Cannon did replace the selector gratis, and I have now protected the icons on the top of the selector with a two part slow setting resin (72 hrs), this looks good and works perfectly.<br />Apart from the above this is a great Camera and I have been very happy with it and have taken thousands of great pictures in the year I have had it.<br />My friends wish they had my Camera and when they pull out their fancy Samsungs, HP's etc., there faces soon drop when they see what mine can do.","The camera has worked ok for me. I have been using it in my plastic surgery practice and it hasn't let me down so far. However there are a few short comings. First, it didnt come with a bag and i still havent found a suitable bag for it. Pretty mean of Canon ppl. Secondly the auto focus is sometimes frustratingly slow and sometimes just doesnt work. Third the flash is not good enough for indoors. It leaves the corners of the pictures dark.<br />Having said that....overall its a good camera and does give good pictures","I bought the Canon G5 about 3 months ago, best digital camera i ever owned. I still have my ELPH S230 which I carry around all the time, but this one is capable of fully manual and automatic settings, you can do everything  with this little gem. I do not know why the lens cap falling off bugs people so much, would you rather take that great shot with the lens cap on? I would give this camera 6 stars if I could.","Amazon, pay atention, may be the store had receive a bad parcel of G5, 'cause two customers had writen a review about bad battery.","Easy to operate user friendly and the best results","For the price, there are a lot of good cameras available. The G5 scores highest on picture quality, and the level of control you have over your photographs.<br />I did end up choosing the Fuji S7000 because I got a great deal - nearly $100 less than the amazon price for the G5. Also the Fuji has better zoom, and is much faster. However with a smaller $ difference - maybe $50? - I might have chosen the excellent G5. The 600+ shots I got to take with this camera left me really impressed.<br />The G5 has an excellent instruction manual that actually teaches you a thing or two about digital photography every time you look through it. The camera's menu is intuitive and easy to use. I have compared this camera with a few including the Nikon 5400, the Fuji S7000, Kodak DX 4490, and a few others and found it easiest to get \"true\" colors from the G5(I am still struggling with the Fuji).<br />The high quality LCD will show you a fairly accurate representation of your photograph. Nine out of ten digital cameras do not do that. The LCD also swivels - great feature to have if you want to avoid scratches.<br />There are some disadvantages as the other reviewers have pointed out - like the flash getting blocked by any lens attachments, camera being a little too big to carry around conveniently, limited zoom, difficult to hold in one hand, etc. However if picture quality and control are important, the G5 is hard to beat at the price.","When I was researching cameras, I wrote out a list of requirements that my camera had to have: high quality shots, sturdy build, easy to carry, hotshoe for additional flash, ability to add filters, rapid shot feature, manual and automatic settings, movie settings, red eye flash, timer, programable white balance, 3-5x optical zoom (has 4x), and takes CF cards (cheaper than other memory cards). When I entered all my requirements into [...] only 2 cameras showed up that met my requirements. After comparing the photo quality of the 2, the G5 was the obvious choice.<br />Before getting my G5, I had taken less than 500 pictures in my life. Now, after owning this camera for almost 2 months, I've taken well over 2500 pictures. Yes, 2500. It's just so easy to take a great picture with this camera that you will enjoy taking it with you everywhere!","I got this camera a week ago.  I would not recommend this camera to  others.  1) The optical viewfinder is partially blocked by the lens.  I find this very annoying.  It makes the optical viewfinder partially crippled.  2) Chromatic aberration.  If you shoot a back lighted object (say in front of a mirro with flash on) you will see a blue halo along the edge of the object.  3) Camera body not ergonomically designed.  It is hard to hold the camera with one hand, since the camera body does not fit the right hand ergonomically.  You will have to use both hands. 4) One has to remove the lens cap before turning on the camera.  This is also very annoying.  I wish I could keep the lens cap on with the camera turned on.  It protects the camera lens between shots.  5) Camera lens can be easily smeared without the cap.  It is not recessed deep enough.","This is a great camera but you have to work with it. The build is solid the optics are great, and the buttons and menus are very easy to navigate. I have printed slightly cropped 8x10's and the image quality is amazing many people have thought they were originally shot with film.<br />I only have two problems with the camera<br />  1) The autofocus really does not work well in low light but with a little practice you can use manual focus so I am not to concerned with this anymore.<br />  2) lots of noise above 100 iso. This is not a problem for me as I generally shoot macro or landscapes which I have not needed high iso's for.<br />  So other than these two things the 1000 plus photos I have taken in the last 3 months have completly amazed me.<br />P.S. This camera does it's job extremely well but if you are like me it will only increase your thirst for a digital slr.","Let me start by saying that I bought this camera because we couldn't get the PowerShot G3 in time (for the price I wanted). I was more than content with the 3.x Megapixels and wasn't looking to buy a 5MP camera.<br />That said, the G5 is a great camera, with many features that will make your mind boggle (time spent with the manual will definitely come in handy - btw, this is one of the better manuals I've seen). It comes with with an Automatic mode (read as mode for dummies who don't want to deal with aperture, speeds, modes etc.) or you can choose different modes (landscape, portait, nightshot, stitch assist etc...). The controls for these modes is on the top of the camera and is designed well. I tried all of them and it does make a difference compared to the default mode. The stitch assist was also easy to do with the software that comes with the camera. I doubt it that I will use this feature again, but it's nice to know that it exists if the need arises.<br />I was able to get the camera up and running quickly and transferring photos to the computer is a snap (just follow directions - equally well written manual) and you will be fine.<br />What is not designed so well is the series of buttons at the back - specifically the White Balance (WB) and Menu. My hand tends to hit the back of the camera when you are taking shots. Also on extended zoom the lens is unprotected, making me a little antsy.<br />Overall, I feel that this is too much camera for me. I still give it the 4 stars because it takes great pictures (get a 128MB memory stick as the 256MB memory stick has caused problems in the past - the 32MB that comes with it will not be adequate), it is easy to transfer and create an online photo album and the prints (4X6 as well as 5X7) that I developed are decent.","I've been disappointed with this camera.  While it has an abundance of features, the controls are annoying and confusing in many respects.<br />For example, the auto shutoff delay, which is relatively short, can't be adjusted: if you opt to have it enabled, count on the camera being off just when the perfect picture presents itself.<br />The on/off and zoom buttons are small and clumsy to use.  Other controls are nonintuitive: expect to spend a lot of time with the manual.<br />Serious purple fringing is evident in the images, a dissapointment for a maker of Canon's reputation.<br />I'm not a novice: my first \"serious\" camera was a Minolta SRT-101 (in the late '70's), and I've since owned a succession of Olympus, Nikon and Canon SLR's.  Currently I use a Canon Elan 7 for film photography, and it's a fantastic camera.  Prior the G5 I was using a Kodak DC 4800 3mp model for digital photography: it was much easier to use and the image quality was nearly as good as the G5's.<br />If you're considering this camera, be sure and take it for an extended test drive to make sure the controls suit you.","I am not a professional photographer, but I love taking artful and beatiful pictures. This camera is allowing me to fully learn the art of photography. It is versatile enough to allow me to try anything I want to.<br />I would say that this camera is more than needed if all you want to do is take point and shoot snapshots. You can do that with this camera, but you can do so much more.<br />For someone who, like me, is becoming a serious amateur photographer I would say this a great camera. I have been very happy. I would also say get a photography how-to book. I'm reading \"The Basic Book of Photography\" by Tom & Michelle Grimm. Read that along with the manual that comes with the camera and you can use all the knowledge from the book.<br />Get Photoshop Elements and a companion how-to book. I use Scott Kelby's Photoshop Elements for Digital Photographers. With Photoshop you can make a good picture look great.<br />Get a quality photo printer. I got Canon's i860. It does a fantastic job at making gorgeous prints, and it's quick.<br />With all of these compontents a whole new world is opening up. If you have a Mac, like me, all of these components work together seamlessly.<br />The camera is fun and easy to use. I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone interested in getting serious about photography.","There's plenty of repetition in the reviews you'll read about the G5. Here are a couple thoughts I haven't seen expressed yet.<br />First, this is a compact camera, and that means the lens is made to tuck well into the body. The protective shell only extends part way out to keep the profile slim, so the fragile lens is somewhat vulnerable when extended. This is also the case with other maker's compact cameras. One solution is to add the lens/filter adapter, but if you've got any sense of style you'll be put off by its contrasting gray color. This, by the way, is the only way to add a protective UV or other filters - the lens barrel itself is not threaded. For a camera at this price and with these capabilities, the user should have a threaded barrel and sturdier lens construction.<br />Second gripe is the placement of the controls on the back of the camera. I have average sized hands, but my thumb constantly bumps either the white balance or set buttons. It's more of an annoyance than a problem though, because they keys rarely engage from the contact.<br />Canon clearly recognized both these issues, because they've fixed both in the new Pro 1.<br />But don't let these turn you off. It's a fine, full featured compact camera.","If I could give this 4 1/2 stars, I would, but I can't.  The G5 is a great digital camera for all kinds of users, however is simply too much camera for most people that will want to take snapshots; many people won't even touch on using or even understanding all of the features the G5 has unless they have some photography experience.<br />The lens is quite good, it's very sharp no matter the aperature used, the autofocus is of average speed, and the zoom is roughly equivalent to a 35-140mm on a film SLR - you get a pretty good range of focal lengths as long as you don't need wide angle or extreme telephoto shots.  Bokeh is okay at wide aperatures, but don't expect it to compare with a good SLR lens, because it won't.  Macro shots are very good, with little distortion, sharp focus, and decent bokeh.<br />Image quality of the pictures is excellent - colors are balanced and realistic, and edges aren't oversharpened at all, 8x10s look fantastic but I have yet to print anything larger (The G5 should be able to make a nice 11x14 print).<br />Featurewise, the G5 is very well rounded - it has a full auto mode, which works quite well, except the auto exposure for shots using the flash tends to overexpose the picture (This does not bug me since I usually use manual or priority modes), it had a program mode which gives you some control over the camera settings, and various manual modes including full manual, aperature priority, shutter priority, and also several scene modes for taking portraits, night landscapes, and more.<br />My biggest complaint with the G5 is that it takes very noisy pictures at a given ISO - ISO 400 is utterly useless for taking shots because they are so grainy, ISO 200 is usable but I wouldn't print an 8x10 with it, and ISO 50 and 100 are okay - this camera is great for outdoor shots but if you need something to work with inside without a flash, you are better off with a D-SLR of some sort.<br />Ergonomically, the G5 is great, it's well built, easy to hold, and all of the controls are easy to reach and intuitive.  There are numerous functions however, and it will take most people a while to become accustomed to and comfortable with all of the camera's features.  The flip out LCD is a very useful feature, and it has helped me take many shots that I couldn't have made otherwise.<br />Overall, it is a very good all around digicam, but for some people with specific needs (Long zoom, wide angle, indoor shots without flash), there are better choices.  I strongly reccomend this for people with photography experience, but it is complete and total overkill for someone that wants to take snapshots.","I ordered a G5 for work--we do a fair bit of digital imaging.  We were very impressed with the resolution and sharpness of the images.  I was reasonably pleased with the interface, though the other person who tried the camera thought the menus were too complex.  HOWEVER .. this camera had very pronounced chromatic aberration showing at the boundary of light and dark areas in high-contrast situations.  The dreaded \"purple fringing.\"  We had to send the camera back.  It may be that this was an early lens or coating and this will be fixed in cameras produced later than the one we bought (December 2003).  And it might not bother some users at all.  But we thought it was unacceptable for a $600 camera.  :-(","I love my 2 Megapixel Canon Elph. Small, sharp and reliable - during its time, it was all I could ask for.  I even sold a couple of its pictures to magazines, so what's not to love?  While I have not discarded my Elph, I recently moved up to the G5 because it's better in every way. With a fast 4X optical zoom (all the way out to a 35mm-camera-equivalent of 140MM) and 5 megapixel chip, it could easily become my new favorite camera. The manual is thick but it uses a lot of illustrations and the text is surprisingly clear and simple so the reader should not be intimidated. Not being one to read manuals, I was able to take the G5 out of the box and immediately shoot pictures without cracking the book (the battery came out of the box with a decent charge too - how cool is that?) That's how simple and intuitive the camera is. I have already made a few 8X10 prints on my Canon color printer and they are sharp, show excellent contrast and have good color balance too. Like most auto-focus digital cameras there is a brief shutter lag. It's not too bad but the shutter release is certainly not as quick as one of my 35mm Leicas. Speaking of Leica, the shape and size of the G5 is very close to that of the classic Leica M series cameras. And the clever design of the battery case allows it to serve as a grip - I found it comfortable and secure. (Note: a similar grip is a [$$$]option on a 35mm rangefinder Leica!) I don't like the fact that you can't screw a UV, skylight or other kind of filter on the front of the lens. I like to have a good quality filter on the front of my lenses for protection - but that's me. For the average camera user, there are 2 auto exposure settings that should cover the vast majority of shooting situations. (I used \"P\" and got an \"included in the box\" 32mb compact flash card full of great exposures.) For the advanced photographer, the G5 comes with just about every manual control you could need or want - similar to those on their excellent EOS 1V pro camera. One cool feature is the ability to capture a shot in both RAW and JPEG at the same time. This feature will give you a \"pure\" file with no data loss due to compression and will allow you to make the largest, sharpest print possible. (The manual says that the RAW file is compressed, but there is no data loss - must be a new form of Japanese magic!) Bottom line, the RAW format will give you the biggest file with the most information. I suspect that a RAW file will allow the careful user (i.e., one who is fussy about focus, exposure and camera shake) to make an 11X14 inch print that is as good as any 35mm camera (maybe better!)  When compared against the many excellent digital cameras out there, the Canon is a stand out. Its size, resolution, simplicity, and Canon's excellent reputation for reliability made it and easy choice for me.","I bought this camera knowing its drawbacks, and would still buy it again, but just so you know, here are the issues: (1) the wonderful lens is completely exposed w/o the lens cap and the lens cap falls off very easily--it has to, because if you press \"on\" without removing the lens cap, if the lens cap didn't fall off as the lens extended, the gears would strip. (2) to fix the first issue, you can buy the lens adapter and screw on a 58mm filter but this adapter is so large that it interferes with internal flash coverage, creating a black cast in the bottom right of pictures and also, it makes the optical viewfinder unusable. (3) even w/o the adapter, when using the optical viewfinder, the lens blocks a small corner of the view on widest angle. Why use the viewfinder? If you're following action, LCD displays may not have quick enough response from picture to picture. You might want to wait until the replacement for this camera comes along, sometime in the Spring I hear. (Addendum Feb-04. Check out the new Canon Pro-1!","Bought the G5 after an intensive search, comparing w comparably priced Nikon, Sony, Olympus, among others, having owned the Olympus 3040 for several years.<br />The G5 has a few quirks that some enjoy beating Canon up over: yes, on wide angle shots looking through the viewfinder you see a (small) piece of the lens; yes, the G5's major enhancement over the G3 is a mere megapixel; and some speak of noise at higher ISOs and chromatic aberration in some pics that one would not expect in a $600 digital.<br />I haven't seen a hint of noise (shooting primarily at 50 or 100 ISO) or chromatic aberration after hundreds of pictures, and one quickly adapts to the tiny piece of lens one sees in the viewfinder at the wide angle.<br />How about what's right?<br />1) great pics--vibrant, detailed and sharp<br />2) a fabulously flexible LCD that makes taking pictures from any angle a breeze (not to mention the delight my 5 year old gets in seeing herself as I take the pic.<br />3) excellent, easy-to-use software, light years ahead of the Olympus software I had been using<br />4) coherent, reasonably well written and helpful manuals<br />5) wealth of exciting and genuinely useful features--including ability to convert a shot to RAW after you've taken it, 4X optical zoom (35-140), easy menus to navigate, controls that make sense on the camera body, great panorama function (with excellent software--it works!), strong flash (for a compact), and a whole lot more.<br />This camera delivers high quality pics, sophisticated features, a well-designed body at a size that still fits in the pocket and all at a reasonable price, given what you get.  Highly recommended!","I've been borrowing a digital camera for ages - debating between the digital rebel & the G5.<br />WHY did I wait so long???<br />I finally decided that since I never used my SLR, I'd probably never use the digital rebel.<br />I've used my G5 daily since its arrival & the only problems I've encountered were as a result of my failure to read the manual!<br />I'd buy it again in a heartbeat!","Don't forget that the G3/G5 are using the Compactflash memories... which mean you can use the 1Go and 4Go megadrives from Hitachi (previously built by IBM). When I go on week-ends/vacation, I'm worse than a japanese busload: I shoot, I shoot, I bracket, I'm at the biggest resolution and I don't worry about the memory.<br />The result? On a 300 to 500 pictures week-end (G3 w/1Go microdrive), I can decently go to my Walgreens and print 5 to 10 AWESOME 8x10 pictures.<br />For less amateurs people, you can use this way the RAW format and still have room in your memory.<br />Conclusion : when you choose your camera, don't forget that you won't have always your computer around to unload your memory sticks. Check also the price per Mo.<br />Go Compact Flash !! Go Microdrive !! Go G3/G5 !!!","NO, I bought the G3 rather than the G5 because of some less-than-favorable reviews of putting a bigger engine in the same frame. The G5 [other than for the black drag] is a Powershot G3 with a five- rather than a four-megapixel CCD sensor. Canon seems to have put just a finer-grained CCD in the exact same body as the G3, causing chromatic aberration and increased digital noise, with little gain in picture quality, in an effort to keep up with the competition. My suggestion is either to get a G3 (top rated by Consumer Reports) at a great price, or wait for Canon's sure-to-come-soon top quality prosumer camera with larger CCD.<br />The G5 is just an annual model change, rather than a genuinely new revision.","Hi everybody.<br />I may make few spelling mistakes, but my review for G5 is sharp, true and clear.<br />Let's get started. I bought G5 and I am happy about it. I red prefessional reviews and comparisons and let me tell you something. Regardless what they say about purple fireing and increased noise, canon G5 gets the sharpest and cleanest picture of 5 megapixel sensor out there. I even compared it with fuifilm s7000 (6.4 megapixel camera), G5 brings more details and better colors. The shapes of the objects are original and edges don't diffuse like all other cameras of this price range (+ - $200) except canon digital rebel 300D. All other cameras have problems either with their not enough bright lenses or not as good CCD sensor. They all try to compete with canon and this is how cheap they do it...><br />They run noise reduction algorithms before the picture is being saved in memory and their pictures loose lots of details, objects loose edges and their pictures look more like a painting. This is why canon has the sharpest picture. If you take orginal G5 photo in photoshop and do noise reduction, the resulting picture will have a micro low noise, far less than any sony, nicon, olympus, or anything else out there, while still keeping the sharpest picture compared to all cameras above. The profesional reviewers fall for this as I can see from what I am reading, and they rate canon g5 as having the sharpest picture but worst noise, sending wrong message to readers about the canon true quality. In fact canon g5 original picture has far the least noise from its 1.8 inch CCD, however canon technicians don't run noise reduction algorithms and leave this option up for users. Or just do this - set up low sharpness mode and you will get the most noise free pics compared to the competition while still being the sharpest.<br />If you ask me I prefer high sharpness, which increases the noise slightly, but improves the contrast and sharpness of the picture. When you print out picture like this you will get the best looking prints since noise levels come in question only if you zoom in the picture in your computer, but for the droplets of the printer good color and sharpness is what counts the most for best prints.<br />If you are looking for better quality and original noise free pictures buy digital rebel 300D. I didn't buy this camera only because my dad would kill me thinking that I spent a lot of money for a camera. Another reason was that this one is smaller and fits very tight in a little bag, making it perfect for \"bring me anywhere\" while having the image of a turist and photo satisfaction of a pro.<br />Made one mistake though....>>>>>><br />Didn't look at canon S50 - the best value on the market. I give it 6 stars for the price matched with its quality, size and weight.<br />Listen to me. Buy S50 today - or wait for even better deals.","Camera takes awesome pictures right out of the box.  Best value by far in it's price point.  However, the autofocus was just too slow for me.  I shoot mainly action shots, kids sports, moving objects etc, some low light stuff too.  It was common for it to take 4+ seconds to focus in standard room lighting in Auto mode.  I went to a local store and tried the Cannon Digital Rebel.  If you've got the extra $350, do it.  I was totally amazed with the Rebel.  Focus was next to instant, and image quality was the best I've ever seen.  I returned the G5 and am waiting for my Rebel!<br />The G5 is no slouch, and at $650/5MP, you can't find a better camera in my opinion.  Just wish the focus was a little quicker, because I loved everything else about the unit.","Buying a camera, like buying most things, is a trade-off - there is no single right answer. On one hand, it's \"horses for courses\" (get something suitable for the type of photography you plan to do). On the other, we each must weigh the features of different models against each other, prioritize our personal wants and preferences against the price, and decide what is best for us. It's subjective and personal.<br />I had already had a Canon Powershot S20 for a few years when I decided to get a Canon G5. Why should I want to do that? Was I dissatisfied with the S20, with its limited manual operation features, 3MP resolution and 2× optical zoom? No; I had originally planned to keep both, but I have found that the G5 is not so much bigger after all, so I am going to sell the S20. I just don't need both of them.<br />While the G5 is still a small camera, there are many things it can do that the S20 cannot. Of course, there are still a few things the G5 cannot do, but for the general sort of photography I do, they are not many.<br />Here are the main issues, chosen partly in the light of other users' (sometimes negative) reviews of this camera:<br />1 Do I need 5MP resolution? Yes - mainly so I can crop a good chunk of the original image when I need to, which is quite often.<br />2 Do I need the 4× optical zoom? Yes. I don't have the wide-angle or tele lens converters yet, but I may get them later.<br />3 Do I need the fully manual control and the many focussing and exposure options? Yes - quite frequently (more often now that I have them, of course).<br />4 Do I like the ergonomics and aesthetics of the G5. No question. A few minor quibbles, but nothing serious.<br />5 Good value for money? I think so. Actually I think that most competing products are also good value for money. We get more for our dollar in photography now than ever before.<br />Comments on some specific complaints that have surfaced in other reviews:<br />1 Chromatic aberration (manifests itself as purple fringing under certain light conditions): I conducted a very thorough review of reviews before I bought this camera, and I decided to risk it. I am glad I did. The problem exists, but under practical (not test) conditions it is rarely noticeable. You may see it in very contrasty parts of a picture (e.g. bright lights against a dark background) when you are using an aperture wider than about F/4. This problem seems to be somewhat worse in the G5 than in some other cameras partly because it has a faster lens, which I hardly see as a fault. In all other respects this lens is as good as any, and better than most.<br />2 The noise issue: at higher gain settings (`film speeds'), all digital cameras show increased noise. The G5, according to some reviews, is rather worse in this than some other cameras. However, according to the same reviews, the G5 shows higher gain than most other cameras for any given setting. ISO 400 on the G5 actually seems to be about ISO 700 on other cameras. In the end, I could not really see any difference in normal use. I use ISO 50 most of the time anyway.<br />3 The viewfinder: to avoid getting part of the lens barrel in the viewfinder at wide angles, the viewfinder would need to be located further from the lens, which would require a bigger body, or else you would have to have a smaller lens. It's just another trade-off. Some cameras avoid this problem by just not having a viewfinder at all. There are times, however, when a viewfinder is the best way to frame the picture, at least for me. I can live with this.<br />4 The lens cap: lens caps are a necessary evil with any lens that does not retract more or less fully into the camera. The G5 has a simple (but nicely molded, not at all cheap-looking) plastic lens cap that comes off quite easily. This is surely intentional, because if you turn the camera on before removing the lens cap, it gets pushed off by the extending lens without damaging the zoom mechanism.<br />Overall rating? I'm giving it 5 stars, partly to offset some of the absurdly low ratings given by other reviewers. Otherwise I'd have given it about four-and-a-half.","Hi,<br />I got this camera, but it seems that as per Amazon policy the $50 coupon for $250 or more in Electrnoics is not valid for this item.<br />So I would reccomend the users to email the customer service in Amazon.com, before buying this.","G-day..from down under..my name is Montana..<br />ok we have heard the pro's, the cons etc...<br />I my self had a sony V1 for 2 weeks and retuned it for the G5<br />yes the V1 has a faster auto focus and fancy electronic beams night mode, how ever the V1 lcd screen in daylight is hopless and talking about the lcd screen if you are looking threw the view finder your nose is squashed up against it...<br />the auto white balance lets not talk about that..the memory cards to expensive and last but least Sony havent quite got it right with there colours there is a blue cast in every picture..<br />Well now the G5 it feels like a camera looks like a camera, with the focus you nead a little time..it comes good..study the Camera User Guide and you cant go wrong..good pics good controls fantastic Lcd flip-out a poor mans SLR..buy it and let your fingers do the walking POINT AND SHOOT..see-ya..<br />Montana","I had to write this to laugh at the guy that said the Nikon 5400 is better.  Yeah it is, just don't plan on taking any pictures indoors, or in any poor light!!  The POS Nikons don't have AF assist.  If Nikon does not get on the ball, they will start losing market share to Casio.<br />The G5 is a great camera.  Funny how people say the S50 is better also, or any of the small P&S cameras.  I have a little piece of info for ya'll, most are locked at 50 or 100 ISO, that's why there is so little noise.<br />Keep your G5 locked at ISO 50, and it will blow them all away!!","I have had this camera for over a month now and all I can tell you is that if you are looking for a solid 5 MP camera, look no further.<br />This camera is very easy to use but still gives you the manual control when you want it.<br />My largest gripe is the very poor lens cap.  I see why they make it so easy to come off, due to the lens pops out at start up but I think Canon could have done better with the design of this.<br />Also, the gripe about looking though the view finder and seeing the lens if valid but I very rarely, if ever, use it and secondly only blocks out about 1/16 of the field of view in the lower left corner.<br />In summary this is a great camera and I have no regrets about buying it!!!!","I use a pro model digital SLR for my important work and purchased the G5 for a handy travel camera and for candids at parties,etc. I had previously used the Canon G2 for this purpose,but wanted more resolution in case I got a shot that I wanted to enlarge to 11X14. The Canon G5 fits the bill.It does everything I ask it to do and does it well. I agree that the noise produced above ISO rating 100 is unacceptable,but the ISO setting of 50 for the G5 is equal to 100 on other cameras and the 100 setting is equal to 200. I find that with the availability of f.2 to f.3 speedy aperture I find little need to shoot at any higher ISO. As far as the complaints I've read regarding soft images and poor focus,I have not found this to be the case.After taking around 800 shots with the G5 I can say that the images are very sharp with no focus problems.Perhaps the complaints stem from the users technique. Yes,the shutter lag is a pain,but shutter lag is a problem with all compact digital cameras.If you don't need enlargements beyond 8X10 then go with the less expensive G3,but if you want enlargements up to 16X20 and don't want to invest in a digital SLR I think you'll be more than happy with the G5. Shoot at ISO 50 when possible. Keep in mind that a vast number of the best published 35mm images are shot on Fujifilm Velvia (ISO rating 50).","I bought this camera to replace a 2mp camera that allowed no control over aperture and speed and to give me the greater resolution that would allow larger than 8x10 prints. I was very pleased with the menu structure and layout of the controls but I was very surprised to see the lens barrel visible through the optical viewfinder, obscuring the lower left part of a shot unless the camera is zoomed in. The lens is outstanding, and shots taken at ISO 50 are wonderfully free of noise even in low light. What killed the camera for me is the autofocus. For some reason it often has a hard time finding focus. In several situations from macro to landscape and at various light levels the autofocus would hunt for seconds and then occasionally would give up and lose focus entirely. The conditions mentioned in the manual that might cause difficulty with focus were not present. Of course, I could focus manually but that can be a tedious task using the LCD display (and not just with this camera), especially in bright light. The camera has a good feel and is easy to use but I finally gave it up from the frustration with focus. I bought an Olympus C-5050 which is not quite so easy to use but the autofocus is rapid and reliable. I frequently see a shot where I must get the camera out and on it quickly and the G5 couldn't be counted on.","I am huge Canon fan and have found the G5 disappointing --  Pros: Compact body, good battery, EOS dial features, up to 1GB memory, works with Speedlite EX flashes, good stop action photos, good menus, good electronics.  Cons:  The higher ASA does not work.  Flash, particularly EX needed to shoot indoor photos, lots of grain, viewfinder gets the lens in the window!  This camera needs a lot of lite to get a crisp image, indoors or out.  Focus is soft.  I had a digital elph S100 and found that to be better focus.  Get an Elph or SLR but bypass the G5.  This hybrid is lacking.","Wasn't sure if I wanted to buy the camera due to critical information that people have gave the product dissing it and giving bad opinions so I talked to a few professional photographers on the G5 and they had said it was well worth the money for being the best Digital advanced point and shoot so far by Canon,having 12 Eos based features as well.<br />As an amateur photographer I have no regrets at all, it is an awesome camera!","I recently bought the G5 and I am extremely happy with it. When deciding which camera to buy, I was initially put off by the numerous negative comments (especially on here). But when I compared the G5 with its competition (Nikon, Sony, Olympus etc) it was clearly a hands-down winner in terms of overall features and image quality.<br />So why the bad reviews? Because this is a series, G1, G2, G3 and some reviewers here are comparing this camera against its predecessors. So yes, G3 users may be disappointed with the G5, but only because they've been spoilt with the G3. Giving the Canon G5 1 or 2 stars is plain silly.<br />This is a 5 star camera, and it knocks the socks off its competiton. When reviewers give ratings, they ought to rate the camera on its own merits, or compare it to its competitors, but to give it a low rating becase it doesn't live up to elevated expectations is wrong.<br />It is also very unhelpful to potential buyers who may be put off by the low rating, buy another brand, and end up with a camera that is \"surprisingly good\" and \"surpassed expectations\", but which is sadly inferior.<br />Disappointment noted, but the G5 is clearly the best in its class, and well deserving of 5 stars.","I upgraded from a Kodak DC280, which I loved. Kodak just didn't make anything that I felt was an upgrade to the 280. I compared all brands on market and went with this one. I am very happy so far.<br />The zoom and clarity is great. There is alot to learn as far as the functions go, but that is to be expected. It does have a pretty easy \"point & shoot\" capability also.<br />I wouldn't suggest this camera for a digital camera beginner, but it is a very nice upgrade for someone with a little more knowledge and higher expectations.","this is a full-featured camera that you use as a point-and-shoot and still have the flexibility to be more creative when you want.  this fills the niche between the excellent canon s50 5MP digicam and the d-SLRs.<br />pros:<br />- excellent resolution from a small lens - 5MP power!<br />- 4x optical zoom<br />- good metering and good tonal balance - maintains shadow detail<br />- good natural light white balance, strong and balanced colours<br />- allows control over cameras internal processing algorithms - saturation, tone, sharpness<br />- fast lens (F2.0 - F3.0)<br />- low noise at ISO 50 (keep in mind that ISO 50 for this camera is actually ISO 100 for everyone else; likewise, ISO 100 is in reality closer to ISO 200, etc)<br />- shooting priority play mode - simply half-press the shutter during playback and you're ready to shoot<br />- impressive range of manual controls<br />- very good shot-to-shot times, considering the larger files due to the higher resolution<br />- nice metallic black finish - i definitely prefer this to the silver finish of other compact cameras<br />- great fold-out LCD: nice and bright PLUS it folds away when not in use (less likely it'll get scratched)<br />- fairly good startup time, especially for an extending lens camera<br />- the manual focus has magnified loupe and ruler readout<br />- flexible continuous shooting modes (buffer after processing)<br />- RAW file format maintains 12-bits of data<br />- ability to turn JPEG shot into RAW during record review<br />- Compact Flash Type I/II and official Microdrive support<br />- voice annotation feature<br />- has a hot-shoe that allows the use of an external flash<br />- invervalometer (time lapse capability)<br />- AF assist lamp works well<br />- has an included IR remote control<br />- nice optional accessory portfolio to choose from<br />- excellent battery life<br />- USB connectivity<br />cons:<br />- where's the nine-point AiAF that's standard in Canon's own S50?<br />- you'll need to remove from tripod to open the battery/CF compartment<br />- AF Assist lamp doesn't have enough power at telephoto zoom<br />- viewfinder partially obstructed by lens barrel<br />- zoom controller does not have enough steps / multiple zoom speed<br />you would choose the G5 over over the s50 if you value flexibility over compactness (and you don't want to go all the way to the d-SLR range).<br />you would choose this over the G3 because of the higher resolution, which more than makes up for the higher noise levels of the G5.<br />this is a fantastic camera - highly recommended. enjoy!","Excellent Camera for advanced hobbiest.  I've had it for 2 months now and love it to death compared to my G2.  Pictures are great at ISO 50 and 100 but noisy above that.  Camera allows full manual control for great pictures but the auto features are lacking somewhat.  If you like manual control and great pictures, but can't afford a dSLR, then this is it.  If you're looking for a point and shoot auto mode camera you shouldn't even be in this price range anyway.<br />joe","I got my Canon G5 on 7-23-03 and I love it.  I took some photos as a test to compare it to my Canon G1.  WOW, what a difference.<br />The depth of field has improved a LOT.  Now, you can photograph the same road, and see a 1/2 mile down the road in clear focus rather than a blurry end.  You can pick out license plate #s two blocks away from where you took the photo.  Ever taken a photo of a purple flower and had it come out blue and awful?  I took photos of some purple flowers and they came out crisp and gorgeous deep color purple.  Like to photograph insects?  WOW, you get to see them CLOSE UP.  The macro function is astounding.  You can see the detail of fly eyes and misquito wing structure.  The detail on my cats teeth is totally awesome using the macro function.  I can see every bit of smile and every little scale on his tongue.  Like photographing nighttime views over a moonlit water?  MAN, it is so awesome using the night scene mode.  You can get moonlight over the ocean and buildings lit up over the bay in clear focus with no pixelation.  They must have fixed that.<br />About the fringing and the noise - if you take photos with a film camera, you know how tough it is to get a good photo at dusk or in shadow.  The digital camera is doing what you tell it to, if it isn't coming out right, try a different time of day or use the flash!  If you are photographing a building against the sun, DUH, it's going to have fringing around the edges.  The sky will look white if you photograph an object with the sun behind it.  Try using the white balance controls - this camera has so much you can test and try out.  Read the manual.  Try every function on the camera before you give up.  Having trouble focusing?  The dumb Conversion Lens Adapter LA-DC58B made especially for the Canon G5 is to blame, in my opinion, because when I take it off, WOW, OMG, the photos are perfect.  I think the adapter blocks the focusing beam.<br />Pros - quality, crisp, clear closeup/macro photos, great depth of field in focus, rich color tones, tons of functions<br />Cons - a lot to learn in order to use it properly , but the best things in life require work, time, and dedication.","I don't agree with the review of some people who rated the G5 with very low score.  I just bought my Canon G5 and the camera is awesome.  The pictures I took with the Canon G5 are very beautiful.  Canon in my opinion make some of the best digital camera out there.  I use Canon, Nikon and Olympus digital camera before and Canon is by far the best.  The only other camera I would be interested in buying is the Canon 10D, but the camera is out of my budget at this very moment. ...","Many people will find it hard to believe that they're better off with the nearly identical 4 megapixel G3. Reviews by dedicated digital photo sites conclude that the G5 introduces significant noise into images causing the effect of extra resolution to be cancelled out by the degradation in image quality. Canon had to produce this camera because of our obsession with pixel count and in spite of the fact that all of the reviews of the G3 conclude that its combination of a clean sensor and excellent optics give it an edge over most 5 MP camers.<br />Furthermore, very few people actually need 4 megapixels, much less 5. I had a hard time accepting this myself, until I printed out a couple 8x10s from my G3. 5 megapixels will simply mean that your memory card gets filled sooner, and each image will take longer to write to the compact flash card. Unfortunately, people look at pixel count much the same way as they do processor speed in computers. This is why we see folks buying P4 machines with 15\" monitors and 128MB of RAM.<br />The G3, with its less noisy sensor and lower price is the sensible choice. It's a better camera for less, but most won't see it that way.","The G5 is an incremental improvement over the G3 model rather than the revolutionary jump some Canon users were expecting. G2 and G3 users (other than the gear-obsessed) probably won't be lining up to trade in their cameras, but new users, or those upgrading from 2Mpixel cameras will find the G5 to be an excellent choice.<br />It's still not quite the ideal compact for my purposes. The zoom range, equivalent to a 35mm-140mm lens on a 35mm camera, just isn't wide enough for what I want to do. I'd rather sacrifice the 140mm end and get something with a perspective equal to a 24mm-100mm lens, which would give you a long enough focal length for decent portraits and provide a good wide angle for indoor shots and landscapes.<br />That aside, this is still an excellent camera for someone coming over from film. Resolution is sufficent to produce really excellent 8x10s with a little Photoshop fine-tuning. The manual controls are all you'd ask for. The fast f/2 lens allows shooting at high resolution in dim light. And the ability to link to the various Canon TTL flashes proides for exceptional control over lighting.<br />So while I'm not quite ready to trade in my G2, the G5 would certainly be my first choice if I was moving over from film or a lower resoltuion camera.","It is simple. Nikon makes the best SLRs. Canon makes the best digital cameras. This is particularly true in the prosumer range, where Canon's Powershot Gx series beats them all with its ease of use (both hardware and software), in looks and holding comfort (which is a subjective opinion, and this is mine), in the sheer realism of the pictures etc etc.<br />I own both the G2 and the G3, the latter being a upgrade more for the purposes of competitive response than anything else -- different bodyline, somewhat higher pixel ratio etc. Now, G5 may come across as the same with little to show for, except its black paintjob and the insiginficantly higher pixel ratio. A tad disappointing for us Canon aficianados who were expecting a bit more from the next in the series.<br />WHAT'S NEW:<br />(1) Black body. Personally, I have gotten used to the silver finish, which appeals to me. I hope Canon doesn't standardize on black and makes the next cam available in both colors.<br />(2) More \"megapixels\" (of course). Which doesn't really mean squat unless you wish to print your photographs on 20 x 30 photopaper.<br />(3) Video recording with sound for 3 minutes (actually G3 can manage about the same).<br />(4) This could be an important factor to some of you who believe digicams haven't yet reached their prime given how pathetic their focus speeds are -- G5 rocks in terms of instant clicking. G2 was painfully slow and effectively useless for sports photography for instance, G3 was a remarkable improvement, and G5 now is almost as good as EOS in its response time.<br />Summary: what can I say. Great camera from Canon, but falls short of being spectacular as an upgrade. If you already own G2 or G3, wait for the next in the series by when let's hope the clicking response times should match EOS and other digital SLRs.<br />But if you are in the market for a new digicam, this is easily the best on offer in the semipro category (as are G2, G3 etc if Canon does not make them obsolete).","For a long time film/slide shooter like me, this has been a great discovery and addition. Extremely compact, fast shooting with high quality pictures. Couldn't ask for anything more."]},{"name":"HP Photosmart 635","amazon_reviews":["I got this camera about half a year ago, and it worked quite well.

Because in spite of the fast battery consumption, it delivers what it promises:<br />- Optical AND Digital zoom in 1 camera with auto focus<br />- True plug n play (with my WinXP OS/Suite)<br />- Beautiful hi-resolution pics (lower resolutions available)<br />- Extremely easy to use (for those familiar with digicams)<br />- Movie clips w/audio (only camera w/sound in 2.1MP for $150)<br />- a strong feature rich software program that's very easy to use<br />- lots more options than I anticipated and have yet to explore<br />I'm a heavy (almost everyday) digicam user and I don't have time to fix pics post-download, so I have to get the picture right almost every time. This is my 3rd digital camera, my first camera was one of the first cameras out there (...) When I started to do research (via amazon, cdnet, zdnet, pcmagazine, etc.) I wanted a camera that was good, solid and an exceptional value. This camera came in the top ten of 4 out 6 editor  surveys I reviewed for the 2.1MP digital camera class. I carefully studied all the minuses and pluses of all the 2.1 cameras in my price range ($130 - $150), and for the price, this camera has more features and is a better quality than any other I looked at.<br /><br />After listening to all the warnings, I bought rechargeable batteries and a 128Mb memory card with the camera. It was the best thing I ever did. On a single set of batteries, with the high resolution view finder on and using the optical zoom in lens (which I love), I was able to take over 50 pictures and a 3.5 sec movie clip of a 16 month old and a 4 year old scurrying about, while using only 2/3 of the battery power. Even when I took action photos the pictures came out crisp and clear, no blurryness, what a relief. The only thing, I have to anticipate the action by a quarter of a second in order to capture the shot I want.<br />After taking all those photos, I forgot the camera at my mom's for a few days and wondered if I would have enough power to download the pics onto my PC.  Not only did I still have enough battery power to download I was able to take some more pics, even with the \"Battery Low\" warning coming on the view finder(something my 2 previous cameras didn't feature). 2 weeks and over 250 pictures later (I'm on my 3rd set of batteries) and I'm still very happy with this camera. The picture resolution, combined with my ability to make adjustments post-download in a solid camera that was at a sensible price, make this an unbeatable value (as what was indicated by most of the editorial reviews I read).<br />So, if you know what you want in a camera and you do your homework/research before hand, you'll probably enjoy what you buy. (...)","With the price of digital cameras now within reach for most people, it is tough to decide on which one to go with. I am nothing more than a casual user of cameras, and am not in need of one with loads of bells and whistles, nor can I justify spending an arm and a leg on one. The HP 635 was the camera I decided to go with and am so far very pleased with it, despite a few technical flaws.<br />The biggest selling point of this camera is that fact that it is one of the most user-friendly on the market. The intuitive design and menu system makes operating it right out of the box very easy, and you will be shooting pictures in no time. Everything function is controlled by a series of buttons on the back of the camera. There are four function keys (even one for printing, if you have the camera hooked up to a printer), a flash and video control key, and 4-way navigation keys with an \"OK\" button in the middle, like the ones found on DVD remote controls. The menus appear on the LCD viewfinder and are easy to navigate. Adjusting the picture quality, setting the color scheme, and deleting pictures in the memory are just a few of the functions made easy with the menu system. The camera comes with 16 MB of internal memory, but it can be expanded using the memory card slot. Everything you would expect from a digital camera is here, making the HP 635 a great value.<br />The pictures themselves are excellent quality, even at the lowest image quality setting. The optical zoom (which I recommend over the digital zoom) and auto focus allow you to get the best quality pictures with minimal effort on your part. What pleased me as well was the imaging software that came in the box, which takes no time to set up and is easy to use. The images take no time to be downloaded to your computer, and the imaging software provided helps you re-size and edit your pictures quickly and easily. The USB cable is provided with everything else. In terms of functionality, this camera has been nothing short of stellar so far.<br />Having said all the praise, there are a few flaws that might dissuade people who would use this camera frequently. For starters, the battery life is horrible. Since the camera has a high-resolution viewfinder and moving parts for the optical zoom, the batteries don't last very long. If you are taking pictures a lot, you will probably have to replace the batteries every 1-2 days (I am not kidding). The minimize this, avoid using the LCD viewfinder too often, or playing with the optical zoom too much. The other flaw is that the 16 MB internal memory doesn't hold much, especially if you are taking pictures at the highest quality. It can hold 12 pictures only on the \"Best\" setting, while having it on the lowest (\"good\") will allow you to hold 80, which is better. If you insist on the best quality, you will have to buy an extra memory card.<br />Since I am not a heavy camera user, I had few beefs with the HP 635. The abysmal battery life and small capacity are slight turnoffs, but they hardly make me regret buying this particular camera. If is well made, easy to use, and reliable. For first time buyers, I highly recommend it for both the value and functionality.","This is a great camera. I have had it for about 2 weeks and the photo quality is awsome. The LCD is bright and clear, and the Movie mode is extremely fun to mess around with. The ONLY problem this camera has is that it eats up batteries to fast. Don't even attempt normal batteries and go strait to NIMH rechargables. Even then make sure you have 4 of them, two in the camera and two on standby. Well worth the money.","I'll admit it, I basically bought this camera because it was affordable (I got it for $149.99 at Target), and it had all the features I wanted in a digital camera.<br />It's incredibly easy to use! I took it out of the box and started shooting photos about ten minutes later. There are so many nice features, too. It has a built-in flash (which can be modified to a red-eye reduction setting, a night setting, and other settings depending on what lighting you're using), optical and digital zoom, an LCD screen, and much more. I thought 2.1 megapixels wouldn't work well for me, but I've found that they are perfect for me. Most of the photos I take are just for fun, for my website, for selling items on eBay, or just everyday use, so I don't need to print out photos any larger than 8 x 10.<br />I would suggest buying a larger memory card for the camera if you want to take lots of pictures at one time. Mine came with a 32MB card, and that takes about 35 pictures (if you use the highest quality setting -- more if you use a lesser quality setting). Also, purchasing rechargable batteries is a very good idea, seeing as the camera goes through batteries fairly quickly.<br />Basically, if you're looking for a camera that's easy to use, takes fantastic photos and is affordable...this is the camera to buy. It's great for first-time digital camera buyers (like me).","I bought this camera 2 weeks ago, and I am very impressed. I was worried that a $180 camera would not take such great pictures, but I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. The picture quality it GREAT,I printed some 4X6s of my images at a photo lab, and they looked almost perfect, VERY close to regular 35mm. I also printed an 8X10, and although it was a tiny bit blurry it was more than acceptable. It has plenty of features for the beginner, to advanced user. The 3X Optical zoom is great, but don't use digital zoom it makes the pictures look pixely. All of the settings such as Image Quality, Exposure Mode, White Balance, ISO Speed, Saturation and Sharpness, are easy to set using the intuitive menu system, or you can let the camera automatically select the best settings. It has a 1.6\" LCD screen for reviewing your images. It also has a video mode with sound that works surprisingly well.  I recommend buying a Multimedia, or Secure Digital Card to save your images, since the internal 16MB only holds about 12 Pictures. I have a 128MB card which can store about 112 pictures. The main problem I have with this camera is that it eats batteries fast. Using standard alkalines it lasted about 15-25 pictures, depending on how much you zoom, use the LCD screen etc... I just bought the brand new Rayovac IC-3 15 Min Charger, and would recommend it to anyone considering this camera. So far I am up to 60 Pictures and the battery is still full! Much better than alkaline. Over all this is a GREAT camera for the price, which is now only $150. I would recommend this camera to anyone.","The HP 635 is everything you need combined into a sleek, easy to use, bar-none great quality camera.<br />If you use other HP products, even better. Loads and prints in a jiffy.<br />Don't sell yourself short by not using the Movie function. It's a blast to make quick video clips on the fly. I suggest getting more memory if you plan on making alot of videos.<br />Enjoy!","I bought this camera yesterday and i love it!<br />The screen is great- you won't be able to go back to a film camera. I also reccomend buying a photosmart printer. Then you print your pictures wherever you are and you don't need a computer!","I was in need of a better digital camera from my old one.  After searching for some time, I decided to get this model because of the optical zoom and easy to use features.<br />Initial setup with this camera is extremely easy, and you'll be taking pictures within minutes when you first open the box.  Image quality is very good at the 2.1 MP this camera is capible of.  The on-screen menu system for the camera is very easy to use and to change settings.  The movie mode for the camera is also fun and easy to use, and movie record time is limited only to the amount of memory in the camera.  The camera automatically adjusts to lighting levels, and you also have the ability to change color controls and can even change to macro focus modes with the camera menu system.<br />The HP software is VERY easy to use, and the camera even has buttons right on it if you want to email a picture of print a picture right to your printer (all of this an more can be setup with the included HP software).  Battery time isn't the greatest, but I've found I can take around around 50-60 images at higher quality, and you can probably take even more if the LCD screen is kept turned off.  I recommend you buy some NiMH rechargebles if you are going to get the camera, as they are the most economical.  I would also recommend getting a SD memory card for the camera, as the built-in 16MB fills up quickly.<br />Overall this camera is a great value, with easy to use features and image quality that is very well."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot SD10 (Digital IXUS i / IXY Digital L)","amazon_reviews":["Love this little camera.  Takes great pictures","Ive had this camera for quite a few years now. Its is a very handy camera to have due to its size. It also shoots quickly (probably due to no optical zoom) and shoots decent pictures. This is a no nonsense camera. Straight point and shoot anyone can use it. I like how small it is cause you can truly take it anywhere. As they say the best camera is the one you have with you. Is very cheap on ebay if you want one. This or the sd20 which is the improved version.","I love this camera<br /><br />I love the macro, the clarity<br /><br />someone into photography told me it has especially clear pictures BECAUSE it has no optical zoom and  I have been very pleased.  The only thing is I would like optical zoom, so I am thinking about getting another camera, but DEFINITELY sticking within the canon line.<br /><br />It is super sturdy, I'm ashamed to say it's hit the floor a few times.  Dont get generic batteries, it's worth the investment to get the brand name, they'll last a long time and generic just isn't worth the medium amount of money you will pay.<br /><br />The size is great which is why I can take it everywhere with me.  I love that I can take continuous shots which comes in handy with my godson and his brother and my rabbit.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this as a point and shoot camera.  I happen to know a bit about photography and love it....and the camera is great for me....sometimes I woudl like to be able to set some manual settings but then again the pros SIGNIFICANTLY outweigh the cons...the quality is good.  Using the self timer I have done my own headshots, and theater professionals thought they were professionally done.  Let me just tell you I saved thousands with that instance, and I can just keep updating them and whatnot.  It's great to have a tripod with it sometimes and just try things out.  This is my first digital camera and it's also a great one to start with, why get all the fancy shmancy if you are new to digital cameras?  As a theater major who does makeup, it is invaluable for taking photos of the actors' makeup to keep it the same from day to day and even for other things with \"documentation\"  like if I see a dress I like and I want to go get that fabric, I Just take a pic since I always have it with me, that is one of the main handy features and I have so many pics that I only have because it waas easy to carry around and who wants to lug a huge thing around all day all the time?  I have even used it in craft stores to remember what I wanted to use on a project and so I would remember where it was, what it looked like and sizes and whatnot..it is So handy for things you wouldnt always think of and expect.<br /><br />I really really do reccomend this and all the other elph cameras....zoom or no zoom  but if you DO want zoom go for optical because digital zoom wont really get you anywhere....<br /><br />enjoy :)","I bought this when it first came out a couple of years ago.  At the time it was the smallest 4MP out there, and since my goal was to go \"small,\" i decided that i could live without an optical zoom.  While it served me well, I will tell anyone now that we all need optical zoom.  Photographic quality is good, though there are sometimes too much chromatic aberration (color fringing).  Focus indoors can be slow or impossible, even with flash turned on.<br /><br />Unless you can get a really good deal for this, I suggest looking elsewhere, as there are many other offerings from this class of cameras now -- all with zoom lenses.  I recommend the recent Casios or a Pentax Optio.","I recently took this lil cam on a trip overseas and am extremely happy with the pictures that it took.  Color and clarity are top notch, what I expect from Canon.  It's very compact and easy to carry around.  Just be sure it's in a safe pocket or bag, you wouldn't want to leave it behind.<br /><br />The SD10 does lack optical zoom, which is advantageous in some ways.  It's easier to use (no zoom controls to fiddle with) so strangers can just point & shoot in those situations when you want a picture of yourself.  \"Zoom with your feet\".  Not having to fiddle with zoom controls also makes for quicker shooting.  Use a paint program afterwards to crop what you want to keep in the pic.<br /><br />This isn't a replacement for a full-sized digicam.  But it sure gives them a run for their money.  I wouldn't take any other cam on a long trip.  The charger is universal 100-240v 50/60Hz, so no power converter is necessary (just a plug adapter depending on where you're going).","I'm not really involved in the digital photo scene so this won't be a super technical review.<br /><br />I purchased this camera because of the size. It's about the size of a mobile phone, smaller than some, larger than others. It fits perfectly in the phone sized pocket of my shoulder bag.<br /><br />Operation is mostly simple. Power it on with one button, focus and shoot with a different button. The location of these two buttons is pretty ergonomic - they make sense. I haven't taken a single picture with part of my hand shadowing the flash or found any fingers in the shot. In the past 14 months, I've taken over 2500 pictures with this unit and had no fingers in the pictures, so I think that's pretty ergonomic for a small camera.<br /><br />The zoom is digital which makes it useless - if you zoom in, you can just see bigger pixels, so don't buy it for the zoom, ok?<br /><br />Manual operation is hit and miss. Some of the settings I've found to be superior to the default point and shoot mode but for the most part I think you're better off using it in automatic mode. For one thing, it's really hard to find a setting where you can turn the flash off without leaving the shutter open forever. That means I can't use the camera in many museums because most restrict the use of a flash. Of course, a DIY fix for that would be to cover the flash securely with something like electrical tape, but I really don't like the idea of that.<br /><br />Battery life is long, if you use the actual Canon batteries. I purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries and they only last for a couple hours of turn on, take a couple photos, turn off and repeat. So for vacation when you really need to rely on a spare, buy an actual Canon battery. It's worth the extra dough.<br /><br />The case that comes with the unit is quite nice. You shouldn't need to spend more $ to buy another one. I don't like the velcro on the case so much because it gets stuck on the little camera strap and makes the strap look all scuzzy, but maybe you can find a better strap. Any cell phone strap could be used. Try to find one that will fit around your hand for security. I've dropped the unit once and it's okay so far but I wouldn't want to risk any damage.<br /><br />The battery charger is small - no cord. On the US model it plugs into any two prong outlet. Doesn't work well on a power strip because it has a large footprint. But on a regular double outlet with a normal plug in one, this charger will fit just fine in the other outlet. On a totally dead battery it takes about 35 minutes to fully charge it.<br /><br />The manual is descriptive. Keep it handy when you're getting started. Don't just use the quick start guide. You'll want to know how to use those manual settings from time to time. Take it with you on vacation.<br /><br />Video mode is okay. The mic is quite sensitive - better than I had suspected. You won't get a particularly large image but you can find video editing programs that will enable you to enhance the video you record. For fun little snippets to send to friends via e-mail, which is what I wanted, it's great.<br /><br />Sorting through the images and videos is extra simple. Deleting unwanted images is just as simple. Be careful, or you might delete something you meant to keep.<br /><br />The unit does come with a 16mb SD card but that's too small for use in reality. Go to the store and buy a 256 or a 512 MB card and you'll be able to take way more pictures than your battery will allow. You should not need more than one 512 for a 10 day vacation. Seriously. I like that it uses SD cards because they're still quite easy to find. And unlike other camera brands, you can buy any brand SD card.<br /><br />I can tell you that some SD cards are faster than others, which will affect your between snapshot time more than the camera itself. I'm using a PNY card and it's much faster than the card that came with the camera. Unfortunately, most of those cards are made by 2 or 3 manufacturers and then rebranded by the sellers. If you feel that it takes too long to take one photo after another, try a different card. Don't blame the camera.<br /><br />There is a cable included to directly connect the camera to a device. You could use that but honestly I think it's easier to take the card out and insert into a card reader. Many computers have them built in. If yours doesn't, you can buy a reader at any electronics retailer for about $9-30 depending on how many types of cards it can read. All you need is SD reader.<br /><br />Would I buy this camera again? Yes I think so. It's not everything I wanted but almost everything. 4MP is still nothing to sneeze at - the images are quite good. Usually the only modifications I have to make are to orient the photos 90 degrees(I take a lot of portrait shaped pictures, which default to view sideways when you look at them on your computer.)<br /><br />Buy with confidence and enjoy this little thing. Every time I use it people still say \"wow it's such a small camera!\" If that's important to you, you'll really like it.","I will buy another Canon Elph when this one finally dies.  With the option of going up to a 1 GB SD card, the future is wide open.  It is possible to buy a lesser brand 4MP camera for a lot less, but the extra Canon quality is worth paying for if you plan to have your camera for a long time.","let me note that if i were rating this camera among all other small cameras, i would be giving it a 5.  however, among all cameras in general, including giant ones as big as your arm that cost twice as much, it understandably gets a 4.<br /><br />this is a great little camera.  If you are in the market for a camera that you want to carry around in your pocket, this is it, stop looking.  you won't find one that takes better pictures that is even close to this size.  It still has a nice screen on it too, which i like.  It's easy to use, very few buttons on this one, but it has as many features as any other camera.  It comes with a good Li-ion battery that has great life.  Cameras that use AA batteries are a complete pain in the neck, so I was happy about the battery.  It also comes with a 32 MB memory card, which will store anywhere from 16-72 pictures depending on which size and quality settings you choose.  I upgraded to a 128 MB card and i have never had to worry about even coming close to running out of memory.  The only thing lacking is zoom quality.  It doesn't have optical zoom, only digital, so if you zoom in at all, it makes your pictures grainy.  Anyone that says that this doesn't happen is either lying or just stupid, because it's something that anyone who has ever used a digital camera would know.  However, i am willing to sacrifice zoom for all of the other great things about this camera.  And think about it anyway...if you are just taking a picture of some people, just take a few steps forward if you need to \"zoom in.\"  If you are taking pictures of a landscape, you probably wont need to zoom.  However if you are someone that needs zoom for whatever you use your camera for, then you probably shouldn't be looking at a camera this small anyway, you will need one with one of those giant lenses.  The SD-10 has an awesome macro (close-up) setting, you can get within a half inch of anything and take the most detailed picture you will ever see.  I took a picture of a flower and you could see the veins in the petals when i pulled it up on my computer.<br /><br />Also, not that this really matters, but every time i take this camera out in front of anyone (i got the black one), they all want to see it and compliment how cool it looks.  Now, this isnt why you should buy it, but it is a testament to the physical beauty of this camera.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful camera and it even comes with a small, nice fitting carrying case.  Again, if you need a small camera, get this one, you will not be disappointed.","if you need a new camera, want something to fit in your pocket, this ones for you! 4 megapixels, more than enough, this thing is TINY!  id highly recommend this to anybody, if you don't got the money for it, consider getting one for FREE!<br />it got me mine, check it out, its all the information you need on getting this camera for FREE!","Love this little camera.  Takes great pictures","Ive had this camera for quite a few years now. Its is a very handy camera to have due to its size. It also shoots quickly (probably due to no optical zoom) and shoots decent pictures. This is a no nonsense camera. Straight point and shoot anyone can use it. I like how small it is cause you can truly take it anywhere. As they say the best camera is the one you have with you. Is very cheap on ebay if you want one. This or the sd20 which is the improved version.","I love this camera<br /><br />I love the macro, the clarity<br /><br />someone into photography told me it has especially clear pictures BECAUSE it has no optical zoom and  I have been very pleased.  The only thing is I would like optical zoom, so I am thinking about getting another camera, but DEFINITELY sticking within the canon line.<br /><br />It is super sturdy, I'm ashamed to say it's hit the floor a few times.  Dont get generic batteries, it's worth the investment to get the brand name, they'll last a long time and generic just isn't worth the medium amount of money you will pay.<br /><br />The size is great which is why I can take it everywhere with me.  I love that I can take continuous shots which comes in handy with my godson and his brother and my rabbit.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this as a point and shoot camera.  I happen to know a bit about photography and love it....and the camera is great for me....sometimes I woudl like to be able to set some manual settings but then again the pros SIGNIFICANTLY outweigh the cons...the quality is good.  Using the self timer I have done my own headshots, and theater professionals thought they were professionally done.  Let me just tell you I saved thousands with that instance, and I can just keep updating them and whatnot.  It's great to have a tripod with it sometimes and just try things out.  This is my first digital camera and it's also a great one to start with, why get all the fancy shmancy if you are new to digital cameras?  As a theater major who does makeup, it is invaluable for taking photos of the actors' makeup to keep it the same from day to day and even for other things with \"documentation\"  like if I see a dress I like and I want to go get that fabric, I Just take a pic since I always have it with me, that is one of the main handy features and I have so many pics that I only have because it waas easy to carry around and who wants to lug a huge thing around all day all the time?  I have even used it in craft stores to remember what I wanted to use on a project and so I would remember where it was, what it looked like and sizes and whatnot..it is So handy for things you wouldnt always think of and expect.<br /><br />I really really do reccomend this and all the other elph cameras....zoom or no zoom  but if you DO want zoom go for optical because digital zoom wont really get you anywhere....<br /><br />enjoy :)","I bought this when it first came out a couple of years ago.  At the time it was the smallest 4MP out there, and since my goal was to go \"small,\" i decided that i could live without an optical zoom.  While it served me well, I will tell anyone now that we all need optical zoom.  Photographic quality is good, though there are sometimes too much chromatic aberration (color fringing).  Focus indoors can be slow or impossible, even with flash turned on.<br /><br />Unless you can get a really good deal for this, I suggest looking elsewhere, as there are many other offerings from this class of cameras now -- all with zoom lenses.  I recommend the recent Casios or a Pentax Optio.","I recently took this lil cam on a trip overseas and am extremely happy with the pictures that it took.  Color and clarity are top notch, what I expect from Canon.  It's very compact and easy to carry around.  Just be sure it's in a safe pocket or bag, you wouldn't want to leave it behind.<br /><br />The SD10 does lack optical zoom, which is advantageous in some ways.  It's easier to use (no zoom controls to fiddle with) so strangers can just point & shoot in those situations when you want a picture of yourself.  \"Zoom with your feet\".  Not having to fiddle with zoom controls also makes for quicker shooting.  Use a paint program afterwards to crop what you want to keep in the pic.<br /><br />This isn't a replacement for a full-sized digicam.  But it sure gives them a run for their money.  I wouldn't take any other cam on a long trip.  The charger is universal 100-240v 50/60Hz, so no power converter is necessary (just a plug adapter depending on where you're going).","I'm not really involved in the digital photo scene so this won't be a super technical review.<br /><br />I purchased this camera because of the size. It's about the size of a mobile phone, smaller than some, larger than others. It fits perfectly in the phone sized pocket of my shoulder bag.<br /><br />Operation is mostly simple. Power it on with one button, focus and shoot with a different button. The location of these two buttons is pretty ergonomic - they make sense. I haven't taken a single picture with part of my hand shadowing the flash or found any fingers in the shot. In the past 14 months, I've taken over 2500 pictures with this unit and had no fingers in the pictures, so I think that's pretty ergonomic for a small camera.<br /><br />The zoom is digital which makes it useless - if you zoom in, you can just see bigger pixels, so don't buy it for the zoom, ok?<br /><br />Manual operation is hit and miss. Some of the settings I've found to be superior to the default point and shoot mode but for the most part I think you're better off using it in automatic mode. For one thing, it's really hard to find a setting where you can turn the flash off without leaving the shutter open forever. That means I can't use the camera in many museums because most restrict the use of a flash. Of course, a DIY fix for that would be to cover the flash securely with something like electrical tape, but I really don't like the idea of that.<br /><br />Battery life is long, if you use the actual Canon batteries. I purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries and they only last for a couple hours of turn on, take a couple photos, turn off and repeat. So for vacation when you really need to rely on a spare, buy an actual Canon battery. It's worth the extra dough.<br /><br />The case that comes with the unit is quite nice. You shouldn't need to spend more $ to buy another one. I don't like the velcro on the case so much because it gets stuck on the little camera strap and makes the strap look all scuzzy, but maybe you can find a better strap.

Being only a bit larger than a cellphone, its sleek size really does the trick to slip in your pocket, and it really impresses people to boot. The only problem is a lack of a viewfinder, but you get used to that quick.","awesome camera with great options and attributes!<br />megapixels are pretty good, and the print quality of these<br />pictures come clear.  But the price is a bit too high<br /><br />[...]","Did you ever experience a moment where you've said \"oh man i wish i had my camera!\" or, you've had your camera and just wished it wouldnt create such a huge bulge in your pocket??  Well problem solved.<br /><br />i was in the mood for buying a small camera and tripped apon this little beautie...at first I was skeptical, thinking Im paying too much for something that might turn out some-how dissapointing...<br /><br />I read the reviews everyday for about 3 days wondering if I should buy it or not. Well guess what happened next...I bought it.<br /><br />so after i bought it, I kept reading the reviews to escape any doubt in my mind.<br /><br />I came home late at night and saw it on the table (considering that im still with my parents and they were home when it was delivered) and was TOTTALLY excited about its arrival...I took it out and 1.the packing was excellent 2.the camera is TINY!! I measured it to everything I could think of...and the closest thing was a pack of cigarettes!! its even slightly smaller than that!!!(slightly)<br /><br />3. once I got it I went on a rampage of photography, the menus were pretty easy, I didnt even need the manual at first to turn it on and start rampaging...(thats good for the men)<br /><br />  hmmmm...now for the reason for the 4 STARS.(though it deserves more of  4 and 3quarter stars)<br /><br />Alot of people gave it 4 considering theres lack of a viewfinder and lack of an optical zoom...believe me, im a hard-to-impress-guy when it comes to quality...the camera compensates the optical with its QUALITY in EVERY pic!! thats right... EVERY pic...but now for the only  major problem on my hands.. i read what was in the box and i saw the ion battery charger with the battery...and at first i was like \"COOL\",and I thought well now the good part is that I dont have to waste gas and precious money to buy more batteries...but the bad part is that it takes electricity to charge up and you have to do that with an outlet...(primarily at HOME) so if your camera runs outta juice and you're without your charger and electricity...boom you miss out on your rampage ...and you cant just go out and buy batteries at your nearest convience store... but i suggest a power a/c outlet that you can hook up to your car lighter....yeah they make'em.. I bought mine at wal-mart...ooh that is an awesome store..and I felt smart about it ever since...<br /><br />  so in conclusion besides the whole battery charger dilema...this camera is awesome in all aspects,  size, quality, and speed of getting those\"quick-shot-moments\" that are impossible to get with a slow shutter camera. I bought the bronze one since my pocket has that quality-for-cheap type mentality, I doubted the color and I wished I could have gotten the black one, but once I got the bronze, i was amazed at the color..to me it looks like looking into a brand-spanking new penny...so shiny and irrestible to look at...actually i fallen in love with the camera (if there is such a thing!)<br /><br />  so besides the charger...if your looking for something compaq, ready to shoot in a second, and where quality meets above expectation, then this is the CAMERA to buy//////// go ahead, DONT wait any longer reading this stupid review...buy the camera NOW!!! TRUST ME IT WONT DISSAPOINT.. :)","the size is compact n i fall in love with it the moment i saw it. but the problem with this camera is , it becomes warm easily.the battery life too is quite short though many claimed to have good battery life. it just last for about 2 hrs or so.dont know if you would consider that long lasting.<br /><br />the size is too small that u mite lose it if you dont be careful about it.","I purchased this camera to use for close-range stuff in clubs, bars, street photography and while having fun (pictures of friends, family, etc.) I wanted a simple point-and-shoot, something with decent specs (wanted at least 3MP) and *especially* something with a form factor as small as possible.<br /><br />The unit fits into my pocket unnoticed...especially in comparison with most other digicams out there with similar specs. The unit starts up fast (uner 2 secs...nice!) and is fast in taking pics and saving them (don't have a high-speed SD card, oh well...) Focusing I wish was instantaneous, but it is way faster than my Dad's old digicam ever was. It takes maybe 2 - 3 seconds on average, sometimes less. Annyoing, but probably endemic with all digicams in the ballpark range.<br /><br />The image quality of this unit is super-nice. Color is pure, natural and \"living.\" Detail is high. The superfine JPEG mode is very nice. I wish it had a \"raw\" option (it may, I don't know how to get it to do that if so), but I don't think it does. Superfine JPEG clocks in at about 2MB per 4MP picture. Not bad, a decent trade-off.<br /><br />Once you get down into Fine territory, you start to see ever-so-slight fuzziness and jpeg compression artifacts. I am the type of person who appreciates HD video-type signals, and like to see the blackhead on the nose of the guy across the bar. So, take this minor gripe for what it's worth.<br /><br />The other \"negatives\" about this unit are no optical viewfinder (you use the review screen to frame shots...believe me, NO big deal AT ALL...preferable for me) and no optical zoom. The optical zoom thing I am of two minds about: on one hand, I have had the *occasional* use for clear zoom. On the other hand, if it means adding even a millimeter to this unit, FORGET about it. So, at the end of the day, it's fine by me.<br /><br />The images are detailed and sharp. As long as you can keep your hands reasonably still, you will get insane detail to images. Slight softness in high-contrast, distanced situations (such as dark text against a light backgrond on a candy bag on the far end of your shopping cart, for example) exists, but I am splitting hairs.<br /><br />The DiGIC chip is awesome...images come out consistenly well-balanced (hump in the middle of the graph) and there are plenty of options for displaying image info as they are shot. Also, there are plenty of manual controls, good white balance, etc. WAAAAY more than a user like myself (I understand these things on a surface level, but mostly just want everything done for me...I like point-and-shoot for my applications).<br /><br />All told, I am very impressed with this unit. It also looks really cool, to boot (I have the silver, and the circular, shiny brushing/grooves on the front look great in club/bar lights or anywhere else...very attractive). Body is metal housing, have had no problems with it. I notice that there are slight dimples if I turn the unit sideways in the light, they were there from the beginning. No biggie, can't see them straight-on.<br /><br />If you are looking for a light, compact, purse and especially *pocket*-sized unit, I can think of no better than this one. Surprisingly I was able to get it new in West Hollywood, CA. for a significantly lower price than listed here.<br /><br />The great thing about this unit is the value factor:<br /><br />a.) good price<br /><br />b.) you don't have to pay for processing and you can take way more pics with freedom, freeing you to experiment and snap more casual/unposed stuff since there is no extra outlay financially<br /><br />and<br /><br />c.) you capture irreplaceable moments in high-detail that easily justify the cost of the unit","In addition to all the good things mentioned, this item also has a bonus. Amazon surprised me by throwing in the Deluxe Leather Case PSC SD10, with the color perfectly matching the camera. I was a little concerned before receiving the order, wondering where I could get a case to protect my little beauty. Now problem solved. Thanks Amazon!","When I bought this camera it was for it's size. I love a camera that you can just throw in a pocket and forget you even have. I had a logitech pocket cam but the pics we're just terriable, so I went after this canon. Well first impression was what quality. It's metal construction and sleek look wow's you imedietly. But the real wow comes when you see the pictures it takes, They are flawless. I have a canon A-80 and let me tell you these pics are as good if not better than that.<br /><br />OK, It has no Opitical viewfinder or zoom, But who uses viewfinders anymore anyhow, We all use the lcd screens to take our pics.As for the zoom, If thats what you want you'll have to sacrifice size then.<br /><br />Bottom line is if you want a super small high quality camera that takes great everyday pictures then this is your baby. Battery life is superb, I took over 80 pics and still have juice.","I just got my camra today! It's the cutest thing ever. It's smaller than the rest of the camra's on the market. The 4.0 mega pix is a plus too! WOW I love it. It's smaller than my cell phone. You should get it too!","This is perfect for you if you are looking for a small, portable digital Camera. You can take this thing anywhere.<br />Pros:<br />1. Size and weight - I love the fact that you can just drop it in your pocket and head on out. It's small, sleek, and light weigt.<br />2. Picture quality - At 4 megapixels, this is not a technological lightweight when it comes to picture clarity. The pictures I have taken so far have come out excellent.<br />3. Canon Quality - Canon makes great digital cameras that feel sturdy and are well - built.<br />Cons:<br />1. Digital Zoom/Lack of optical zoom - The zoom feature of this camera is not good at all. It's a trade-off for its compact size. When using the digital zoom, the pictures dont come out very sharp.<br />2. Red-eye - You will note a tendency for images to have a bit of red-eye in the subjects. That's not much of a problem if you have image editing software.<br />Suggestions:<br />1. Buy a bigger Memory Card - the one that the camera comes with is too small. At the very least, get a 128mb card, 256/512mb is my recommendation.<br />2. Buy an extra battery - this way when you are out, you can just swap batteries without having to worry about how much power you have left.<br />3. Buy a USB 2.0 memory card reader - If you take a good number of digital pics and your computer has a USB 2.0 port, then a reader is excellent for downloading pictures and transferring it to your computer. USB 2.0 is very quick and where a typical transfer may take approximately 5 minutes, with USB 2.0 the same transfer will take 45 seconds.<br />4. Get image editing software- This affords you the opportunity to brighten images, sharpen images, take the red-eye out, crop images. I use adobe photoshop, but any image editing software should do. It just gives you a greater sense of control over the output.<br />Conclusion:<br />You know that there will be a trade-off in some camera functions for its small size, and for me, I have no regrets about it. I simply can't get over how small the camera is. It excels in close to medium distance images in daylight. At 4 megapixels, the resolution of the pictures is very satisfying. This camera delivers as promised.","From the moment I recieved this product I knew I had made a great desision in this purchase. The packageing was impressive and it came with everything which I think is a total plus, the case, battery, battery charger and the cords. I recently purchased a more expensive digital camera and had to put more money into the rechargable batteries and charger and the AV cord and the case, and the product packageing was no where near as good as this little camera. Also this camera has an awesome orange light ( don't know the Tech. term )that totally suprises whoever your taking a picture of and can take a picture in a competely dark room, my big camera cant do that. I take it everywhere it is so small, I love it.","The Canon SD10 has to be one of the best cameras out there for its price. I only have a few things that I don't like about this camera. One of the things is that some of the pictures show a little bit of red eye but when you go to print it out you just click red eye and it takes it out for you so that really isn't that big of a deal. Another thing has to be the digital zoom. When you take the picture it is fine but when you are looking at it on the LCD when you want to take the picture it shows blurry. But if you want to use the zoom... just take the picture and zoom in and print it on the computer. This camera takes excellent pictures and let me tell you is it ever TINY! It is seriously the size of a credit card but you don't want to drop it because you know it will break. I think that anybody who is looking for a camera get this one because it is great! You won't be disappointed...","I purchased this camera last Christmas because I wanted a 4 mega pixel camera in a sleek lightweight body. I always use Amazon for the reviews which I read before making a buying decision and I was not disappointed. The unit is great. I just returned from Hawaii and took many pics in varying light situations and they all look super. Colors are vibrant and properly rendered. I agree that red eye is a problem though.<br />Being middle aged, I would have appreciated a bigger screen. That is the single largest drawback for me.  I bought an extra battery and recommend that you do so if you are like me and hate to be caught short. However, I do have to say that the battery life has been good. I also popped for a 128SD memory card and found that to be more than enough to capture the 90 pics taken in large size superfine shooting format. My unit came with a very nice leather case that uses Velcro to secure the case to a belt loop. I found this to work very well and it did not interfere with getting to the camera quickly. I generally shoot pics with a 35MM NIKON 6006 SLR so you could say that I am an experienced photographer. Take it from me; you'll like this camera and the results you achieve.","I have four digital cameras - but this one is my favorite.  The photos are crisp, the camera is very responsive and fast.  It is small enough to carry every day.  The charge is good too.  I would say this and the Casio XFilm are the bext low-end digital cameras around.","I'm not going to repeat the positive reviews, but just state this is probably the best value camera I have ever bought! It's stylish, functional, affordable and absolutely TINY. What more could you ask for? Buy it now!","This camera is awesome but it does have some drawbacks.<br />PROS: You can take it everywhere and you will without even noticing, i sometimes forget I have it in my pocket.<br />Great pictures if you mess with the settings a little.<br />CONS: the charger size.  I was so worried that i would lose the camera that I forgot to keep up with the charger.  The charger is about 1/3 the size of the camera and if you don't have a place to plug it into a wall permanently you will lose it.  I don't have a open plug in my room and my house is full of people traffic and dogs so I couldn't put it anywhere else.  I lost it after 3 charges.<br />Other than that its great.  I haven't checked how much a new charger is but I assume it's not cheap.","Eclipsed ONLY by the lower-end Casio Exilim cameras in sheer compactness, the appeal of the SD10 in all its various colors is obvious: 4 megapixel snapshots in a package so compact that it won't even feel like a presence in your pocket.  For those desiring a digital camera half as a camera and half as a fashion accessory, this is the way to go.<br />For those more performance minded, however, consider the following.<br />Pros:<br />-Smallest 4 megapixel digi-cam on the market.<br />-Slightly above average start-up time (especially important for snapshooters, whom this camera is geared toward).<br />-Sleek, sexy design.<br />-Canon's 5 point autofocus system, while not especially powerful, is better than the average ultracompact 4 megapixel camera's system.<br />-Canon's image sensor captures better quality images than most other cameras do, within the same style.<br />-Canon STILL uses Compact Flash technology, which is a significantly cheaper media than sD or xD, so you save money here as opposed to competing cameras.<br />Cons:<br />-Picture quality is noticably worse than Canon's other 4 megapixel cameras (S400/410, A75/80, S45).  You pay for the compactness somehow: apparently this is how.<br />-No optical zoom.  While a larger-than-you-might-think majority of people actually do not have much need for optical zoom in an everyday setting, those purchasing this camera for trips may be disappointed.<br />-NO OPTICAL VIEWFINDER.  Again, most people who purchase an ultracompact digi-cam aren't photo enthusiasts and are content to snap off pictures using the LCD as their only reference, but this is bound to be a factor for some customers.  I wouldn't purchase this camera on this point alone, but only because I avoid using the LCD for anything at all times because of the drain it puts on the battery.  Not to mention Canon compacts have a tiny (1.5\") LCD that warrants use of the optical viewfinder.<br />Having said all that, I have to recommend that anyone looking at getting this camera STRONGLY consider the Canon S410 as an alternative.  It is only mildly larger than this camera and has the same resolution, settings, but much better photo quality.  It also has a 3x optical zoom lens, which ends up being an asset at times you didn't expect (think: those 30th row floor seats at a concert, capturing that mountain view from a distance, that gorgeous woman you spied walking across the other side of the club).<br />Misc. Note for a large number of digi-cam purchasers:<br />90% of people who purchase a camera with higher than 3 megapixel resolution do not need it.  With a 3 megapixel camera, you can make prints of up to 5 x 7 without a noticable loss of quality, and barely any loss of quality for 8 x 10.  If your computer is running at 1600x1200 resolution, the maximum size picture taken by a 3 megapixel camera will more than fill the screen.  The moral of the story is this: do not be lured by larger megapixel sensors that you do not need.  Look at how the camera performs in other ways, and what features you'd find the most useful.  The only reasons you might want a larger resolution camera are: because you intend to crop a large majority of your photos, because you want to make poster-size prints, or because you're a graphic artist that needs to be working with as many pixels as possible to ensure quality.","I purchased this camera after much research because it was highly rated for image quality, it is made by a relyable company, and it is small enough to go anywhere.  After a few months with this camera I've discovered that this really is the camera that fits all of those criteria.  I take this camera everywhere with me without having to carry a larger bag or purse.  It is easy to operate and turns on and off quickly.  It has pretty good battery life and amazing image quality. I've never had a problem with this camera, but I know I can trust Cannon to provide good technical support when needed.  If you will use a camera mostly for point and shoot or small video this is all you need.  Some people don't like having only an lcd screen, but it has never bothered me.  Also, some people might be annoyed that there is no zooming in movie mode, but I have never needed this feature.  Also if you have big, clumsy hands the size of the buttons and camera in general might be too small for you. If you won't be bothered by these few small details you'll love this camera. For the price, size and image quailty this camera is such a bargain.","I have had many point & shoot digital cameras, and this canon sd10 is by far the best. 4 mega pixels, amazing picture quality, fast reaction times and such a small, but strong body! I had the Pentax s4i and sold it to get this. Nevermind the Sony T1 either, bad photos! Get the canon! This camera rules.","*OK so this bad boy is TINYYYY.  You will never have to worry about carrying a bulky camera again, plus its really ultra chic and trendy looking. HUGE PLUS.<br />*Unlike a lot of other digital cameras that take forever to take a picture, this thing is faaaaast. The time between each snap shot is fast too. VERY impressive.<br />*I'm not a professional photog but if your just about quality photos without all the technical craziness then this camera is perfect for you.  Right out the box its super easy to work with without having to first read the lengthy manual(s).<br />*The digital zoom on this thing is more than cute enough to accomodate you and I find that it doesn't distort the photos or comprimose the quality of the pic.  I understand there are a lot of people that don't care for this dital zoom feature but It hasn't been a problem for me.<br />*Its so tiny you feel like its the most fragile thing in the world.  Its roughly about the size of a credit card!<br />*There's no optical viewfinder on this camera (for the lay person its the little hole most people look through on any other camera before taking a picture). I thought that it would be wierd having to look through the screen before flicking it up, and surprisingly its not.  In fact taking pictures is easier now,<br />* I havent used the camera's included software because my computer allows me to download my photos by inserting the memory disk directly into it so I can't comment on that particular aspect.<br />*I'm in loooove.<br />*The ONLY bad thing about this little camera is that its so cute people want to hold it all the time and the belt clip is secured only by a leather velcro strip so it doesnt feel as secure as I would have liked.<br />*This camera is soooooo worth the money. Click that \"BUY NOW\" option immediately and stop fooling around, you know you want it.  = )","No, the SD10 is not perfect.  For one thing, it could use some optical zoom.  There is *always* a situation that arises when you do need to zoom in just a little bit.  Digital zoom never does it for me.  So Canon, please add optical zoom (even if a paltry 2x) and this will be a 10-out-of-five camera!<br />That said, the SD10 is perfect for the snap-happy.  Count yours truly as one.  It's a take-anywhere-snap-anywhere-view-anywhere-hide-anywhere kind of camera.  The four megapixels are nice, and the picture quality is nothing short of astonishing, at this super compact size or at any size.  BTW, the number of pixels usually does not translate directly into picture quality, just as a CPU's megahertz rating doesn't correlate directly with a system's overall speed.  But Canon engineers are a bunch of smart monkeys, indeed, and every Canon digital camera out in the last three years has just been totally fabulous in the picture quality department.<br />What makes a digital picture top-quality?  The colors have to be natural-looking and balanced, preferably both indoors and outdoors.  There shouldn't be any digitized artifacts (like glowing edges of your new kitchen knife or pixelated pimples on your kid's face).  The white should be white and the black black.  Above all, one look at the picture and you go, \"wow, this is one nice shot!\" (assuming it's meant to be one nice shot).  The SD10, happily, delivers in all these aspects.  One could wish for a longer flash range, but, alas, that's why serious photographers like me have to keep an old-style SLR film baby around with a hotshoe on it.  If you want serious flash, man, you have to use an external flash.  The SD10 does well what it was designed to do.<br />I really don't want to talk to you about the tech specs.  They are meaningless in the real world anyway.  To sum it up, the SD10 is a camera you'll be happy with and you'll probably fall in love with -- a gadget freak like yourself likes all nice gadgets but we don't fall in love easily, but the SD10 deserves to be loved.  If you are anything more than a casual photographer, I recommend you *also* buy a \"more serious\" model like the Canon S410 or Minolta Xg which has more controls and does come with optical zoom, and use the SD10 as a candid shooter.  But, seriously, this is a great camera for all kinds of photographers -- and gadget freaks.","The SD10 is my 4th digital camera, and it is by far the most enjoyable.<br />Here are a few of my favorite things:<br />- size (can't be beat)<br />- 4MP!<br />- really nice predictive focus. like the Canon film SLRs I have used, it has that very handy focus frame that pops onto whatever you are focusing on. Very good at reading your mind.<br />- the flash exsposure system is right on the money.<br />- the lens is sharp and fast (no zoom! i find that a plus, actually)<br />cons<br />- i get a lot of red-eye (don't use any red-eye reduction) - but that is really due to the small size and having the flash so close to the lens.<br />- hearing people complain that there isn't a zoom.<br />- i shoot everything at 50 ASA for the best results. at 200-400, there is a really big difference.<br />- people always wanting to hold it.","I've had tis camera for nine months now, I am rarely without it.  It is just too easy to take with me everywhere, so I no longer say \"oh-no, wish I had my camera!\"<br />The ONLY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM: The exposure of the images are slightly darker at the extreme edges.  This becomes blatently obvious when stitching images -- the slightly darker edges are revealed as dark bars running along the stitch seam.  If you never stitch images, then this won't bother you.  If you like to take panoramic photos, then find a different camera.  I haven't had one successful stitch in the two hundred or so images that I have tried.  I compare this to my other canons (S200, A40) which do an awesome job of stitching.<br />I have never missed the optical zoom.  With 4MP of picture, I have always been able to crop the image to get what I wanted in the shot.","Although this is my first digital camera, I believe it may be my last.  This TINY little camera has everything that an amature could wish for, but the best has to be the stitch assistant.  On a trip to Vegas, I successfully took about 8 shots and panned the entire strip, and the included software (on my laptop) took care of the rest.  The photos are top notch, the camera is about the size of a cell phone, and the battery lasts forever.  No complaints here, you will not go wrong if you purchase this camera.<br />If you are looking to purchase a digital camera but don't want to spend too much, spend just a little more and get the SD10, you will be extremely happy with your purchase.","I have had this camera for 4 months, and I absolutely love it!  The picture quality is the best, the battery lasts long, and I don't think cameras of this quality get any smaller.  My only gripe would be that there is no optical zoom.  I just take a normal picture and crop/zoom on the computer.  For all the features and the size, it is definitely worth the money.","i do not have this camera yet<br />it is cool litte camera","I just received my camera, my words cannot express how tiny this camera is (about the size and weight of a cell phone).  I have various digital cameras and have found the tiny ones are the most useful, since they go everywhere with you.  Digital zoom quality is very good.  Upgraded my Minolta Dimage, which was a good camera as well, but this thing is tiny.","First I bought this one Canon SD10, and then I tried the Sony T1, and the Casio Exilim3.2. This tiny little Canon blew both away.  I have the Rebel Digital and this one for a pocket camera.  I also bought the underwater casing which looks and works great.  Trust me if you are looking for a compact camera you will not be disappointed.  It works as nice as the Canon G2, & G3, which I also owned but where to bulky and I wanted something more compact.","My wife brought the bronze version for me for Christmas.  I'm an adv. amateur and have had a number of Canon cameras.  I find it to be a perfect walk around camera to complement my Canon G1 & 1D.  It's a great looking camera too.  Usually, Canon cameras are set up to slightly underexpose to prevent highlight blowout.  But the SD10 pictures come out perfectly exposed right out of the camera.  Skin tone, expecially on light skinned people is great.  On the other hand, with my G1, I usually had to reduce the magenta, bump up the red, and add a dash of green to get the right color balance for light skinned people.  Still, I put all pictures I care about through PhotoShop to get everything perfect.<br />I don't miss the zoom lens at all.  In return I get really sharp pictures.  The macro mode is fantastic, allowing focus as close as 1-1/2\".  Just remember to switch out of macro when done because it stays in this mode thru a shut down.<br />The flash is surpringly powerful but it's no 550EX.  I get just acceptable shots with group pictures but it works well for 2 people.  It does a good job of adjusting the exposure based on subject and distance, but again, its not perfect.  Ex: I would not recommend for weddings (black groom/white bride).<br />The camera startup is really fast.  The focus speed is also very fast, probably due to the non-zoom lens - much faster than my G1. I was concerned about the level of image noise due to the really small sensor on this camera, but it's fine for 4x6 prints, even at ISO 200.  ISO 400 for dark night shots (no flash)is not usable for me.  I had no problem focusing in low light, such as in restaurants, because of the bright focus assist light<br />I carry it around all the time and have used it to take snapshots of white board diagrams at work.  Its small size really encourages me to take a lot of picture.  I bought some extra non-Canon batteries & additional charger on ebay at cheap prices.  They works fine.","Got this from Amazon, expecting I might need their return policy.  But it's a keeper.<br />The number one feature of this camera is its size for such quality images.  A friend with a larger digicam agreed, saying his next camera would be a small one like this that he could have with him always.<br />It is also very easy to use.  After reading the review at Photoxels.com, with their discussion about histograms, I keep it in auto mode, and check the histogram (I set the review details to show for 10 seconds).  If the viewed picture or histogram tell me to reshoot, only then do I go into manual mode and adjust.  Have only had one bad shot (indoors with flash, came out with shirt color off, but that was one of my first pictures when I was playing, so I may have done something wrong, plus it was set at the default fine compression, rather than the better quality superfine compression, which I now use).<br />I thought I might want the Sony DSC-T1 for its optical zoom, but the early reviews of the Sony said indoor photos came out badly.  And the Sony is bigger (114.66 cubic cm vs. 78.52 cubic cm).  I keep this thing in my shirt pocket most of the time.  Don't think that would be likely with the Sony.  Also, the Sony needs its docking station to be able to connect to a TV, so it becomes even less portable.<br />Although Amazon didn't advertise it, I was pleasantly surprised to receive the case.  You can't use the case for shirt-pocket use, though (too bulky)--I'm using a little cloth drawstring bag for that.  But when it's not in the pocket, the case seems to add some protection from bumps.  It's made for belt attachment.<br />Accessories load up the price: 256 MB SD card (Panasonic and SimpleTech seem to have the best ratings for not much more $$), extra Canon battery, waterproof case (but cheap compared to other cameras', and not too big), external firewire/USB2.0 hard drive (Seagate 160 MB is nice, and they seem to couple sales with Seagate rebates), and LCD screen protectors (makes for more worry-free camera handling).<br />Other than the lack of optical zoom, which I will accept in trade for the small size with quality 4MP pics, I have no complaints.  It's been perfect for me, with full auto mode working exceptionally well: point and shoo-shoot (i.e., shutter down halfway to focus, then down fully).  Result has always been great pictures.","Okay, here it is, let me break it down.<br />I was in the market for a small digital camera for months. Price was not the central issue but I was waiting to get the best possible deal on the best possible product. When I saw this camera in a bar, I knew it was right.<br />First, It's tiny, much smaller than the image indicated. Its also the nicest looking camera out there by far. Especially in black.<br />Second: It is so easy to use that you don't even have to read the book if you don't want.<br />Third: It takes great pictures. Sony has come out with a new miniature camera, its 5MP and its also $550. If you read the reviews on CNET its reputed to be a stinker. My decision was between that specific sony and this one. The sony has a zoom.<br />Fourth: What do you really need a zoom for anyway? If you're like me, you want the camera to take snapshots, you don't need a zoom for that, if anything having the zoom there confuses things when you ask a stranger to take a photo.<br />Lastly: Don't go somewhere else to buy this product. I did find it cheaper in other places on the net. However, Amazon has no hassels. Don't like it, send it back for free. Doesn't work, NO PROBLEM they'll send you another. All that for about $20 over the minimum you'll find it on the web. $20 for piece of mind, a good deal I think. So what are you waiting for?","i used to own a canon powershot s300 digital elph and i loved it.  i gave it to my parents so that they could get into the digital age.  so i researched different cameras and i kept coming to the sd10.  a lot of the reviews said that the one flaw it had was no viewfinder.  i don't really care for it.  i never used the viewfinder on my s300.  im not a professional photographer. i love the size of this camera.  it's the same size as my driver's license! i love the clarity and the quick shot feature.  it used to take forever to take a picture because of the shutter.  now i don't miss a shot!","I got this small camera because I needed a quality camera which I can carry on my belt for those instant shots. Boy, I am extremely impressed with the quality of the pictures!  I also have a Sony F828 8 Megapixel and let me tell you, this camera is up there if you are just printing an 8x10.  It was a bit difficult to tell which pictures came from which camera unless you look really close.  I also have a Sony Cyber Shot V1 (5 Meg) and the Alph is also up there with the V1, but the Alph's pictures are more colorful than the V1. The V1 is also an impressive camera but not as portable and not quite as color-saturated. The flash on this is much better than the Nikon 5000 because the Nikon flash was too bright most of the time and inconsistent.  The color saturation of the Alph is similar to the old Nikon 950, which I love - but the images are much sharper on the SD-10 Alph.  It comes with a very nice leather belt holster about the same size as your cell phone and it's just great for portability, virtually un-noticeable.  I just absolutely love this camera and have it on me all the time. Get one, you won't regret it.","Love this camera!  It is even smaller than it appears in the pictures. I have no more excuses for not having my camera with me at all times.  Also very chic...I got mine in black because it looks like a mini-Hasselblad! I didn't install the software included (not sure about that virus thing) but instead just used the software on my XP.  Works fine.  Pictures are clear, clean and crisp.","I absolutely have fell in love with this machine, and I have been through many digital cameras.  It takes amazing pictures in the dark, fires up fast, and doesn't take long between pictures.  I got tired of taking photos of my kids soccer games, and by the time my fuji finally took the picture, the kids were long gone. I have no regrets, well worth it.","This Camera is very impressive!  I agree with all the positives from above and highly recommend it.<br /><br />There are only two flaws I've found so far (after four days of using it extensively.) First is that there is no way to check the battery life.  This is only mildly annoying, since the battery lasts a very long time, but I found myself getting anxious that I was going to run out of juice in the middle of a shooting session.  Once the battery is low it gives you a warning icon that battery is low - but that's like not having a fuel guage, only a fuel light.  Not good.<br /><br />Second is that there is no range finder.  This means that in low light situations, it can be very hard to make sure that you're aligning the camera properly.  Not a problem for shots of people who are close to you - since the camera has a dim focus light it uses, which does illuminate the people a bit - but for larger images it can be a problem.  It frankly hadn't occurred to me when I was researching the camera - I just assumed it had a range finder.<br /><br />Other than these minor issues, I'm ecstatic about the camera, and everyone who's seen it is impressed.<br /><br />I'm particularly happy with the quality of the Flash. Shooting last night in a darkened bar resulted in beautiful images.  The AIAF autofocus is amazing - every shot was in focus, even though the image was not clearly discernable on the screen.<br /><br />-- Updated after one year --<br /><br />Okay - this camera still rocks.  Everyone who sees it wants one, and everyone we've sent pictures to has been impressed.<br /><br />The autofocus isn't as good as the one on my old $100 point and shoot olympus 35MM.  That is disappointing.  It sometimes takes a few seconds to find itself, and occasionaly fails completely.<br /><br />The Flash isn't as good as I thought before.  It tends to overwhelm the image often.  But its pretty good.  Overall - love the camera.  I'm hoping they've fixed many of these issues in the SD20, which came out this year.","Excellent choice for a small size camera (looks bigger on the pictures)...Nothing beats canon with this model. Stylish design with a powerfull 4mpx.<br />On previous reviews I had noticed, that the optical zoom was one of the setbacks of this camera since it does not have it, but the technology that canon incorporated to this camera let the camera work extremely well using digital zoom only..<br />I would recommended to everyone if the size and quality matters.","I bought the Canon Powershot SD10 (ixus i) on 22nd Nov and<br />installed it on my PC. A few days later all my applications stop<br />working. I scanned the CD and detected 2 infected exe files on it.<br />I've contacted the local Canon representatives and also email<br />whoever at Canon that i can find online but NOT a single person has<br />replied my email.<br />A snippet of the email i sent to Canon, with the virus details.<br />Anyone else has this problem?<br />******************<br />Unknown to me, the The Canon Digital Camera Solution Disk CD is<br />shipped with 2 of the files INFECTED with Win32/Resur.b virus! After<br />installing the Canon CD, some of my applications stop working. It<br />took many hours to figure out what is wrong with my other word<br />processing and image editing software, as all I did was to install<br />your camera driver. One would not expect such a highly regarded<br />company such as youselves to have such sub-standard quality and<br />screening control as to allow something as damaging as this happen.<br />The infected files on the Canon Digital Camera Solution Disk Ver.<br />14.0 CD (C84-1199 Made in Japan) are<br />D:\\SOFTWARE\\RCTASK\\ENGLISH\\LAUNCH.EXE<br />D:\\SOFTWARE\\RCTASK\\JAPANESE\\LAUNCH.EXE<br />Attached is the screen capture of the virus scan.<br />For your information, the virus has cause most of my applications<br />on my machine to cease functioning, and subsequently infecting<br />other machines on the network. It took many hours to clean up the<br />virus, and reinstalling all the software and update patches. All<br />this due to a camera driver installation CD from Canon!<br />As you can imagine, I am highly disappointed with the whole<br />situation, which caused me and my colleagues alot of needless<br />stress and<br />wasted time. I have even tried contacting the Malaysian support but<br />after being passed on from one person to another and finally<br />having the details of my problem taken down by a very helpful Miss<br />Gan, who did not offer anything more than other alternatives of<br />acquiring another copy of the driver - but the damage has ALREADY<br />been done.<br />********************","The picture at Amazon makes it look huge in comparison (once you take it out of the box, you will be stunned at the actual size). I almost made the mistake of getting the Casio because it is so tiny, but reviewers said the 4MP Casio was a complete sham (more like 2MP) so I got this one instead. Very glad. Night mode is excellent and everything else is Elph quality- basically what you'd expect. Pretty tough too.<br />Just to be sure, I got a \"standard\" memory card because I was told the other ones wouldn't be compatible?","The camera is compact, very easy to carry around.  Comes with 32MB memory card where most others just provide 16MB. I highly suggest purchasing more memory as high resolution pics take up a lot of space. This camera is easy to use.  The pictures are crisp and clear and colorful.  Fantastic  pictures and easy to use camera makes this SD10 a winner.","The following website suggested that our SD10 cameras were limited to 256MB of SD Memory:  [...]<br />So, I e-mailed Canon's technical support group, and they replied with the following information:  \"As long as the memory is the standard SD memory card you will have no problem at using any size card you would like with the SD-10.  Hope this clears up any confusion.\"<br />So, If you are tempted to buy a 512MB SD card, just make sure it is \"standard SD memory\" and you will be fine.  I recently bought a 512MB SanDisk card myself because the movies chew through lots of memory.<br />I am a hard-to-impress techno geek, and I really like this product.  The first thing everyone said when I went to took pictures during Thanksgiving was \"look at how small that camera is!\"  It is tiny!  And, I am amazed at how many features they were able to cram into that tiny package.  I have another 2MP Polaroid digital camera with built-in printer.  It is a monster to carry around.  My justification for upgrading to the 4MP SD-10 was that it would be easier to carry around.  And, so it is.<br />When I went to buy memory, I was a little disappointed at the fact that the SD memory is so much more expensive than the Compact Flash memory.  I found 1GB cards of compact flash out there for around the same price as the 512MB SD memory cards.  So, going with another version of the Powershot that uses compact flash could make economical sense if these memory prices persist.<br />I shot some pictures without the flash in a \"barely-lit\" room with ISO400 turned on, and the pictures turned out to be as bright as if the sun were out.  I was amazed at how well they turned out in the low lighting.<br />The super-macro feature is \"mind-bogglingly-awesome\".  I shot a picture of a tiny piece of lint, and it turned out to show a ton of detail on the lint.  It was as if I was looking through a microscope or something.  That is a super-cool feature of this camera that I have never seen before.<br />I don't really miss the viewfinder since the LCD screen is very high-res and easy to see.  The camera is so small that it almost feels like you are taking spy pictures in an old James Bond movie.<br />If they would just throw a hand-held PC, MP3 player, and cell phone into this camera, I would only have to carry 1 device around with me.  I'm sure versions of this already exist, but just not with such a high-quality version of a 4MP camera.<br />My bottom line is that this camera is still a winner (5 stars) despite the higher cost of memory, lack of a view-finder, pricey cost of the camera itself and lack of optical zoom capability.","I just got the camera yesterday and immediately started playing with it. Like all other Canons, robust built, feels and touched nice and expensive. Didn't have to read the manual since this is my fouth Canon over the past several years in the ultra compact line. I like my camera to be very small and light and still robust enough to survive small accidents. The startup time is excellent, pretty much like point and shoot. The display adjusts very rapidly to different lighting conditions. An optical viewfinder wold have been great, but the display is sufficient for me. The picture quality in daylight is great, evening pictures with flash are good . Movie quality in low light condition is for me at least sufficient with little distortion. The audio playback in this tiny device is loud enough to understand everything recorded. The camera can be customized with different startup pictures and sounds for all kinds of functions. The camera came with the usual software, an updated version of Zoombrowser ex and some editing software. Since I use my own preferred software to organize and edit my pictures (good old photoshop and picasa), I only assume that Canon put together an easy to use software package for the novice user.<br />But the camera also has some drawbacks: It is quiet difficult for people with bigger hands to remove the SD card safely and without breaking the card/battery door. As stated by the previous post, the door somehow doesn't fit the rest of the camera. It is made of cheap plastic (the rest of the camera is metal) and doesn't close all the way. I'm afraid it might break off when changing the SD card or battery in a hurry. (better keep your fingernails long to pull out that SD card!)<br />The battery life seems to be sufficient, but I ordered a spare battery just in case.<br />The leather case that came with the package is well made but a little oversized for the camera. It is also missing a pocket for a spare battery or addtl. SD card.<br />Alltogether it was well worth waiting for this device after they stole my old S 330 about two months ago.","if canon's sd100 was still too big for you, the sd10 is an even smaller alternative.  but you give up the optical zoom.<br />pros:<br />- 4MP resolution!<br />- ultra-compact at 3.6 x 1.9 x 0.7\" weighing 3.5oz.  this is the smallest canon to date.<br />- stylish, all-metal body and you it is available in four colors: bronze, white, black, or silver.<br />- fast startup.<br />- fast shot to shot times.<br />- minimal shutter lag at faster shutter speeds.<br />- impressive overall photo quality for such a small camera.<br />- 5 point AiAF system.<br />- Quick Shot feature allows you to take pictures without prefocusing.<br />- very good macro performance.<br />- AF assist light is very useful for low-light focusing.<br />- has a metal tripod mount, which is not present in all the ultra-compact cameras.<br />- easy to use menu system.<br />cons:<br />- some redeye.<br />- above average noise.<br />- some barrel distortion.<br />- no optical zoom.<br />- more manual controls would have been nice (or at least some scene modes).<br />- no optical viewfinder - this makes it tough when you use this camera in bright sunlight.<br />- solidly built except for the camera/SD door which feels less robust.<br />- RAW and TIFF formats not supported.<br />- expensive for the feature set but you're paying for the ultra-compact package and the panache of this little gem.<br />- metal body scratches easily.<br />- 32MB SD card provided is inadequate so add $$ to your budget to buy external memory.<br />- proprietary battery - again, a few more bucks for a spare.<br />this is another solid effort from canon.  i particularly like the photo quality (especially coming in an ultra-compact package), the AiAF system, the AF assist light, and the body color options.  not having optical zoom and very few manual controls top my complaints, but i guess some compromises had to made to come up with these features in such a small package.  competitors would be the pentax optio s or casio ex-z3 which are slightly bigger and only have 3MP resolution but have 3x optical zoom. for even better image quality (in a slightly bigger package), also consider canon's sd100.  if you can live with a bigger camera, take a look at canon's a80, which has a lot more features in the same price range.<br />i hope this helps you with your buying decision. peace."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC33","amazon_reviews":["Very easy to operate.Takes excellent pics.

I work with digital cameras all the time in my line of work and this little Panasonic is by far one of the best I have used (compared to other small cameras by sony, canon, and fuji).  I did not get this camera from amazon but for those who want to buy a digital camera this is one of the few that are worth the price.  It is easy to use and the battery life is great(with the LCD screen turned off).  The only compaint I have with this camera is the option with movie recording, it is not poor but very close, so I still give it 5 stars.  Highly recommend to first time digital camera buyers.","I was doing quite a bit of research on 3 MP cameras a few months ago when I came across this camera. The lens is from Leica and the electronics from Panasonic. As I was a fan of both, I practically had no choice but to get this...!  I have absolutely no regrets. The flash is a little weak but if you don't have too high an expectation for that, you would be pretty satisfied. If you are planning to get your first Digital Camera, you simply can't go wrong with this one.","I did fair amount of research and concluded that the Panasonic Lumic DMC-LC33 is the best value overall. With the Leica lens, it takes absolutely great pictures that are comparable to those of film cameras.  It is very easy to use.  The mode dial (choice of simple, normal, macro, portrait, landscape, night portrait, motion) help beginners to take nice pictures.  For sophisticated users, it has many control enable you to adjust ISO, EV, white balance, etc. Besides the picture quality, its speed is one of the best among digital cameras. You almost don't feel any shutter lag.  I especially like the burst mode which let you take 5 continuous shots in one second, perfect for those hard-to-catch moments.  The movie mode appears a bit jittery at 10 fps, but like its still images, the picture quality is very good. I have seen other reviews mentioning the flash being weak.  However, I found it adequate and can be easily enhanced by setting ISO to 400.  Its size can fit into a pocket.<br />I think maybe because Panasonic is not as well known in camera as brands such as Canon, Nikon, Olympus, etc., so it prices its models very competitively. This is a great camera at a valued price.  I couldn't be happier with it.  Strongly recommended.","Panasonic digital cameras are not anywhere near as ubiquitous as Elphs, and it's unfortunate.  I think these Lumix cameras, which are slightly larger than the Elphs, compare more favorably in many ways.<br />I recently upgraded from my Panasonic DMC-LC20 to this camera and have not been disappointed.  The LC-33 is slightly smaller, is 3.2MP versus 2.1MP.  It still delivers many of the functionalities I was looking for in a DC.<br />The most important features on this camera are:<br />- Leica lens:  Perhaps one of the most important features of a camera is its lens.  With a good lens, you can take good pictures.  With an excellent one like a Leica...<br />- AA batteries:  Proprietary batteries suck.  They're expensive and they sometimes inexplicably just die or lose their charge.  It's much better to rely a few sets of AAs.  And if you're ever out on vacation and run out of power, just run out and buy more batteries instead of having to wait to look for an outlet and charge up for a few hours.<br />- Burst mode:  Allows you to take as many as 3 (manual says 5, but I've only gotten 3) pictures within a second.  This only works in ideal light conditions, but if you've ever tried to take sports/action shots with a DC, you know how frustrating it can be with the lag between clicking the button and the camera takig the picture, and the lag between pictures.<br />- Short Lag time:  Speaking of lag times, the Panasonic seems to have a shorter lag than Elphs.<br />- Picture Review:  Some cameras require you to switch from camera mode to picture mode to view the last picture you took.  This is a foreign concept to me.  With the LC33, press a button, and it's back on the screen for 5 seconds.<br />- Movie mode:  Although movies don't come out all that great (10 fps compared to 15 on some other cameras), the camera does allow you to record for as long as you have memory.<br />- Audio annotation is a fun feature to have.  This allows you to automatically store a few seconds of audio with your picture.<br />- They fixed the battery storage fip-door thing.  The LC20 had a horrible design that just felt like it was going to break anytime.<br />Cons:<br />- Weak Flash<br />- The body of the LC33 doesn't feel quite as sturdy as the Elphs, but I haven't had any problems with the LC33, and my LC20 is still going strong despite some short falls.<br />The camera I was comparing it to was the Canon A70, which I've heard and read is supposedly the best in this class.  The Elphs are nice, but more pricey.  And since I wasn't as concerned about size, I opted to look at the LC33 and A70.<br />I eventually settled on this camera for the following reasons:<br />- It takes 2 AAs rather than the A70's 4 AAs.  If a camera takes 4 batteries, you'll need a minimum of 8 rechargable batteries at all times.  With the LC33, I get away with having 6 AAs.  Each pair gives me a good 100+ shots.<br />- Panasonic takes SD memory instead of the A70's Compact Flash.  CF is a dying technology.  Even Canon's moving away from it.  (Note their newest Elph, the SD100 takes SD.)  SD, is here it stay.  It's being used in PDAs, phones, and other mobile devices.<br />- A70 fit poorly in my hand.  The battery storage area for the A70 is in the handle.  Before you buy any digital camera, go to a store and see how it fits in your hand first!!!<br />- Last, my previous positive experience with the Panasonic swayed me towards the LC33.<br />I'll conclude with the end to my review of the LC20:  The key to buying a DC will be to ask yourself what you will be using the camera for most. Is it something you want to bring with you EVERYWHERE? If so, you'll probably want something ultra-small, smaller than this camera (and thus probably twice the price of this camera). I just wanted something to replace my Point-and-Shoot, something that allows me to take a lot of pictures without worrying about the cost of film, development, etc. IMHO, this is a great starter DC. It's relatively cheap, has a lot of great features, and it's compact enough to carry in a jacket pocket. Overall, it has exceeded my expectations and continues to please.","There are plenty of long interesting and informable reviews, I'll keep it short...GREAT CAMERA!!!  It had it all at a great price with all the features of the more expensive camera's: CanonA70  Only draw back is the way it sucks up the power, get rechargeable NiMh batteries and a bigger memory card. No company gives a big enough card so dont use that as a mark of a good buy for a camera. This is the one....GET IT!!!","All the reviews about the \"user friendly\" aspect are true. I did not even read the directions to set the clock and date, it guided you thru on the screen. When I did open the book to read the directions they were very easy to follow and was taking pictures within a half hour of receiving the camera. I Highly recommend this camera if your not into paying mega bucks for a very fine camera. I purchased at the same time a 128 MBSD memory card and the NI-MH rechargable batteries as recommended by the other reviews,so I feel I am ready to go take pictures of the Holidays without any problems. Panasonic has always been my preferred brand for ALL of my electronic products, they have NEVER let me down","I was searching for a digital camera that took decent pictures without the large price tag. I found it!! This camera is on the smaller in size, light weight, but full of features. It takes an SD card which is common. It also takes ordinary AA batteries or may be used with rechargable AA. It doesn't require a special battery like so many small cameras. It takes great pictures on fully automatic or can be manipulated manually. It rivals my mom's canon A80 for picture quality for a lot less money (and it's smaller and lighter). I haven't found any negatives yet, but I've only had it 2 weeks.","I bought this camera 1.5 weeks ago, and used it at several family Thanksgiving gatherings. I have been very pleased with the results so far. It has really met all my expectations.<br />I had been looking for a $200 travel camera, and had been watching the features I wanted come down the price curve. I am an experienced photographer and wanted all the key features and controls, but it had to be easy enough for my wife and kids to use. I purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LC33 on a short local sale for $200. This camera has had little publicity and distribution, but is very competitive at the the standard $269 price. It is a hidden gem.<br />Details:<br />So far, everything working as it should.<br />The Leica lens, which drew my initial attention, produces VERY sharp images. For indoor family shots with limited light, setting the ASA at 400 produced amazing results without flash, and at the low resolution setting. I kept the flash off most of the time. Battery life has been excellent, but since I have not yet used up a set of high capacity rechargables I am not sure how good. Camera feels good in the hands, but I found that to take steady pix, it helped to use the optical viewer and hold the camera against my face. There are many controls accessible and easy to use, but you have to know or learn what they mean to get the most out of the camera.<br />On the other hand, if you just want point and shoot simplicity, just put it in that mode using the top dial (the heart) and start shooting.<br />Transferring images to my pc (WInXP Pro) was quick and very easy. I connected the camera to the pc with the USB cable. A new F disk drive appeared in my Win Explorer window. I just copied the files to the new directory for my Thanksgiving photos. Then unplugged. Click on the file to display the image. I have not bothered to install the software that came with the camera. I don't envision doing a lot of editing.<br />The movie mode with sound works well. The review functions work well when playing back the photos and movies, and deleting unwanted images was easy. Little shutter delay noticed, and there was quick recovery between shots. Optical telephoto function works smoothly, but digital telephoto hard to figure without practice. The multi-shot button will come in handy when shooting kids.<br /><br />Tips - turn off LCD display when not in use. When battery starts to show running down, turn it off for a while to let it recover.<br />For web posting and emailing, use the lowest resolution setting. JPG file size was about 60k, and they looked great.<br />Negatives:<br />Found it a bit confusing when clicking the shutter switch as to whether a photo was taken, partly because of flashing diode lights and slight shutter delay.<br />A bit larger and heavier than the smallest Canons, but at a lot smaller price. The choice is yours. This one is small enough for a jacket pocket or micro pouch, but perhaps too much for a shirt pocket. All very small cameras such as this one need special care when taking shots to avoid jiggle and fuzzy focus. The sound recording option made me wish I could plug in headphones to listen, but I can live without it. LCD will get smudged and probably scratched pretty fast. I will look for a Palm type cover sheet. Sometimes forgot to switch back from review mode to photo mode on top dial, which caused confusion when trying to take the next shot.","The panasonic DMC-LC33 camera is a good deal for those looking for a basic digital camera without a plethora of manual settings.<br />It does not have aperture or shutter speed priority controls. Most people won't use these features and will find the automatic settings sufficient. The auto settings will provide them with enough flexibilty for normal daylight exposures. The flash is rather anemic, but does a good job within it limited range. Most compact cameras seem to suffer this malady. Overall I find this camera will take good pictures within it's given limitations. As a point and shoot compact digital camera it does an excellent job (for the money). If you expect perfect clarity and resolution, buy a good 35mm camera.","This is the fourth digital camera I have bought, and I love it! Before I talk about why, let me answer an earlier question from \"customer in Atlanta\", who asks \"does the camera print the date on the photo?\".<br />The answer is that almost all digital cameras, including this one, comply with the DPOF (Digital Print Order Form) standard. This means that they all record the date, time, aperture, shutter speed and a whole host of other information for every photo. You don't have to do anything, they do all this by themselves. As to whether you can print the date on your photo, well, that depends on your printing software, not on your camera. Therefore, with the right software, almost every digital camera will print the date on the photo. The software that comes with this camera DOES allow you to print the date on the photo.<br />The camera itself is superb. The lens is from Leica, the best lensmaker in the world since 1925, and you can tell by the pictures. They are as sharp as a tack, with good color saturation and contrast, and will print to 11\" x 14\" size with no problem at all.<br />I got this camera for my wife, who was a little intimidated by the SLR film cameras that we have, and by the Olympus C730 digicam that we have. She wanted something that would be point-and-shoot easy, but produce good sharp photos. This camera fits the bill perfectly. It handles well, is very light, and is just the right size in my view. There are smaller digicams (the Canon Elph and the Pentax) but they are TOO small in my opinion, and that makes them hard to hold steady and keep your fingers out of their way. (By handles well, I mean fits well in the hand, feels good, feels balanced, and you can easily keep your fingers away from the flash, light sensor, and lens).<br />By the way, if you read the editorial tech specs on Amazon for this camera, they talk about the \"MEGA optical image stabiliser\". This is a mistake, this camera does NOT have MEGA. MEGA is on Panasonic cameras with a 12x zoom, whereas this camera has a 3x zoom. The good news is that you don't need MEGA with a 3x, only with a 12x. (Long zooms such as 12x suffer from severe camera shake when fully extended).<br />We run our Lumix on rechargeable NiMh batteries. They are very long lasting, and work out to be a fraction of the price of any other batteries. Make sure to get NiMh's with more than 1800 mAh. Ritz Camera have a great 4-pack of \"Sunpak\" NiMh's at 2000 mAh for only ten bucks - half the price of Radio Shack or anyone else. Speaking of price, check the Panasonic camera web page for the MSRP of this camera - you will find that neither Amazon nor anyone else is discounting the price.<br />They don't have to in my view - this camera is better than others I've seen at $400. And my wife's opinion? She loves, and I mean loves, this camera. She is now excited about photography (to my delight) and takes pics just about every day. I can easily see the Lumix becoming our main camera because of its easy portability and use, and its great results.<br />If you plan to get a 3.2 megapixel camera like this, you should also budget for a 128Mb memory card. The 16Mb card that comes with it holds only 10 or 20 pictures (depending on the compression you choose) at 2048 x 1536.<br />If you are looking for a good point and shoot automatic camera, you will not regret buying this one.","On Oct 9, customer mrb1862 wrote in his excellent review: \"Pictures do not show the date (computer file only)\"<br />This feature is very important to me.<br />At Buy.com, product'Technical Specs'state in additional features: built-in Date/Time Stamp.

(Cameras like those from Gateway, Samsung, Vivitar, Argus etc are just pathetic in comparison, don't waste money on them.) My recommendation is to get either Panasonic LC33, Sony P72 or Canon A70.","Can't give a complete rating yet, just received it from Amazon and the thing died within a half hour.  New batteries didn't help, so its going back.  I've got another one on its way here (Amazon's shipping is very fast- and FREE).<br />Also, Amazon is giving out $50 for purchases above $250 and if you go to Panasonic's web site, you can still get a free 128 meg SD card until the end of Oct.<br />Pros<br />[] Burst mode works great (neat for golf swings).

The instruction manual is very well written and the camera, while small, has a feel of quality.  The picture quality is very good up to and including 8 x 10.  The only area of improvement here would be the included 8 megabyte SD card.  This is unacceptable in a 3.2 megapixel camera. My advice would be to get at least 1 128 meg SD card and give the 8 meg card to someone still using a 1 megapixel camera.","The DMC-LC33 is my first digital camera; I've been using Leica \"M\" rangefinders for 20 years, and, candidly, the Leica lens was a major draw.  I just returned from my first real outing with the camera and I love it!<br />* I shoot every image at maximum resolution and print using Picture Window and an Epson 2200 -- 5\"x7\" prints are glorious; 8 1/2\" x 11 \" (~A4) are really good if viewed from a foot or more away.<br />* There are enough controls to put the photographer in charge if need be (I use the +/- EV control a lot), but on pure auto-pilot the exposures are always at least decent, usually better.<br />* I've had good experiences in \"Leica mode\" -- turn off the flash and display, compose through the optical viewfinder.  The exposure lag is the only downside I've found with this camera.<br />Highly recommended to any traditional photographer wanting to get their feet wet in the digital realm.","I have been researching for my 1st Dig cam for a month now.

However, to my dismay, the picture quality wasn't what it promised to be.  When using the largest picture resolution (lower res. seems to be more sharp), most(90 percent or so) of my pics came out grainy--even when the camera was adjusted to ISO 50.  And as if that wasn't bad enough, the focus was soft.  The pics also seemed rather \"mosaic\" in form.  My old digital cam did this some of the time, but, this one did it often; very often. I can't quite describe it other than if you took a sharp picture, went in with Adobe and made it look a little more impressionistic/pointilistic (is that a word?) Anyhow, when you do view your pics on your program, you can't really see the noise (by the way, the manual says the \"mosaic\" noise is normal) until you view the pic at its full size.  But, why buy any digital camera if you can't use its largest resolution and not get sharp pics? Anyhow, that seemed to be the largest dissapointment.  Oh yeah, if you soom out to its max, be prepared for a very blurry image.<br />I did do some comparison shots.  It seems the grainy effect is in correlation to the color mode you pic.  If you use \"natural,\" the graininess associated to the color (some colors are very grainy...like brown and gray shadows), the graininess is less; \"standard\" is a little more grainy, while \"vivid\" is rather grainy.  I also printed out one of my grainy pics and sadly, the grainy color make-up also came out in the print.<br />On its plus side...it's fast (if you have an SD card).  It's light, the overal picture color is nice.  It's got some cool effects--cool(makes your pics more blue), warm (makes your pics more red), black and white.  It takes only 2 AA batteries and has a real nice power economy mode.  The LCD screen can have its brightness adjusted, too...good for those sunny days.  The MOV recording is fun...has sound (it's only mono)...still nice and it doesn't use too much memory (320X240 res).  And physically, the camera fits in one hand and can be operated with that one hand.<br />So, if you don't mind too much about having grainy pics, it's a fun camera.","First, I will say that this camera is a great value at the listed price.  But with the certificate Amazon offered, along with a rebate from Epson on the 825, you effectively get a free photo printer afer rebates and credits.  Wow.<br />I took the camera to a weekend baseball tournament to take a few pictures.  Instead of taking a few pictures, I was asked to take pictures for the team's digital yearbook. I ended up taking 230 pictures over three days.  Most were outdoors so no flash was used, but there is still life in my second set of batteries for the weekend.<br />The pictures are consistently excellent.  I simply pointed the camera and took a picture, using the standard auto mode the whole weekend.  The only pictures that were poorly exposed were my fault, and were easily fixed using software.  It fit in my hand nicely for such a small camera, and felt solid.<br />Consider rechargeable NiMH batteries a requirement, and get at least a 128 MB SD card, preferrably 256.  Also consider a carrying case (I found an inexpensive Case Logic fabric model that works very well).  This will add about $100 for the accessories, but they are well worth it.<br />I could go on and on with praise, I really have no complaints.  I wish that there was zero lag between pushing the button and being ready to take the next shot, but all cameras have that.  The display is very nice, even in bright daylight, I recommend covering it with a screen protector.  The rapid 5-shot sequence mode was very cool, especially for capturing a batter's swing or a pitcher's release.  The menus and controls were easy to use and had a good feel.<br />It would be hard to imagine finding a better value in this range.","Bought this camera a few weeks ago. Made my decision because of the Leica lens and I have not been dissapointed. It takes really great pictures with amazing clarity. It also has a few manual settings for those who want to have a little control. I heard in Japan this camera is really making waves over there. Try it out and you'll see what the rave is about."]},{"name":"Sigma SD10","amazon_reviews":["Great Camera with kit lenses that far surpass Nikon Kit lenses.

I have the TTL flash made for the camera by Sigma, and its 'ok' with some post editing. Good reach and power, but will sometimes not talk to camera and need to restarted.<br /><br />Because of it being a stripped down body, I have had better battery life and easy use of the few functions that the camera does have.

Long before reading about the X3, I always wondered why we had to be content with 25% Red, 25% Blue and 50% Green on an Image Sensor -- why not 100% of all colours? However, business was booming for all Digital Camera companies despite the fact that there wasn't really a CCD that could be seriously taken till the X3 arrived on the market. I knew instantly, the SIGMA-Foveon joint venture would break through a newer kind of Digital Photography, so I decided to wait. I skipped SD9 when I realized Foveon was working on a combined 10MP X3 Chip.<br /><br />The wait was worth every second! I ordered the SIGMA SD10 with the standard twin Lens Kits (18-50mm F3.5-5.6 and 55-200mm F4-5.6) and separately ordered a 18-50mm F2.8 EX DC Lens. I wish SIGMA had packaged the kit with at least one F2.8 large aperture Lens. Anyway, I will give my 18-50mm F3.5-5.6 to a friend who just bought a NIKON D70 with a NIKOR 18-70mm Lens.<br /><br />I have not yet received my shipment from AMAZON, but have had the chance of using my friend's SD10, including the SIGMA Photo Pro software and some sample X3Fs and some of my own. The RAW format of SIGMA has some outstanding advantages over the JPEG type of files. With a RAW file, you will feel like as if you're truly dealing with a \"Negative\", whereas the JPEGs will feel like \"Polaroid\" shots -- equivalent to getting prints from a Camera. SIGMA should never revert to traditional file formats and stick to this great RAW format which allows the best possible artistry with digital negatives.<br /><br />I know why NIKONs, CANONs and other brands won't want to use X3 -- they want to maximize their profits by using their proprietory CCDs no matter how badly they compare to a superior product. I think they are also complacent that their \"devoted\" customers will not change sides because of their famous names. But I can tell you, there would be a lot of migrations now towards the X3 and SIGMA -- those popular brands have already compromised their quality by not developing something equivalent to X3.<br /><br />Well, I have used NIKON, CANON, Fuji and the rest --- but to tell you the truth, SIGMA is like a Rolls Royce of a Camera. They have only two Models, but they speak volume of quality and they are also the only sellers of X3 sensors at the moment.<br /><br />So, if you want to experience something quite special and differnt than the rest, then SIGMA is the only option currently available --- I suggest, you give it a try to judge for yourself.","Sigma has a winner with the Foveon chip. Excellent images and far superior to ordinary chip cameras. The best feature of the camera itself, in my opinion, is the ease to which to operate the controls. The controls are very intuitive compared to the other 4 or 5 digitals I have owned or operated. Simplicity is the secret, not a lot of \"junk\" that will never or rarely be used. I was a professional photographer in the 80's and 90's and always found other digitals too complex even for someone with a comfortable knowledge of photography. The only negative I have found in the month and half I have owned the SD-10 is battery usage. You have the option of using rechargable AA or the CRV-3 batteries. With the AA, I get intermittent operation, something Sigma stated was characteristic of Metal Hydride batteries, especially if new. I'm a little skeptical of that assessment. I did just purchase the CRV batteries to try them. The only other issue I have is that I try to use the camera in a professional setting and there is not a way to get the flash off the camera. I purchase the Sigma DG 500 Super, which is a great flash if you don't need it off the camera. I bought the pc adapter and use it with a Metz 60ct2 flash. It would be nice if they (or someone) would produce a TTL cable or compatable flash. Overall I'm very happy with the camera and hope that more compatable accessories follow.","Perhaps the most annoying thing about using the SD10 is that there is no straightforward answer to the seemingly simple question, \"How many megapixels?\"  Purists claim that it has only 3.4, and Sigma claims 10.2, counting all three colors at each of the 3.4M locations.  When people ask (and when they see my prints, they DO ask), I sometimes just say 3.4, leaving them to wonder how I do it.  The way I figure, when you save the file at double size, you're getting 13.7 megapixels with the same amount of interpolation on the red and blue channels as a normal camera, and more interpolation on the green channel.  However you figure, the resolution is stunning, and with a little care you can make 12\" by 18\" prints that are as sharp as most eyes can tell.<br />Pros:<br />1.  The software, especially the \"fill light\" function will let you quickly massage even your badly exposed pictures.<br />2.  The great resolution.<br />Cons (I'm spending more space on these because Sigma's text waxes eloquent on most the pros (and they're not lying)):<br />1.  The software.  The SD10's only format is a proprietary RAW format, so you need to run everything through their raw converter before you do anything else with it.<br />2.  The kit lenses are OK, but not great.  The 18-50 in particular is vulnerable to a lot of chromatic aberration.  If you're going to shoot with EX-series lenses (and you really should), you might as well just buy the body.<br />3.  Low light performance is not stellar.  ISO 800 is practically unusable, and ISO 400 is dicey.<br />4.  The buffer is not huge, and the write speed is slow.  The camera will take only 6 high-resolution shots in burst mode, and after that it can take more than a minute for the camera to recover.<br />All in all, however, this is a great camera, and if you get it you're likely to one-up all those folks buying digital rebels.","First off I want to say this is an Amazing Digital SLR.. the picture quality is outstanding.. if your in the market for a pro level digital slr you can't go wrong especially with the 2 lenses that were designed for this camera..<br />On another note.. amazon's features list is wrong.. the camera doesn't accept xd memory and it doesn't come with a 32 meg card.. its a compact flash format camera.. i'd recommend a 512 meg or higher CF card as it fills up quickly at its highest resolution..  my old 64 meg CF card can take about 6 pictures on its highest resolution.. i've ordered a 1 gig card i'm just waiting for it to ship now..","Great Camera with kit lenses that far surpass Nikon Kit lenses.

I ordered the SIGMA SD10 with the standard twin Lens Kits (18-50mm F3.5-5.6 and 55-200mm F4-5.6) and separately ordered a 18-50mm F2.8 EX DC Lens. I wish SIGMA had packaged the kit with at least one F2.8 large aperture Lens. Anyway, I will give my 18-50mm F3.5-5.6 to a friend who just bought a NIKON D70 with a NIKOR 18-70mm Lens.<br /><br />I have not yet received my shipment from AMAZON, but have had the chance of using my friend's SD10, including the SIGMA Photo Pro software and some sample X3Fs and some of my own. The RAW format of SIGMA has some outstanding advantages over the JPEG type of files. With a RAW file, you will feel like as if you're truly dealing with a \"Negative\", whereas the JPEGs will feel like \"Polaroid\" shots -- equivalent to getting prints from a Camera. SIGMA should never revert to traditional file formats and stick to this great RAW format which allows the best possible artistry with digital negatives.<br /><br />I know why NIKONs, CANONs and other brands won't want to use X3 -- they want to maximize their profits by using their proprietory CCDs no matter how badly they compare to a superior product. I think they are also complacent that their \"devoted\" customers will not change sides because of their famous names. But I can tell you, there would be a lot of migrations now towards the X3 and SIGMA -- those popular brands have already compromised their quality by not developing something equivalent to X3.<br /><br />Well, I have used NIKON, CANON, Fuji and the rest --- but to tell you the truth, SIGMA is like a Rolls Royce of a Camera. They have only two Models, but they speak volume of quality and they are also the only sellers of X3 sensors at the moment.<br /><br />So, if you want to experience something quite special and differnt than the rest, then SIGMA is the only option currently available --- I suggest, you give it a try to judge for yourself.","Sigma has a winner with the Foveon chip. Excellent images and far superior to ordinary chip cameras. The best feature of the camera itself, in my opinion, is the ease to which to operate the controls. The controls are very intuitive compared to the other 4 or 5 digitals I have owned or operated. Simplicity is the secret, not a lot of \"junk\" that will never or rarely be used. I was a professional photographer in the 80's and 90's and always found other digitals too complex even for someone with a comfortable knowledge of photography. The only negative I have found in the month and half I have owned the SD-10 is battery usage. You have the option of using rechargable AA or the CRV-3 batteries. With the AA, I get intermittent operation, something Sigma stated was characteristic of Metal Hydride batteries, especially if new. I'm a little skeptical of that assessment. I did just purchase the CRV batteries to try them. The only other issue I have is that I try to use the camera in a professional setting and there is not a way to get the flash off the camera. I purchase the Sigma DG 500 Super, which is a great flash if you don't need it off the camera. I bought the pc adapter and use it with a Metz 60ct2 flash. It would be nice if they (or someone) would produce a TTL cable or compatable flash. Overall I'm very happy with the camera and hope that more compatable accessories follow.","Perhaps the most annoying thing about using the SD10 is that there is no straightforward answer to the seemingly simple question, \"How many megapixels?\"  Purists claim that it has only 3.4, and Sigma claims 10.2, counting all three colors at each of the 3.4M locations.  When people ask (and when they see my prints, they DO ask), I sometimes just say 3.4, leaving them to wonder how I do it.  The way I figure, when you save the file at double size, you're getting 13.7 megapixels with the same amount of interpolation on the red and blue channels as a normal camera, and more interpolation on the green channel.  However you figure, the resolution is stunning, and with a little care you can make 12\" by 18\" prints that are as sharp as most eyes can tell.<br />Pros:<br />1.  The software, especially the \"fill light\" function will let you quickly massage even your badly exposed pictures.<br />2.  The great resolution.<br />Cons (I'm spending more space on these because Sigma's text waxes eloquent on most the pros (and they're not lying)):<br />1.  The software.  The SD10's only format is a proprietary RAW format, so you need to run everything through their raw converter before you do anything else with it.<br />2.  The kit lenses are OK, but not great.  The 18-50 in particular is vulnerable to a lot of chromatic aberration.  If you're going to shoot with EX-series lenses (and you really should), you might as well just buy the body.<br />3.  Low light performance is not stellar.  ISO 800 is practically unusable, and ISO 400 is dicey.<br />4.  The buffer is not huge, and the write speed is slow.  The camera will take only 6 high-resolution shots in burst mode, and after that it can take more than a minute for the camera to recover.<br />All in all, however, this is a great camera, and if you get it you're likely to one-up all those folks buying digital rebels.","First off I want to say this is an Amazing Digital SLR.. the picture quality is outstanding.. if your in the market for a pro level digital slr you can't go wrong especially with the 2 lenses that were designed for this camera..<br />On another note.. amazon's features list is wrong.. the camera doesn't accept xd memory and it doesn't come with a 32 meg card.. its a compact flash format camera.. i'd recommend a 512 meg or higher CF card as it fills up quickly at its highest resolution..  my old 64 meg CF card can take about 6 pictures on its highest resolution.. i've ordered a 1 gig card i'm just waiting for it to ship now.."]},{"name":"Fujifilm FinePix S7000 Zoom","amazon_reviews":["It arrived in great shape with all the original accessories...and the manual.

His original camera, identical to this one, was in need of repair which would have cost more than purchasing this camera.  It arrived promptly in original packaging and it works great.  He is 81 years old and had no desire to attempt to get used to a new camera, so this was a perfect fit for him. He is thankful to have a working camera again.","I own two S7000's. My review is simple. I purchased my first S7000 new in 2004. It served me well as my first digital camera. I love the way it takes excellent macro pics. It is hard on batteries and I quickly learned that lithium batteries were the only thing that would last for long. My biggest challenge with this camera is the delay between the time you press the button to capture your image vs. the time the image is actually taken. With the slight delay, I had to work and practice a lot to capture images at the exact time I wanted them. This was especially important to me when shooting pics of my family playing sports. Several snap-on attachments I acquired for the lens seemed to be a waste of time and money. I am especially fond of the fact that you have the option to use a view finder or the small monitor on the back of the camera to frame your shots. With my vision being slightly less than perfect, I enjoy the view finder because it makes the images much sharper than the viewing screen. A simple press of a button lets you switch betweeen these two options.<br />A few years ago I upgraded to a Nikon camera but I continued to use my S7000 for macro shots and locations (sporting arenas) where professional cameras (my Nikon) was not allowed. Approximately three years ago my S7000 suddenly quit working. The view finder/monitor on the camera would not display clear images. Any pics taken also showed the same scrambled image. Attempts to get the camera repaired were met with expensive estimates of around $200. Eventually I found a used S7000 on Amazon at a very reasonable price. Even with the few shortcomings, I am very happy to have another S7000.<br />Note: With regards to the above mentioned purchase, I procrastinated and did not immediately rate the Amazon seller of the S7000 I purchased several months ago. When I tried to rate them recently, I discovered an Amazon policy that would no longer allow me to do so. I would like to thank Amazon seller BFuller563 for the entire buying experience of my second S7000. The purchase was handled perfectly, the seller communicated with me in an extraordinary manner, and I highly recommend BFuller563 to others.","This is my third S7000.  Not because the other two quit, but both were stolen.  After trying smaller Kodak and Vivitar cameras, I had to go back to the Fuji.  Although no longer produced, this camera fits so well in the hand, and the controls are so easy to manipulate I found myself scouring the internet for used ones.  The versatility of this camera, the quality of the pictures and videos and the design are some of the most comfortable features in a camera I've encountered in my 50 years of amateur photography. Some say the batteries drain quickly but I have found that using a high quality rechargeable makes that problem minimal.  And a 1gb XD card can store so darn many pics you could shoot for days. Fuji did a phenominal job on the model and I hope to use my third Fuji S7000 for many years.","Not to make this a short and sweet review, but I love this camera. I've used it for many years. The super macro lens is great. The only knock on it to me is I'd like more zoom lens, but for something that is a fixed lens camera it is fantastic. Really wish they still offered it brand new.","It arrived in great shape with all the original accessories...and the manual.  I was very impressed.","The best fuji camera, better than newest models.

Even ISO800 images come out quite well. RAW images that come out of this camera and processed through Fastone(image program) generally look astounding. The larger 1/1.7 sensor definately flexes its muscles in the s7000.<br /><br />However, with the high shutter range, fast 2.8 lens, and general nice feel, I cannot understand why Fuji limited the ISO range. My s5200 can take 64-1600, which is why I still keep it around. If I could think of any other prosumer camera that could one up this dynamic duo, it would be the Konica Minolta A2 with it's manual features, larger sensor, better lens system and generally bulky feature set.<br /><br />Other than that, I believe this camera does the trick for hobby photographers.","This Fuji S700 is my 4th Digital Camera. The first was a HP that started messing up within the first week. I swapped that out for a Fuji which gave me years of reliable service. I gave that to  friend a few years ago when I bought a Panasonic that had more bells and whistles. She is still using the Fuji I gave her. The Panasonic developed a quirk with the on/off switch and I went back to Fuji with the S700.<br /><br />All I gotta say is, WOW! This S700 far exceeds my expectations. It has more features than I'll ever use and is very user friendly. Even a newbie will easily be able to use it right out of the box. It has the looks and feel of a sturdy SLR and is extremely well balanced. That make is easy to take quality no jitter pics. Both the view finder and LCD screens are remarkably bright and easy to see even in the brightest conditions out side. The pop up flach is unique and does the best job I've ever experienced with eliminating red eye. For those of you who have Dogs and/or Cats, you know that even with red eye eliminator set on most cameras, the eyes of your pet will still have that piercing glow. Not so with the Fuji S700! My Puppy Zoe's eyes are the beautiful soft natural Brown even with the flash. Rae my Cat's deep Green eyes look deep and green wvwn with the flash. The Vid setting takes amazinly great Video for a multi function Camera. You can get up to 45 minutes of Vid on a 2 gig SD card. The audio is even exceptionally good for a Camera. One feature that knocked off my socks is the battery discharge feature. I was able to completely discharge some NIMH batteries that were destined for the recycle bin due to not keeping a charge. That resulted in them now holding a complete charge again! I can go on and on about the wonders of this camera. Oh yeah, the manual. It's detailed and leads you through the use and functions in a logical, easy to understand step by step process. One of the best written manuals I've ever seen. Yes, there are better ones on the market but they are many times the cost of the Fuji S700. I could go on and on singing the praises of the Fuji S700 but will conclude in saying that I'm beyond pleased with it.","I've been using my FinePix S7000 for about three years now.  Overall, I've been extremely please with all aspects of the camera *except* for the following:<br /><br />1. The electronic zoom control is inoperative in the movie mode.<br /><br />2. *My* camera requires a re-boot when I switch from a CF card to an XD card.  No rebooting is required when I go the other way (XD to CF).  Fuji claims this is a problem that could be corrected with a new mother board, however, my camera is out of warantee and I'm not going to pay $175 to fix such a minor problem.<br /><br />I have taken literally thousands of pictures and I have to say that this camera has consistantly produced outstanding results.<br /><br />All considered, looking back to when I bought the camera, I made a good decision and would probably do it again.","The Fuji S7000 doesn't disappoint! I have used this camera for about 3-4 years and am still using it. If there is one camera you need to take with you in a hurry for any photography situation, this could be the one. The 6x optical zoom is more than competent for about 95 percent of most pictures, and if you need more then you can bump up the added 3.2x digital zoom (total 19x zoom). With this camera you can put in two memory cards at the same time (CF and xd), but of course it will read/write to only one at a time that you choose. But this gives you automatic backup, just switch to the other card if your primary card is full! Also, it shoots 30 fps video, so it's a good idea to get as big and as fast a memory card that you can. In the macro mode it can get as close as ½-inch, and I have taken many awesome close-ups! The built-in flash also has a rated range of nearly 28 feet at wide angle and 26 feet at telephoto! And it has a hot shoe so you can add a more powerful flash if you wish, if you needed it. I did have a disappointment with it in that because the lens is an external zoom (the lens zooms outward), it is not possible to attach a lens filter to the front of the lens. (When the lens is retracted, it is possible to attach a 55 mm filter, but then the camera won't operate because the lens can't pop out when the camera is turned on.) I believe Fuji sells an accessory tube that can be attached which is longer than the extended lens to allow the use of filters. (I was brought up on film SLRs, where every lens had a UV or haze filter to protect the lens.) Another quirk, which is a \"good thing,\" is that this camera will shut itself down when battery power is low. It happened to me, but all I had to do was restart the camera, and it will continue to take pictures (and then shut down again). I know I am writing this review late, since the camera is already officially discontinued, but I happened to browse this site, and was impressed that the camera has such high rankings and such a loyal user base.","I've now taken this camera through four years of hard use and it has been terrific. It's been dragged through dusty back roads of Mexico and to snow covered New England mountain tops. Take the time to learn how to take advantage of the control it offers.  It provides the power and flexibility of an SLR digital and the convienence of a point and shoot. The zoom and lens optics are impressive.  I can highly recommend the S7000 for someone wanting a more serious digital at a great value.","I still love this camera. I actually have 3 other digital cameras (Canon, Panasonic, Disney) and this is the one I use the most. It has the best clarity and I'm in love with the video capture. It also has a \"multiple shot\" function to get those hard-to-get fast motion or low light pictures. I've had this camera for a little over 2 years now and not one problem whatsoever! (knock on wood) Great buy!","This is an awesome camera. One of my great investment ever! I had bought it from Sears as closeout model for under $[...].<br /><br />I own this camera for more than 1.5 years now - just never got a chance to write review on it. I am not a professional cameraman but I love taking pictures. And any give time, pictures taken from this camera just come out great. All of my friends & co-workers always envy my camera. I ended up buying the same camera for my brother too. ;)<br /><br />When I originally bought the camera, 6.3MP was a lot for most of the people. Now you can even find 7MP camera. Most of the time I actually take picture with 3MP but they still 100 times better than regular 3-4MP cameras. I have taken some great skyline pictures in the night with this camera too. My advice will be to get 1GB SD memory card along with this camera so you don't need to worry about any space issue.<br /><br />The only pictures I don't like with this camera are fast activity picture and the one mainly in low light. I just find the speed slow that it's not able to take very good pictures. For that I use, small point & shoot digital camera. But with this small disadvantage this is still an awesome camera and so I am giving 5 stars!","I must say I have been totally pleased with the purchase of the S7000 camera. I owned a Fujifilm 6900Z prior to acquiring this camera and have found the S7000 to be a world apart in difference (much better). Utilizing the excellent digital media format (xD) or the older Microdrive/Compact Flash I or II media. Slots are provided for both. The range of shutter/flash settings provided are capable of all that you'll ever need and even a threaded cable release shutter-release button for time exposures. All though the lens' zoom controls are now on the back right-side panel of the camera they are a little less intuitive in this location and a little more cumbersome. The learning curve is a little steeper with these zoom controls at least as to placement of the controls. One control any photographer should learn about right away is the exposure/focus lock button, although the auto-focus feature works extremely well, a slight movement of the camera will change the point of focus rather quickly. So, knowledge of the exposure lock control is fairly important. Also, you will need to keep the exposure lock button depressed until the shutter release button has been depressed and the image begins recording. This is a minor drawback and inconvenience and Fuji should have created a simple \"on\" lock for depressing the button and an \"off\" mode if pressed again. In addition, the manual focus setting appears to be pretty worthless as the focus mechanism struggles to update the focus point inside the viewfinder rapidly. This makes knowledge of the use of the exposure lock button with the auto-focus feature even more important. Understanding White Balance is also key with this camera. Relying on any camera's auto white balance feature, means a lot more post processing correction. Custom White Balance with S7000 is a breeze using the back side of a 18% Gray card (it's white)! Read up on this feature before heading out into the field and relying solely on the camera's interpretation. A major plus with this camera is the capability to do all image processing outside of the camera with a PC or MAC. This camera offers the RAW CCD sensor format solely for post processing work (image processed outside the camera). Images range from about 12-13Mb per image. So definitely obtain a 1Gb xD or Compact Flash storage card if you want to work a lot in this particular format. Rechargeable NiMH batteries are a must for this camera unless you own stock in EverReady or Energizer. Although, power management is extremely good even if you like to preview your images a lot? You will find you'll need to end up turning the camera on and off a lot if you're using a timer for the power management. I have always set mine to \"off\". Also splurge on the exorbitantly priced AC Adapter or buy one used online. If you decide to let the camera process images, you will get some extremely good color results at the highest JPEG settings (6.3 Mega-pixel actual and 12.1 mega-pixels interpolated). This is probably the easiest and best setting for most people who don't want to process every image outside the camera on a computer. I never use the video capabilities on this camera although they are quite good, only limited by your memory card capacity (I'd say go for the Hitachi 2Gb Microdrive if you plan on using this for video) I believe if you want to shoot video though, you should buy a video camera. This camera is too capable for still image creation to utilize as a video camera solely. I found this camera to be one of the finest semi-pro point-and-shoot cameras on the market for the dollar. This model incorporates top notch optics and superior low noise, and in-camera processing (JPEG) when utilized. This is an easy camera to recommend for an advanced user and someone who is already familiar with basic photographic exposure principles and color temperature. It will be a challenging camera for someone who is just beginning to come to terms with photographic principles however. I am a professional photographer who also uses the Fuji S2 and S3 Pro SLR digital cameras where a multitude of lenses might be required. So, I have a pretty thorough understanding of the most of the Fuji lineup from recent years.","My previous camera was a canon g2 which was an excellent camera so I was hesitant to try a fuji but after reading the great reviews I decided to try it. Got the S7000 on ebay for 275.00 with 512 memory card. I have to say this camera is amazing using the 6mp mode, I mean its no professional camera but the average user like myself will be blown away at the results. I beleive the picture quality is due to the focusing of the camera which is excellent and fast. If you are considering the s9000 or the s5200, save some money and get a s7000, you wont be sorry!","I think this is one on the best camera`a that I`ve used for simplicity, not being a pro I have found that the pictures that I have taken for my website ( [...] ) prove what quality photo`s can be taken on this camera. I think you`ll be amazing at the quality, especially the night shots taken from the top of the Empire State Building and Time Square in New York.. Its a brilliant camera for a learner and will give you confidence to follow it up with a more interesting look at photography..<br /><br />Well worth a loook..","I have owned Fuji Finepix 3800, some junkie Sony, Fuji Finepix E550, Canon Digital Rebel XT and this one. Guess which one is left standing. I have bought, sold and returned all of these cameras including the S7000. I then came back to my baby. It will take a heck of a camera to replace this one. I think I'll keep this one for ever and maybe get a second one as technology advances. You won't be sorry.","I have had GREAT LUCK with the Energizer e2 LITHIUM AA's.  They cost around 12$ for 8, but I went through 600 pictures w/flash and they are still going.  I have heard many people complain that the Fuji S7000 draws batteries, and these are great!!!..  Rechargables dont even come close!!!","Quality, much better than I imagined. I was unsure about switching from 35m SLR film to digital but this little beauty has changed my way of thinking. The controls are very similar to an SLR. The results speak for themselves. I have used the camera now for about 6 months, taken over 500 shots. Taken it on holidays to Canada (3 weeks mostly cold 1 degree Cel and lots of snow. Shot mostly in Ap priority (as I used to with 35m) and it worked extremely well. I especially like the way Fuji have incoporated their film colour technology into the digital camera. The colours are brilliant. It's an easy camera to use if you are used to 35m SLR, but this camera is definitly not for beginners. Well done Fuji.<br /><br />Problems<br /><br />No Problems as such but would love a DOF smaller than F8. I am used to F22 at least. A DOF preview button would be good also. I really miss that. Plus an ISO of less than 200 would be even better still. Low light is a little difficult to focus, but can easly set to manual focus.<br /><br />I can not understand why some reviewers say poor quality? All I can say to this is, you must be using it wrong.<br /><br />Great camera, go buy it.","OK - I am not a \"camera-phile\".  I read all of the reviews by the more experienced camera users.  All very informative, but very technical.  From a \"regular mom\" consumer point of view, I wanted to add my comments.  I LOVE this camera.  The quality of pictures I am able to take is just fabulous.  I was reluctant to switch to digital, but now I wonder why.  The ability to manipulate photos of this quality has been great.  Often friends can't believe they are digital prints!  I've just been thrilled.  Initially, I was unwilling to spend this amount (remember, just a mom wanting to take family pics), but it really has been worth it.<br /><br />Thanks to Fujifilm for a great camera.","May be this sounds interesting, but I'd been upgraded to the FinePix S7000 from a Canon A95.<br />You can ask me the question: why did I ever upgrade when I was mad about my A95?<br /><br />The reasons are simple:<br />- Because I cannot afford two digit cams at the same time at this price level (so my second one is a Fuji A200 for pocket use).<br />- Because I needed a hot-shoe for future plans,<br />- Because it has 6x optical, 2.8-3.1 fast zoom lens,<br />- Because it has unlimited movie mode,<br />- Because although the ISO starts at 200 (160 in auto mode) it is quite clear even at ISO 400 (and 800 at the 3MP mode),<br />- Because of the professional feeling, excellent ergonomics,<br />- Because of the high resolution viewfinder,<br />- Because of the many extra settings and external buttons for quick menu accessing,<br />- Because of the 1/10,000 min. shutter speed,<br />- Because of the \"last 5\" continious shooting mode,<br />- Because of the 1cm super macro mode,<br />- Because of the faster performance in record mode, faster AF,<br />- Because of the USB 2.0 high-speed transfer from camera to PC,<br />- And because of the dual media slot that is very useful.<br /><br />So what are the things I miss from my S7000 at this price range?<br />- Flip-out and rotating LCD<br />- Custom modes on mode dial (or anywhere)<br />- ISO 800 at full CCD resolution (6 MP) - Yes, I DO NOT miss ISO 100!<br />- Continious shooting mode with flash on<br />- A bit better auto white balance<br />- An AF-assist lamp would be nice (passive sensor helps mainly in good light)<br /><br />Many people compare the S7000 to DSLRs. This is NOT fair IMO. Compare DSLRs to each other, this camera may look like a DSLR (that is very nice) but that is not a DSLR and it doesn't want to be one. It's an all around, full-featured prosumer camera with high quality lens and longer than average zoom.<br /><br />I use only the 6MP mode, the 12MP interpolated is not my cup of tea. The images are soft and noisy for my liking in the 12MP modes, but in the 6MP mode everything is clear - so if noise is the issue you hesitate buying this camera, then go and get it, it's not an issue - at least for me.<br /><br />I like the aperture of 3.1 of the 6x zoom lens at tele position very much. With this, I can make crystal clear and sharp images at full zoom, without having to struggle with light and AF. Of course, it needs external light that can be a flash unit, but this property of the S7000 is really outstanding, comparing it to any of my previous Canons.<br /><br />The last 5 continious shooting mode is very useful - it even works for moving objects, I shot several sharp images of my 2-year-old daughter without any problems. Just make sure you have a big memory card, make as many photos as possible and keep the best of them at the end of the day.<br /><br />Strong jpeg compression is another thing I was afraid of. Having 5 Canon compacts before, my first thing was to test the image quality straight out of the S7000 without any post-processing. Some of the photos I saw on the net (on pbase) were great, but some of them looked grainy and soft. Here's my opinion: again, at the 6MP mode the images are GREAT. At the 12MP modes, although it allows for larger print sizes, images look grainy and soft to me. So I stick with the 6MP mode, it's enough for me and gives at least as detailed pictures as my A95 gave before.<br /><br />What can I say about the macro mode? It's outstanding with great DOF, very high resolution and image detail. No complaining about the S7000's macro performance.<br /><br />VGA movie mode - it's nice. Fills up the memory card quickly so be sure to get a few ones (or a big one). Try to avoid microdrives, nowdays high capacity CF cards can be bought, no need to a microdrive, I always preferred flash cards to microdrives.<br /><br />One of the big big advantage of the S7000 to other cameras is user friendliness, ergonomics, menu and button layout. It's unbeatable I think. Everything is in the right place, you can manage the camera even with one hand.<br /><br />I have only one problem at the moment, but it's not that big really. The camera seems to misfire the white balance sometimes when using flash indoors. It has a blueish tint to the images taken, that happens occassionally. In the same environment, without changing anything, I was obtain to take 9 pictures with great wb and 1 with bad (blueish) all the time out of 10. This is quite strange, may be I have a faulty camera I don't know, but it can be easily corrected in post-processing afterwards.<br />It did the same when using one of the pre-programmed wbs, like the incandescent setting.<br /><br />Still, despite of the white balance issue, I HIGHLY recommend this camera to every serious amateur photographer out there. It's certanly NOT a DSLR but can you get a DSLR for this price? I don't think so. The S7000's outstanding ergonomics and appereance, feature set and high quality optics raise above most of today's compact (and even prosumer) cams, just go and buy it you'll love it I promise. That's what I've been told and they were right!<br /><br />...<br /><br />Back again. Did I ever mention the RAW format and the zoom ring for manual focus?<br />I would like to talk about the noise issue. The S7000's lowest noise setting is ISO200 in P, A, T and M modes, and the camera can select ISO 160 if it can. Are the images of the S7000 noisy at ISO200? I would say definitely NO. In fact, image noise of the S7000 at ISO200 match the image noise of my A95 at ISO100. One of my favourite digitcam reviewers on the net was complaining about ISO200 as the lowest selectable ISO and higher than average noise. OK, a Rebel has less noise. But hey, again, this is not the same price point. For the price, the S7000's noise is lower than average. I can shoot hand-held images without flash at ISO400 (or 800) and I don't need a tripod. Just try it yourself and you'll see that noise is not an issue, indeed it's better(lower) than average. Show me another camera at this price that has lower noise at ISO200 and ISO400 than the S7000. I wonder if you could.<br />So come on people, hurry up, before this excellent camera gets discontinued!<br />...<br />Another update: the more I use the camera the more I like it. There is another issue unfortunately: blown highlights. The S7000 tends to overexpose images occasionally that many times leads to blown highlights and therefore loss of detail. Be careful with the right exposure setting. I know that in winter it's really tough for the camera to set the correct metering, but the number of overexposed images seem a bit more than average to me. Still, I love this camera you just have to check and set the exposure manually a few times and then you're ready.<br />DOF of this camera is SOOO great!","This is my 2nd digital comera. I have been using<br /><br />it for over 8 months. I am very happy with this camera.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews about the good photo quality<br /><br />from this camera. Just to address something not heavily<br /><br />covered by other reviews.<br /><br />1. I am using Hitachi's 2GB microdrive and MAGICSTOR's<br /><br />  2.2G microdrive. No problem for continuous 5-shooting<br /><br />  with the highest resoultion setting (5-meg, fine),<br /><br />  where each picture is about 4.8Meg byte in size.<br /><br />  Microdrive is fast enough.<br /><br />2. With microdrive, this camera can capture >30 min of<br /><br />  video at its highest setting (640x320, 30-frame/sec).<br /><br />  The video lenght is limited by my microdrive disk<br /><br />  space.<br /><br />3. With microdrive, the captured video does not show<br /><br />  any slack, and dragging effects. You don't need to<br /><br />  use xD-card for video capturing. The microdrive is<br /><br />  already fast enough for non-stop video capturing.<br /><br />4. This camera has very very good video capturing power.<br /><br />  The captured video is better than my JVC camcorder.<br /><br />  The color is more vivid. The focus is far more sharper.<br /><br />  The audio capturing is more clear than my JVC camcorder.<br /><br />5. Excellent low-light video capturing power.<br /><br />  Here is the best part, virtually all camcorders don't<br /><br />  capture good videos under low-light condition. This<br /><br />  camera is very good in video capturing under low light<br /><br />  condition. In a kid's birthday party, when all the light<br /><br />  is off, with only the few candle lights on the cake,<br /><br />  it still can capture good video. Pretty amazing....<br /><br />I do a lot of video shootings for my 4 and 3 years old<br /><br />daughters. Instead of using my camcorder, I use this<br /><br />Fuji S7000 most of the time for video capturings.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera for both photo shooting and<br /><br />video shooting.","I haven't seen any battery drain with the FinePix S7000 and use a CompactFlash card to store the images.<br /><br />Also when it arrived it was factory set at 1 Megapixel so you need to push the f button and change the quality setting to a higher level [I keep mine set at 6 Megapixel].<br /><br />At that setting it is very high resolution, I use images I take and use them as a background for my desktop PC and the colors are excellent.<br /><br />Overall a great camera, also the video setting works great, it has two settings, at 640 it lasts 1m48s and at 320 it lasts 3m34s with a 128 MB CompactFlash card.<br /><br />Also at 6MP it holds 83 frames with regular snapshots, and at 3MP it holds 164 frames on a 128 MB CompactFlash card.","I owned the Finepix S3000 for a couple years before I purchased this model about 6 months ago in late June of '04. I was EXTREMELY fond of my old camera so Fujifilm is where I looked first. I briefly considered a Sony and a Canon Digital Rebel but settled on the S7000 based on great reviews and amazing price.<br /><br />\"Disappointed\" isn't even in my vocabulary!<br /><br />Excellent camera - it is my S3000 plus a whole net set of additional features: much faster shutter delay and focus, better lowlight shooting, fully manual settings, greater megapixel rating.<br /><br />The things rules. I rarely leave the house without the S7000.<br /><br />Hats off to Fuji, AGAIN!","I work as a wedding/portrait photographer using high-end Fuji and Nikon DSLR cameras. DSLRs are excellent performers, but they don't make good family/travel cameras because of their bulk. When I decided to buy a new family/travel digital camera I wanted something that could perform almost as well as high-end DSLRs but in a relatively compact form with a low-end price.<br /><br />The ONLY camera that fit the bill was the Fujifilm FinePix S7000. I can't say enough about how great this camera is. The list of great things is too lengthy to go into, so I'll list the only two negative things about this camera. 1: The autofocus system is not as fast/reliable as what you can get on a higher-priced DSLR like the Nikon D70 or Fuji S2. But then, the S7000 is at least $500 less expensive. 2: The ISO noise/grain is worse than in a higher-priced DSLR, but you can remove ISO noise/grain easily using Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.<br /><br />If super-fast autofocus speed and clean high ISOs are what you \"need\" then I don't recommend the S7000. But for 90+ percent of people out there, the S7000 will make an EXCELLENT camera.","I'm an early adopter of digital cameras and have been progressively upgrading as the better technology becomes available at a reasonable price.  With my current iteration, I decided to get the best available (at a reasonable and depreciating price) that I could find.  I also looked at the many reviews, but went ahead a purchased this camera, mostly because of examples I found on review sits and my preference for Fujifilm digital cameras.<br /><br />The bottom line?  I've had this for about 7 months and still love it.  New digital SLRs are coming down to the reasonable price range lately and I have NO motivation to upgrade - I can imagine using this camera for years - and that says a lot for me.<br /><br />By the way, to correct one reviewer's comment regarding the video recording of this camera - it is NOT limited to 30 - 45 but the limit of your memory (compact flash/micro drive or xD), and the quality of the video is quite good - I use it as a substitute for my digital video camera more frequently than I use my video camera!","The best thing about this camera has to be its video capture (with sound).  You can only record about 30 - 45 seconds at a time, but the resolution is unbelievably clear!  Better than our digital camcorder and very easy to upload to your hard-drive.  We are really impressed with this product, which we have owned for 6 months now.  A great buy!!!","As a photographer, I'm in the beginning to moderate range.  I bought the s7000 prior to a recent trip through Colorado and the Dakotas in September and October, and came back with several hundred photos.  I don't think I had really discovered photography until I sat at my computer and saw some of the great photos this camera produced. Everything appears to work well, although it is more complicated than the basic point and shoot stuff. The color photos are great and the built-in macro is killer. I purchased both the Olympus wide-angle and teleconverter lenses (as well as the Fuji adapter ring), and these complement the camera nicely. A couple sets of rechargeable batteries are a must if you take a lot photos like I did in the Rockies. Stick with the viewfinder as opposed to the LCD monitor to maximize battery life. My only real problem is that the auto/manual focus switch is easy to trip, sometimes resulting in out of focus shots if you're thinking you are in auto mode.  Otherwise, this camera ís very much right on and can deliver professional quality shots.  I'd say the s7000 will open up new dimensions for the beginning/intermediate photographer. I bought mine through Amazon.com, who usually offers up very competitve prices and is very reliable. Highly recommended camera.","I was originally looking for a full SLR digital camera but after reading what the S7000 could do I decided to take a chance and pocket the extra $600-$1000 for the Canon or Olympus. I have not been disappointed. The image quality is superb, the features are great, the battery life has been very good, its durable, its not as heavy/sturdy as the Digital EOS for instance but it doesn't feel like a toy either. You can run the gamut from full manual to full auto to adjust to your situation. It also takes both Compact Flash and new XD cards which was a selling point being taht I already had 2 big CF's. The optics are great and while you don't have the lens flexability of a true SLR there are attachments that can get you closer. (...)","Okay I'll be honest. I am a complete amateur(for the moment) when it comes to cameras and all the jargon that is associated with them, but I must say that this baby does a really nice job of what it is supposed to do and that is to take good,high quality pictures. Tinkering around with the buttons for an hour or so will give you a general idea of what this camera is capable of. The only problem that I did face was that the memory card supplied with the camera is woefully inadequate for the kind of images that you would like to take with a camera of this calibre. All in all I am extremely pleased with my purchase.","I bought this camera in september of 04 and am very pleased with the results. The image quality is sharp and the picture can be blown up without distortion. It looks and feels like an SLR although I was expecting the auto focus to be quicker. I also bought the 256mb compact-flash card and I get a little over 50 pictures in 12mp mode so I would definitely buy a memory card. I am now using it for my sister's senior pictures and am very particular about my photos. This camera excedes expectations. If you want a great camera for a great price, I would no doubt by this camera.","I own two photography companies.  I purchased this camera because of its incredible price.  The quality is amazing.  I would recommend it to any professional or novice.  Very easy to use.  I love the manual settings as well.<br /><br />A must buy!","This is the best camera you will find for under five hundred dollars.  I just spent all day taking pictures with it and I'm totally blown away by this camera's performance.<br /><br />Someone said that it doesn't autofocus enough but only one of the 200+ pictures I took today was out of focus.<br /><br />The camera is a little awkward to hold.  I almost always use a tripod anyway so that's a non-issue with me.<br /><br />Switching picture quality is really fast and simple.<br /><br />It's nice to be able to switch from the EYF to LCD screen with one button.<br /><br />The zoom is fast.<br /><br />It runs on AA batteries instead of a pack.  I ran out of juice today but I was able to canabalize the AAs from my MP3 player.  This made me realize how much better it is to just use common battery types instead of an expensive pack.<br /><br />The camera wrote to my xD picture card REALLY fast even on the higher quality settings.  This is probably more to the camera's credit than the card's but I love those little cards.  They're so tiny, I feel like I'm on star trek when I use them.<br /><br />It took exellent pictures!  Way better than my old kodak.<br /><br />It's auto mode is great for a beginner and its manual modes and settings would make it great for a back-up camera for a professional.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm very pleased with it.  It was fast to set up my shots, it wrote to the card fast, the pictues look good.<br /><br />** I would reccomend that you get a tripod or at least a monopod though since it lacks image stabilization. **<br /><br />:) I'm very happy with it.  :)","This is my third digital camera the others are an early Olympus 2020 (2 Meg) and a Canon Elph (3 Meg - bought for the small size).  I had three SLR's over the years, and love taking photo's.  I looked for an upgraded camera to take on a boat charter to the Alaska Inside Passage this summer.  I did a lot of research and read the reviews.  I settled on the Fuji Finepix S7000 for a variety of reasons - the biggest being the ease of use (it holds and hefts like a SLR, so it comes naturally) and picture quality.  Others I looked at include the Canon Digital Rebel (not a lot of versatility in the stock lens), the Nikon 8700, and the SONY.  My criteria were something that got me 6 Meg (to get a good 8x10 print with some cropping), could do point and shoot as well as aperture, shutter or manual without a lot of fussing around, appeared to be well made and fit in a medium sized case.  Based on the reviews and the price, the S7000 was my choice.<br /><br />The camera is great, all and more than I expected it to be.  It takes great pictures, has a lot less shutter lag than my other two cameras, brilliant colors, little color fringing, and low battery drain.  Everything is well thought out and fits in your hand like a good SLR.  With a 512 MB XD card and a 512 CF card in the camera I was able to have over 600 pictures in the camera. It is a joy to use.<br /><br />Any limitations?  The wide angle is a 35 mm equivalent - a 28 would be nice indoors, but it has not bothered me yet.  There is a less range in ISO speeds than I would have liked.  But these have yet to have any impact on the quality of my pictures.<br /><br />I love the camera.  Any limitations now are those of the photographer.  To see what it can do, take a look at the Fuji enthusiats web site [...]<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend it.","i've had a 1.3mp olympus digital for some time now and went to this camera.<br /><br />If you're into the basics of photos (point and shoot)This camera has that with very good results.<br /><br />If you think that 6mp is over kill. Think of your last vacation photos can you really blow that up.<br /><br />Now ever wonder what your shot could have been like if you could just change something to make the pic look just the way you want.<br /><br />Welcome to more<br /><br />and enjoy<br /><br />ps<br /><br />buy Rechargeables","I got this item as a gift for myself after a vast amount of research.  The other camera that I was looking at was the new Canon digital elph.  My mother ended up purchasing that one and I chose the fuji.  My previous camera was a canon digital elph, and I liked it very much.  That being said, this Fuji far exeeded my expectations in every way.  It is a lot bigger, so if you want small stick with canon; however, when comparing the same picture, from the same distance, in the same lighting my camera blew my mother's canon away in clarity.  The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a rechargeable lithium battery instead of taking double A's.  I do love the ability for dual media and I took a picture of a flower on macro only to find there was a bug on that flower that I couldn't even see.  I really love this camera and all my friends want one now.","I don't want to bore you with this-n-that and what this camera does and it's shortfalls.  In short, it's a great camera.  I've had it for a couple of years now and have shot a little more than 13,000 photos.  In short, this camera has been outstanding.  Four months ago I bought a Canon EOS 30D (8 MP) thinking that I could improve my photos (I also needed a camera where I could change lenses).  But I was dead wrong in my thinking.  The Fuji S7000 out shoots it!  I know that may sound funny especially when you read all the kudos by professionals in the various photo magazines toward the 30D.  I know.  Who am I to say they're wrong.  I spent one afternoon shooting the same scene with both cameras.  Both cameras were set on a tripod to make everything equal.  Later that evening I printed eight pictures shot with the S7000 and with the 30D.  I took them to work and asked several people to tell which pictures they thought were the better.  In each case they all picked the ones shot with the S7000.  They were just a bit sharper.  The smaller details were clearer.  The Canon does have some nice features, but when you spend $1400 on a camera that has a higher MP rating you would expect it to produce a better picture.  Against the S7000 it loses.  Especially when you consider the price.<br /><br />I got my start in photography in the mid 1950's in Japan and haven't stopped.  I've had pictures published in magazines and books.  I grew up with 35mm and 2-1/4.  I can tell you without reservation that this is as good as any of the 35mm's that I own.  And a couple of those 35mm cameras are professional grade.  Now it's great to come home after a day's shooting and download everything into my computer in a few moments.  No more standing around waiting for things to develop and no more breathing chemicals.  No more washing prints and drying.  I just sit at the computer and produce pictures as good as anything I've ever shot.<br /><br />I seriously doubt that you'll find a camera that does everything you want and to the degree you want it.  Take a chance!  The S7000 will not disappoint you.  Believe me this is an outstanding camera!!","Go for it. I purchased 3 weeks back, taken 1200 snaps. Most of them superb. I am no expert ( used a 1.3 mp for some time), but I am sure, I will grow with this one. The Auto mode is decent. Even 3 MP pics  in Auto are excellent unless u r looking for massive prints. Macro/Close Up mode is grrreat! Hope this works ok, and then I will really have a nice time.<br />The Good News : Any Novice can easily use it and churn out great photos.<br />However, get at least 256 Mb if not 256 in both slots. Forget Movie Mode, though it is clear, takes too much memory. Contrary to Review, the Battery lasts long enough. Get a rechargable in course of time. Also, think of a Bag to carry it around. It is quite big, bigger than my Sony TRV 19 MINIDV.<br />Worry : Why are prices falling fast ? I got for 590 less 100 mail in fr Fuji ( yet to get rebate).Now rebate is gone, but Amazon sells for 499. Buydig gives for below 450!!! What is Fuji upto?<br />As an user, I have to give it 5 Star. Its good, budd. Happy times!!!","I bought this as an upgrade to my Fine Pix 2400 compact and haven't been disappointed.<br />The electronic viewfinder has a big and clear display ,with a useful grid feature you can switch on and off to help with composing pictures to the rule-of-thirds. The battery life seems to be reasonable, and the memory options with XD clips and micro-drive compatibility is welcome for taking lots of shots at the 6.3 megapixel maximum before software does its thing to generate 12 megapixel files., which I haven't bothered with.<br />Colour saturation looks a lot cleaner than with the smaller 2.1 megapixel 2400, and the 6X optical zoom works well, but a tripod and a cable release is necessary to avoid blurring of distant detail. The self timer could be used instead of a cable release, but this option might be too slow for some users who use maximum zoom on a regular basis.<br />Downloading via USB 2.0 is significantly quicker than with USB 1, even so, the purchase of the XD/ smartmedia reader would be a good choice, especially if you intend to use the 128MB and higher  XD clips.<br />A collar can be fitted to the main lens ring, with which you can attach filters. A polariser would be a good addition for getting crisp shots under bright light conditions.<br />This camera can also be used to shoot short videos, and be used as a webcam.<br />Although the battery life is reasonable, purchasing the optional power supply would be a good idea, especially if you intend to be using the flash unit a lot.<br />This is a good camera.","Having owned the Fuji Finepix S602, I recommended to two colleagues they consider it's next generation S7000. Both decided to buy it after examining and briefly using my S602. When I got a chance to play around one of theirs, I was immediately impressed with how much more responsive the S7000 autofocus was and how incredibly crisp it's shots were even in low light condition. On top of that the latency between shots was much better that the S602. The only thing I seem to dislike a bit is the autofocus mechanism which appears much noisier than its predesessor. I can hear it operating and making faint clicks all the time.<br />I had my S602 for 2 years, loved using it, but disliked its low light performance. I managed to sell it and get the S7000 (...). Aside from the cost of the new XD card I needed to buy it is a GREAT deal, and I get new warranty to boot! A no-brainer purchase.<br />The sturdiness of the S602 continues with the S7000. It is rock solid and comfortable in my hand. It is not comfortable for my wife however who prefers her own pocket sized Gateway 5.25 mp camera.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this Fuji camera feels much like a small 35mm camera and can be something that gets a bit tiring to lug around your neck. That said, I would rather carry it and have the ability to takes photos that are really outstanding with the Fuji S7000 camera. It captures images of stunning clarity and color better than all other digicams I have had the occassion to use or test except the Sony DSC F828 8mp unit. Considering the delta in price ($350 or more) the Fuji really stands out as the clear bargain and a pretty capable one also. Though not perfect it scratches enough itches to satisfy this casual photo taker.<br />Many have underscored the issue of distorion caused by the firmware compression but I have not noticed anything objectionable so far. All 400+/- pictures I have taken are more than acceptable in that performance critereon. A new button near the 1.8\" display makes resolution adjustments much easier than the prior model. Adjustments can be made in 1/4 the time. Great idea Fuji!. The only feedback of a negative nature on the menu system is in the means of performing a memory format. In the S602 it was very easy to do, in the S7000 it is now buried in a different menu and a bit more difficult to perform. This is a pretty minor issue however.<br />All in all I believe anyone wanting one of the better digicams out there for considerably less than those High End Big names, walks away with a fine camera and hundreds to spend on other 'toys'!","I did a lot of research for my big move from the original HP 1 megapixel digital camera I have had for the last 3 years.  I wanted to purchase a camera that placed me close to my old SLR Film days and the Fuji S7000 is that camera and a whole lot more.<br />I looked closely at products from Canon, Pentax, HP, and Nikon and found that dollar for dollar, the Fuji S7000 was an excellent choice.  The pictures that this camera takes are incredable to say the least.  I took pictures from 2 Meg up to the 12 Meg and also using the RAW settings, and the color saturation and clarity are awesome.  Obviously the best shots are at the 6 Meg level, but what range you have!  Wow!  Also, the Macro and Super Macro settings are a lot of fun and get the minute details that you really want with close up shots.<br />Lastly, I have not run into any of the problems that I have read in a few of the prior reviews, ie. the battery drain from the CF Media or noise on film (I even tried the shot with the lens cap on and no lines (noise) recorded!) I did buy a double set of good quality rechargable batteries and have taken a lot of shots with no problems.  Buy it quick and (...) it's an even better buy!!!<br />I love this camera and look forward to many years of fantastic photos!","I am \"in love\" with this camera! I have NO COMPLAINTS whatsoever about it, except maybe for the fact that the neck strap is in the way of my hands, but that's CERTAINLY not a reason for not buying this camera! The results of the pictures are absolutely beautiful, even at the lowest setting. It has a LOT of bells and whistles--for the photo-tech--and enough automatic functions to make a novice happy! I can't say enough about this camera. I am overjoyed that I now own such. The pictures are beautiful both on-screen and printed out. You WON'T be disappointed in purchasing this one.","I received the S-7000 about a week ago and have taken about 250 pictures with it so far. Generally, the image quality is very good even at the lowest setting (1M) and the resolution is a great improvement over my old Sony FD-91. The color is more true than with the Sony.<br /><br />My only dissapointments so far are:<br /><br />When you have an image with a solid background there is noticable noise that manifests itself as slight color splotchiness in dark backgrounds. A 2 second empty image (with the lens cap on) had various white, blue, green, and red dots throughout the black field. I don't know if this is a sensor or firmware function but long exposures at night might be affected. Good news is fringing is minimal.<br /><br />Using the flash at longer distances is one of the reasons I choose the S-7000 and it works very well even at around 30 feet. But it does seem to be a bit on the warm side yielding a slightly  greenish-yellow tint to whites. This may have been due to my proximity to the subject at the time since other images seem to be well balanced.<br /><br />The auto focus has problems in low light situations but if you keep the subject greater than about 7 feet away you should be alright. I tested this last night in a darkened house and it seems to work alright.<br /><br />Fuji says it has a CF II memory slot but they say it's for a microdrive only (max. 1 GB but I've seen packages that include 2GB microdrives). Most info doesn't mention that. I have read that 512 MB 40x Lexar CF cards work without a problem but since Fuji doesn't specfically recommend them you take your chances if you use them. Also, some CF cards can cause your batteries to drain even with the camera powered off. I understand openning the storage compartment door, after the camera is shut down, will prevent this. Since the file system is fat16, you are also limited to 2 GB storage, which should be plenty for anyone buying this camera.  The 16MB xD card that comes with the camera won't do you much good unless you stay close to a computer to empty the card when it's full.<br /><br />That Fuji doesn't supply a set of rechargable NiMH batteries and a charger with the camera is something else to take into a purchasing decision. If you already have them you're in good shape but look for the added expense for them and storage if you do not have them. A set of fully-charged 1900 mA NiMH batteries lasted for about 150 images. Most of these images were taken using the flash and the LCD panel. Since I'm still using just the 16MB card it also involved uploading the files to the computer for evaluations. Just a note here I do wish the LCD was tiltable.<br /><br />Having been involved with technical documentation for 30+ years I have to say that the manual leaves a bit to be desired as well. There is no index and it seems Fugi has it's own terminology for some functions/features. They haven't separated feature information from usage tips. (This is good for beginning users but this and the lack of an index made the manual hard to use when looking for specifics.)<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />(...) it's a fair to good point-and-click camera but if it was any more than that I be very disappointed with the noise in the images and the non recommending of CF cards. I'll probably be contacting Fuji to see if there is a firmware update available or if there is anything that can be done about the noise.<br /><br />Follow up to previous review...<br /><br />072604 - Just got back from a one week vacation around Mt. Rushmore and must say I was disappointed with the S7000 in auto mode. I took more than 200 6MP photos with the camera in the auto mode in daylight and darker situations requiring the flash. (BTW the NiMH batteries lasted the entire trip even with the 1GB microdrive and the flash.) The noise in the images has made them essentially useless to me for anything but computer desktops or snapshot use and the color bias toward the green end is bad enough in some images to make the sky look teal in color. (Photoshop may be able to correct this but I don't feel I should have to do this.)<br /><br />The auto focus may have caused some of the detail problems since it focuses in steps (about 21) not in one smooth range.<br /><br />The lack of image stabilization hurt the quality of some of my images where I was at a location that would not allow visitors to use the flash and tripod use was not feasible.<br /><br />I have images from an Olympus C-50 in auto mode that produced color much more true and free of the noise that blurs details.<br /><br />There are cameras that yield better images for less money. They may not have all the features of the S7000 but if you think about it, you really won't use most of them. I should have kept the Olympus C-5050.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this camera unless you're willing to put up with it's short-comings. To some people they are minor but for my use they are not.<br /><br />11/26/04<br /><br />I've contacted Fugi several times about firmware updates and have only recieved form-letter responses that pretty much say we're not doing it cause we think it works fine. Their web site has not improved since I got the camera.<br /><br />I just came back from a short trip and the images I got at a 6MP setting were of considerably lower image quality of the same subject, under the same conditions, a friend got using a less expensive 5MP Sony camera.<br /><br />The more I use this camera the more disappointed I'm becoming.","I've now learned that the problem with the batteries discharging while the camera is turned off is limited to early production models with certain CF cards left in them while turned off. In the UK Fuji repaired the cameras. In the US they've just told people not to leave CF cards in them. It turns out that the problem can also be solved by opening and then re-closing the battery compartment after turning off the camera. (It some how resets the power supply so that it doesn't drain the batteries through the CF card.) In any event, this shouldn't be an issue for anyone buying a new S7000 at this time.","I Started about 5 years ago with Black and White photography.  That being my main forte I was looking for a good transition to digital.  I did massive amounts of research and landed upon the Super CCD Fuji.  The noise issue did give me some concern, however, dealing with film I feel it gives it a more realistic quality.  I can't wait till Fuji masters the Super CCD just think the octogonal constructions is way ahead of its time, perhaps too far.  However.  After using this little bugger for 3 weeks now I am in love with it.  The night capabilitys are amazing.  It says maximum sutter time is 15 seconds, but, with a release cable, it can stay open for hours.  It has \"B\" mode.  Awesome.  The macro cababilitys are also killer.  Now to get a shot that I can only get with film just use the manual override.  That way you have total control.  Sorry, I can't keep my hands off this little bugger.  Good luck on your research.","I have been getting amazing photographs with this camera. In just one trip to Mount Shasta, I got atleast thirty stunning shots with great realistic colors. Better than the best photos I got with a Canon G5 borrowed from a friend for a Cancun trip. I was even able to make 16\"x20\" posters out of some pictures.<br />This camera excels at outdoor photography where colors and light are both rich (it does not have a snow mode though if you are thinking of taking it along for a ski trip). Menu controls are less than intuitive - for example you cannot access the megapixel resolution setting through the menu - you need to press a different button.<br />The best feature in this camera has to be the speed. If you have used other digital cameras, you would have experienced the frustration of the \"moment\" slipping away while your camera takes its time responding to your pressing the button. Not this one - shot times are extremely fast, making even this bulky monster a near-natural fit in most photo situations. This is probably one of the fastest cameras out there.<br />This camera takes AA batteries - which is great. I got myself a set of 8 rechargeables so I would have a fully charged backup set at all times.","Now that I've had the camera for several months its seems like a good time for an update, especially given some of the criticisms that have been leveled at the S7000.<br />The short answer is that I still love the camera, even though it's not perfect. The long answer deserves some explanation.<br />I have many years experience with 35mm film, but also many years experience with computers and computer graphics. Even today, film has capabilities that can't be matched with digital cameras, except possibly by cameras beyond the means of most people. On the other hand, digital photography has huge advantages in terms of immediate accessibility, cost per shot, electronic distribution, editing and enhancement, and the ability to control the printing process to get prints that look the way you want them to.<br />My initial path into digital photography was to buy a film scanner and scan 35mm slides, which in some ways still represents the best of both worlds. But it is a time consuming and expensive (on a per shot basis) approach. My move into digital cameras has occurred in two steps. The first was to replace my \"little\" 35mm camera with a compact digital camera. For recording events and snapshot photography digital cameras became the preferred approach several years ago, and I'm on my second generation compact digital camera. I love being able to go to a family gathering, then go home and do a quick sorting and editing of the pictures, dump them on the web, and e-mail out a URL so everyone can see them while the gathering is still fresh in their minds.<br />Replacing my 35mm SLR is a tougher problem, and one that hasn't been completely solved yet. The biggest issue I have is that the format of available digital sensors means that there are no really wide angle lenses available for reasonably priced digital SLRs. This, more than any other issue, keeps me from buying a digital SLR. I bought the S7000 as a way to get most of what my 35mm SLR does at a reasonable price, while retaining the 35mm SLR, the film in the refrigerator, and the film scanner as a backup until there is a digital SLR that comes close enough to my ultimate requirements that I'm willing to pay the extra money for it.<br />The S7000 is a remarkably capable camera for the price. The wide end of the zoom is restrictive for me, but I have an adaptor and a  Raynox 0.66x lens that help. A fast 1GB compact flash card makes it easy to take a lot of pictures at essentially zero marginal cost. It is true that the lack of control over the compression is an occasional annoyance, but the compressed pictures usually come out very well.<br />Then there is the noise issue. There is no question that if you want to blow up the images and look for noise you will find it. For many shots it's not an issue, but for clear skies and a few other situations you can clearly see it. In most cases screen images and prints of modest size won't show unacceptable noise, but there are situations where it will be evident. Note that there are tools available to make the nose less apparent in images, and if you only occasionally make big enlargements they may solve the problem (if it is one) for you.<br />To continue on this issue, if I scan a slide from ten or more years ago I will generally get grain that is more evident than the noise in an S7000 image. Newer film, thanks to the intense rivalry between Kodak and Fuji in the 90s, has noticeably less grain, but it is still there. So it is all a matter of expectations. The S7000 can create images with noise no more evident than the film grain of days not long since past. Yes, for half again as much you can buy a camera with less noise, but is that a reason to criticize the performance of the S7000?<br />The S7000 can create marvelous images at a great price. It doesn't quite match the capabilities of a cameras that cost significantly more, but why should it?<br />I'm delighted with the S7000, and have taken a lot of pictures that I really like with it. I like being able to shoot hundreds of pictures without changing film. The battery draw bugs me a little, but the problem is not that I've ever had to stop while shooting to change batteries. The strange thing is that it draws down batteries while it is turned off, so I have to plan on inserting fresh batteries each day. But that's a small problem when you expect it.<br />I keep up on what's happening in the digital camera world, and I knew when I bought it that it was possible to buy a better camera at a higher price. But, as I alluded to above, I'm waiting for the digital SLR system that gives me everything I want before I make a big investment, and this camera offered pretty much everything available at its price point or even a step or two higher. The one competing camera that intrigues me is the Sony DSC-F828, which has a wider zoom and a four color CCD mask. But it not only costs half again as much, it weighs nearly twice as much as the S7000. So I still think the S7000 is the right camera for me at this time. That doesn't mean that it is the right camera for everyone. But when you compare its strengths and weaknesses it should be clear why many people love it even though, as some critics point out, it certainly isn't perfect. But it is a very capable and fun camera!","When I was doing my research I was between this one and the Canon G5. I honestly went for this one because I found it chepear and I don't regret it at all. The picture quality is incredible and that was what I was most concern about. If you have a good printer (I have the HP psc 2210), you would be amazed with the results.<br />The LCD of the camera is above and beyond anything I have seen. The camera is easy to use. And it has more settings than the average user will ever need; hey that's a plus ;-)<br />I was able to take pictures of the Grand Cannon from the airplane and these pictures came out pretty good.<br />Anyway, I highly recommend this camera.","I asked my wife \"what is the opposite of buyer's remorse,\" to which she said \"buyer's ecstacy,\" which is what I am experiencing ever since the camera arrived a couple days ago.<br />It took me about 2 minutes to figure out how to hook up the video cable to my TV and how to record a video clip.  Moments later I was amazing the kids with short video clips with sound of themselves dancing around the room.  Later in the evening I started delving into the incredible depth of feature sets this camera has and realized that this thing is as sophisticated and \"manual\" as I want it to be while also being as simple and \"automatic\" as a novice would want it to be.  It covers the entire spectrum.<br />One issue that was very important to me in upgrading to a better camera was getting one that would fire the shutter right away and be ready to go for more a moment later.  My previous camera left a lot to be desired in the confidence that I would end up with an image that bore any resemblance to what I was looking at when the shutter button was pushed.  Add to that the interminable wait before the next shot was able to be taken, and it was a real roulette of experiences.<br />The S7000 is ready to take pictures when I am, and includes a function that will take several frames in sequence if desired.  The SLR function means I get pictures framed correctly instead of the viewfinder offset that spoiled a few clever photos I experimented with on my old camera.<br />I cannot imagine a better value out there.  The technology that is built into this camera and the results it produces are phenomenal.  The body seems rugged and the controls seem solid with good feedback.  There are several buttons positioned all around the camera to perform various functions, but they seem pretty intuitive.<br />I wish the camera came with an AC adapter.  I can't find it among the listed Amazon accessories, so I'll be tracking that down elsewhere since the provided AA batteries didn't last long (but I put it through its paces).  Rechargeables (NiMH recommended) look like the way to go.<br />I am not an expert, and can't offer much in the way of comparisons, but this seems as good a camera as a casual hobbyist like me ought to be allowed to have without being overcome with a sense of importance and photo-journalistic flair.  Fujifilm did great on this one!","Actually, 4.5 stars.<br />I only had a little time to run the S7000 through its paces, but that was enough to see that for a camera that can be had for $700, it is a price-point bargain.  It's not perfect, and I'll give a couple of examples, but overall, I'd give it very high marks.<br />On the plus side, the 6x optical zoom lens is of excellent quality and the autofocus system works very well.  The focus and exposure electronics seemed to be faster than most, thus there is less of the notorius \"digital lag\".  If you capture images in the least-compressed modes, you will get excellent results considering that the CCD is \"only\" 6 MP.  This thing, at its best, rivals my 8MP Sony.<br />On the minus side, the S700 does not have continuous autofocus, so it that's a priority, you will find it lacking.  Also, I found the exposure of close-range flash pictures to be poor and beyond the range of compensation.  Aside from those caveats, this is a very fine device at a very reasonable price.","Not just dads, but anyone not wanting to lug around a camcorder with their digital camera.<br />I researched like crazy on what camera to buy, wanting good resolution and more importantly video capture. It came down to these cameras, the Canon S50, Fuji F700. Fuji S5000 and S7000<br />S50 has best picture, small, but not good zoom, doesn't take standard batteries, and the video capture is only half-rez and limited to 3-mintue max sizes.<br />The F700 is small like the s50, taked great video (full rez, as long as you want), but it doesn't use standard batteries, only does 3MP pictures and only takes the more espensive XD cards..<br />Then I found the S500 which does 3MP, good zoom, but only takes half-rez video and requires XD card..<br />But... the S7000 seems to have everything i wanted for around the same price..<br />It takes standard AA batters (and rechargables too)<br />Taes XDcard AND Compact Flash/Microdrive storage<br />Has 6X zoom.<br />Super-macro mode,<br />Continuous burst shooting.<br />takes 6MP pictures natively (12MP possible too)<br />and takes full-rez video ad 60FPS for as much storage you have.... sold.<br />I was going to only spend $300 total, but with the $100 rebate, the s700  really became worthwhile.<br />The camera takes AWESOME outside pictures.. a bit noisy indoors, but the flash makes it work great indoors..<br />Okay, a quick comment to the people that say a digital camera isn't good for capturing video for life's moments.. like recording your child's school play etc/...<br />You might use a camcrder to capture 90-minutes of video.. but really, you gonna watch that full 90-minutes at a later time? no, youre gonna edit, fastforward or whatever just to get to the part you want to watch which will probably be like 10 minutes tops.","The Fujifilm FinePix S7000 is a fine camera offering most of the functions that can be found on the better quality SLR cameras. The only serious point of dissapointment is the fact that it does not at least have the same type of lens than the Fujifilm FinePix S5000 which offers the serious photographer the oportunity to also photograph in the wild or any other distant object should circumstances require it. The 37mm-210mm lens would have been the ideal lens size for this quality camera.","This camera is a real money savor for a family that can only afford 1 camera!  Along with the F5000 (a real bargain now) this camera allows a user to learn photography from full auto to full manual without the high expense of film and processing.<br />You don't even need a Video Camera!  The vast majority of video that I take of family and other cute stuff are very short in duration.  This camera does 30 frame per second (that means it's like TV, without any jerky movement or lost frames) and the clips are already fully digital and ready to transfer to computer or display to tape.  Put a lot of short clips together and you have the same thing you would get from a camcorder only it's all in one camera!<br />Hot Shoe - One of the major plus' of this camera is the Hot Shoe.  Any digital camera without some way of putting on an external flash is really just a snapshot camera, no matter how much it costs!  The external flash means that when you take a photo of something like the inside of an old structure like a cathedral, etc, you get a beautiful photo that you could not get without the external flash!<br />The quality of the photos in the S7000 is tremendous.  We stopped doing film photos a few years ago when a local processing company destroyed the only two rolls of a friends wedding back east.  Naturally, after that the memories of the trip were gone!  They only appologized and moved on!  With digital, we have never been disappointed.<br />Both the S5000 and the S7000 are, in my mind, two PERFECT cameras for the typical family!  And a real money saver!  I especially like the little graphic in the viewfinder that reminds you that there might be some camera shake and to hold the camera steady!  Very cool camera!","found the review in WHAT DIGITAL CAMERA To be right on the money this camera has a full line of features learning curve probably two weeks and 200 pics.","Great camera with all the extras. Also own 35mm Pentax LX. This is my first digital camera and I followed the rating by What Digital Camera. Found it to be just as reported. Learning cure probably two weeks and 200 pics.","i would say if u like to play with close-ups or want a camera that has fantastic macro and supermacro abbilities, then you found the right one.the view finder is great.you dont even want to use the screen with such a good view finder!the only thing that this camera has that gets on my nerves is that it doesnttake good fotos with mooving objects.like if u want to take photo of kid you have to use shutter speed priority, otherwise it's out of focuss.<br />also the video shooting thing is fantastic!if u want a good quality camera and u r not afraid to use shutter speed button take this one.oh!it's better to have 512MB card.and also what is great is the 'delete' button!works great!saves you lot of space on card if u want to get just rid from some photos in easy way.(it lets you also to restore the photos though)","The s7000 has the essential features I wanted : large 6 Mpixel sensor, dynamic range of light (no more white-outs!), excellent resolution and colors, value for money, 6x optical zoom, external flash hot shoe, standard AA batteries and compactFlash memory cards. The camera is very easy to operate, including with gloves. (tried it outside in winter!)<br />The image quality is great when using the best settings (12M pixels fine or RAW, ISO 200). The AUTO mode, the default sharpening, and the JPEG compressor for 1-3 MPixel images produce artefacts or boost sensor noise.<br />I just changed the rating of the camera from 4 to 5 stars after seeing what the raw format is capable of (not using Fuji's bundled software).  Note that the s7000 is not a 12-MPixel camera: it has 6 MPixels. For a fair assessment of the s7000, use at raw files converted using a  lossless format (e.g. TIFF) before magnifying the image at a 1:1 ratio on your monitor.<br />If you use the best settings, you will have excellent pictures. However, the s7000 is not comparable to cameras with larger sensors. If you really want to remove the noise, the \"advanced sharpen\" tool of Picture Window Pro 3.5 will clean it up. Resolution is great. Chromatic aberration is very low but can be noticed (by a purist) when viewing pictures at high magnification.<br />The viewfinder is comfortable and accurate. The delay for taking pictures is better than my other digital camera's (Canon S10). To aid focusing, you can hit a Focus Check button that pops-up a magnified area of the image. The macro photography modes allow for extremely close shootings (1 cm); the auto-bracketing works fine; the last-5 frames continuous capture is a great idea for action shots.<br />Video quality is awsome, and there is no limit to the duration of the videos. I don't need another video camera, since the s7000 is good enough for my needs.<br />Missing features:<br />- a tool for rotating images in the camera<br />- a mode for taking pictures to be stitched (panorama)<br />- 24 hour time format is not supported<br />- range of flash adjustment should extend beyond -0.6 EV<br />- 16 or 24 FPS video rate (only 30 FPS is supported)<br />- Zoom is not enabled during video shooting<br />- sensitivity cannot be set manually lower than ISO 200<br />- bundled RAW converter has no controls, and is not taking the best out of the RAW files. Use alternatives!<br />Minor annoyance:<br />- RAW setting should be available from the \"F button\" for Image Quality (not the SET mode).<br />- LCD display is fixed (many other cameras have an articulated extension)<br />- Audio annotations to photos require tedious manipulations<br />Nice Surprise:<br />Third party RAW converters are available on the web. For example, s7raw has more controls than RAW Converter LE that comes with the camera, and it can output 16-bit TIFF images. dcraw is also very good, and you can experiment with its source code.<br />rawgem (my own converter) is also available for download, and produces PSD 24/48 bit or BMP 24-bit files.<br />Problem<br />The histogram shown during picture taking in manual mode is different from the actual histogram of the picture taken. It can be way off -- don't rely on it for setting the camera aperture/speed.","This is a superb camera. It has SLR-like capabilities and quality that you just don't find with similarly priced Nikons and Cannons.<br />I completely disagree with the other reviews that complain about focusing problems indoors. Those reviewers obviously don't know how to use the built in flash properly. It has a variety of intensity settings that allow you to take sharp, beautiful indoor pictures. I've had the camera for a month and after about 1000 pictures, this Fuji is a clear winner. Highly recommended.","A friend of mine went shooting in the woods for some wildlife shots. He eventually printed 6 of his best shots commercially to 36\"X40\" prints. I was stunned by the clarity and picture quality of the output at this huge size.<br />My Sony F717 eventually became wimpy compared to the prints of the S7000 especially in bigger sizes. The sony is good up to 8X10 but higher than that it becomes noticeably noisy. Not good. I am so amaze that am about to sell my F717 in ebay and buying a fuji S7000 myself but everywhere I go it is on back-order. Apparently Fuji cannot keep up with the demands. I need this before the holidays. Please...","I had the chance to tinker with this camera and had it set to 12MP, Fine, and soft sharpness as suggested by one reviewer here. Started taking pictures mostly outside without the flash. I was so delighted with the shots that I had them developed at a local Kodak processing center. 5 A4 sizes and the rest in 6X4s. This is a native 6MP camera but the shots taken at 12 MP can rival a 9 or 10MP camera without paying extra. The printed photos were just amazingly clean of noise and artifacts.<br />I suggest getting a circular polarizer with it because it just brings out more vibrant color to your outdoor shots.<br />I am so thrilled with the performance that I have started buying accessories for it to really take advantage of all its features.<br />The accessories I bought are<br />1. Adapter ring (I suggest getting 55-55 not the suggested 55-52)I bought mine from cameragear.com because it is not availble from any stores in amazon.<br />2. Tiffen deluxe filter set (FL-D, Neutral Density, Warming Filter)<br />3. Tiffen circular polarizer<br />4. Vivitar 285HV Professional Flash (this one is highly recommended from pro to amateur users because of its price and features)I got mine from amazon as well.<br />All this accessories only cost me U$ 160.00 but it really brought out the best from the S7000.<br />For the price and feature set, nothing comes close to the s7000. It is the new king of prosumer digicams at the moment.","I have been using this camera extensively for the past week and I am liking it more and more. First things first, this is not for the casual point and shooter although with some fine tuning of settings it can also deliver good results in Auto. The camera shines best when in manual mode. The noise that reviewers talk about are non-existent in the prints I have made. This is mainly because these reviewers just examines the photos in their computer monitors. Naturally, it will exhibit noise because monitors are not the most faithful in showing the \"real picture\". In my case,  The photos are beautiful at a4 size printed from 6MP with sharpness tuned to \"soft\". To have full control I suggest shooting in 12MP raw, fine, and soft sharpness.  I have been so lucky so have so far all noise-free, vibrant and true to life images from this S7000. And the real kicker is that it cost way less than the competition.","This camera evokes love/hate relationship based on the numerous reviews and comments from users. So the bottom line really is the picture quality.<br />Prior to owning this I had been an Nikon and Canon SLR user but like many, I also have to adapt to the current trend in using digicams. So before purchasing, I spent a whole month researching through the web, visited shops and get a feel of the current digicams on offer. In my quest for the best digicam for my needs, I have seen their output, held the camera itself and thoroughly inspected everything about them. Besides, Im spending U$600-700 so I really need the best for my needs. In those times, I have seen them all, and finally purchased the S7000.<br />What about S7000? I must say that the picture quality of this camera is best at 6mp native resolution. Although it is capable of taking 12MP interpolated photos, I would personally skip that because at that resolution it does become noticeable noisy. However, pictures taken at 6MP and below are by far the best amonth the current offerings. I have tested the Minolta Dimage A1, Nikon coolpix 5700, Sony F707 and the Canon and by far the Fuji have the best color saturation, more natural, vibrant and crisp photos among these cameras.<br />At U$650, you just cannot go wrong with the S7000. The other cameras mentioned here are even pricier and doesnt give all the extras that the Fuji can give.<br />Right now, I am having a blast taking photos with this baby witout worrying about film development cost. It is a great way to learn the ropes about photography espcially in manual mode because as long as you have the memory, you can practice your skills endlessly.<br />When I am done with it, I would like to upgrade to the Nikon D100 because despite the excellent features of s7000 it still is not perfect, but the s7000 is way ahead of the current Nikon, Canon, Minolta offerings at this price range.","Dear all,<br />After a week of diagnostic and test-out the new Fujifilm FinePix S7000,<br />it has big improvement from the S602Z with so many cool features.<br />It worths the upgrade.<br />==============================================<br />Pros of S7000 :<br />00. 6 mega pixel effective 4G Super CCD.<br />01.

RAW conversion software is a plugin to finepix viewer, instead of a standalone application.<br />02. RAF format is proprietary for s7000 with its own header, not compatible with Fuji S2 Pro.<br />03. Lack 24bit Tiff format in firmware storage format.<br />04. F button can be confusing, needs to be accustomed to.<br />05. Low light operation is still not perfect, but improved from S602Z.<br />06. Need the new F700 \"Green Light\" assisted AF illuminator.<br />07. Would be nice to have a REAL optic image view finder.<br />08. Missing ISO 1600 for Manual mode, or 1 mega byte Auto mode<br />09. Software provided does not have nice menu, everything is in HELP directory in HTML format.<br />10. Need the S2Pro Hyper Utility EX or similar to ship with S7000 that can be standalone<br />  and adjust all the image properties BEFORE converting.<br />11. Does support FAT32, meaning 2GB CFII is the maximum size supported.<br />I already send all my concerns to Fuji support, if you have similar concern feel free to voice them<br />to fuji since fuji is not a company not listening as my experience.<br />I recommend this Proconsumer Digital Camera which has a nice-grab, sturdy body, super fast startup+performance,<br />and professional features to all Digital Camera lovers, and it will serve you well,<br />and take photo that match the professional level camera with price 1k to 2k.<br />Please start this discussion group so all owners of s7000 can discuss about this camera here,<br />always thanks DAVE for his site and providing a space for us here.<br />PS : I already get the command line set of tools to perfectly<br />convert S7000 CCD-RAW format with higher resolution...","Ease of Use:  Excellent - It is easy to use right out of the box<br />Durability:  Very Good - Well made and will last a long time<br />Portability:  Very Good - Small and usually functions well<br />Photo Quality:  Excellent - Pictures are professional grade<br />Battery Life:  Very Good - Lasts all day<br />Lighting Conditions:  Use inside & outside, with or without a flash<br />I would recommend this camera primarily for:  Anyone<br />I went from a Casio QV-3000, to a Canon G5. After testing the S7000, I sold the G5 in favor of the S7000. The options exceed those of the G5, included 12MP image capability. A buddy of mine (you know him, Mr. Pro-photographer) said that digital camera's that do RAW format is the one to go with. I had no idea what he meant until I had one printed out. Stunning.<br />As the QV-3000 and G5 had, and the S7000 has, the ability to use IBM Microdrives. I tested the seek/write times between the Microdrive and the xD-Picture card ... my recommendation is to dump the Microdrive. The xD-Picture card uses less power and seeks much quicker than the Microdrive. Well, not wanting to get rid of my investment, I was happy to find that I can use both the xD-Picture card and the Microdrive at the same time (in case I run out of room on the 256MB xD).<br />Ease of use. In my family, I'm the one who figures techy stuff out (like the blinking VCR time). This time my wife figured this one out way before I did. We had it in the house for 1 day and when I came home, she told me of all the neat stuff it did. Very easy to use.","I own the Olympus E-20. The Fujifilm S7000 is half the weight at half the cost and a lot better camera. I'm very happy with it, though i've only owned it for 17 days. Very sharp lens. It's like someone took the time to figure out what was wrong with most top line digitals, and made it right. I own another Fuji (i wish the'd drop the \"film\" part of their name, it confuses people) and i've noticed that they are designed very well and are user friendly.","Fuji Finepix S7000 is a wonderful camera by any comparison. I am in the digital photography since the beginning of it with a Kodak 640/480. I had many other cameras last of which was a Fuji Finepix 4900. This last model is a markedly improved one. I read most of the reviews about this camera. Some of them are critical in the respect of picture quality and some presented photographs to support this claim. I examined them carefully but I did not agree with the criticism. I did my own testing in any way I could and at any setting. I do not agree with previous reviewers who claimed that SOFT setting is better then NORMAL and that 6MP is better then 12MP setting. I suggest you should do your own testing. I also printed several photographs (2400/1200 printer) at full-page size and they appeared superb. I do not suggest that you should rash and buy this camera, but I do suggest that you should include it in your options, as it is indeed one of the best in its class.","This is the best digital camera I got so far. The photos came out beautifully with sharp focus, brilliant and balanced color (no any color casting as one reviewer stated). Resolution is exellent. Even at 3 MP, it beats all competitors, like Olympus, Nikon, HP, Kodak etc. It's the only digital camera came with a shutter cable release which is incrediblly important for taking pictures at night or under dim light when a tripod is used. Its Raw Mode gives almost noise-free photo, as good as you can possibly get.<br />  For the price of $$$, it's a very good deal. It's basically a SLR with many nice features. its value is a way more than the price. I tested the shooting modes of P, SP, M, S, A, all were very satisfactory. The night view photo came out very good. I like its manual focus, too.<br />  I wish it were 10X zoom.<br />  Overall, I love this camera. I give it 5 stars!","I've only had this camera for a week now, but the \"shake out cruise\" at a local botanical garden left me anxious to get out and take more pictures with it. Even in 3 MP mode the images can handle significant enlargement, and my tests to date (partial frames printed on an Epson 2000P printer) suggest that the higher resolution modes will support at least 22.5x30\" prints assuming you don't insist on pressing your nose against them to find fault with them. The super macro mode allowed very close up pictures of tiny flowers, and the \"ISO 800\" setting coupled with shutter priority mode allowed me to freeze the wings on a hummingbird. The electronic viewfinder works very well, and I like having a ring on the lens for zooming. I still haven't tried all the features, but I got a lot of decent pictures on the first time out. This is a digital camera that can do a lot of what I've done in the past with a 35mm SLR. (I shoot slides and scan them.) To be fair, it isn't perfect. I would have preferred the handgrip to be a little smaller, but I have small hands. I would have liked a 28mm equivalent short end on the zoom, but I have an adapter to give me that capability that I need to get out and try. More options on image compression would also have been nice, although it produces very good images given the level of compression it achieves. I do like the fact it runs on 4 AA batteries (but get high capacity NiMHs) and will take CF cards (preferably fast, high capacity ones). All in all, it's a lot of camera for the price."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix 3700","amazon_reviews":["Step son's Christmas gift. He's in the Navy, so shopping was difficult for us this year.

This camera  compensates for my total lack of ability to take a decent pic. For some reason 98% of the pics I have taken have come out absolutely stunning. When I took it to a family reunion and started taking pics side by side(with my family members using their ultra mega-pixel, high speed dig cams with all the bells and whistles only found on the space shuttle and other advanced technological inventions)it became readily apparent that my pics were greatly superior to the ones they were producing. It was worth the price of the camera to watch them fiddle with  knobs,switches and dials on their cams to try and replicate (let alone exceed) the quality of the pics my 3700 was producing. Not wanting to acknowledge that I had a superior product they blamed everything from atmospheric pressure to the depleted ozone layer for their inferior pics. To make a long story short within a week they had sold their overpriced, over rated dig cams and purchased 3700's  Nuff said.","This camera for my Kid Birthday present and she like it very much. This Coolpix 3700 the small and practical camera I have ever have. Have video, voice recording, optical zoom, directly printed the image to the printer and very easy to use. You just turn on the camera and let the coolpix do for you. You still can use the manual shoot but it's not perfect. Its appropriate for my kid that she just need to framed the image and shoot. The 3.2 mega pixel is enough for A4 paper size.The price is approriate for your pocket","Let me just get the negative out of the way.  This camera is not great for low light photos.  I took a picture of my cousin's parents on stage during her weddding and the result was sort of dark and gloomy.<br /><br />This camera definitely depends on its flash.  Without flash, taking a photo can be too dark or blurry.  If you use a tripod, then with enough light source you can disable the flash.<br /><br />The LCD screen is small compared to other much newer cameras available today.<br /><br />That being said, this camera is worth the money.  The picture quality is freaking sharp.  Continous snapshots works great, panoramic photo is really fun and the other 13-14 pre-set functions are easy to use.<br /><br />The motor is quiet compared to the 4MP Canon Powershot.  The video recording is fun and more impressive than I had imagined it to be.  I probably would just get a digicam if I am serious about recording.<br /><br />The metallic body is really good looking and the feel of the camera when you are taking a picture is comfortable.  The camera is small enough to easily fit inside your pants pocket.<br /><br />Battery is like other batteries.... you probably want to carry more than one if you travel a long time without a chance to charge up.  The charger does a good job charging fairly quickly... I think less than 2 hours with totally discharged.<br /><br />It does not come with a case, but I went out to buy my own durable case for it (less than $10).  It uses the fairly small SD card, which you can buy for next to nothing these days.","This camera will create images with color accuracy to not only rival but beat other digicams costing 5 times as much - *BUT* it must be used in certain modes to accomplish this.  Just go to [...] and compare pictures from almost any camera.<br /><br />To create TERRIFIC *indoor* pictures use the \"BACK LIGHT\" pre-programmed mode - for every indoor occasion.  Hold the button down halfway until the camera is ready and then press all the way. To eliminate camera shake, which ruins many pictures, use a tripod (a great folding SLIK w/case costs less than $25).<br /><br />I haven't taken any pictures outdoors yet but I have seen pictures from this camera that astonish me.  So I am sure that I will be able to identify a mode that will do the same for me when the occasion arises. *IF ONLY* Nikon made this EXACT camera with some manual modes, a hotshoe, and accessory lenses, AND anti-shake. Enjoy!","I am no camera buff. I know nothing about the workings of a camera or how to manually render wonderful picures. Thankfully, the Coolpix 3700 is totally automatic, no need for me to adjust or fool around with obscure settings to get a decent pic. Still, the camera does offer a number of different \"environments\" you can choose from, such as indoor party, portrait, night landscape, panorama, closeup, etc. But the beauty of it is you only need to choose the appropriate setting to match the environment, no need to configure the f-stop or shutter speed or all that other crazy stuff. I agree with the other reviewers, I think this camera is awesome, especially for the price after rebate.<br /><br />What I like best are this camera is 1. The rechargable battery lasts a really long time, 2. The macro shots are amazing, the close up detail is really exceptional, 3. The size is a mere 4.6 ounces, there are smaller cameras out there like the optio 4si, but the 3700 is still smaller than the canon elphs, 4. the build has a solid feel with a brushed aluminum finish, no cheap plastic, and 5. the overall picture quality is first rate, in my opinion, it's just really crisp and bright.<br /><br />That said, I would've liked a 4 megapixel camera, but I realize that this 3.2 mp is more than sufficient for my needs. I'm not going into the photo development business anytime soon, so oversized prints are not necessary for me. The manual also states that this camera is best suited for up to 7x5 prints, it can certainly go higher, but this size is optimal for quality.<br /><br />I think it's strange that this camera is not very popular, I have yet to see a camera match the 3700's picture quality in the point and shoot category. The closest rival is of course the Canon Elph, but that's too rich for my blood. Plus, I think a case can be made that the 3700 is arguably a better point and shoot camera than the elphs, not to mention the smaller size. So, if you're on a budget, I highly recommend this camera to really get your money's worth.<br /><br />One other note on memory cards: this camera comes with a 16 mb SD card. I recommend a high speed card, perhaps a 256 mb. Check out newegg for the kingmax sd card, it's 60x speed (up to 10mb/sec transfer) and it's incredibly cheap. Also, if you're into name brands, outpost has the 256 panasonic SD (also 10mb/sec transfer) for a mere 45, (...), but it won't last long. Happy shopping!","Becareful it blocks and doesnt work, it appears \"lens error\".<br /><br /> It was sent because of the warranty and it last only 15 pictures and continue with the same problem.<br /><br /> Nikon says to send it again but they wont change it for a new one. I am not agree with this, the same problem twice is not worth it any more.<br /><br /> Is not a good warranty.<br /><br /> This maybe happen to you.","I beleive this is a good camera for the light/novice photographer. Check steve's digicam and cnet for a review. just remember the camera's limitations; fully automatic ( no Man. Settings), flash range is 7-8 feet, in dark or zoom, try to have a steady hand as shutter speed decreases. it is an overall v.good camera for just ponit and shoot with good focusing system.<br /><br />P.S.Try to copy and paste the camera's name in google and check for prices on pricegrabber.com, cnetshopper.com and epinion.com. You'll be amazed, that it actually exsists in other trusted websites for $75-$125 less than in amazon.com. and this is the case with most of the electronics on amazon.com.<br /><br />It seems that amazon.com is fooling only its loyal cusomers (I have been a loyal amazon customer for 4 years now)by its nonsense promotions. The huge price difference clearly shows that amazon.com is now not looking to keep its customers who are always few clicks away from other sellers. Amazon.com is obviousely looking just to use it's customers' trust to get an exaggerated profit margine on the merchandise compared to the common market profit, as you'll see from other stores' prices.<br /><br />Don't let amazon.com silly promos fool you. Shop smart and don't allow them to use you.<br /><br />I believe, with this attitude, amazon.com will loose a huge number of its current customers, along with a big market share in the near future. The consumer has become now more and more aware about the e-market tools and rules.","This camera takes great photos and gives you lots of options, from simple point and shoot to preprogrammed settings (landscapes, fireworks, dusk, closeups) to total manipulation of features and images using camera features and software. We wanted a small, light camera, and this one is compact while easy to get your fingers on the \"mouse\" and dial. We were especially surprised by the quality of movies and audio (movies with sound and sound alone features) for an inexpensive camera that is not meant to be a true video/audio recorder. What a bonus!","Pros:<br />-compact size, stylish<br />-metal body, nice build quality<br />-selectable AF sensor and metering in M-record mode, each AF bracket acts as spot meter, useful for tricky lighting<br />-framing guides on LCD<br />-generally competent metering, Auto white balance, focusing.  again, for difficult lighting, the AF sensor acts as spot meter in M-record mode<br />-straightforward transfer with Nikon View, although a separate card reader is recommended instead of connecting camera directly to computer, this is to save those USB contacts in the camera from wearing out prematurely.<br />Cons:<br />-movie mode exhibits that notorious audio-sync problem<br />-hot or dead pixels on my unit, resulting to those annoying white spots on the image when viewed at full size<br />-Scene Modes disable features here and there, and that set up may not be what you really want<br />-no option to set ISO, camera adjusts ISO on its own, which may result in noisy images<br />-more on noise, you really need lots of illumination, either daylight or flash, to keep the camera from bumping the ISO up, and with it, the noise<br />-still having difficulty dealing with the green cast of fluorescent lighting (as do most cameras)<br />-button operated zooming, with those tiny Wide-Tele buttons, especially when in Macro mode, is not the easiest thing to do<br />Overall, a decent picture taker that requires well-lit scenes to perform well.  That means it is a \"flashy\" camera.  For someone used to the Olympus Stylus, this is not an issue, however, this camera is not for those who prefer shooting without flash, especially indoors.  There's the auto-ISO issue mentioned above, which leads to noise, also, the lightweight and small size of the camera, not to mention all those buttons which get in the way of the left hand, prevents any decent steady handhold.  This maybe the reason for those soft lens comments from other reviewers, among other variables (e.g. how is the Sharpness set?).<br />Many of the cons are limitations imposed by the small size of the camera.  Regardless of make, for compact cameras, these limitations are something one must live by.  If you want more control (to prevent the ISO from bumping up by itself), and you want to stay Nikon, the larger Coolpixes (4500, 5xxx) maybe the better choices.  The Canon A70/75/80 also offer greater controls, but at the expense of compactness.  However, I cannot believe that Nikon or any other manufacturer for that matter, cannot make a compact that allows manual ISO setting.<br />The decent build and finish of this camera are regrettably offset by noise issues, and in my sample, dead pixels, which prevents me from giving this camera a higher rating.","Fully function, good price and the mail-in rebates process is faster. Highly recommend.","The CP-3700 is my 5th camera I owned in 5 years due to my traveling need. The last one I use was Nikon CP-3100 and which have been lost by my friend, I then bought this Nikon CP-3700.<br />This camera is very handsome and small. Its whole metal body is stylish and well built. It can easily fit into any pocket, so you can carry it all the time and never lose a scenery. This camera is fast and its vedio mode is super that takes 640*480 vedio with sound, and the length is only limited by the memory card you installed.  And this camera has assistance beam to help focus at low light condition. However, when talking about image quality, I am not impressed.<br />The color of the pictures are always very good, and seems they were always well exposured, however, most of the images are not very sharp, even compared to the cheaper and older CP-3100. besides, serious distortion occurs at the wide angle, which makes those pictures looks very bad especially when there were big buildings near the edge.<br />So, if you want a small nice-looking camera and you are going to take family pictures or party pictures or for flowers or yor dog, this one is good. However, if you are going to take picture with part of building in it, say you are going to shot in New York or Paris, then avoid this one, or you will find curved skyscrapers and cathedrals in your picture.<br />I already gave this camera to my girl friend. I may buy the Sony DSC-W1 for my next digital camera, it is slitly bigger but it comes with Carl-Zeiss lens, some manual controls and can attach with some converters.","I love this camera.  I researched cameras quite a bit before purchasing, and with the $100 rebate, this camera is an awesome deal that simply can't be beat.  This is my second digital camera, after having traded up from a 2.1 megapixel model.  I find that the quality of a 3 megapixel camera like this is ideal--big enough for high quality photos, yet not insanely detailed to the point that the photos eat up incredible amounts of hard drive memory.  The camera also takes pictures quickly without much lag time in between photos.  Also, one of my favorite aspects of this camera is that with a 512k memory card, the camera doubles as a little camcorder for capturing high quality, quick videos (with sound) of precious moments.  The only thing I don't like about the camera is that the rechargeable battery has to be removed in order to be recharged.  There's no way to recharge it simply by plugging in the camera.","excellent photo quality, features and ergonomics.  much lighter, better ergonomics, better display than the canon S400 series (its main competitor).  this is a wonderful camera w/ great portability (about the size of a cell phone or pager) which i carry on my belt or pocket and really impressive photo quality.  i had to return the first one i ordered which appeared to be a lemon (probably a problem w/ auto white balancing), but its replacement takes just first rate pictures.","I purchased the Nikon CoolPix 3700 after much research and chose it over the Canon S400.  I've been extremely satisfied with the quality of the pictures and videos.  This camera was rated #1 Best Buy by PC World and for good reason.<br />Pros:<br />-rediculously light and very sturdy<br />-has a long, narrow shape that is more natural in your hand and your pocket as compared with the more square Canon S400 and other Nikon Coolpix cameras<br />-almost NO SHUTTER LAG, a big plus when photographing people who don't like to hold still for too long.<br />-EXCELLENT PICTURE QUALITY, 3MP is PLENTY for most uses.<br />-takes such great videos (with sound) that it might just replace your video camera.<br />-easy to set up and fairly straightforward menus<br />-uses SD memory which is generally better than CF.<br />-pretty good battery life, recharges fast, most users probably won't need an extra battery.<br />-if you need it, Nikon's tech support line is very helpful (toll-free and 24/7!)<br />Cons:<br />-Performance in low-light isn't great, but that is the case with most other cameras of this type.<br />-No case included and only comes with 16MB SD card.  A leather case and 256MB SD card will set you back about a hundred bucks.  (256MB is the ideal size, I recommend Panasonic SD cards because they record at 10MB/s)<br />-on/off switch and zoom buttons are awkwardly placed/shaped, should be switched, takes some getting used to.<br />-included USB cord is a bit fragile, I had to get a replacement from tech support<br />-3x optical zoom isn't much.  If you want a lot of zoom go 10x.<br />Overall a great camera with the best performance in this price range.  Highly recommended, it's really a hidden gem.  Perfect as a first digicam or for someone who wants to upgrade.","I've owned and used all sorts of digital cameras. My three last digital cameras were Sony and they all had some things in common: 1)the picture quality was not up to par, 2)the MemoryStick(tm) has very slow write/read speeds. When I decided to browse for a new camera, the usual brands came to mind...Olympus, Minolta, Kodak. However, the product offerings were not tantalizing to me. I then looked-up for Nikon and to my surprise they had the product I was looking for at a price I could afford.<br />Let me tell you, the camera is very small and light. The picture quality is DEFINITELY superior to that of Sony's and Kodak's I've used. The full-quality, full-TV-screen video option is very good and comparable to full-fledged DV cameras. The options are vast. The user interface is very intuitive and easy to get around of. The versatility of using SecureDigital media is definitely a plus, since it can be used in PDAs, cell phones, et cetera. The voice-recording option can be very handy. The flash recharge time is minimal (it used to take my Sony good 10 seconds to do the same). The auto-shutter is pretty good. And the Auto-Focus is very precise. It's worth its price and then some. I highly recommend this device. A must for digital photography enthusiasts.<br />***Ok, I wrote this review before trying night-time shots. To my dismay, in low-lights the camera it's incredibly useless. It won't let you shoot w/o flash-- period. I'm incredibly frustrated. It does not let you choose manually the shutter spped and the pre-set scene options are ludicrous. It's a shame, because it took such a good pictures with good light...but tonight was nothing short of catastrophic.","I needed an ultracompact digital camera capable of taking decent pics (including photos of text), recording voice (like meetings, classes etc.) and making a short movies. My previous digital camera was a no-nonsense Ricoh DC-2 (bought back in 1996), so I had to learn about today's technology befor meking my purchase decision. My choices were, in chronological order: Casio EX-Z4U (but since American version doesn't feature video I hed to resign of it), Minolta Dimage G400 (but reported problems with focusing in darkness made me still open for another options), and was all the time attracted to Canon, but neither could record long audio. All of the sudden Coolpix 3700 emerged, the very latest from Nokon (I searched just after New Year).<br />It's really as advertized:<br />- ultracompact, so rather thab considering to take it or not you keep it all the day long in your pocket, ready to take a pic<br />- with many preset photo modes and some manual setting<br />- offering 5 video modes, up to 640x480 (TV resolution) in color and 30 frames per second<br />- delivering high fidelity of color and sharpness<br />- very fast in response - can make a pic in a second after turning on<br />- with excellent, crisp LCD<br />- audio/video out so you can watch your movies or photos directly on TV (NTSC and PAL)<br />- and of course with fast USB to dump your files onto hard drive of your PC<br />The attached software bundle is good and easy to use.<br />Finally, it uses SecureDigital memory cards (up to 512 MB) which are very fast.<br />Thats all I needed and much more. In one sentence: EXCELLENT PRODUCT WORTH WELL MONEY IT COSTS. Strongly recommended!","I've tried my share of digi cams, from sony to canon to fuji and found that the Nikon 3700 is by far the best in its class.  Sweet Compact Size and really light in weight. Excellent quality of pics during the day and at night, found it to be superb in most cases. Scene modes can come in handy. Tons of great features. Movie quality is probably the best in a digital camera. At 640 X 480, it was excellent.  This camera is very satisfactory and worth the $350.","This camera is excellent. I cannot believe the quality of the images. I bought it because I especially wanted to use it for close up shots - and they turned out much better than I expected. The camera is a great size, easy to learn and control, has almost no noticable shutter lag, and takes great shots. The battery life is not the best, but I like that the battery is removable and extra batteries are cheap. All-in-all I'm very glad that I bought this.","Had previously bought a Canon SD10 to replace a Coolpix 4300 since I needed a faster and smaller camera.  Was confident of good picture quality after reading reviews on Amazon and CNET.<br />Much to my horror, no matter what settings I changed, the picture quality was blurry when compared with my old Nikon.  So I returned the Canon and, with much trepidation, bought the 3700 even though it offered a megapixel LESS than the Canon, and for more money too.<br />In this case, it is obvious that you get what you pay for.  Sharpness of photographs are amazing despite being a megapixel less.  Definitely superior to the Canon and comparable to my old Nikon 4300.  Upon reading the manual, discovered that Nikon has specifically built a algorithm to ensure sharpness in its digital processor.  Makes a world of difference.  Responsiveness is great too with imperceptible shutter lag.  Would recommend to all looking for a compact camera.  Just make sure that 3 megapixels are enough for your purposes.  I eventually returned this camera to wait for Nikon to release a compact, fast, 4 megapixel camera.  The extra megapixel is important if you crop your photos or otherwise want to be able to print larger than 4x6 genuine photo-quality prints."]},{"name":"Pentax Optio 550","amazon_reviews":["This was my first digital camera.  Pentax is awesome, lots of bang for your buck!  5x optical zoom was the best at the time.  5 megapixels was super awesome at the time.  Nowadays 5 megapixels and 5x optical zoom can easily be topped for a lot less money, but back when this camera came out (at least 5 years ago I think) it was so great.  I took it everywhere, played with it all the time.  Like, constantly.  I finally got a DSLR but even then it was nice to have a little point and shoot for the times I didn't want to lug my DSLR around (also a Pentax, love love love Pentax).<br /><br />Well after years of abuse, my Pentax Optio 550 finally stopped focusing properly.  Battery life and picture quality were still just fine.  I was sad to replace this one.  But today I wouldn't recommend buying this exact model camera because it is old and outdated.  You want a newer model with more megapixels and even more optical zoom.  But when it came out it was pretty freakin' sweet.  These days I would still recommend a Pentax Optio, just get a newer model.  That's what I'm doing!<br /><br />I used to work in a nice camera store, taught photo classes there, printed photos there, became the store manager after a while.  I sold Pentax all the time.  I sold so many Pentax cameras, I won a cruise!  That's how many I sold.  And in all the years I worked there and sold lots and lots of Pentax cameras, only one customer ever brought hers back unhappy, and that's because she dropped it ALL THE TIME.  She was mad that it broke everytime she dropped it on the tile, with the lens out, from a standing position.  I'm sorry but they just aren't meant to be dropped lens-first on tile.  After the first time we fixed it for her (free of charge by the way) she let her little kids run around with it and they broke it too.  That lady didn't need a digital camera, in my opinion she needed one of those Fisher-Price rugged cameras made for toddlers.  Everyone else who bought a Pentax from me came in to print their pictures all the time, and every time they came in they just talked forever about how much they loved it and they would ask me to show them more neat features on it.  (The Pentax Optios usually have lots of cool features and modes).  If you like all the fun modes and features, and the compact size, and the compact price, you will <3 Pentax like I do.  =)<br /><br />Also good to know: Pentax accessories usually don't change with every model like some brands do.  For example, the little remote control I got for my Optio 550 also works on my DSLR and every other Pentax camera (film and digital) that uses a wireless remote.  So now that I have to buy a new Pentax Optio, I don't have to buy a new remote, I can keep using my old one.  =)","I love the Optio 550.  It takes great pictures, with lots of options for the more technical person.  I haven't figured out how to use the 3D function yet (but I'm not sure I ever would) and the flap to the PC/AV card is a little flimsy (but it hasn't broken yet).  The zoom is awesome.  I love to be able to blow up a picture and have it maintain its resolution.  The pictures are clear.  I am still trying it out, but so far it works great.","I am excited and very happy with the quality of these pictures and the size of the camera!  5x zoom is great!  5 MP is great!  My only 2 issues are once it was shutting down (low battery) and battery went dead and camera lens cover jammed and left lens exposed.  Had to force it closed with newly charged battery.  But my biggest complaint is that I thought I was getting a $70 piece of software along with this camera in ACDSee, but found out it's a version a few years old!  It's version 3.x!!!  5.x is out!  What a bummer, so I emailed Pentax and got no reply...","I think capitalism is a fine thing. Everyone deserves their fair profit.<br />I read the PC World \"Editor's Choice\" review and bought the camera for less than $500...and still got $50 back on the rebate. That's a net of $450. I also did a lot of other homework. Many side-by-side comparisons. I read the Consumer Reports Digital Camera issue which didn't rate this camera because it was too new.<br />Today you will be hard pressed to find the camera for less than $599. Although it is still worth every penny.<br />I am surprised at the speed with which online retailers responded to the demand. Maybe the camera is in short supply. It should be!<br />Pentax has developed a great product. Even if the price has gone up 25% in two weeks, you will still get a wonderful camera (others have outlined its features so I do not have to) and after your $50 rebate (Hurry)you will have many chances to share the love ;-)<br />Get a 256MB SD card right away. The little 16MB that comes with it is good for about 16 high quality (or 50 lower quality) stills. I took about 300 photos in two days. There was still battery power left and the color was as good as my 35mm SLR.<br />Just outstanding!","the optio 550 is a solid camera with one big advantage over the competition: 5x zoom in a compact package.<br />pros:<br />- 5MP resolution with good image quality.<br />- beats competition with a 5x optical zoom in a compact package (dimensions are 3.9 x 2.3 x 1.6 in, weighing 8.7 oz.).<br />- accurate color reproduction.<br />- low image noise at low ISO setting.<br />- allows a great deal of manual control.<br />- live histogram in shooting and play modes.<br />- very good macro capability.<br />- spot metering.<br />- long movie clips - up to 10 minutes each!<br />- convenient shooting priority play mode - a half-press of the shutter brings you back to shooting mode.<br />- decent night exposures with automatic noise reduction.<br />- no color cast when using flash.<br />- camera feels solidly built.<br />- bright, high resolution LCD monitor with anti-reflective coating.<br />- passive AF sensor helps with focusing.<br />- impressive battery life.<br />- price (compared to competition).<br />cons:<br />- noise noticeable at ISO 100 and above.<br />- some purple fringing/chromatic aberration visible.<br />- some lens distortion from half-zoom to telephoto.<br />- autofocus speed could be better.<br />- shot to shot times not as fast as competition.<br />- no slow-sync flash setting.<br />- RAW format not supported.<br />- metal body scratches easily.<br />- high redeye occurrence.<br />- vignetting visible from half-zoom and wider.<br />- slow startup: >5 seconds.<br />- fastest continuous shooting speed is only 1 fps.<br />- slowest shutter speed available is 3 seconds.<br />- cannot physically access the battery or memory card while mounted on a tripod.<br />- plastic tripod mount.<br />- 16MB SD card is inadequate - be prepared to shell out more $$ for more memory.<br />- the batteries supplied are proprietary so add a few bucks to your budget for a spare.<br />the optio 550 has a very impressive feature set, better than competition 5x zoom, and 5MP of resolution.  there's not one glaring omission but there are enough minor ones that it got a 4 star rating.<br />i hope this helps you in your buying decision.  peace.","I purchased the Optio 550 to replace my original Kodak DC215.  I was looking for a camera with decent Optical zoom, good photo resolution, and not something so big I would dread carrying it around.<br />So far I have been VERY pleased with this camera.  It weighs significantly less than the Kodak, and is a good deal smaller too.  It's a little big to put in your pocket, but I was able to get a reasonably small camera case which will work very well.<br />The pictures I have taken so far have all been very good quality, and you can't beat the 5MP resolution :)  Connecting it to my computer was a snap, and the menus and options while a little bit criptic, provide easy access to lots of features.<br />I only have 2 complaints with this camera.  1) You will DEFINITELY need a larger memory card.  The bundled 16MB card will only hold 4 pictures at the highest quality setting (below TIFF).  However, this is true with every single digital camera I was looking at so I can't hold it against Pentax.  2) The movie mode does not support Optical zoom, only digital zoom.  I have no idea why they did this, but for some reason you cannot use the optical zoom while shooting movies.  Granted, this is a still picture camera, and I will probably seldom use the video mode, but it seems to be a very strange oversight.<br />I would DEFINITELY recommend this camera to anyone who wants a relatively easy to use camera, that takes very good pictures.","In addtions to the comments of the previous reviews, I would like to mention four other settings for the Option 550:<br />1. The \"Dawn/Dusk\" setting allowed me to take pictures in very low light, sometimes of very dark objects.  [Note:  In such instances, I should have used a tripod or other stabilizing method.]<br />2. The \"Snow/Sea\" setting allowed me to take pictures of some backlighted objects.<br />3. The \"Distance\" setting allowed me to shoot through glass with little back reflection.<br />4. The \"Recording\" setting, allowed me to record over 8 hours of voice/music on a 256 card.  [Note: I'll need help in making the recording more audible, however.]<br />In brief, I am very pleased with almost all of the 800+ pictures that I took on a recent trip to Italy.<br />4/2004 Addition:  I have had the camera about a year now and have a major criticism about the ACDSee software: Whenever I transfer photos to the computer with ACDSee installed (or uninstalled) the file type is changed to ACDSeeJPG.  The first time I took out red-eye and transferred the photo back to the SD card, the whole SD card froze up; I have not been able to reformat that card in the Pentax Optio 550, in Windows, or in DOS.  The second time I (mistakenly) transferred a photo back to the correct folder on the SD card, all of the photos were distroyed, but this time I was able to reformat the SD card on the Pentax Optio 550.<br />Since then, I have tried to uninstall ACDSee, but when I copy photos to the computer they still arrive there as ACDSeeJPG.<br />I have communicated with ACDSee tech service a couple of times but have not resolved the problem.","The major pros of the Optio 550 are its overall image quality, 5x lens, battery life, feature set, and portability.  The major downsides I've experienced are ISO noise, a slightly slow zoom and autofocus, and a delay in shutter release.  A few other problems are ignorable or easily fixable in photoshop (vignetting) or can be largely fixed in camera settings (indoor photos).<br />Size and Build: I wanted a camera that is unobtrusive and the Optio 550 is certainly small enough.  It is not a one-hand camera because of the weight, but it fits my hands (which I believe are slightly below average male size) very well.  In addition, the build feels solid.<br />Image Quality: On the whole, very excellent.  ISO noise is a problem (400 is unusable, 200 is marginal and will probably depend on your tolerance for grain, 100 and 64 are just fine) and so this camera isn't best for lots of shots in dark spaces, especially if the flash won't be able to illuminate the subject.  In some of my images there has also been minor vignetting (slightly darkened corners) and according to dpreview.com, which has a good review, this occurs in wide-angle to half-zoom shots.  Most of the time it is barely noticeable, and it is never a showstopper because a forum member at dpreview.com created a Photoshop file that can be used to easily correct the problem, which I have so far used a few times with good results... Cropping out the affected portion is, of course, another option.  Otherwise, the image quality has been excellent, provided one sets and keeps the sharpness (and possibly also contrast, this seems to be more a matter of taste) down a notch from the default value.  Outdoor images are, in my experience, sharp and detailed using the camera on full auto.  Indoor images without good illumination are a bit harder for this camera, but forcing the camera to use ISO 64 or 100, in conjunction with the lower sharpness/contrast settings, will almost always give a very good photo.  I am colorblind, so I will not offer an opinion on color accuracy.  The comments of others on this aspect seem to be uniformly positive, however.  The camera has three levels of JPEG compression, as well as a TIFF mode.  The visible difference between ** and *** images is very difficult to see, but ** is about half the size.  Users who aren't scrutinizing or heavily editing images will probably find that a very suitable compromise.  The purist in me wants to use TIFF but my budget demands otherwise, so I usually stick with ***.<br />Battery life: Quite long.  I was, for instance, able to go a week of casual picture taking (perhaps 15 pictures a day, no flash) with around two-three hours (all told) of nothing but reviewing pictures before it finally ran out.  An AC adapter is not included, unfortunately, although a charger is.<br />The lens: The 5x optical zoom was a major selling point for me, and I have already appreciated its ability to get me up close several times.  At this point in time, if you value small size and zoom capabilities, no other camera is its equal.  It takes about 2 seconds to completely zoom in from a wide shot, which sometimes seems too slow.  The Optio 550 has a 4x digital zoom also, but this type of zooming is best done after the fact with Photoshop or something else anyway, so I turned it off.<br />Feature set:  Has full auto, full manual, an aperture priority and a shutter priority mode all of which operate as expected.  Movie quality is adequate, but not great.  The sound quality of annotations and movies is quite decent, however.  Several filters (for color, softness, etc) are available which I haven't used.  Modes for certain picture types (sunsets, snow, portraits, etc.).  Of these, I've only used sunset and fireworks so far.  The manual neglects to mention that fireworks mode sets a long shutter time, requiring the camera to remain motionless.  3D and panorama modes.  The continuous shooting mode is about a frame per second at full resolution.  The flash can be on, off, on with red-eye reduction, autoflash, or autoflash with red-eye reduction.  The camera will display a histogram on the lcd live or after the fact.  There is a 3x3 grid overlay available on the lcd to help framing.  There is a mode for taking movies more slowly, allowing playback to appear faster, in addition to time-delay and time-interval settings.  Two macro modes.  More that I don't have space to detail.<br />LCD: Sharp enough, bright enough.  No adjustable brightness settings, however.  In bright sunlight it is, as others have noted, difficult to see.  You can also elect to turn it off.<br />Miscellaneous:  The autfocus is a bit slow, there is a slight but noticeable lag between pressing the shutter release and the actual picture, and these in combination with the fairly slow zoom will probably make some action shots very difficult to capture.  Includes ACDSee software, and USB/NTSC cables.  The SD card that comes with the camera is an anemic 16MB, so buying a 128MB or 256MB card is a necessity.  I use the user mode on the camera to hold all my indoor shot settings, which means that I am always only a turn of a single knob away from alleviating indoor image concerns.<br />Conclusion: Given all the positives, I think the negatives are outweighed.  I think the Optio 550 offers the best overall quantity of features and quality of images for a \"take anywhere\" camera of any that I researched before purchasing.  The price is excellent as well, considering what it offers.  I am very satisfied.","As someone who strted taking photographs 40 years ago with a Box Brownie, worked his way up through various SLRs, and basically lives & dies in public presentations on the basis of slides, I confess that I was VERY sceptical about going digital. The Pentax Optio has changed all that. I have been using this camera for about a month now, and my poor Canon F1 has stayed in its case.  I am simply STUNNED with the quality of the image, the ease & accuracy of the \"point and shoot\" features, and the impressive array of options that Pentax offers me.  Battery life seems excellent, the camera has survived a tough month in the field in high humidity/salt air being jostled and banged (and dropped at least once) in transfers from boats to dories to shore, and the 5x optical zoom lets me get reasonably close to my birds (it still isn't a \"real\" telephoto, don't be confused, but it beats the heck out of other digital cameras that I have played with).  Downsides are that the enclosed 16mb card is a joke, I didn't even bother with it, get at least a 64mb & start shooting. The lens DOES take a while to extend, and there is a slight-but-noticeable delay between pressing shutter release & the actual image. This is annoying in an \"action\" setting. In addition, the viewscreen, while brighter than I expected, is invisible in bright sunlight.  The biggest problem with this (the optical viewfnder is just fine for actually taking photos) is that messages like \"memory card full\" may not be conveyed to you unless you look really closely -I lost half a dozen pictures from not paying attention. Overall I am VERY impressed with this camera, it is light, portable, versatile, gives me very high quality pictures, and seems tough enough to stand up to a demanding life on off-shore seabird colonies. Go for it.","This was my first digital camera.  Pentax is awesome, lots of bang for your buck!  5x optical zoom was the best at the time.  5 megapixels was super awesome at the time.  Nowadays 5 megapixels and 5x optical zoom can easily be topped for a lot less money, but back when this camera came out (at least 5 years ago I think) it was so great.  I took it everywhere, played with it all the time.  Like, constantly.  I finally got a DSLR but even then it was nice to have a little point and shoot for the times I didn't want to lug my DSLR around (also a Pentax, love love love Pentax).<br /><br />Well after years of abuse, my Pentax Optio 550 finally stopped focusing properly.  Battery life and picture quality were still just fine.  I was sad to replace this one.  But today I wouldn't recommend buying this exact model camera because it is old and outdated.  You want a newer model with more megapixels and even more optical zoom.  But when it came out it was pretty freakin' sweet.  These days I would still recommend a Pentax Optio, just get a newer model.  That's what I'm doing!<br /><br />I used to work in a nice camera store, taught photo classes there, printed photos there, became the store manager after a while.  I sold Pentax all the time.  I sold so many Pentax cameras, I won a cruise!  That's how many I sold.  And in all the years I worked there and sold lots and lots of Pentax cameras, only one customer ever brought hers back unhappy, and that's because she dropped it ALL THE TIME.  She was mad that it broke everytime she dropped it on the tile, with the lens out, from a standing position.  I'm sorry but they just aren't meant to be dropped lens-first on tile.  After the first time we fixed it for her (free of charge by the way) she let her little kids run around with it and they broke it too.  That lady didn't need a digital camera, in my opinion she needed one of those Fisher-Price rugged cameras made for toddlers.  Everyone else who bought a Pentax from me came in to print their pictures all the time, and every time they came in they just talked forever about how much they loved it and they would ask me to show them more neat features on it.  (The Pentax Optios usually have lots of cool features and modes).  If you like all the fun modes and features, and the compact size, and the compact price, you will <3 Pentax like I do.  =)<br /><br />Also good to know: Pentax accessories usually don't change with every model like some brands do.  For example, the little remote control I got for my Optio 550 also works on my DSLR and every other Pentax camera (film and digital) that uses a wireless remote.  So now that I have to buy a new Pentax Optio, I don't have to buy a new remote, I can keep using my old one.  =)","I love the Optio 550.  It takes great pictures, with lots of options for the more technical person.  I haven't figured out how to use the 3D function yet (but I'm not sure I ever would) and the flap to the PC/AV card is a little flimsy (but it hasn't broken yet).  The zoom is awesome.  I love to be able to blow up a picture and have it maintain its resolution.  The pictures are clear.  I am still trying it out, but so far it works great.","I am excited and very happy with the quality of these pictures and the size of the camera!  5x zoom is great!  5 MP is great!  My only 2 issues are once it was shutting down (low battery) and battery went dead and camera lens cover jammed and left lens exposed.  Had to force it closed with newly charged battery.  But my biggest complaint is that I thought I was getting a $70 piece of software along with this camera in ACDSee, but found out it's a version a few years old!  It's version 3.x!!!  5.x is out!  What a bummer, so I emailed Pentax and got no reply...","I think capitalism is a fine thing. Everyone deserves their fair profit.<br />I read the PC World \"Editor's Choice\" review and bought the camera for less than $500...and still got $50 back on the rebate. That's a net of $450. I also did a lot of other homework. Many side-by-side comparisons. I read the Consumer Reports Digital Camera issue which didn't rate this camera because it was too new.<br />Today you will be hard pressed to find the camera for less than $599. Although it is still worth every penny.<br />I am surprised at the speed with which online retailers responded to the demand. Maybe the camera is in short supply. It should be!<br />Pentax has developed a great product. Even if the price has gone up 25% in two weeks, you will still get a wonderful camera (others have outlined its features so I do not have to) and after your $50 rebate (Hurry)you will have many chances to share the love ;-)<br />Get a 256MB SD card right away. The little 16MB that comes with it is good for about 16 high quality (or 50 lower quality) stills. I took about 300 photos in two days. There was still battery power left and the color was as good as my 35mm SLR.<br />Just outstanding!","the optio 550 is a solid camera with one big advantage over the competition: 5x zoom in a compact package.<br />pros:<br />- 5MP resolution with good image quality.<br />- beats competition with a 5x optical zoom in a compact package (dimensions are 3.9 x 2.3 x 1.6 in, weighing 8.7 oz.).<br />- accurate color reproduction.<br />- low image noise at low ISO setting.<br />- allows a great deal of manual control.<br />- live histogram in shooting and play modes.<br />- very good macro capability.<br />- spot metering.<br />- long movie clips - up to 10 minutes each!<br />- convenient shooting priority play mode - a half-press of the shutter brings you back to shooting mode.<br />- decent night exposures with automatic noise reduction.<br />- no color cast when using flash.<br />- camera feels solidly built.<br />- bright, high resolution LCD monitor with anti-reflective coating.<br />- passive AF sensor helps with focusing.<br />- impressive battery life.<br />- price (compared to competition).<br />cons:<br />- noise noticeable at ISO 100 and above.<br />- some purple fringing/chromatic aberration visible.<br />- some lens distortion from half-zoom to telephoto.<br />- autofocus speed could be better.<br />- shot to shot times not as fast as competition.<br />- no slow-sync flash setting.<br />- RAW format not supported.<br />- metal body scratches easily.<br />- high redeye occurrence.<br />- vignetting visible from half-zoom and wider.<br />- slow startup: >5 seconds.<br />- fastest continuous shooting speed is only 1 fps.<br />- slowest shutter speed available is 3 seconds.<br />- cannot physically access the battery or memory card while mounted on a tripod.<br />- plastic tripod mount.<br />- 16MB SD card is inadequate - be prepared to shell out more $$ for more memory.<br />- the batteries supplied are proprietary so add a few bucks to your budget for a spare.<br />the optio 550 has a very impressive feature set, better than competition 5x zoom, and 5MP of resolution.  there's not one glaring omission but there are enough minor ones that it got a 4 star rating.<br />i hope this helps you in your buying decision.  peace.","I purchased the Optio 550 to replace my original Kodak DC215.  I was looking for a camera with decent Optical zoom, good photo resolution, and not something so big I would dread carrying it around.<br />So far I have been VERY pleased with this camera.  It weighs significantly less than the Kodak, and is a good deal smaller too.  It's a little big to put in your pocket, but I was able to get a reasonably small camera case which will work very well.<br />The pictures I have taken so far have all been very good quality, and you can't beat the 5MP resolution :)  Connecting it to my computer was a snap, and the menus and options while a little bit criptic, provide easy access to lots of features.<br />I only have 2 complaints with this camera.  1) You will DEFINITELY need a larger memory card.  The bundled 16MB card will only hold 4 pictures at the highest quality setting (below TIFF).  However, this is true with every single digital camera I was looking at so I can't hold it against Pentax.  2) The movie mode does not support Optical zoom, only digital zoom.  I have no idea why they did this, but for some reason you cannot use the optical zoom while shooting movies.  Granted, this is a still picture camera, and I will probably seldom use the video mode, but it seems to be a very strange oversight.<br />I would DEFINITELY recommend this camera to anyone who wants a relatively easy to use camera, that takes very good pictures.","In addtions to the comments of the previous reviews, I would like to mention four other settings for the Option 550:<br />1. The \"Dawn/Dusk\" setting allowed me to take pictures in very low light, sometimes of very dark objects.  [Note:  In such instances, I should have used a tripod or other stabilizing method.]<br />2. The \"Snow/Sea\" setting allowed me to take pictures of some backlighted objects.<br />3. The \"Distance\" setting allowed me to shoot through glass with little back reflection.<br />4. The \"Recording\" setting, allowed me to record over 8 hours of voice/music on a 256 card.  [Note: I'll need help in making the recording more audible, however.]<br />In brief, I am very pleased with almost all of the 800+ pictures that I took on a recent trip to Italy.<br />4/2004 Addition:  I have had the camera about a year now and have a major criticism about the ACDSee software: Whenever I transfer photos to the computer with ACDSee installed (or uninstalled) the file type is changed to ACDSeeJPG.  The first time I took out red-eye and transferred the photo back to the SD card, the whole SD card froze up; I have not been able to reformat that card in the Pentax Optio 550, in Windows, or in DOS.  The second time I (mistakenly) transferred a photo back to the correct folder on the SD card, all of the photos were distroyed, but this time I was able to reformat the SD card on the Pentax Optio 550.<br />Since then, I have tried to uninstall ACDSee, but when I copy photos to the computer they still arrive there as ACDSeeJPG.<br />I have communicated with ACDSee tech service a couple of times but have not resolved the problem.","The major pros of the Optio 550 are its overall image quality, 5x lens, battery life, feature set, and portability.  The major downsides I've experienced are ISO noise, a slightly slow zoom and autofocus, and a delay in shutter release.  A few other problems are ignorable or easily fixable in photoshop (vignetting) or can be largely fixed in camera settings (indoor photos).<br />Size and Build: I wanted a camera that is unobtrusive and the Optio 550 is certainly small enough.  It is not a one-hand camera because of the weight, but it fits my hands (which I believe are slightly below average male size) very well.  In addition, the build feels solid.<br />Image Quality: On the whole, very excellent.  ISO noise is a problem (400 is unusable, 200 is marginal and will probably depend on your tolerance for grain, 100 and 64 are just fine) and so this camera isn't best for lots of shots in dark spaces, especially if the flash won't be able to illuminate the subject.  In some of my images there has also been minor vignetting (slightly darkened corners) and according to dpreview.com, which has a good review, this occurs in wide-angle to half-zoom shots.  Most of the time it is barely noticeable, and it is never a showstopper because a forum member at dpreview.com created a Photoshop file that can be used to easily correct the problem, which I have so far used a few times with good results... Cropping out the affected portion is, of course, another option.  Otherwise, the image quality has been excellent, provided one sets and keeps the sharpness (and possibly also contrast, this seems to be more a matter of taste) down a notch from the default value.  Outdoor images are, in my experience, sharp and detailed using the camera on full auto.  Indoor images without good illumination are a bit harder for this camera, but forcing the camera to use ISO 64 or 100, in conjunction with the lower sharpness/contrast settings, will almost always give a very good photo.  I am colorblind, so I will not offer an opinion on color accuracy.  The comments of others on this aspect seem to be uniformly positive, however.  The camera has three levels of JPEG compression, as well as a TIFF mode.  The visible difference between ** and *** images is very difficult to see, but ** is about half the size.  Users who aren't scrutinizing or heavily editing images will probably find that a very suitable compromise.  The purist in me wants to use TIFF but my budget demands otherwise, so I usually stick with ***.<br />Battery life: Quite long.  I was, for instance, able to go a week of casual picture taking (perhaps 15 pictures a day, no flash) with around two-three hours (all told) of nothing but reviewing pictures before it finally ran out.

Battery life seems excellent, the camera has survived a tough month in the field in high humidity/salt air being jostled and banged (and dropped at least once) in transfers from boats to dories to shore, and the 5x optical zoom lets me get reasonably close to my birds (it still isn't a \"real\" telephoto, don't be confused, but it beats the heck out of other digital cameras that I have played with).

Personally, I especially like the Marco and Super Marco function for flower and other close up shoots. The quality is superb. It does have some difficulty in lower light, but you just need to make several adjustments to overcome them. Of course, you can not compare this compact with Professional ones. They are blonging to different categories. I take this one in my pocket or computer bag every day, and shoot everything happening around. Much easier than bring a bulky professional ones. (P.S. Battery life is really great, seems never ending.)","This camera is GREAT!<br /> It fits in my bag and goes with me everywhere, it's easy to operate, the zoom gives you access to all the shots you want and the quality is superb - as good as film!<br />  The user defined features allow you to set the speed and depth of field, as well of filtering the image, which is an awsome feature.<br /> The main points of satisfaction are its size, the zoom and the quality of the pictures.<br />Thumbs up!","Pros: Very compact for its specs; comprehensive feature set; high-quality images; long battery life.<br />Cons: Autofocus speed average at best; continuous-shooting mode only 1fps; no slow-sync flash setting; no RAW mode.<br />I recently brought the Pentax Optio 550 and this camera has a wide range of possibilities. THe colors are vibrant, the 5x optical is awesome, the 5.03 mexapixels are nice, and the wide range of options is awesome. The microphone records at 64 kpbs and can record somewhat decent clips. I have only taken 100 or so pictures, but most of them have turned out very nice. Only two possible down sides, though they are easily compensated for. First of all the noise levels at 400, and even 200 can be hideous. Just go to user mode and set the ISO to 64 or 100. Then set the Exposure Compensation to +1 or +1.3. Secondly, the movie mode is not of high quality, as it only records 320 * 240, however, given that this is a digital Camera, and not a video camera that is acceptable I have two 256 MB lexar card and those are definitely useful.","I bought my first digital camera (a Kodak DC 280, 1 MP) three years ago. It's worked fine, but I've wanted something that could fit in my shirt pocket and had good optical zoom capability. As of last winter, these were mutually exclusive requirements. When the Pentax Optio 550 was announced in February, it seemed to be what I was looking for. I bought one last month, and it's been just about everything I could ask for. The pictures are excellent, the size and features are terrific, and the battery life is great. As some of the published reviews have pointed out, the lens is a bit slow to emerge, so it's not the best camera for an impulse shot of some fleeting phenomenon like a car crash or hummingbird. Learning all the features may take an hour or two. Unlike the Kodak and some other competitors, the Pentax didn't come bundled with any software. And some standard accessories (like an A/C power adaptor or extra battery) are somewhat difficult to find. But overall, this is a terrific little machine that so far has no real competitors.","This camera has all the features that are important to me:<br />(1) 5x optical zoom [3x is not enough]<br />(2) compact size for carrying and travel<br />(3) 5 mpixel for resolution and prints up to 11 x 14 [or smaller enlargements of portions of the image]<br />(4) terrific battery life<br />(5) decent optical viewfinder with diopter adjustment for my glasses<br />(6) 0.1 sec. shutter release lag.<br />Right now I don't see this combination of features available in any other camera.<br />In the first two weeks of owning this camera I have taken some outstanding images including some macro close-ups. I have had some 8 x 10 prints made whose resolution rivals any 35mm prints that I've seen. The camera controls are well thought out and intuitive to use.<br />I have purchased a Pentax small leather case with a belt loop [camera and case also fits easily into a pants or jacket pocket], a Pentax remote control, an extra battery, and a 256 mb SD card that holds about 142 images at the 5mp/** JPG compression resolution. The camera is a little hard to hold as it is heavy and relatively small, but I use two hands.<br />So far I am very pleased with this camera.<br />Pentax may have come a little late to the digital camera game, but I think this camera has a combination of features that will appeal to a wide range of users like myself.<br />Problem:<br />This camera has very high image noise at ISO's settings above 64.  Other cameras using the same sensor have much less noise.  The problem likely comes from too high sharpening used by the camera which Pentax could probably easily fix by issuing a firmware update, which so far they have not done.  If you are looking to use this camera in low light conditions, it is probably not the camera for you, as you would have to do extensive noise reduction on images above 8 x 10.<br />This noise is not a problem if the ISO setting is set at 64 and the sharpness and contrast settings on the camera are set to low. Shooting always at ISO 64 does reduce the usefulness of this otherwise fine camera.","i think this is a great camera with a lot of powerful features!  what attracted me to this camera was that it is a 5 megapixel camera with a 5x optical zoom!  when i received the camera i was pleased with it's small size (though some men said too small for their hands)  the camera is well constructed and compact.  To save a 5 megapixel picture takes a while and the camera only comes with a 16mb sd card (they might as well sent me a candy bar - i would have enjoyed that) - a 16mb card does nothing with a 5 mp camera!  i was also frustrated by the lack of accessories - i realize this camera just came out in february but i couldn't even find a place online to buy an extra battery.  The folks at pentax assured me that it is because the cameras are selling so well and the accessories are being snatched up - i'm not sure that's exactly how it's working.  I hope more people notice this camera and more accessories become available and i can say i had it back when nobody had heard of it - but in the meantime, i'm afraid i'm returning it.","The 550 is a small but powerful camera.  Picture quality is excellent!  I would recommed this little Giant to anyone who is serious in owning a digital camera.  Camera is easy to operate, controls are very user friendly.  I hope my Epson Photo printer is up to the task of printing the same quality I get with this Awesome Little Giant.  Buy it, you'll be plesantly surprised!!","As a person that loves photography, I longed for the day that digital would rival 35mm. That day is here! I received the Pentax Optio 550 and took it for a field test. I took images of nature and did several macro exposures of different plants and flowers. To my amazement, the photos were razor sharp, with an incredible sense of depth. The color saturation was superb. The camera is compact, the body is sleek and made of aluminum alloy, perfect for travel. Above all, it is easy to use. Pentax you have a winner and you deserve your five stars!","As a photographer since 1971, I have seen many stunning changes in the art, business and technology of photographic imaging.  Now these achievements are celebrated in this perfect tool, the Pentax Optio 550 5MP.  The design and features are exceptional.

In comes the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ10 at 4 Mega-Pixels (4MP) released<br />in late 2003 and after all these years later all I have to say is WOW, I mean I'm blown away. I picked up one of these<br />gems on Ebay for $49 so my expectations were not were not exactly out of this world but my reaction was Wheeeyew!<br />I have a Nikon D80 and picture to picture comparison is not exactly a clear win for the Nikon.

It's been around the world, been dropped, been used on the beach, in the rain, on a bike (taken falls off the bike with me).  It still works perfectly.  Although the LCD is raised, it does not have one scratch.  And the picutres! It still takes better pictures than most new cameras.  Gorgeous, better than slide film and SLR, as far as I'm concerned.  Makes me look like a professional.  Worth every penny.","I love this camera!  This is my 3rd digital upgrade since beginning with digital cameras. I am not a pro in photography, and have no real desire to get into the nitty gritty of apatures and all the tech stuff... but I care deeply about getting some great pictures. SO.. I deal as much as I have to with the technical. I especially love candid people shots, and do a lot of indoor photography in places where constant flash is undesirable, such as weddings and other church services.<br /><br />I discovered that what aids this the most is a big lens, stabilization and good zoom... which led me to this camera, and I was NOT disappointed.<br /><br />The larger lens has allowed me to get the most amazing indoor  with no flash pictures.

I just returned from AZ where I took a river boat ride, and a flock of mountain sheep was spotted high on the canyon walls. I could barely see them with my naked eye.. could only really spot them from movement, but I zooming in fully, and kept clicking. Wow! I got the most amazing pictures. I've also gotten some great pictures taken from those tiny airplane windows as the plane is taking off and landing. Some great overviews of the San Francisco bay... and was able to zoom into some boats on the water even. The color is great!<br /><br />You ever try taking people pictures of people who don't like having their pictures taken... like family and friends? With this camera I turned off all sound, use no flash, and am able to zoom in easily from across the room, and I get the best family and friends candid pictures!  Also the best thing I did besides buying this camera was to get an extra battery, and buy a 1MB media card. I seldom run out of room or battery power (beyond this)even when I'm on an extended vacation. Even after 2 weeks in AZ, I just took my SD media card to WalMart and had it put onto a photo CD.. and cleared it for more pictures.  I only needed to do this once... and took over a thousand pics (total) on vacation!  All in all I'm now drooling over the newer and improved models of the same camera!!<br /><br />Pros: Large lens, great zoom, super color, very stable, comfortable grip, good settings and able to take great pictures while you are still learning them. A great point and shoot camera for non technical people who still want great pictures.<br /><br />Cons: I usually use the auto focus and there is a delay of a few seconds while the camera focuses before I can snap the picture. This is a pain sometimes, and I miss some great spur of the moment pics because of it.  The lens cap is a pain, too, as it is not attached. I haven't yet, but am afraid I will lose it. I wish the camera was smaller, but wouldn't trade off the larger lens for lesser quality.","I bought this camera back in May of 2004, and I have not had any problems since. One thing I have learned is that mega pixels are not everything. I bought my father a 4MP minolta S414 and the pictures are not as sharp as my camera. I think that has something to do with the lense. The long zoom is very nice. Up until today I never printed out a picture bigger than 8X10 Today I paid for a picture to be blown up to 16X20 and it looks pretty darn good. Certain things like the hand grip and resolution could be improved (and they have been with the newer models) I was thinking of replacing this camera with something like the FZ20, FZ30 or  the new 8MP samsung with the 3.5\" screen. However after seeing how nice my 16X20 blow up turned out to be, I think I will keep it for a while.","This camera brings the true beauty of pictures if you edit them with software and apply various types of filters. Visit my gallery at [...] and you'll know what I mean.","When Panasonic released this camera in the fall of 2003, I couldn't wait for it to be available for sale. A couple of months passed and it was completely sold out even before it was available anywhere in the market. At that point, I couldn't wait and I contacted a Panasonic dealer and reserved one right away. I was on the waiting list for 2 more months and I finally got it in Jan 2004. A 12x stabilized optical zoom at that time was unheard of on a consumer camera. It was awesome! I could take pictures at full 12X without a tripod and the stabilizer made sure the pictures were perfect. For $599 it was the best digital camera out there. It has almost been a year since I bought this camera and I am still in love with it; but I wish I had waited. When Panasonic came out with the same camera but with a 5.0 mega pixels at the same price earlier this year, I was kicking myself for being so impulsive. Nevertheless, it is a great piece of engineering. The camera feels like a tank- very solid but not all that heavy at the same time. I have captured some of the most amazing pictures with this camera, which I will treasure for the rest of my life.<br /><br />If you don't really care about all the features and just want a small digital camera to carry around and snap pictures with, I wouldn't recommend this camera for you. This is more like a camera you would want to take to your trip to the Grand Canyon and capture the breath taking shots or the perfect sunset that you always wanted to capture and have it blown up. There are so many features in this camera, it will take a good couple of weeks for you to read the manual and get used to them.<br /><br />I am not going to list all the features this camera has; you can read about them on the product description page or you can go to the Panasonic homepage and get a more detailed description of all the cool features you can find in this camera. However, I do want to make a couple of points:<br /><br />This camera uses a Leica lens. For those of you who are not familiar with this brand, Leica Camera AG is a world-renowned German camera and lens maker. Just the name Leica, in the photography world, is synonymous with durability, quality, and optical precision. Leica makes lenses that cost thousands of dollars for high-end professional cameras so for Leica to feature its lens in this Panasonic camera tells it all.<br /><br />One thing a lot of people don't look at when they are buying a digital camera is if you can add additional lenses and filters like you can with a 35mm SLR. Although a 12X optical zoom (equivalent to a 36mm to 432mm in a 35mm camera) will be more than enough for most of us, some of us might want to add conversion or teleconversion lenses or filters and YES you can with this camera. Let me give you an example of what a 12X zoom can do: How many times have u been to a NFL or a baseball game and have taken pictures only to find out that you can't even make out what number jersey a player is wearing when u get the pictures? Well, with this camera, I have been talking pictures at games and let me tell you, they are just amazing! Besides all the close-up shots of all my favorite players, I could even capture those priceless facial expressions when someone makes a hit or at that moment when a receiver catches the ball for a touchdown.... it's truly amazing!<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with this camera!","If you aren't going to read the rest of this (fairly short) review: Buy This Camera, unless you want an SLR.<br /><br />I didn't do much research on SLRs before I bought this, but I DID do a lot on 4-5MPX digital cameras. This one came out on top, no matter how you look at it. The AMAZING zoom was a big seller for me, as was the look and feel of the camera itself. Like everyone says, it feels like a 35mm - just a bit lighter. I love where the controls are (better than any Nikon), and there is no comparison for the picture quality. Plus, it's easy to use, all the features are clearly labeled, yet there are still a lot of advanced options for the experienced photographer.<br /><br />If you want an example of pic quality, check out:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />That's full resolution, so you might want to view it slightly smaller to get the real idea.<br /><br />My only \"but\" would be: if you are thinking about buying this instead of a Digital SLR, Don't. I've had the camera for a few months now, and while I plan on keeping it (because I LOVE it), I recently upgraded to a DSLR for better clarity and more advanced lens options. However, my FZ10 will be sticking around!","\"What kind of camera is that?\" is the first thing everyone says to me when they see this camera. This is the only camera I have had that people immediately write down the model number to go get one for themselves. You can see from other reviews, the owners of this machine are smart people who have done their research. I have now sold several photos taken with this camera.<br />It's lighter than it looks, it handles like my 35mm, it is easy to use right away and as I get better with it the images are getting better and better. We all send pics via email. The response is usually \"cool pic\" or similar. Now it is \"wow! what a great shot!\"<br />The battery life is the best I have ever had. I can fill a 256mb card and the battery meter still shows full charge.<br />The bad? It won't fit in my pocket.","I finally decided to take the plunge into digital cameras after by two faithful Pentax's finally gave up the ghost.  I did a lot of research looking for a camera with the right combination of quality, features and price.<br />Having used other peoples point-and-shoot camera's I was disappointed with AF ability, and wanted to ensure I had a manual focus override - the FZ-10 has it.  I also do a lot of sports photography, so I needed a camera with shutter-priority - the FZ10 had it (in addition to aperture priority and fully manual options).  I also needed a camera with a reasonable f range, and the 2.8-8 available with this camera met my needs and seems better than most others.  Finally the 12x optical zoom with image stabilization means I no longer need to carry a bulky 400mm lens and tripod.<br />I have only had the camera a week and already love it.  The color rendition is superb, the exposure bracketing works really well, the macro produces superbly sharp pictures, the image stabilisation really works and I have enlarged pictures up to 10x8 with no noticeably digitization.  In fact, I believe the quality of images I am getting are better than with my old film camera.  The spot-focus mode is tremendously useful for portrait work.<br />Of course I do have a few gripes.<br />(a) The manual focus assist is not as good as the split-ring system on my old camera and I have now turned this off,<br />(b) I would prefer to be able to go down to f/16 (and I will be buying a neutral density filter to overcome this problem),<br />(c) it doesn't store images in raw format (only jpeg),<br />(d) the supplied 16MB card is too small to be of any real use (but hell it's only there to get you going),<br />(e) I would prefer to be able to use non-propietary batteries (but given the relatively modest cost of the camera I can live with this and buy a second battery)<br />(f) The lens cap is not attached and I suspect I will lose it.<br />Others complain about the fact that you can't access the SD card and battery if the camera is mounted on a tripod.  This is true, but I also found the need for a tripod much reduced.  I have not had a chance yet to try it out in low-light conditions, but I understand this can cause problems.","This is an amazing camera. I have been researching what camera to buy for the last few months! and I haven't found a camera that comes close to this one.<br />First of all the camera is big, so if you want a small zoom camera this isn't it. I'd recommend the Panasonic DMC fz1 or the Olympus C-750 models.<br />This camera comes the closest to perfect for me and what i've wanted in a camera.<br />Pros:<br />(1) leica lens (fyi leica makes $2000 cameras, so for this camera to have a leica lens, it's got to be good).<br />(2) the camera has auto and manual focus, and auto and manual modes so u can either point and shoot or learn to take pix with the more advanced features.<br />(3) movie mode is very descent and it has good sound.<br />(4) has a 16:9 ratio for 1 photo size (quality) setting, so u can take a pic and it'll be in widescreen...cool huh?<br />(5) all the modes on the dial, portrait, night portrait, panning (makes a moving object in sharp while the background is blurry), sports, macro.<br />(6) battery life is good. lasts pretty much all day.<br />(7) has this cool flip animation, you can make movies with ur clay figurines, if you'd like!! take a pic of a figurine and move it slightly every time and when done itll convert it into a quicktime movie.<br />(8) of course, the super ultra yummy zoom! how could i forget that? that's what got me interested in the camera in the first place.<br />(9) aperture range of the lens is f2.8 throughout the focul range from wide to telephoto.<br />(10) menus are easy to navigate and quick.<br />(11) can use conversion lenses for wide and tele.<br />(12) burst mode, can take 4-5 pics quick.<br />(13) histogram on play and record mode - good for composition measuring.<br />(14) turns on in about 2-3 secs after getting lens ready.<br />(15) great photo quality!!! which is the most important thing!!<br />(16) creativity for pictures!!!<br />Now for cons:<br />(1) of course, price.......but ah well...shouldn't be a con, nice things cost money!<br />(2) i found that you cannot thread filters to the lens (lens not threaded) so can't protect lens with a (for example a UV filter to leave on permanently.) But can thread filters (72mm) to the lens hood (the camera package includes) which attaches to the lens barrel, (lens hood) roughtly 2-3 inches wide.<br />(3) and the movie mode.....cant use the zoom!!!! wonder why!?!<br />(4) extra batteries are expensive, and hard to find at ur local store.<br />despite these 4 cons i have found in the last 3 months of researching for the perfect zoom camera, this has gotten to the closest i've found.<br />Also, get a SD card at least 256megs or larger and start shooting away!!!!","It's funny, you see all these camera companies talking about mega-pixels. 13, 14, 15 million and so on.<br />The fact is the human eye can't tell the difference between a 4MP picture or a 14MP picture so what's the<br />big deal with massive mega-pixels? Beats me but there is one MAJOR drawback to all those big fancy mega-pixel<br />cameras and it's called FILE SIZE! Ever tried to upload a picture online and get the message \"File too large\".<br />Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. In comes the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ10 at 4 Mega-Pixels (4MP) released<br />in late 2003 and after all these years later all I have to say is WOW, I mean I'm blown away. I picked up one of these<br />gems on Ebay for $49 so my expectations were not were not exactly out of this world but my reaction was Wheeeyew!<br />I have a Nikon D80 and picture to picture comparison is not exactly a clear win for the Nikon. Considering the Nikon is nearly 4 times the<br />retail cost of the Lumix I'd have to say the DMC-FZ10 stands in a class all it's own. Oh and if you want to upload<br />a picture and send it to a friend or family member? No problem....with my Nikon? Wouldn't upload, file too large.<br />The DMC-FZ10 takes absolutely stunning pictures and by far one of the best purchases I have ever made. If you happen to<br />catch one at a decent price, snag it! If you have one, don't sell it, you'll regret it.","This is my fourth year using this camera.  It's been around the world, been dropped, been used on the beach, in the rain, on a bike (taken falls off the bike with me).  It still works perfectly.  Although the LCD is raised, it does not have one scratch.  And the picutres! It still takes better pictures than most new cameras.  Gorgeous, better than slide film and SLR, as far as I'm concerned.  Makes me look like a professional.  Worth every penny.","I love this camera!  This is my 3rd digital upgrade since beginning with digital cameras.

I have developed pictures from both cameras and there is no comparison.<br />This camera truly outperformed all of my expectations.  There are many options to push your experience into the \"professional mode\" which I have not even tried yet.  I have not had this for a week and yet have many excellent pictures which I have shown off to friends and family.  One problem I have had with all cameras is trying to get good pictures of my ragdoll cats without red or irredescent eyes.  I captured their big blue eyes and did not even use the red eye reduction feature.  The flash angle is perfect to impart a professional quality to your photos.  It is true that the lens cap is not attached, but if anyone passes this camera for that reason they are truly missing out on a great opportunity.  I feel that my pictures compare with Canon T70 which I used for years.  If you research this camera at the digicam review sites, they all agree that it is an excellent buy.  One very important feature on this camera is the optical image stabilizer.  I took some existing light pics which should have been taken with a tripod and yet they were perfect because this camera stabilizes camera shake so well.  I expect to keep this camera for many years.  Don't let the 4.0 megapixel make you pass this up.  By adding the Leica lenses, the image quality is superb and may surpass many higher megapixel cameras.  I am looking forward to trying many of the added features soon.  I know I will not be disappointed.","Lumix DMC-FZ10S<br />4Mpel, 12x optical zoom, non-pocket camera, $550ish<br />Wow! Finally an affordable camera with MORE features, functions and image quality than my old 35mm SLR camera. At about $550 this has to be the best semi-pro camera around. The specs are impressive, but the ease of use brings the full potential to your fingertips. While it can take great pictures as a point-and-click camera - easily beating the Canon G3-G5 - the real power comes when you begin going manual.<br />Conventional wisdom holds that you should buy a digital camera from an established film camera company. Well, this camera combines the excellence of a lens/camera company - Leica - with a great Electronics Company - Panasonic - the best of both worlds!<br />For a sound byte: The Lumix takes GREAT pictures! The lens is an incredible 12x optical zoom (equivalent to 35-420mm 35mm) that works well at both ends of the range (yes it does have a bit of chromatic aberration at full zoom, but only at a 200% blow-up on the screen). The macro works down to a few inches! The lens is rather fast for the zoom - f2.8 and the equivalent ASA is 50 to 400. So a good lens, a good sensor, then comes the really great part: the electronics.<br />It has a very low shutter lag, fabulous MANUAL focus (beating all the SLR's that I have seen!), Image stabilization that makes the handheld 12x optical work (don't try handheld at 1/30sec full zoom, but hey what do you expect for a 420mm lens??), a delay timer for both tripod/handheld AND run-and-get-in-the picture, fast multishot, exposure bracketing, a red eye reduction that works, full 30fps movie mode, great review functions on camera and everything in the viewfinder - for those of us needing reading glasses, this is a dream! I could go into detail on all the features, but that is just an owner's manual read. It works and easy to control, at least for a right hander (I'm guessing it would be a pain for a leftie.)<br />I wish they had more controls on the compression - less compression would be nice since in low light the compression artifacts do show up. The 4MPEL image sensor really seems to be a good capture device.<br />Bottom Line: For a serious amateur, this is a great camera. For a pro, this might take the place of many SLR's. An real amateur can go all automatic and get great pictures and have room to move to better pictures with manual later. It doesn't fit in your pocket, but it takes great pictures!<br />Jerry<br />This is the fifth digital camera I have owned. I replaced my Canon IS90 with the Lumix and am pleased I did. I still look longingly at the Nikon D100 6MP and the Canon EOS-10D, but I can't justify the difference in price to compare to the Lumix.","This is a top of the line point'n shoot camera. Without any doubt the 12x optical zoom with image stabilizing and fast 2.8f aperture along the whole zoom range of 35-420 mm (35mm equiv.) are the icing on the cake. Nevertheless I'm slightly dissapointed about this camera because the specs read like my dream camera and the engineers from Panasonic just couldn't keep it together. Why? - I will cover this later.<br />I was so anxious about getting my set together that I bought a bag first going by the size of the FZ1 - big mistake. The FZ10 is about double the size. Definitly no camera to slip in your pocket.<br />Battery are pretty expensive, about 50$ a piece. A good replacement, not from Panasonic but way cheaper and even higher in the mAh rating is AC-CGAS002 (the barn were you get `em from is great). Charge and running time equal almost 1hr.<br /><br />The Tripod adapter blocks access to the battery and memory compartment.<br />In dcresource the macro is described to work only in the automatic macro mode. So you couldn`t go by your own settings (manual). Good news - not true-. What is also not described in the manual, the camera does the same macro in manual mode. Literally up to the lense, almost touching it, with super sharp images.<br />Personally, I do prefer the manual mode for several reasons and this is where my dissapointment starts. In a dim light situation, still enough to take a decent picture, the LCD is pitch black. It is not broken, that's just the way it is. The techs from Panasonic told me something about achery techniques and how to shoot over the body. I call it a \"Misconception\". Also the brightness of the flash is not displayed, saying the LCD should get brighter when flash is activated. Still you get nice pictures - with dim light focusing slightly advanced to some other digital pointers- just you don't see the composition and focusing. I consider this the major drawback of this camera. Surprisingly enough though, if you switch to Automatic mode the LCD display in the very same dim light situation with exactly the same setting, is fine. Aperture- or Shutter priority are also good in this respect.  I say it again, this applies  only to dim light situations in manual mode. In standard light situations you won't notice.<br />Talking about low light situations, the flash is quite impressiv. Gives you also the option to compensate (-2/+2). This is very helpful if you don't wanna compensate the flash by shutter/aperture.<br />Lense cap has no string to hold it to the body - risk of losing it.<br />I am an avid Photoshop user. So I like the auto braket function to take 3 consecutive shots with different esposures for different layers in the software. Still after every shot you have to kick the bracket in again. There is no button to enable this function permanently like cameras for only a fraction of the price do. I wouldn't mind that if it were not so long winded to get to that function. Between changing the shutter/aperture in Manual mode, engaging the bracket to -1/+1 and back again, it is necessary to push 9 buttons. (Wanna count? exposure/dial up/3x dial right/3xdial up/exposure.) And this after every shot, huhhh.<br />Most people won't mind, but it takes only jpeg format. No non-compression formats available. This camera lets me take considerably more pictures (about 165) with 256mb than my Dimage s414 (about 125), which also happens to be a  4 MP camera - each camera in the best jpeg settings. With best settings this camera takes file sizes wich average about 1,5MB (Dimage S414 about 2MB). OK not every manufacture uses compression to the same extend, and in this setting Panasonic has surely found a nice compromise between quality and compression. Still I would be happier if Panasonic had tweaked its compession less aggressively, in order to achieve higher quality (but lager file size).  Expecially since non-compression is missing and this camera is supposingly more oriented towards the prosumer section.<br />Nevertheless the picture quality is superb across the whole zoom range (the lense seems to make up for it).<br />I read reviews were people complained about noise. I figure they chose the wrong ISO (Auto ISO?). Try to use 100, 50 if possible. Everything from ISO 200 on gets indeed noisy, so is it with other cameras. And the fast lense 2.8f over the whole zoom range together with the Image Stabilizer give you quite some options here.<br />The image stabilizer works great. I think this feature should become as much of an standard as it is for camcorders. This from Panasonic should  be a wake up call for the other manufactures to install it in there ultrazooms.<br />Very positive is the overall speed of the camera. SD memory might help it. Run-up, Burst mode and time between shots is very fast. High Burst gets you 4-5 shots in 2sec.  After that you are ready again after about 4 sec. I consider this to be very fast. The only issue in the Burst mode is that it freezes the picture in the LCD screen. Burst makes sense for moving objects. And that is were you find it almost impossible to keep your object in focus when you just see a series of taken pictures with a delay of about 0.5 seconds.<br /> The purple fringing, which often comes along with extreme zoom lenses seems to be moderate. I haven't seen any so far with taken lots of pictures in situations where this is supposed to be most present, like against the sun with darker objects in front. Still it is mentioned in some of the reviews.<br />Verdict: Even thought I wrote critically this shouldn`t distract from the fact that this is a state of the art point'n shoot camera with a great Leica lense and a stabilazation system you won't find in any other model of this category.<br />So giving away some of my high expectations this is still an excellent camera which will epeal to the advanced photographer with a need for an extreme zoom."]},{"name":"Pentax Optio 555","amazon_reviews":["I have my Pentax Optio since the summer of 2003. As I was looking for a new one, (bought an Olympus Stylus 850 SW in 2008 - and had to realize, that pictures taken with the Pentax are much better quality wise) now in 2011 it looks like very hard to find the quality I used to get from Pentax. When I see a camera i am interested for, I oftenly come back to amazon to check customer reviews on the certain item... and there are always a good portion of 1 star ones, unlike this Pentax having none 1 or 2 stars. (Pentax in 2003 - were Made in Japan, does that makes the difference?)<br />Looks like it is 8 years since I use this camera, the battery still works like a new one, one charge is O.K. for a day trip with 150-200 shots taken.","I have taken a look at several digital cameras, from friends, work, etc.  (I have to add that I'm basing this review on the Optio 550 which is very similar to the 555).<br /><br />There are some great features of this camera, and a few drawbacks.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />-The 5X zoom is fantastic.  It's hard to find a 5X zoom 5MP camera that is portable and where the lens fully retracts.  I don't need the 5X often, but when I do it's great to have.<br /><br />-Good night photos.  I'm not saying they are better than the other cameras, but the night photos are reliable.<br /><br />-East light adjustment settings.  Digital cameras do their best to figure out the light settings, but sometimes if the sun is behind your subject it will make your subject too dark; similarly too bright for overly sun-lit objects.  The Optio 555 lets you quickly adjust the light settings without changing to any menus.<br /><br />-SD card.  I prefer SD cards, because they are smaller and cheaper than everything except CF cards, which I find too large.  The complaint about the proprietary USB cable on another review is easily circumvented by a faster and easier card reader.<br /><br />-Long battery life.  I can easily take about 130 pictures on one battery charge.<br /><br />-Focus.  Fast and reliable, except in the darkest environments.<br /><br />-Durable!  I dropped the camera in a river (well actually I fell in the river with the camera - it was in fact in the Ardeche River which is very lovely at least) and the camera was back working more or less within a week.<br /><br />-Light enough.  Some other cameras have the air of durability (though they really arent) because they have heavy steel bodies.  This doesnt help the camera, and in fact can hurt it by transferring shock into the more sensitive interior.<br /><br />Bad points<br /><br />-Long turn-on/turn-off time.  It takes forever for the camera to turn on - by that I mean 3-5 long seconds.<br /><br />-Recharger is annoying.  I hate carrying around the recharger; i'd rather have either AA batteries or a direct plug-in.<br /><br />I don't know the model well, but my next purchase will be the Pentax 5X zoom/5 MP that is smaller, but I am sure has similar strengths (and weaknesses).","This is billed as an upgrade to the earlier Optio 550, and when my much used & much appreciated 550 went over a cliff with a grad student (the student survived, the camera, alas, did not)I went straight out and ordered a 555. Good news/bad news.  Good news is that I find the 555 has all of the things that I loved about the 550 -excellent resolution, remarkably good automatic exposure even in very weird lighting situations, the VERY nice 5x optical zoom that has allowed me to get some really good \"up close & personals\" with my study birds, and downright AMAZING batery life (I took my 555 off for a week in Wales, filled up a 256 Meg card with pix -many using flash- & STILL had plenty of battery when I got home.)It also seems very rugged & forgiving (although I am keeping it away from cliff-diving grad students!.  SO, what's the bad news?  To be honest I don't see much of a difference bewteen the 550 & the 555. The lens is still slow coming out, there is still a noticeable lag between pressing the shutter release & the picture actually taking, so this definitely ISN'T the camera that you want if split-second timing is critical.  Other than that however I would say that if you want a really light-weight high resolution field camera with a good lens, look no further (DO get a big memory card however, you will be eating up a lot of bytes very quickly).","This is my fourth digital camera in as many years.  Overall, this is far better than the Olympus Camedia line and the Sony DSC-W1.  I haven't had the opportunity to work with Cannon's, and I think that would be the closest contender for wht you can get in this camera.<br /><br />The pluses of this Pentax are the crisp, extremely accurate colors, which are, if anything, on the bright side.  But mostly they are spot on.  Secondly, the flash is fast and powerful and most importantly, the focus is extremely fast and accurate even in the flash mode.  By contrast, the Sony DSC-W1 is much slower in terms of 'locking-in' the focus in low light settings, as is the Olympus Camedia C-50. As a result, you have to be much, and i mean much steadier to get a good flash shot with the other cameras in low light settings (less so with the Olympus).  I am not - i like to whip out the camera when my kids are doing fun things and shoot three or four quick shots indoors, and my Optio shots are consistently great, while the Sony's are such a blur that many get<br /><br />deleted.<br /><br />Another plus is the battery.  While I had selected the Sony b/c i thought i would prefer the simplicity of being able to recharge AA's anytime, or buy replacements, i found the Pentax battery extremely long lasting - something like their promo literature says, along the lines of 500-600 shots.  since it is lighter than 2 AA's, the camera overall is lighter than most running on 2-AA's.<br /><br />I will say, however, that it is a bit of a hassle having to carry to Pentax battery charger, when if you use the Cannon or Sony you just need to take the standard AA Ni-Mh charger, which i take along anyway for flashlights etc.  So now i often have 2 chargers, and thats a pain.<br /><br />Another big plus is the very quick record time for the typical full 5 mp high resolution photo.  My very unscientific method of using my watch stopwatch indicates its about .3 seconds, which was definitely faster than the Olympus or Sony.  However it compares to other cameras, its the fastest I've ever experienced, and i've never felt slowed down even in some river rafting action moments.<br /><br />The next thing I really like is purely subjective - the size of the lens is at least double the diameter of any compact 5 mp camera.<br /><br />Now that is completely subjective, but my engineering background tells me that if you double the amount of glass that light passes through, you have reason to believe you will be improving the optical clarity of your images.  somehow, for all the pictures i've blown up to 5 x 7, it seems like the Pentax photos are crisper with better color - could this be why?<br /><br />Another plus - excellent closeup features.  With 2 macro settings, I have always been very pleased with every kind of closeup.<br /><br />The drawbacks are all important to me - but when it comes time to pack a camera, unless i need the wide angle lens of the Sony DSC-W1, this Optio is hands dwon my favorite.<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br /><br />- Movie mode is an embarassment to digital photography!  try playing 320x240 on your computer and you will get eye strain! The movie looks like a moving short-cut! Check out the Sony or Kodak (and possibly some Cannon's) - they offer a resolution of 640x480 which is essential if you want to enjoy any movie clips on your computer.<br /><br />- the proprietary download cable is another insult designed simply to make you buy another Pentax product.  Again, take a lesson from Sony, which uses the standard mini-USB to USB cable for downloads rather than the Pentax-proprietary to USB cable.  If you lose that cable on the road, you have no way of downloading your photos and you are jammed until you can mail order another from Pentax.  If they would only have the courtesy to let you use the standard cable as Sony does, you could go to any electronics store, or use a friends.  Plus, if you carry a portable hard drive or some such thing that uses the mini-USB to USB, you will already have the download cable, while with Pentax you must carry 2 cables.<br /><br />-limited wide angle viweing.  the Sony has noticably better wide angle viweing, something like 28 mm, vs something like 35-50 mm in this camera, Sony also has a screw on wide angle adapter which this camera does not.<br /><br />- its time for Pentax to update the viewfinder.  I'm sure they are working on it, but at least another .5 inches would help this camera ALOT.<br /><br />- increase the size of the font of all the info in the viewfinder.  All the newer cameras with the larger viwfinders using larger font  as squinting to read critical information is just not fun.<br /><br />Thats my take - this camera is far better than some of the competitors, and I hope Pentax is listening and will make some improvements, as i love this extremely functional camera now, but can't wait for the next model!","This is the best camera I have own so far. Lots of cool stuffs. You don't have to be a professional to operate this camera. It's design for beginners as well as camera buffs. Excellent battery life! And most of all, considering all the features built into this camera, the price is very reasonable.","I love this camera's optical zoom.  5x, in a travel camera!  They should all be like this.  The digital zoom is also impressive.  In a kayak, at 50 feet being rocked by waves, I could still capture and center a bald eagle staring at me (albeit it took a couple tries, but who cares with digital)!  What's the minor issue?  The optical zoom is a little too quick so that framing a shot with small changes is very difficult and there is a very significant delay between shutter click and image capture with the digital zoom (however the image stabilization works tres bien).<br /><br />Would I buy another?  In a heartbeat.  Would I ask Pentax to fix the little bugs?  Of course.<br /><br />If I had free will with the rating it would habe been 4 3/4 stars.  Enjoy.","I can't say a whole lot that hasn't been covered by the other comments here... the Pentax Optio 555 is really a great camera.  I agree with the reviewer who immediately turned the digital zoom off -- it's really kinda silly to mess with digital zoom on a digital camera, since you will probably be able to post-process the images.  I haven't found the cash yet to upgrade from the memory card that comes with it, but it's definitely high on my to-do list.  I've never seen a camera that's so easy to use right out of the box but also has so many great features.  Even the novelty features continue to amuse me almost a year after getting the camera.  The 3D photo mode is really fun to play with, and the panorama assist makes it really easy to take panoramic pictures.  And yes, it includes software to stitch the images together (semi)automatically.  Lately I've been taking lots of night pictures -- it's really amazing how well this thing soaks up ambient light to take bright night shots WITHOUT the flash.<br /> The ONLY complaint I've got is that in a really saturated environment the auto-focus doesn't work very well.  A friend of mine got married recently and the auto focus refused to work at all, but I must admit the ENTIRE room was this hideous olive color, from the carpet to the fabric wall covering, and of course the completely mirrored ceiling only made the room twice as green.  Add to that the weak yellow light coming from the chandeliers, and it was understandably tough for the camera.  Finally I just switched to manual focus and put it in the continuous shoot mode and then I could just pick and choose the shots I liked and delete the rest.<br /> A couple of reviewers mentioned that the camera doesn't hold up well... I dunno about that.  Mine's been bounced around on a speedboat, fallen off a table, jerked around by the strap, and survived perfectly intact.  Maybe I've just been lucky, but I think that it holds up really well to \"normal\" wear and tear AND the occasional accident.<br /> I almost didn't get this camera because I really hate being locked into proprietary rechargable batteries.  I'd normally rather go through a bunch of AA batteries because I always worry that in 2 years the company will discontinue the battery and my product will be useless.  I've been pleasantly surprised, the battery has held up really well.  I've had the same battery almost a year and it still works for a few days with several hours of use each day between recharges.  It also holds a charge really well if I don't use the camera for a while.  And though someone complained about the 3 hour recharge time, I'm used to charging my previous [Kodak] digial camera and my camcorder overnight, so 3 hours is a HUGE improvement.<br />(...)","I love this camera.  I have several digital cameras and this one is the best by far.  The battery lasts for a VERY long time.  It's very easy to learn to use (hint:  read the manual).  The pictures are great.  I love the scenes (Pict) modes.  Even city shots at night with no tripod came out great.  There's no restriction on the time you can take a movie (like with the comparable Canon), and then there's the terrific, wonderful, fabulous 5X zoom that beats every other camera in its class.<br />It's small enough to fit in a purse or a pocket and I take it everywhere.  It powers up and focuses as fast or faster as any other digital camera.  No more lost shots of the grandkids taking their first bite of brussels sprouts!  It has a diopter so you can fine tune the optical viewfinder to fit your eyesight.  The LCD screen is bright and sharp.  Macro and super macro shots are amazing.<br />If you're looking for a small camera that does a great job in point and shoot situations, or if you're looking for a camera with enough bells and whistles to keep you interested, this is the one for you.  It's far better than my Canon, Nikon or Sony.  Price is dropping, too.  Sure wish I had the $$$ back I spent on my other cameras that now sit unused at home in their large, bulky camera bags full of expensive extra batteries (for the Canon and the Nikon) and obsolete, expensive memory sticks (in the case of the Sony).<br />By the way, here's the key to capturing moving things, which is true for all digital cameras:  1. Focus; 2. Compose your shot; and 3. Shoot.  With film cameras, you compose the shot, then focus, then shoot.  Won't work in the digital world.  Second hint is use the continuous mode which will capture several shots of the same subject.  Then you get to pick the best one and delete the ones you don't like.<br />One accessory that works great and comes in very handy is the wireless remote.  Set the camera on a tripod and become part of your pictures, or capture those hummingbirds without camera shake.<br />Buy this camera and enjoy.","Outstanding camera with tons of options and flexibility.  Photo/color quality is superb.  I researched many cameras before adding this one to my short-list and then finally selecting it.  Note: it's almost small enough for an oxford shirt pocket but frankly it's a bit too large.  However, the small leather Pentax Optio belt pouch (sold separately) works out very well and makes it easy to carry anywhere.  I really enjoy my 555.","I already have a Canon SLR film camera but it is too costly to keep because of costly film prices and hassle to get pics. So I bought this camera after an extensive research on the digital camera. This is my first digital camera as well. I was very pleased with the feature sets and picture quality of this camera. Easy to use for novices as well.<br />I was dispointed though because this camera is only good for static objects (or non-movable objects). For me the camera is of little use because I bought this camera to take pics of my 1 year old son. Unfortunately this camera is \"too\" slow to take pictures of a moving objects. If you don't have to take much pics of moving objects, then I would recommend this camera otherwise try Canon S400 or S50. I heard they are good for moving objects as well.","I have my Pentax Optio since the summer of 2003.

Again, take a lesson from Sony, which uses the standard mini-USB to USB cable for downloads rather than the Pentax-proprietary to USB cable.  If you lose that cable on the road, you have no way of downloading your photos and you are jammed until you can mail order another from Pentax.  If they would only have the courtesy to let you use the standard cable as Sony does, you could go to any electronics store, or use a friends.  Plus, if you carry a portable hard drive or some such thing that uses the mini-USB to USB, you will already have the download cable, while with Pentax you must carry 2 cables.<br /><br />-limited wide angle viweing.  the Sony has noticably better wide angle viweing, something like 28 mm, vs something like 35-50 mm in this camera, Sony also has a screw on wide angle adapter which this camera does not.<br /><br />- its time for Pentax to update the viewfinder.  I'm sure they are working on it, but at least another .5 inches would help this camera ALOT.<br /><br />- increase the size of the font of all the info in the viewfinder.  All the newer cameras with the larger viwfinders using larger font  as squinting to read critical information is just not fun.<br /><br />Thats my take - this camera is far better than some of the competitors, and I hope Pentax is listening and will make some improvements, as i love this extremely functional camera now, but can't wait for the next model!","This is the best camera I have own so far. Lots of cool stuffs. You don't have to be a professional to operate this camera. It's design for beginners as well as camera buffs. Excellent battery life! And most of all, considering all the features built into this camera, the price is very reasonable.","I love this camera's optical zoom.  5x, in a travel camera!  They should all be like this.  The digital zoom is also impressive.  In a kayak, at 50 feet being rocked by waves, I could still capture and center a bald eagle staring at me (albeit it took a couple tries, but who cares with digital)!  What's the minor issue?  The optical zoom is a little too quick so that framing a shot with small changes is very difficult and there is a very significant delay between shutter click and image capture with the digital zoom (however the image stabilization works tres bien).<br /><br />Would I buy another?  In a heartbeat.  Would I ask Pentax to fix the little bugs?  Of course.<br /><br />If I had free will with the rating it would habe been 4 3/4 stars.  Enjoy.","I can't say a whole lot that hasn't been covered by the other comments here... the Pentax Optio 555 is really a great camera.  I agree with the reviewer who immediately turned the digital zoom off -- it's really kinda silly to mess with digital zoom on a digital camera, since you will probably be able to post-process the images.  I haven't found the cash yet to upgrade from the memory card that comes with it, but it's definitely high on my to-do list.  I've never seen a camera that's so easy to use right out of the box but also has so many great features.  Even the novelty features continue to amuse me almost a year after getting the camera.  The 3D photo mode is really fun to play with, and the panorama assist makes it really easy to take panoramic pictures.  And yes, it includes software to stitch the images together (semi)automatically.  Lately I've been taking lots of night pictures -- it's really amazing how well this thing soaks up ambient light to take bright night shots WITHOUT the flash.<br /> The ONLY complaint I've got is that in a really saturated environment the auto-focus doesn't work very well.  A friend of mine got married recently and the auto focus refused to work at all, but I must admit the ENTIRE room was this hideous olive color, from the carpet to the fabric wall covering, and of course the completely mirrored ceiling only made the room twice as green.  Add to that the weak yellow light coming from the chandeliers, and it was understandably tough for the camera.  Finally I just switched to manual focus and put it in the continuous shoot mode and then I could just pick and choose the shots I liked and delete the rest.<br /> A couple of reviewers mentioned that the camera doesn't hold up well... I dunno about that.  Mine's been bounced around on a speedboat, fallen off a table, jerked around by the strap, and survived perfectly intact.  Maybe I've just been lucky, but I think that it holds up really well to \"normal\" wear and tear AND the occasional accident.<br /> I almost didn't get this camera because I really hate being locked into proprietary rechargable batteries.  I'd normally rather go through a bunch of AA batteries because I always worry that in 2 years the company will discontinue the battery and my product will be useless.  I've been pleasantly surprised, the battery has held up really well.  I've had the same battery almost a year and it still works for a few days with several hours of use each day between recharges.  It also holds a charge really well if I don't use the camera for a while.  And though someone complained about the 3 hour recharge time, I'm used to charging my previous [Kodak] digial camera and my camcorder overnight, so 3 hours is a HUGE improvement.<br />(...)","I love this camera.  I have several digital cameras and this one is the best by far.  The battery lasts for a VERY long time.  It's very easy to learn to use (hint:  read the manual).  The pictures are great.  I love the scenes (Pict) modes.  Even city shots at night with no tripod came out great.  There's no restriction on the time you can take a movie (like with the comparable Canon), and then there's the terrific, wonderful, fabulous 5X zoom that beats every other camera in its class.<br />It's small enough to fit in a purse or a pocket and I take it everywhere.  It powers up and focuses as fast or faster as any other digital camera.  No more lost shots of the grandkids taking their first bite of brussels sprouts!  It has a diopter so you can fine tune the optical viewfinder to fit your eyesight.  The LCD screen is bright and sharp.  Macro and super macro shots are amazing.<br />If you're looking for a small camera that does a great job in point and shoot situations, or if you're looking for a camera with enough bells and whistles to keep you interested, this is the one for you.  It's far better than my Canon, Nikon or Sony.  Price is dropping, too.  Sure wish I had the $$$ back I spent on my other cameras that now sit unused at home in their large, bulky camera bags full of expensive extra batteries (for the Canon and the Nikon) and obsolete, expensive memory sticks (in the case of the Sony).<br />By the way, here's the key to capturing moving things, which is true for all digital cameras:  1. Focus; 2. Compose your shot; and 3. Shoot.  With film cameras, you compose the shot, then focus, then shoot.  Won't work in the digital world.  Second hint is use the continuous mode which will capture several shots of the same subject.  Then you get to pick the best one and delete the ones you don't like.<br />One accessory that works great and comes in very handy is the wireless remote.  Set the camera on a tripod and become part of your pictures, or capture those hummingbirds without camera shake.<br />Buy this camera and enjoy.","Outstanding camera with tons of options and flexibility.  Photo/color quality is superb.  I researched many cameras before adding this one to my short-list and then finally selecting it.  Note: it's almost small enough for an oxford shirt pocket but frankly it's a bit too large.  However, the small leather Pentax Optio belt pouch (sold separately) works out very well and makes it easy to carry anywhere.  I really enjoy my 555.","I already have a Canon SLR film camera but it is too costly to keep because of costly film prices and hassle to get pics. So I bought this camera after an extensive research on the digital camera. This is my first digital camera as well. I was very pleased with the feature sets and picture quality of this camera. Easy to use for novices as well.<br />I was dispointed though because this camera is only good for static objects (or non-movable objects). For me the camera is of little use because I bought this camera to take pics of my 1 year old son. Unfortunately this camera is \"too\" slow to take pictures of a moving objects. If you don't have to take much pics of moving objects, then I would recommend this camera otherwise try Canon S400 or S50. I heard they are good for moving objects as well.","My Canon G1 started showing a CF error at niagara falls, and that really got me p'd off. I mean the G1 is a heck of a camera. With 2 small kids I needed a good replacement and I wanted a small versatile camera. I already had a 3mp and I wanted a compact five mp so I could keep it for a while and get my pro-sumer Big Cam fixed.<br />I was torn between the Sony Dsc-V1, the Canon S-50 and the S-500 digital elph and this camera. Frankly I chose the pentax because the sony was too big and would be 100 dollars more plus the memory stick. The S-50 would probably be just as good or better but the pentax lens is just better than the smaller canon lens in the S-50. THe G- series lenses are fantastic but they are big and the cameras are big. Also- I was familiar with the canon and the Zoom browser software gets on your nerves repeatedly. So I paid $400 for the pentax 555 at a warehouse club and I bought a 256 SD card at an office supply store for $70.<br />I have had the camera 3 weeks, about 500 pictures and here is my assessment so far.<br />Pros= zoom; battery life; flash performance; color; ease of playback; unlimited movie time(only limited by SD card size; Full Manual Control if you want it.<br />With a 3x zoom you always are left saying \"I wish I was just a little closer.\" th e5x zoom cures that. the battery lasts for days and I was extremely impressed with the flash performance on this camera. NO wash out at any distance. The colors are true as well. Manipulation may cure canon color problems but you cannot beat pentax for out of the camera colors. That movie mode is great- the canon limits to 30 seconds per movie. don't buy this or any digicam as a camcorder- but that is a superior feature really. It is immeasurable how nice it is to get true color right out of the camera. Pentax got this right on this camera.<br />Cons: slight shutter lag; low light focus and general sharpness issues.<br />The shutter lag is a little too much on this camera- you find yourself prefocusing so that it goes off instantaneously. Its about 80% of where it should be. The focus/ sharpness issues are correctable so thats ok.<br />All in all, you most likely can't beat the features of this camera for the price and size. If you want a portable camera- really its thiscamera, the canon, or the sony dscv series (t1-V1). If you want a pro-sumer camera for a couple hundred more- buy the Canon G5.","I highly recomend this camera, it takes great pictures and is very user friendly. The reason we bought this is beacause we have a very expensive minolta 35mm that never took a bad picture, that was until we got a pack of film that was bad and every single picture about 75 or so were all bad. That was not a risk I was willing to take with the birth of my first child. I bought this camera two days before my son was born and had very little time to learn how to use, but I did not need it, it is so easy to use and I took over 100 pictures, every single one came out perfect. The only thing you will need to get is a bigger SD card, I got 2, 256mb panasonic cards. I chose the panasonic cards because that is the type of card it came with. But it was only a 16mb, not enough memory. I looked at several other cameras and I chose this one because it has the aluminum case not plastic and none of the other cameras had 5x optical zoom for this price. The camera is outstanding, great build, great size, great quality!!!","Got my Optio 555 several weeks ago (upgraded from a Kodak 2Megapixel) and overall am very happy/glad I made the switch.  The camera takes great pics and I LOVE the 5x optical zoom.  The digital zoom actually works much better than my old Kodak too.  I paid $370 for the camera and would challenge anyone to find a good 5Megapixel, 5x optical zoom camera for that price!  I haven't had any problems with the camera so am not sure if the folks that have had problems just got lemons or what.  I also bought a padded leather case for the camera ($30) so haven't had any problems with the camera not working due to jarring.  My ONLY complaint about the camera would be that in very-low/low light the pics do seem to be too dark/grainy if the subject is more than 3-8 feet away.  There is a special \"sunset\" mode you can use but that doesn't seem to make those pics any better.  As long as you have \"normal\" lighting (normal office setting or at a Mall, for example) you'll never notice that problem, though.  The only time I have noticed this problem was when taking some pics at a large low lit restaurant during a dinner.  Regardless, I am giving the camera 5 stars as I very happy with the camera -- ESPECIALLY when I consider that for less than $550 I got a great 5mega pixel camera, very fast 256M SD card, padded leather case, spare battery, and a 2 year extended warranty.","The Optio 555 has a great feature set and is a great size.  Its outdoor picture are perfect, however indoors in low light the pictures are very grainy.  My Olympus 3.3MP takes better pictures indoors.","I recently purchased a Pentax Optio 555 (not here though) after reading the reviews on Amazon.  This is a great camera!  It has everything. I love it.  However it would not download to my PC using the USB cable so Customer Service recommended I send it to them to check it out. BAD Mistake. I didn't have the camera in my possession a week when I sent it in.  Then they had my camera three weeks before I got upset at their lousy customer service that concluded there was nothing wrong with my camera. I finally got it returned to me but it still won't download to my PC so I use a card reader.  The camera is great but customer service is terrible!","So far my photos seem ok, I'm no expert but I've had several digital cameras and some have taken pictures too dark or washed out. This one takes nice pictures, the color is good and indoor photos are as good as any film camera I've had.<br />I got a fast 512mb sd card and it makes a huge difference in the speed of taking pictures, even smaller jpg is noticeably faster, tiff is about 10 times faster. (I had a Sandisk 512mb prior, now I have the Sandisk Ultra... big difference and worth the extra cost)<br />The camera is not as sleek as the canon's I've had and love and it doesn't seem as rugged, though that might just be the feel of the finish. It is a little larger than many 5mp cameras but not heavier. I like that you can zoom in movie mode and the length of the movie is only limited by the size of the card.<br />The biggest problem is the view finder is way off if you're taking photos of something within 15 feet. It gets better as you go out, but closer shots have to be done via the screen to get the actual shot you want. The battery seems to last a long time. I don't take that many photos, maybe 50 a month, but I'll go a month of showing the photos and letting it sit in my hand bag and not have to charge the battery.<br />I've had mostly Canon Powershot and loved the small, sleek and rugged feel. But the more I use this camera the more I like it. I've had real good experience with Pentax customer service too.","The Optio 555 is an excellent performer but this is certainly not a rugged, reliable companion. I bought an Optio550 originally and had nothing but problems. The slightest jarring while in my suitcase rendered my $500 dollar investment worthless. However this is not my biggest complaint. I sent my camera to Pentax and it took them over 2 months to return it to me. When I got it back the exact same problem occurred but this time I had no idea how. I've read a significant number of reviews and several users have experienced the same problems from insignificant jarring. So I sent Pentax my camera again and finally had it returned to me shortly thereafter. However this took much complaining about the poor customer service I received earlier. At this point I have no confidence in Pentax products. So one day I decided to write a complaint about my poor customer experience. I found the name of several executives who I though may care about my problems and sent them an email. A VP read my email and made sure I was compensated for the nearly 3 months I was without my camera as well as the additional $50 I spent on shipping, by sending me a new Optio 555. So far I am satisfied but have not yet taken my camera out of the house. Although I admit this is a great camera, I would not purchase from Pentax again due to the fragility of their camera and a customer service department that cares little about its customers. I would look into Canon or Sony instead.","I purchased an Optio 555 in November 2003.  I read the instruction manual on the airplane on the way to Hawaii.<br />Problems:  As I was shooting pictures using the zoom frequently outdoors, the camera would \"lock up\" and I had to turn it off to unlock it.  Must have had a software problem.  The pictures were very good within the limits of the camera.<br />Upon returning home, I exchanged the camera for a new one.  The camera shop was very helpful.  The second camera functioned OK without any software problems.  I was not as happy with the picture quality in the second one.  I don't know if the meter was not as accurate or the white balance was not working very well.  Indoors, the color was not accurate or washed out<br />I have returned this to the camera store and will start my search over again.<br />I think that the camera features and ability to take good pictures is very good.  I think this is a quality control problem.  Not like Pentax normally.  Make sure you take pictures in a variety of conditions using all the functions within the time limits of the camera store's return policy just in case you have the same experience I had.<br />On paper this is a good choice if all works well.  The 5 MP and 5X lens are what I wanted.  I haven't got a clear choice in what to buy in a compact package like this.  The software provided made it very easy to download pictures into a PC and do some editing.","I received the camera as a gift a few weeks ago, and expected to spend at least a couple of hours learning how to skate around the various optional settings.  The menu driven software made it easy to navigate and I was up and shooting in 15 minutes.  The paltry 16MB SD memory card can only hold a few of my 5Meg picutres at a time, so plan on getting at least a 250MB card for it.  But the pics are unbelievably sharp and balanced in the auto mode.  I haven't even scratched the surface of its capabilities, but the manual mode allows you to experiment with depth of field and exposure ... it used to take a whole camera bag to house all the filters and lenses etc. that this little shirt-pocket camera has on board.<br />I've owned digital cameras since they first came out, and the Optio 555 is a jaw-dropping, great little powerhouse.  Put this one in the \"highly recommended\" column.","I bought the Pentax Optio 555 on 2 November 2003 in Hong Kong.<br />My number one reason for choosing the 555 was: The longer battery life. My second reason was the 5x zoom, followed by stronger flash and additional features to learn now to use. Saying that, there will be times I wish I had the smaller, lighter, faster Minolta G500... So it was a serious compromise that was not an easy choice - they are BOTH excellent options for a small light 'everyday' camera!<br />Very basic - but my very first photos are here - nothing special, just really posting them so you can see the image quality - almost all done in P mode... and straight from the camera! [...] (this expires 5 Dec 2003)<br />OK - I have never owned a digital camera before, but I have owned most recently a Nikon F100 and do know a little about film cameras...<br />I bought it, battery took exactly 3 hours to charge...<br />While I waited, I read the manual<br />Oh - and the first thing I did was stop all the annoying sounds by turning them all off in the user menu.<br />The second thing I did was turn the digital zoom off<br />I also turned the start up picture off<br />I do not have a stop-watch - but here are some approximate times.  NOT ACCURATE TIMES, NO STOP WATCH!<br /><br />Sunlight/brightly lit room - I found the shot to shot time to be incredibly good - even with the flash and the pictures again were in focus with excellent lighting...<br />Dimly lit room - wide angle - 1-3 seconds<br />Dimly lit room - full Optical zoom - 1.5 - 3 seconds<br />Totally DARK room - wide angle - 3-5 seconds<br />Totally DARK room - full Optical zoom - 3-6 seconds<br />I mean TOTALLY DARK! But saying that - the photos look great, are well lit by the flash and in focus...<br />With the zoom, it takes a bit longer to focus BUT once it gets it, it is perfect. (how, I do not know)<br />Here are more accurate times from another review:<br />Auto Focus LAG Wide angle:<br />0.8 - 1.4<br />Auto Focus LAG Telephoto<br />0.8 - 1.5<br />Shutter Release LAG Viewfinder<br />0.1<br />Shutter Release LAG LCD<br />V1: 0.1<br />0.1 - 0.2<br />Shot to Shot Wide angle<br />1.8<br />Frames per second<br />1.1<br />I am using the P mode and I quickly set up the User Mode as Gordon (see DP Review Pentax Forum) suggested:<br />ISO 200<br />AWB<br />Low Contrast<br />Spot Focus<br />I have a 256 Panasonic SD card (10Mb/Second)<br />MAX Resolution of 2592 x 1944<br />At 1 * it is 243 pictures<br />At 3 *** it is 75 pictures<br />I am switching between * and *** depending on the subject.<br />I am looking forward to Panasonic coming out with a 2 Gig card!!!<br />The user mode with these settings is faster than the P mode by about 1 second in the dimly lit and dark rooms.<br />continuous mode with no flash - that was really fast too - I did not time this.<br />PIC - Night Scene Mode - I went out at night on the streets of HK and took three pictures of the same things - P Mode, User Mode, Night Scene Mode.  What the Night Scene Mode does is really light up the whole area - I don't know how it does this, but the same photo in P mode was bright lights from the signs, and a bit dark everything else.  While with Night Scene the whole photo lights up as if with a flood light - really amazing.  At different times I would opt for P, User or Night Mode depending on my desired outcome.<br />Physical - the case seems sturdy, the buttons are well placed, it is easy to hold and shoot.  I like the way it is easy to change what the LCD displays and to turn it off...  It is not as [nice] as the G500, but it is a nice functional, sturdy camera!<br />OK - so this is the quick first impressions... but so far I am really enjoying it!...","I was looking for a 5MP camera with maximum zoom in an small package.  The Pentax Optio 555 satisfies all of these requirements and more.<br />I had a 4MP 4X zoom but was having a hard time capturing action shots of the kids.  With the Pentax, I now have a camera half the size, 5MP and 5X zoom and the flexibility to adjust shutter speed to capture the moment.  It's no easy task getting the soccer shots of the kids as they're always moving and you need a decent zoom to get close enough.  This camera is perfect for that purpose.  So far the battery life seems excellent.  I fill up my 256MB SD card long before the battery runs out.<br />I'm very pleased with the quality of pictures.  So far I've taken about 100 pictures.  It seems to have some difficulty in low-light conditions but it's better than my previous camera so I'm not sure it's the camera's fault.<br />My only complaint is the 16MB included card is a joke.  It seems typical of all mfrs to include such inadequate storage so it's not unique to the Pentax but never the less frustrating.  The battery lasts forever but it also seems to take forever (~3 hours) to charge.  I'm not usually in a hurry to charge but thought it was worth noting."]},{"name":"Olympus E-1","amazon_reviews":["The E-1 is an anomaly. It is outdated and archaic. Its LCD is primitive. It boasts a whopping 5 megapixel sensor that is currently outdone (number-wise) by cell-phone cameras. And yet, it is one of the greatest digital SLR's to ever roll off a production line.<br /><br />The E-1 has perfect ergonomics, feels like a \"real\" camera (no cheap plasticky Canikon vibe), and takes incredible pictures with a depth of realism that is hard to match. Before I bought my used E-1, I had an E-30. I say \"had\" even though I still have the E-30----but now I rarely shoot it. Ironically, the ancient E-1 has become my primary camera, while the newer (technically better) E-30 has been relegated to \"back-up\" status. That's how good the E-1 feels in your hand.<br /><br />Now, given the current situation with Olympus (and if you are looking at E-1's, you must know something about the company, 4/3rds future, etc.) I cannot say I would recommend someone jumping into the 4/3 system. But, if you already have some 4/3 glass and are looking for an extra body, I can say that you will absolutely LOVE the E-1. This is an example of a camera that is just right on so many levels.<br /><br />A true \"digital classic.\"","Bought this camera used after reading all the good things about it and glad I did.  It's mostly used as a back up, but once I start using it, it's hard to put it down. It's a pros camera (no presets) I love that it's simple and very easy to use. The picture quality is excellent. Ergonomics makes it one of the best cameras to hold.  All the buttons are in the right place for quick access.  It's weather sealed which is another plus, the 5mp is more than enough and the camera is heavy enough that if someone tries to take it from you it doubles as a weapon, you can beat the crap out of someone with this thing and still take their picture when you're done. Uh, kidding.  I do like the weight of the camera, it screams it means business. The only flaw with this camera is the time it takes to write to the card which is not a big problem.","This is my primary camera. No bells and wisthles. Plain and simple! The man/woman behind the camera makes the picture!","I'm shooting since 1985, when I bought my Yashica FXD. Eight months ago I donate it to my sister and I've bought a 137 MA Contax with a couple of Carl Zeiss + Yashica lenses. Two months later I bought an 159 MM Contax also. I love these cameras and the lenses. Thousands of shots most of them in diapositive film and some B/W. Then the digital era were dawn and everything start to look easy and cheap (except the hardware of course - in those days -). Three years ago I bought an Oly C5050Z bridge camera in which I found everything I wanted but for portraits and landscapes only, because as I've tried to capture a motorcycle racing (and Enduro) I've managed to take good shots, only when the racers stood still. Then came the E330 (which is the only new at all camera I have). Seven months ago I've bought a used E1 from E-bay. Good price and in good condition camera.<br /><br />The E1 of course hmm....<br />Its lovely, its a tankmade and ...only 5mgpxls, someone would thought for today's standards. But who cares about the resolution. A4 prints from my Canon Pixma 4300 are excellent. Colors are vivid but not over saturated. Images are crisp and clear (specially in the eyes - portraits - and the water drops - landscapes and macros -).<br />But there is one complain: ...the AF capability. I find the AF speed quite good, but someone must beware the vertical level of the focus. The solution is not to trust the first result of the focusing and to refocus again. Of course you can do this in stand still images and for moving subjects I use the prefocus method. But this is not a real problem for someone who is used to with the old manual SLRs<br />Handling the camera is a pleasure, and I'm looking all around for an opportunity to aim through the bright viewfinder, to press the shutter, to hear the sound (like a gun's breechblock), to capture the moment, to steel a piece of time, to keep a person young for the next decades to come. I do love the feeling of this camera.<br />Buttons and switches are in the right place and when someone get used with the camera, can operate her even in the dark immediately. The size of the buttons is small and the sense of pressing them is not so accurate, that means handling the camera with gloves (in cold weather) is a little bit difficult thing.<br />The rear LCD is a little bit small (maybe tiny) for today's standards and also the shot takes a little time (I never counted it) to appear. At the first time it was annoying for me - getting used with the E 330 - but now I don't mind at all (I have my 19\" LCD from my PC).<br />The 14-45mm kit lens is good (Value/Money), but I think that my 55-200mm SIGMA is far better in quality and sharpness.<br />Today I use the E1 with my old glass (Zeiss + Yashica) and I have no problem at all with the manual focus, because the viewfinder is bright and sharp focused images is a piece of cake - even in races - like the old days with my lovely Contaxes. I think that there is no need to extol the quality of the construction and the image clarity of Zeiss Lenses.<br />For software I use the CS2 with the Genuine Fractals plug in, but Olympus Studio 2 is working grate too.<br />Conclusion ?<br />Great camera to handle, to shoot, to hear the shutter. I do love my E1, giving me inspiration to see things beyond the eye.<br />Ohh!<br />I forgot the C5050Z. Urban landscapes, people, trains, beaches. The body is rugged and the lens is terrific.<br />The only thing I need is time to shoot.","This is a real professional digital camera but it's easy to use for those just beginning. With excellent color rendention, you can shoot RAW for more control or use the Fine jpeg and it will pop your eyes out with a image quality found in only the best of cameras.","We have been using the E1 for 15 months now and I can say we are very pleased.  I love the sharpness of the lenses.  Our company does commercial and portrait work and we are able to go to 30x40 sized prints and they are sharp, much sharper than 35mm and even some 645 neg's we used to use.  Color rendition seems to be right on, bit on the warm side but very little.  Most work is done with studio lights.  All in all the camera preforms the way we want it to.  Would we recommend the E1 .... We now own 4 E1's.","I've been using E1 with Zuiko Digital 14-54 f/2.8-3.5 for several months now, and I must report that I am thoroughly pleased with its operation. It performs flawlessly, without any glitches, and is a solid, well built and reliable photographic tool. It is a joy to use in the field.<br /><br />Image quality is nothing short of excellent. A3 sized prints from E1 easily match my best slide scans from 35mm film. The images are clean, vivid, sharp, with beautiful colors, which reminds me of Kodak emulsions. Once I made a beautiful, clean A4 print from a small cropped segment of a portrait; at this enlargement, the entire picture would exceed A2 paper size. 5 megapixels yes, but 5 megapixels of extreme signal quality. Unlike Canon, Kodak didn't put hardware noise reduction on its sensors, so with help of NeatImage or Noise Ninja, one can make very clean prints even at ISO 800. However, ISO 1600 and 3200 display banding artifacts, and are useful mostly for black&white images. Those B&W images, however, respond very well to noise reduction and produce very good A4 prints. As for the 14-54 lens, it is very sharp from f/3.5-f/11, has very good but not excellent bokeh, has extremely useful range from moderately wide to moderately tele (28-108mm in 35mm equivalents), and works best at the long end. There it really shines as a portrait lens. However, it displays some vignetting at the long end, and some cyan fringing in the corners at the wide and.<br /><br />So, the strong points of this camera are its absolute image quality, color fidelity, buid quality and ergonomics. On the minus side, however, there is autofocus, which leaves much room for improvement. It is slow and of little use in low light. Also, the buffer could clear faster, especially with microdrive, whose full potential isn't utilized.<br /><br />Conclusion: it's an excellent camera, whose real competitor is Canon 20D. Canon has a solid resolution advantage, produces good images, and works better at high ISO values. However, E1 is better built, it has an excellent kit lens which is every bit as good as Canon L zooms and rivals good primes, has built-in sensor cleaning, is splash-proof and an excellent overall package. Choice between them is a matter of individual preference and taste. What made it for me was the range of focal lengths. With Olympus, I can cover my needs with just two lenses, and 14-54 is designed just right. It's wide enough and long enough for me not to need anything else for most applications. With a 35mm legacy and 1.6x crop factor, Canon's lens range is just inconvenient. Most lenses are either not wide enough or not long enough or cover the wrong range. With Olympus, I still didn't feel any desperate need to buy a second lens; 108mm equivalent is just right for portraiture, and 28mm is just wide enough for the kind of landscapes I usually shoot.","Four month satisfied owner after a lot of research.If one goes on raw comparative specs alone, the E-1 may fall short on some comparisons,such as number of megapixels (5) and number of lenses available(ca. 12). But handling it and looking at the untouched results,will impress one,-don't reveal the source and see. It is a tough,professional machine,and weather sealed, and has no history of breakdowns in a year from users and no major glitches... Having said that, some users don't want or need a professional level camera. If you don't need these special adjustment capabilities, don't mess with this level of camera. It is rather heavy, and huge manual to absorb. The dust reduction system and the high quality lenses of superb design are very large advantages to all. Will the E system be around in ten years you say? I don't know, and you don't know,but the camera will be usable for a long time. Certainly until every suburban home has a 36\" high definition flat panel TV in their living room and moves on to covet a 65\".<br />Update as of 9-1-2006:<br />If anything,my respect for this camera increases. It is chunky,not what Olympuses are supposed to be to many,and is even heavier with the accessory HDL-2 grip. I have not pushed the enlargements to the point where I need more than the alloted megapixels,not even close. I have not fully exploited all the capabilities (read multiple options) of the camera,but it is definitely not in the DSLR beginner category. This Fall will likely see news on an upgrade,and some interesting E series bodies. If one is still satisfied with well thought out good design,water proofing,and superb( their mid price line) lenses,with a definite and future limited variety vis a vis Canon et al,then this camera is still a hard to go wrong choice. The downside: Canon and Nikon and now Sony are still the places that folks who own Canon EOS and Nikon and Minolta autofocus lenses will seek out first and who may need a broader choice of accessories or rental super telephotos. For those who have no stable of lenses,and just want to jump in,how can one go wrong with the E-1 and the 14-54 plus one Olympus flash is still my view.<br />(Caveat: If you are subject to buyer's remorse,better wait until Photokina on September 26. The future of this camera and the E system will be shaped by what Olympus displays or outlines its E system offerings at that time...that said,do not hesitate to go for this at a budget closeout price,one third of what I paid in July 2004. It is a camera that grows on you if you like its hefty quality feel, weatherproofing,the buttons versus menu approach.)","I have owned this camera for about 2 months now and I am very happy with it. It is not the fastest or the highest image quaility in its class, but it is the best priced for its overall quality. I have already t ested it's durability and it has passed with flying colors. As a landscape designer it is used regularly in all conditions and has performed flawlessly. Do your homework and you will see it is a solid camera at a  fair price","The E-1 is an anomaly. It is outdated and archaic. Its LCD is primitive. It boasts a whopping 5 megapixel sensor that is currently outdone (number-wise) by cell-phone cameras. And yet, it is one of the greatest digital SLR's to ever roll off a production line.<br /><br />The E-1 has perfect ergonomics, feels like a \"real\" camera (no cheap plasticky Canikon vibe), and takes incredible pictures with a depth of realism that is hard to match. Before I bought my used E-1, I had an E-30. I say \"had\" even though I still have the E-30----but now I rarely shoot it. Ironically, the ancient E-1 has become my primary camera, while the newer (technically better) E-30 has been relegated to \"back-up\" status. That's how good the E-1 feels in your hand.<br /><br />Now, given the current situation with Olympus (and if you are looking at E-1's, you must know something about the company, 4/3rds future, etc.) I cannot say I would recommend someone jumping into the 4/3 system. But, if you already have some 4/3 glass and are looking for an extra body, I can say that you will absolutely LOVE the E-1. This is an example of a camera that is just right on so many levels.<br /><br />A true \"digital classic.\"","Bought this camera used after reading all the good things about it and glad I did.  It's mostly used as a back up, but once I start using it, it's hard to put it down. It's a pros camera (no presets) I love that it's simple and very easy to use. The picture quality is excellent. Ergonomics makes it one of the best cameras to hold.  All the buttons are in the right place for quick access.  It's weather sealed which is another plus, the 5mp is more than enough and the camera is heavy enough that if someone tries to take it from you it doubles as a weapon, you can beat the crap out of someone with this thing and still take their picture when you're done. Uh, kidding.  I do like the weight of the camera, it screams it means business. The only flaw with this camera is the time it takes to write to the card which is not a big problem.","This is my primary camera. No bells and wisthles. Plain and simple! The man/woman behind the camera makes the picture!","I'm shooting since 1985, when I bought my Yashica FXD. Eight months ago I donate it to my sister and I've bought a 137 MA Contax with a couple of Carl Zeiss + Yashica lenses. Two months later I bought an 159 MM Contax also. I love these cameras and the lenses. Thousands of shots most of them in diapositive film and some B/W. Then the digital era were dawn and everything start to look easy and cheap (except the hardware of course - in those days -). Three years ago I bought an Oly C5050Z bridge camera in which I found everything I wanted but for portraits and landscapes only, because as I've tried to capture a motorcycle racing (and Enduro) I've managed to take good shots, only when the racers stood still. Then came the E330 (which is the only new at all camera I have). Seven months ago I've bought a used E1 from E-bay. Good price and in good condition camera.<br /><br />The E1 of course hmm....<br />Its lovely, its a tankmade and ...only 5mgpxls, someone would thought for today's standards. But who cares about the resolution. A4 prints from my Canon Pixma 4300 are excellent. Colors are vivid but not over saturated. Images are crisp and clear (specially in the eyes - portraits - and the water drops - landscapes and macros -).<br />But there is one complain: ...the AF capability. I find the AF speed quite good, but someone must beware the vertical level of the focus. The solution is not to trust the first result of the focusing and to refocus again. Of course you can do this in stand still images and for moving subjects I use the prefocus method. But this is not a real problem for someone who is used to with the old manual SLRs<br />Handling the camera is a pleasure, and I'm looking all around for an opportunity to aim through the bright viewfinder, to press the shutter, to hear the sound (like a gun's breechblock), to capture the moment, to steel a piece of time, to keep a person young for the next decades to come. I do love the feeling of this camera.<br />Buttons and switches are in the right place and when someone get used with the camera, can operate her even in the dark immediately. The size of the buttons is small and the sense of pressing them is not so accurate, that means handling the camera with gloves (in cold weather) is a little bit difficult thing.<br />The rear LCD is a little bit small (maybe tiny) for today's standards and also the shot takes a little time (I never counted it) to appear. At the first time it was annoying for me - getting used with the E 330 - but now I don't mind at all (I have my 19\" LCD from my PC).<br />The 14-45mm kit lens is good (Value/Money), but I think that my 55-200mm SIGMA is far better in quality and sharpness.<br />Today I use the E1 with my old glass (Zeiss + Yashica) and I have no problem at all with the manual focus, because the viewfinder is bright and sharp focused images is a piece of cake - even in races - like the old days with my lovely Contaxes. I think that there is no need to extol the quality of the construction and the image clarity of Zeiss Lenses.<br />For software I use the CS2 with the Genuine Fractals plug in, but Olympus Studio 2 is working grate too.<br />Conclusion ?<br />Great camera to handle, to shoot, to hear the shutter. I do love my E1, giving me inspiration to see things beyond the eye.<br />Ohh!<br />I forgot the C5050Z. Urban landscapes, people, trains, beaches. The body is rugged and the lens is terrific.<br />The only thing I need is time to shoot.","This is a real professional digital camera but it's easy to use for those just beginning. With excellent color rendention, you can shoot RAW for more control or use the Fine jpeg and it will pop your eyes out with a image quality found in only the best of cameras.","We have been using the E1 for 15 months now and I can say we are very pleased.  I love the sharpness of the lenses.  Our company does commercial and portrait work and we are able to go to 30x40 sized prints and they are sharp, much sharper than 35mm and even some 645 neg's we used to use.  Color rendition seems to be right on, bit on the warm side but very little.  Most work is done with studio lights.  All in all the camera preforms the way we want it to.  Would we recommend the E1 .... We now own 4 E1's.","I've been using E1 with Zuiko Digital 14-54 f/2.8-3.5 for several months now, and I must report that I am thoroughly pleased with its operation. It performs flawlessly, without any glitches, and is a solid, well built and reliable photographic tool. It is a joy to use in the field.<br /><br />Image quality is nothing short of excellent. A3 sized prints from E1 easily match my best slide scans from 35mm film. The images are clean, vivid, sharp, with beautiful colors, which reminds me of Kodak emulsions. Once I made a beautiful, clean A4 print from a small cropped segment of a portrait; at this enlargement, the entire picture would exceed A2 paper size. 5 megapixels yes, but 5 megapixels of extreme signal quality.

The camera arrive on time and in perfect condition with the accessories and owners manual.  I love this camera.  Hands down my favourite of all time.  The photos it takes are warm and lovely.  Awesome seller; would definitely buy from these guys again.","I've copied my review below from the DMC-LC1 review I just published, since both cameras are extremely similar. The differences in aesthetics, grip, and minor button assignments are minimal, but give the interested party a clear choice. The Jpeg engine of this camera is ever so slightly tuned differently than the LC1, I'd sum up by saying it is more conservative in color saturation and yields slightly better detail. Other than that, they are the same.<br /><br />I've written extensively on this camera and the digilux 2 online on my own blog.<br /><br />This camera and the digilux 2 are considered true classic cameras, and a decade later they still do not disappoint the discerning photographer who embraces the foundation of principles and fundamentals that make photography a rewarding experience.<br /><br />This camera design is truly unique- one of a kind. Dismissed by the masses but embraced by a very niche group of photographers that desire a camera to be both a design first priority, and, a work of art- at the very same time.<br /><br />The lens of this camera, its manual controls, its bright aperture, internal zoom, build quality, and ultimately its excellent performance- are the heart of its lure and soul of its operation. The body style, and external controls compliment this lens design perfectly. Its size is both large enough to operate manually without being cramped, and small enough to be carried anywhere all day long without fatigue in any way.<br /><br />It's sensor is excellent still to this day, 5mp actually translates to the resolution output of many 10mp sensors because of how sharp this lens is. So don't be swayed by that specification. While this camera's operational speed is pedestrian compared to many of today's cameras, its that exact quality which endears it to owners of it. The mere fact that this camera in some ways is inadequate (compared to faster DSLRS) to a variety of shooting circumstances forces the photographer to think his/her way through the process. Thus a shot well done grants the photographer a proud achievement.<br /><br />This is in stark contrast to using a DSLR where shooting a burst of images with a blazing fast autofocus and burst rate yield one good image out of many.<br /><br />It's EVF and LCD are adequate, and with some practice can become intuitive to the shooters needs. The short range of ISO (compared to today's cameras) is also adequate considering the lens fast aperture, and the fact that it yields sharp images wide open. When you do the math you'll see that a comparable DSLR kit would need to use an ISO speed two stops or more higher than this camera to get the same shutter speed.<br /><br />The build quality of this camera, its handling, are first rate. Leica spearheaded its design (both cameras) and Panasonic provided the production capability and electronics. Don't be fooled into believing that this is a Panasonic design first and foremost. Its actually the other way around.<br /><br />This camera and its twin, continue to hold value extremely well. Most digital cameras end up in the trash bin and forgotten, discounted to oblivion, or end up collecting dust in a storage facility. Not the LC1 or Digilux 2.<br /><br />There is a reason for that.<br /><br />No amount of reading will make you understand the draw of this camera. If you like to think when you photograph, if you like to practice photography fundamentals, if you like perfect manual controls, then this camera is probably going to make you very happy.<br /><br />It's as perfect of a design as designs can get, especially for the time it was introduced.<br /><br />Carl","Ahead of it's time, only to be replaced today by the Fujifilm X-E1. I purchased this silent camera new and had issues only at the beginning and end of ownership. My 5mp images could print 16x20 on an Epson 4000 and impress the room, and was willing to wait for each RAW image to process. Traded in my Contax G2 for this Digilux (with mixed feelings but the G2 had an unfaithful viewfinder) but knew it was a step in the right direction. The first Digilux out of box had a bad shutter/on-off mechinism (Barnack turning over in grave). The second lasted me through A LOT of art school craziness, developed some dead pixels in the EVF, survived dropping/flipping between two rocks only to not survive the cold night with me in a tent on Donner Summit. Snow that morning looked beautiful on the cabin but the Digilux would not power up. After a warranty repair, I sold it still in it's plastic from the repair. \"Good-bye old paint, ...\" If it had 6-7mp then, I wouldn't have let go. After this was a swirl of mechanical Leica thread mounts from iiif's to Zorki's, and some SLR's one DSLR but nothing like this Digilux. I don't own a camera now and graduated without one using mostly the images made from this camera early in my college career. These images are still my most cherished compositions that could not be continued with future camera equipment that followed. The likes of Fuji EV-1 and Nikon V1 are trying this EVF design ten years later.","If you are someone who cut their teeth on film cameras and hate the layout, interface and operation of most modern digital cameras, this may be the camera for you.

As the market for this kind of camera is small, we may never see anything like it again. It's a wonderful camera taken for what it is and could well become a collector's item down the line.<br /><br />If you can find one in decent condition for a reasonable price buy it. My best guess is that the resale price of these cameras has bottomed out and will probably appreciate over time.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />In the 2 years since I wrote this review, the average price on Amazon and eBay has increased significantly.

The camera is mostly metal rather than plastic and has a two tone silver and black markings.  It's built like a tank & beautiful to behold.

At first glance, the Panasonic twin (DMC-LC1) is a much better deal (At the time of this review, it's 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of a Leica) if you're willing to forgo the \"red dot\" and put up with a bit more plastic.<br /><br />Unusual sized 69 millimeter camera lens width means that third party lens-filters are rare and expensive.

Also, for those still unashamed to wear \"butt packs\", you'd need one the size of \"Grandma's purse\" to carry this camera around in.  If you want to do more \"unobtrusive\" photography, the DLux 3 is the Leica to get.<br /><br />Full Review:<br /><br />I've owned a Leica Digilux 2 for two years.  The camera has very high quality construction. More metal than plastic.  It has an amazing lens that can't be purchased apart from the camera body.  Most color and all B & W images have a \"Leica\" look. Even the die-hard Leica film camera fans  have to admit there is something special about the photographs this camera produces.<br /><br />It's overpriced compared to its Panasonic twin (Panasonic DMC-LC1) and other brand cameras with similar feature, so I initially regretted my purchase.  The camera sensor broke after two years of very easy use. Apparently, a good number of the Digilux 2's had sensors installed that did not meet Leica's quality control requirements. A good number of them are now failing.  Fortunately, Leica is repairing the malfunction free of charge.  They appear to be doing so for all of the Digilux 2 cameras even if they are out of warranty, were purchased on the grey-market or if they were purchased second-hand.  As of today, Panasonic with the same sensors in the DMC-LC1 is not providing this level of protection and hassle free repair.  I can't think of any Japanese, Korean or American company that would provide this type of protection to their customers and their reputation.  For this reason, I no longer regret spending the extra money for the Leica camera.<br /><br />Some reviews complain about the viewfinder and LCD image quality.  I wasn't happy with the resolution either, until I realized that the little dial on the side of the viewfinder provides a way to adjust the resolution and focus of the viewfinder image.  After reading the instruction manual and making a slight adjustment, I find the view finder more than adequate.  I suspect that some reviewers may not have read the instruction manual and made this adjustment before writing their review.<br /><br />The Leica lens has a non-standard width of 69mm.  This means that third party lens filters are almost nonexistent and expensive even if you manage to find one. Forget about finding a non-Leica lens hood.  A third-party adapter ring can bump the filter size up to a more standard 72mm or 77mm size, however I've found that non-Leica brand filters (even the expensive ones) seem to degrade the quality of the photographs too much.<br /><br />There are third-party wireless flash triggers and wireless shutter controls available that work with the camera and that are relatively inexpensive.  These help with portrait photography and low light photography and work nicely.  Don't buy the Leica SF24D flash to use with the Digilux 2. It's a fixed-head flash and is very expensive.  Panasonic and Metz make much better flash units for the same or less money that will work well.<br /><br />I would have given the camera five stars if it weren't for the price, and the fact that the sensor failed prematurely for such an expensive camera.  If Leica had not repaired the broken sensor free of charge, I would have given two stars at with a note that the camera would be a wonderful camera but would only work for about two years.  Hope you found this review helpful.<br /><br />12-15-08 Updated review:<br /><br />Leica took over 1 year to repair the broken sensor.  In fact, they lost my camera I sent in for repair and sent me another refurbished one.  Leica digital cameras and their service department are not ready for prime time.  I would change my star rating to 2 stars if I could and would suggest a potential buyer wait 3 or 4 years to see if Leica is still in business before spending money on their cameras.","Okay ----- many people have criticized me for buying a $1,400 digital camera, that is almost 2 years old and has only 5 megapixels<br /><br />they were wrong to criticize<br /><br />I ordered the camera about a week ago (early August, 2005) and just received it today ---- I have spent all day shooting with it, and I am deeply happy that I purchased it<br /><br />so let's go over pros and cons, etc -<br /><br />1. The Director in Us ---- Personally, I'm a filmmaker --- I'm not crazy about cinematography, and for me, I know enough about cameras to take it seriously, but at the end of the day, I see it as a personal hobby ------ this is OUR kind of camera ------ no interchangable lenses to deal with and complete manuel controls<br /><br />2. Lense ----- the lense is terrific, and Leica glass is awesome ---- I'm having a good time looking at all the pics I took over my iPhoto, and there a clear difference between my Nikon/Sony pics versus the Leica ----- however, as mentioned, the lense is NOT changable ------ for me, I like this because I'm not interested in carrying 5 lenses to a bunch of locations ------ but for true photographers, this is a problem - so keep that in mind<br /><br />3. RINGS!!!!!!! ----- Rings for ZOOM, Aperture, and FOCUS ---- I'm in hog heaven!!! There is nothing on this camera that isn't controlled manually, whether it be the rings, the shutter speed, or anything else ----- that is the best part!!!! With the exception of White Balance, I think everything is contolled by either a switch or a ring - which is neat!<br /><br />4. On Board Light Meter ------ the light meter here is adjustable and very accurate ---- I depended on it whenever I set the aperture, and was very pleased with the results ---- in addition, if you hate the pic, you can always erase it<br /><br />5. Stability ---- I shot all day in 4 fps and 2 fps shutter speed modes, and impressively, the camera never showed any blurred lines, provided that I held it still (however, I didn't have to stand like a statue)<br /><br />6. CloseUps ----- closeups were great ----- the focus could probably focus anything in front of me, probably anything that is farther than six inches or more<br /><br />7. BURST shooting ---- you can set the camera to shoot in bursts of 3 or 5 ---- this is a fun mode and works well with the camera<br /><br />8. FLASH ---- I can't stand digital cameras with flashes that are way too strong ---- the flash on this is simple, quick, and not very strong ---- but good enough to produce great imaging<br /><br />9. COMPRESSION ---- I took most of my pics in the LOWEST compression of JPEG, and they are beautiful -- most of them are less than one megabyte in size and very nice looking ---- in comparison, the high compression pics do look better, but there isn't much difference<br /><br />Are there cons? For some, one lense is a con, but not for me ------- I shot all my pics in JPEG (my fav format) but I hear that the RAW can be slow ---- when shooting in JPEG, the camera was very fast to write each pic and move on<br /><br />Don't let the 5 megapixel thing scare you ----- the pictures are gorgeous!<br /><br />I even tried the latest Rebel by Canon today, and I'm just glad that I picked the Leica<br /><br />Did I also mention that this camera just looks COOL too???<br /><br />I'm just having too much fun with all of the manual settings at my disposal<br /><br />Highly recommended for the Liebowitz in all of us!","My familiarity with this camera is limited to the information on amazon.com, so my observations should be taken as that of a spectator rather than a true critical review.  Nevertheless, we all make judgments as to purchases without actually handling the item, especially on-line.  This is based on the criteria I would apply if I were considering purchasing this item.<br /><br />I would expect a camera in the $1500 range to have more than a 3.2x optical zoom.  Cameras costing less than one-third of that now have up to 10x optical zoom.  3x optical zoom is rapidly being relegated to low-end or ultra-compact cameras, neither of which fits the Leica.  It is more in the price range of digital SLRs with interchangeable lenses, so I would expect a more powerful lens if there is no option to change it.","I am very much an amateur who had been using one of the older S series 2 megapixel  Canon Digital Elph cameras for several years. Recently, I decided to upgrade, and considered purchasing the 7 megapixel Power Shot S70 before instead opting to move not only up in megapixels but also over into the realm of true photography. After some careful research concerning the tools I'd need,I stepped up and bought a Digilux 2.<br /><br />In a word, it is awesome<br /><br />The bottom line here is that is that most amateurs who tote along a digital camera to take some pictures on holiday seem to think that megapixels are everything.<br /><br />This is a flawed mindset, for several reasons. First, assuming that all you want are some snapshots to serve as memories or to email to your friends and relatives, then a modestly priced 3 megapixel miniature model will serve quite nicely. Viewed on a typical computer screen or printed out as small pics, the subtlties of fidelity in image reproduction that pro and semi-pro reviewers go into on any of the plethora of available websites will typically go unnoticed to the rank amateur. If this is your cup of tea, then spending $1500+ for any digital camera, much less one with, gasp, ONLY 5 megapixels will seem and be totally unnecessary.<br /><br />But if it's photography you wish to persue, then realize first and foremost that unless you want to produce really large prints, provided you have a reasonable minimum of 4 megapixels or so, that image quality doesnt come from megapixels but from the photographer and the lens. All the megapixels in the universe can not and will not make up for the limitations of a mediocre or miniaturized lens (or a poor artist) After all, your system will ultimately always be limited by its weakest component.<br /><br />The best trained doctor cant perform quality microsurgery with a rusty butter knife, even if he is trying to do so in the world's highest tech operating room<br /><br />And when it comes to glass, Leica Summicron simply has no peer. Every digital camera I had ever worked with or whose output I had seen typically produced pictures that were somehow, \"soft\", is the best way to describe it. Until the Digilux 2. The color fidelity, sharpness, and overall OOMPH of the images produced by this lens are incomparable. I dont know the exact words to describe the technical reasons for this, but I suggest that if you are considering this camera, then find someone who has one, and take ANY prosumer level digital camera of your choice along and do side by side comparisons of pictures taken with the two. You'll either appreciate the difference or you wont. If you dont, then stop right here. If you do, you'll buy a Digilux 2 post-haste.I guarantee it!<br /><br />The pros -<br /><br />1.First and foremost, the lens and the incomparable image quality it renders.<br /><br />2.Next, the LCD. Most cameras have one that leaves you guessing at best as to what kind of picture you've REALLY taken. This one is big enough to not leave this to guesswork. The biggest overall advantage to digital photography is the ability to see what you've got and if need be, discard the pic and shoot again without having to wait for your developed film. This advantage is lost if your LCD leaves you guessing.<br /><br />3.Elegant and functional ergonomics, logical menus, and silky smooth (if occasionally frustratingly slow) operations. Traditionalists will immediately take to the, well, traditional, setting rings on the lens. Refined might be the best adjective to use here. The camera has a simple but stylish \"retro\" look and a solid and quality feel to the all the components including the body itself.<br /><br />4. The bounce flash feature is neat. Not $1500 neat in and of itself, but a nice touch that helps remind you of the difference between high end and the everyday<br /><br />The cons<br /><br />1.The lack of a RAW buffer means that the camera must finish writing one RAW file before you can shoot the next. Even with the fastest SD cards currently available, this means your rapid sequance capabilities will be rather severely limited in RAW mode (Figure 5 seconds or so between shots) Remember what I said about a system being limited by its worst component? This IS the Achilles heel of this camera IMHO.<br /><br />2. It's BIG. For someone used to the ease and unobtrusiveness of a pocket sized-miniature, I am still trying to find the best way to tote it around and not feel a little laden down.<br /><br />3. There are some hidden expenses. You can buy one from a Leica dealer at around $1500 delivered, but figure to be into the system for a little over $2000 when it's said and done<br /><br /> a.You'll need to spend some dough to buy two SD cards with the speed and capacity to do justice to this camera. At least 512, and better yet 1 Gig. One to use and a backup is worth the expense to ensure that a card malfunction doesnt ever shut you down for the day. And if you even think you might want to explore the possibilities of shooting RAW, you'll need a fast card like the Sandisk Ultra II or Extreme III, or you'll find that transfer times are way too long. Figure $150-$250 for two good fast cards<br /><br /> b. You will also want to buy a UV filter, if for nothing else than to protect that magnificent lens. Leica sizes are such that you cant expect to walk into any run-of-the-mill camera shop and find one (I actually had an employee of a well known retail chain look at me like I was from Mars when I told him I needed a 69mm filter, claiming that no such beast existed). Filters can be found of course, and can be had for $60 or $70, but if you want to go with Leica brand, it'll be $100-$120. Compare this to $15 or so for an off-brand filter in a more standard size.<br /><br />c. For macro work, you'll want a cable release to overcome the problem of camera shake. The Leica Cr-DC1 will run you $75-$90<br /><br />d. A small tripod ($20 or less for a table mount model) is money well spent.<br /><br />e. An extra Leica BP-DC1 battery for the same reason you carry an extra SD card - $30-$40<br /><br />f. An external flash unit for the more serious. The Leica SF-24D runs $250-$300<br /><br />g. A cardreader - The Digilux uses a standard size SD card. A one function reader can be as cheap as $10. One that has ports for any memory device currently available is around $35<br /><br />These little extras are individually trivial compared to the cost of the camera, but they do add up.<br /><br />On a side note, I dont personallly see much need for a digital wallet, or image tank, as they are otherwise known. Yes it's a backup copy of your images, but if you paranoid about losing pics to corrupted date files, you can usually find a copy shop or somesuch that'll burn your stuff to disc for $10 or so<br /><br />4. The electronic viewfinder is subpar compared to the rest of the camera. For those used to using one, it may well prove a disappoitment. I am used to lining up shots using the LCD, so to me, this is not a real issue, save to say that it wouldve been more aesthetically appealing if the rangefinder was of the same quality as the rest of the camera. If this would be a real issue for you, I'd suggest getting an accessory optical finder<br /><br />5.When in autofocus mode, it is very easy to inadvertantly and unknowingly slip it from normal to macro. This typically happens when zooming. A few ruined shots, and it'll be second nature to double check, but it's a pain in the behind<br /><br />6. That gigantic LCD? So big that it can be challenging to handle the camera without occasionally smudging the LCD with finger grease.<br /><br />7. Numerous reviews that I researched were about unanimous in their opinion that image quality was rather badly compromised by noise at ISO 400. I havent yet experimented with that setting<br /><br />8.Some might have an issue with the lack of lens interchangabiltiy in this price range. I for one am convinced, however, that one great lens beats a bagful of also-rans<br /><br />Originally through Dec 31, 2004, and then extended through the end of January, Leica had program whereby buying a new Digilux entitled you to send in for an extra battery and an external flash unit. The end of that deal corresponded almost exactly with a drop in retail price from the $1700-$1850 range to $1450-$1600. Basically, it's about a wash<br /><br />Some folks take issue with the fact that the camera is in fact produced in Japan, and that the electronics are made by Panasonic. To that I say, \"Big deal\" Remember, what you buying here is above all Leica quality glass - whether it's made by a guy who orders his dinner in German or Japanese isnt really important<br /><br />As for the version of this camera with the same combo of eletronics and lens but branded Panasonic? It's about $300 cheaper. You are very much paying for the little red dot. But bottom line, the two camera could be identical and yet when it comes to either resale value, collectability (if any digital cameras ever achieve that status) or just prestige - as illogical as it might seem to some, Leica has it, and Panasonic doesnt and wont. Some might argue with me, but I say if you're going to step this far up, then dont not take the last little step<br /><br />The competition? I suppose one could cite the Canon Digital Rebel, the Nikon D70, or the Panasonic brand version of the Digilux. Leica would of course say that they HAVE no competition. Follow my advice and take the time to do the legwork to track down a Digilux owner so you can try it out and do some side by side comparison. You'll either \"get it\" or you wont. Either way, your decision to buy or not buy will be clear cut.<br /><br />To sum it up, for the artist, great glass is at the root of outstanding pictures. If you understand this,it might well be the resson you havent yet gone digital. This issue is now moot, provided you can afford the privilege.<br /><br />Only 4 stars and not 5 because it does have a few equivalents of the cup-holders in a BMW<br /><br />As for this camera becoming obsolete. Advances in technology may forever expand the bounds of what is possible. When this happens, medicority becomes obsolete, and quickly. Quality on the other hand, will forever stand as a classic","This review is long past due.  The camera arrive on time and in perfect condition with the accessories and owners manual.  I love this camera.  Hands down my favourite of all time.  The photos it takes are warm and lovely.  Awesome seller; would definitely buy from these guys again.","I've copied my review below from the DMC-LC1 review I just published, since both cameras are extremely similar. The differences in aesthetics, grip, and minor button assignments are minimal, but give the interested party a clear choice. The Jpeg engine of this camera is ever so slightly tuned differently than the LC1, I'd sum up by saying it is more conservative in color saturation and yields slightly better detail. Other than that, they are the same.<br /><br />I've written extensively on this camera and the digilux 2 online on my own blog.<br /><br />This camera and the digilux 2 are considered true classic cameras, and a decade later they still do not disappoint the discerning photographer who embraces the foundation of principles and fundamentals that make photography a rewarding experience.<br /><br />This camera design is truly unique- one of a kind. Dismissed by the masses but embraced by a very niche group of photographers that desire a camera to be both a design first priority, and, a work of art- at the very same time.<br /><br />The lens of this camera, its manual controls, its bright aperture, internal zoom, build quality, and ultimately its excellent performance- are the heart of its lure and soul of its operation. The body style, and external controls compliment this lens design perfectly. Its size is both large enough to operate manually without being cramped, and small enough to be carried anywhere all day long without fatigue in any way.<br /><br />It's sensor is excellent still to this day, 5mp actually translates to the resolution output of many 10mp sensors because of how sharp this lens is. So don't be swayed by that specification. While this camera's operational speed is pedestrian compared to many of today's cameras, its that exact quality which endears it to owners of it. The mere fact that this camera in some ways is inadequate (compared to faster DSLRS) to a variety of shooting circumstances forces the photographer to think his/her way through the process. Thus a shot well done grants the photographer a proud achievement.<br /><br />This is in stark contrast to using a DSLR where shooting a burst of images with a blazing fast autofocus and burst rate yield one good image out of many.<br /><br />It's EVF and LCD are adequate, and with some practice can become intuitive to the shooters needs. The short range of ISO (compared to today's cameras) is also adequate considering the lens fast aperture, and the fact that it yields sharp images wide open. When you do the math you'll see that a comparable DSLR kit would need to use an ISO speed two stops or more higher than this camera to get the same shutter speed.<br /><br />The build quality of this camera, its handling, are first rate. Leica spearheaded its design (both cameras) and Panasonic provided the production capability and electronics. Don't be fooled into believing that this is a Panasonic design first and foremost. Its actually the other way around.<br /><br />This camera and its twin, continue to hold value extremely well. Most digital cameras end up in the trash bin and forgotten, discounted to oblivion, or end up collecting dust in a storage facility. Not the LC1 or Digilux 2.<br /><br />There is a reason for that.<br /><br />No amount of reading will make you understand the draw of this camera. If you like to think when you photograph, if you like to practice photography fundamentals, if you like perfect manual controls, then this camera is probably going to make you very happy.<br /><br />It's as perfect of a design as designs can get, especially for the time it was introduced.<br /><br />Carl","Ahead of it's time, only to be replaced today by the Fujifilm X-E1. I purchased this silent camera new and had issues only at the beginning and end of ownership. My 5mp images could print 16x20 on an Epson 4000 and impress the room, and was willing to wait for each RAW image to process. Traded in my Contax G2 for this Digilux (with mixed feelings but the G2 had an unfaithful viewfinder) but knew it was a step in the right direction. The first Digilux out of box had a bad shutter/on-off mechinism (Barnack turning over in grave). The second lasted me through A LOT of art school craziness, developed some dead pixels in the EVF, survived dropping/flipping between two rocks only to not survive the cold night with me in a tent on Donner Summit. Snow that morning looked beautiful on the cabin but the Digilux would not power up. After a warranty repair, I sold it still in it's plastic from the repair. \"Good-bye old paint, ...\" If it had 6-7mp then, I wouldn't have let go. After this was a swirl of mechanical Leica thread mounts from iiif's to Zorki's, and some SLR's one DSLR but nothing like this Digilux. I don't own a camera now and graduated without one using mostly the images made from this camera early in my college career. These images are still my most cherished compositions that could not be continued with future camera equipment that followed.

These help with portrait photography and low light photography and work nicely.  Don't buy the Leica SF24D flash to use with the Digilux 2. It's a fixed-head flash and is very expensive.  Panasonic and Metz make much better flash units for the same or less money that will work well.<br /><br />I would have given the camera five stars if it weren't for the price, and the fact that the sensor failed prematurely for such an expensive camera.  If Leica had not repaired the broken sensor free of charge, I would have given two stars at with a note that the camera would be a wonderful camera but would only work for about two years.  Hope you found this review helpful.<br /><br />12-15-08 Updated review:<br /><br />Leica took over 1 year to repair the broken sensor.  In fact, they lost my camera I sent in for repair and sent me another refurbished one.  Leica digital cameras and their service department are not ready for prime time.  I would change my star rating to 2 stars if I could and would suggest a potential buyer wait 3 or 4 years to see if Leica is still in business before spending money on their cameras.","Okay ----- many people have criticized me for buying a $1,400 digital camera, that is almost 2 years old and has only 5 megapixels<br /><br />they were wrong to criticize<br /><br />I ordered the camera about a week ago (early August, 2005) and just received it today ---- I have spent all day shooting with it, and I am deeply happy that I purchased it<br /><br />so let's go over pros and cons, etc -<br /><br />1. The Director in Us ---- Personally, I'm a filmmaker --- I'm not crazy about cinematography, and for me, I know enough about cameras to take it seriously, but at the end of the day, I see it as a personal hobby ------ this is OUR kind of camera ------ no interchangable lenses to deal with and complete manuel controls<br /><br />2. Lense ----- the lense is terrific, and Leica glass is awesome ---- I'm having a good time looking at all the pics I took over my iPhoto, and there a clear difference between my Nikon/Sony pics versus the Leica ----- however, as mentioned, the lense is NOT changable ------ for me, I like this because I'm not interested in carrying 5 lenses to a bunch of locations ------ but for true photographers, this is a problem - so keep that in mind<br /><br />3. RINGS!!!!!!! ----- Rings for ZOOM, Aperture, and FOCUS ---- I'm in hog heaven!!! There is nothing on this camera that isn't controlled manually, whether it be the rings, the shutter speed, or anything else ----- that is the best part!!!! With the exception of White Balance, I think everything is contolled by either a switch or a ring - which is neat!<br /><br />4. On Board Light Meter ------ the light meter here is adjustable and very accurate ---- I depended on it whenever I set the aperture, and was very pleased with the results ---- in addition, if you hate the pic, you can always erase it<br /><br />5. Stability ---- I shot all day in 4 fps and 2 fps shutter speed modes, and impressively, the camera never showed any blurred lines, provided that I held it still (however, I didn't have to stand like a statue)<br /><br />6. CloseUps ----- closeups were great ----- the focus could probably focus anything in front of me, probably anything that is farther than six inches or more<br /><br />7. BURST shooting ---- you can set the camera to shoot in bursts of 3 or 5 ---- this is a fun mode and works well with the camera<br /><br />8. FLASH ---- I can't stand digital cameras with flashes that are way too strong ---- the flash on this is simple, quick, and not very strong ---- but good enough to produce great imaging<br /><br />9. COMPRESSION ---- I took most of my pics in the LOWEST compression of JPEG, and they are beautiful -- most of them are less than one megabyte in size and very nice looking ---- in comparison, the high compression pics do look better, but there isn't much difference<br /><br />Are there cons? For some, one lense is a con, but not for me ------- I shot all my pics in JPEG (my fav format) but I hear that the RAW can be slow ---- when shooting in JPEG, the camera was very fast to write each pic and move on<br /><br />Don't let the 5 megapixel thing scare you ----- the pictures are gorgeous!<br /><br />I even tried the latest Rebel by Canon today, and I'm just glad that I picked the Leica<br /><br />Did I also mention that this camera just looks COOL too???<br /><br />I'm just having too much fun with all of the manual settings at my disposal<br /><br />Highly recommended for the Liebowitz in all of us!","My familiarity with this camera is limited to the information on amazon.com, so my observations should be taken as that of a spectator rather than a true critical review.  Nevertheless, we all make judgments as to purchases without actually handling the item, especially on-line.  This is based on the criteria I would apply if I were considering purchasing this item.<br /><br />I would expect a camera in the $1500 range to have more than a 3.2x optical zoom.  Cameras costing less than one-third of that now have up to 10x optical zoom.  3x optical zoom is rapidly being relegated to low-end or ultra-compact cameras, neither of which fits the Leica.  It is more in the price range of digital SLRs with interchangeable lenses, so I would expect a more powerful lens if there is no option to change it.","I am very much an amateur who had been using one of the older S series 2 megapixel  Canon Digital Elph cameras for several years. Recently, I decided to upgrade, and considered purchasing the 7 megapixel Power Shot S70 before instead opting to move not only up in megapixels but also over into the realm of true photography. After some careful research concerning the tools I'd need,I stepped up and bought a Digilux 2.<br /><br />In a word, it is awesome<br /><br />The bottom line here is that is that most amateurs who tote along a digital camera to take some pictures on holiday seem to think that megapixels are everything.<br /><br />This is a flawed mindset, for several reasons. First, assuming that all you want are some snapshots to serve as memories or to email to your friends and relatives, then a modestly priced 3 megapixel miniature model will serve quite nicely. Viewed on a typical computer screen or printed out as small pics, the subtlties of fidelity in image reproduction that pro and semi-pro reviewers go into on any of the plethora of available websites will typically go unnoticed to the rank amateur. If this is your cup of tea, then spending $1500+ for any digital camera, much less one with, gasp, ONLY 5 megapixels will seem and be totally unnecessary.<br /><br />But if it's photography you wish to persue, then realize first and foremost that unless you want to produce really large prints, provided you have a reasonable minimum of 4 megapixels or so, that image quality doesnt come from megapixels but from the photographer and the lens. All the megapixels in the universe can not and will not make up for the limitations of a mediocre or miniaturized lens (or a poor artist) After all, your system will ultimately always be limited by its weakest component.<br /><br />The best trained doctor cant perform quality microsurgery with a rusty butter knife, even if he is trying to do so in the world's highest tech operating room<br /><br />And when it comes to glass, Leica Summicron simply has no peer. Every digital camera I had ever worked with or whose output I had seen typically produced pictures that were somehow, \"soft\", is the best way to describe it. Until the Digilux 2. The color fidelity, sharpness, and overall OOMPH of the images produced by this lens are incomparable. I dont know the exact words to describe the technical reasons for this, but I suggest that if you are considering this camera, then find someone who has one, and take ANY prosumer level digital camera of your choice along and do side by side comparisons of pictures taken with the two. You'll either appreciate the difference or you wont. If you dont, then stop right here. If you do, you'll buy a Digilux 2 post-haste.I guarantee it!<br /><br />The pros -<br /><br />1.First and foremost, the lens and the incomparable image quality it renders.<br /><br />2.Next, the LCD. Most cameras have one that leaves you guessing at best as to what kind of picture you've REALLY taken. This one is big enough to not leave this to guesswork. The biggest overall advantage to digital photography is the ability to see what you've got and if need be, discard the pic and shoot again without having to wait for your developed film. This advantage is lost if your LCD leaves you guessing.<br /><br />3.Elegant and functional ergonomics, logical menus, and silky smooth (if occasionally frustratingly slow) operations. Traditionalists will immediately take to the, well, traditional, setting rings on the lens. Refined might be the best adjective to use here. The camera has a simple but stylish \"retro\" look and a solid and quality feel to the all the components including the body itself.<br /><br />4. The bounce flash feature is neat. Not $1500 neat in and of itself, but a nice touch that helps remind you of the difference between high end and the everyday<br /><br />The cons<br /><br />1.The lack of a RAW buffer means that the camera must finish writing one RAW file before you can shoot the next. Even with the fastest SD cards currently available, this means your rapid sequance capabilities will be rather severely limited in RAW mode (Figure 5 seconds or so between shots) Remember what I said about a system being limited by its worst component? This IS the Achilles heel of this camera IMHO.<br /><br />2. It's BIG. For someone used to the ease and unobtrusiveness of a pocket sized-miniature, I am still trying to find the best way to tote it around and not feel a little laden down.<br /><br />3. There are some hidden expenses. You can buy one from a Leica dealer at around $1500 delivered, but figure to be into the system for a little over $2000 when it's said and done<br /><br /> a.You'll need to spend some dough to buy two SD cards with the speed and capacity to do justice to this camera. At least 512, and better yet 1 Gig. One to use and a backup is worth the expense to ensure that a card malfunction doesnt ever shut you down for the day. And if you even think you might want to explore the possibilities of shooting RAW, you'll need a fast card like the Sandisk Ultra II or Extreme III, or you'll find that transfer times are way too long. Figure $150-$250 for two good fast cards<br /><br /> b. You will also want to buy a UV filter, if for nothing else than to protect that magnificent lens. Leica sizes are such that you cant expect to walk into any run-of-the-mill camera shop and find one (I actually had an employee of a well known retail chain look at me like I was from Mars when I told him I needed a 69mm filter, claiming that no such beast existed). Filters can be found of course, and can be had for $60 or $70, but if you want to go with Leica brand, it'll be $100-$120. Compare this to $15 or so for an off-brand filter in a more standard size.<br /><br />c. For macro work, you'll want a cable release to overcome the problem of camera shake. The Leica Cr-DC1 will run you $75-$90<br /><br />d. A small tripod ($20 or less for a table mount model) is money well spent.<br /><br />e. An extra Leica BP-DC1 battery for the same reason you carry an extra SD card - $30-$40<br /><br />f. An external flash unit for the more serious. The Leica SF-24D runs $250-$300<br /><br />g. A cardreader - The Digilux uses a standard size SD card. A one function reader can be as cheap as $10. One that has ports for any memory device currently available is around $35<br /><br />These little extras are individually trivial compared to the cost of the camera, but they do add up.<br /><br />On a side note, I dont personallly see much need for a digital wallet, or image tank, as they are otherwise known. Yes it's a backup copy of your images, but if you paranoid about losing pics to corrupted date files, you can usually find a copy shop or somesuch that'll burn your stuff to disc for $10 or so<br /><br />4. The electronic viewfinder is subpar compared to the rest of the camera. For those used to using one, it may well prove a disappoitment. I am used to lining up shots using the LCD, so to me, this is not a real issue, save to say that it wouldve been more aesthetically appealing if the rangefinder was of the same quality as the rest of the camera. If this would be a real issue for you, I'd suggest getting an accessory optical finder<br /><br />5.When in autofocus mode, it is very easy to inadvertantly and unknowingly slip it from normal to macro. This typically happens when zooming. A few ruined shots, and it'll be second nature to double check, but it's a pain in the behind<br /><br />6. That gigantic LCD? So big that it can be challenging to handle the camera without occasionally smudging the LCD with finger grease.<br /><br />7. Numerous reviews that I researched were about unanimous in their opinion that image quality was rather badly compromised by noise at ISO 400. I havent yet experimented with that setting<br /><br />8.Some might have an issue with the lack of lens interchangabiltiy in this price range. I for one am convinced, however, that one great lens beats a bagful of also-rans<br /><br />Originally through Dec 31, 2004, and then extended through the end of January, Leica had program whereby buying a new Digilux entitled you to send in for an extra battery and an external flash unit. The end of that deal corresponded almost exactly with a drop in retail price from the $1700-$1850 range to $1450-$1600. Basically, it's about a wash<br /><br />Some folks take issue with the fact that the camera is in fact produced in Japan, and that the electronics are made by Panasonic. To that I say, \"Big deal\" Remember, what you buying here is above all Leica quality glass - whether it's made by a guy who orders his dinner in German or Japanese isnt really important<br /><br />As for the version of this camera with the same combo of eletronics and lens but branded Panasonic? It's about $300 cheaper. You are very much paying for the little red dot. But bottom line, the two camera could be identical and yet when it comes to either resale value, collectability (if any digital cameras ever achieve that status) or just prestige - as illogical as it might seem to some, Leica has it, and Panasonic doesnt and wont. Some might argue with me, but I say if you're going to step this far up, then dont not take the last little step<br /><br />The competition? I suppose one could cite the Canon Digital Rebel, the Nikon D70, or the Panasonic brand version of the Digilux. Leica would of course say that they HAVE no competition. Follow my advice and take the time to do the legwork to track down a Digilux owner so you can try it out and do some side by side comparison. You'll either \"get it\" or you wont. Either way, your decision to buy or not buy will be clear cut.<br /><br />To sum it up, for the artist, great glass is at the root of outstanding pictures. If you understand this,it might well be the resson you havent yet gone digital. This issue is now moot, provided you can afford the privilege.<br /><br />Only 4 stars and not 5 because it does have a few equivalents of the cup-holders in a BMW<br /><br />As for this camera becoming obsolete. Advances in technology may forever expand the bounds of what is possible. When this happens, medicority becomes obsolete, and quickly. Quality on the other hand, will forever stand as a classic","The Leica Digilux 2 is one of the best digital cameras on the market, if not the best. The fact that you could operate the camera manually makes it an excellent tool for learning photography. It is an expensive camera but worth the price. Many old school Leica purists have also switched to Digilux 2. It has been such a pleasure using the camera.<br /><br />The positive:<br /><br />+Classic retro design; a delicate balance between old & new technology<br /><br />+The Lens is just simply amazing, sharp like a razor<br /><br />+Images are comparable to film<br /><br />+User-friendly digital interface and buttons<br /><br />+LCD display is large, bright and clear<br /><br />+Battery life is long enough for hours of shooting<br /><br />+Built-in flash & bounce mode<br /><br />+Camera has a fluid, dynamic feel in hands<br /><br />+Leica strap is included<br /><br />The negative:<br /><br />-Expensive<br /><br />-Camera life span & value over time are questionable<br /><br />-RAW mode might be too slow for some users","31 DEC 04:  Let me preface this review with a little personal history.  I have been taking photographs for 53 years and ran a part-time wedding photography business for 24 years.  I fought the change to digital for years, but finally succumbed in 2002.  Since that time, I have never looked back.  The Digilux 2 is my sixth digital camera and I can honestly say it takes better photographs than any of my other cameras, including my Nikon D-100.  The Nikon is more flexible, with interchangable lenses, but the Leica is much more portable and intuitive.<br /><br />Some might complain that the camera is \"only\" a five megapixel unit.  But, there are megapixels and there are megapixels....not all are created equal.  The CCD on the Digilux 2 is very large, providing larger megapixels.  This solves a lot of problems currently being experienced by high-megapixel \"pro-sumer\" cameras and creates stunning photographs.<br /><br />Having used range-finders and other \"analog\" cameras for many years, the Leica is like an old friend.  There is no other digital camera on the market that is easier to use, when switching from \"automatic\" to manual or shutter/f-stop priority.  This camera is usable by everyone, from a beginner (just go \"full auto\", until you learn more about the camera's capabilities) to a professional.<br /><br />The Digilux 2 is built like a tank and will stand years of service and abuse.  The LCD is HUGE, as well as being the clearest and brightest I have ever seen.  It's usable even in bright sunlight.  The built-in straight or bounce flash capability is extremely useful.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Leica should have made the switch from \"Autofocus\" to \"Autofocus-Macro\" a little stiffer.  It's easy to move the switch and not be aware that you have done so (if you set the display to show the switch position, it is easy to check through the viewfinder before you take the shot).  With all the other things going for it, I will not let that minor thing keep me from giving the camera a full five stars.<br /><br />If you can afford it, the Digilux 2 will serve you well for many years.<br /><br />UPDATE (5 JAN 05):  Now that I have used this camera for a longer period of time, I would like to add some additional thoughts/information, based on that usage.  (1) Because of the weight, configuration, minimum shutter lag, and lack of \"monkey motion\" (flipping mirrors, etc.), it is extremely easy to hand-hold the Digilux 2 at low shutter speeds that would be impossible with digital SLRs or most other digital cameras.  Check out the sample photos on this site, many of them taken hand-held at 1/20th - 1/25th sec. (2) The depth-of-field is amazing, even at F-2.0.  (3) The \"out-of-the-camera color is the best of any digital camera I have ever owned or used, including top-of-the-line SLRs.  (4) The custom white balance settings are quick, easy, and spot on.  (5) The tonal values, when the camera is set on B&W are outstanding.  (6) Contrast is also outstanding.  BOTTOM LINE:  I am in love!.<br />UPDATE 2 MAR 05:  Check out the two new photos I have added.  The landscape photo has been enlarged to 16 x 20 by a custom shop the level of detail is incredible (even the horses at the bottom right of the photo have amazing detail).  This camera has an OUTSTANDING lens/sensor combination.","I read every review I could find of the Leica D2 and still had qualms about buying one.  Having received it and used it, I can now say that it was the right purchase.  Others have commented on the D2's outstanding picture quality (don't go by the number of megapixels alone, the quality of the lens is at least as important).  What I'll add is that the D2's lens is so fast that you can take almost any reasonably lit indoor picture without using the flash -- a major plus for natural-looking pictures.  I'm not as impressed by the ergonomics of Leica's traditional brick-with-a-lens shape as other reviewers, but the ease of use and solid feel of all of the controls more than make up for that.<br /><br />The key point is that within the first half-hour of using the D2, I was paying more attention to the pictures I was taking than to the camera itself -- which is what I imagine Leica had in mind when they designed this great camera.  Is the D2 worth what it costs?  Not if you would only take it out of the drawer for holiday and vacation snapshots.  But, if you are the kind of photographer who often grabs the camera on the way out the door just to take pictures, it is well worth the price.  You will enjoy using it every time you pick it up.","as a 'dyed-in-the-wool' traditional film camera enthusiast (and having owned and used nikon, leica, canon and olympus slrs and view finders), i strongly resisted for the longest time 'going digital'...that is to say, until the leica digilux2 came along...<br />i am now a confirmed digital convert, and can say that the quality of images rendered from the digilux2, when compared to the photos rendered from my film cameras and in the absence of investing in my own film processing studio, will make the new leica a preferred choice for many years to come, and notwithstanding the 5 megapixel sensoring....","Sure, the Nikon 5400 is capable of similar pictures, at least in ideal situations, if you have the time to fight your way through its menus.  But what makes the Leica d-2 the best camera currently available is its ease of use, the brilliant design of every knob and lever.  Whatever you want to do, this camera can do it, simply, logically, and quickly.  Bottom line:  if you're rich, this is the best camera currently available.  If you're poor, other digital cameras offer similar performance for a third of the price as long as you're willing to deal with their confused, convoluted, time-consuming menus and controls.","To the person that mentioned the Leica Digilux 2 will be obsolete in 2 years, I'm sure many luddites don't like digital photography.  Get used to it as it's here to stay.  The Leica Digilux 2, and its sister Panasonic Lumix DMC LC-1, are the best digital rangefinder cameras, I think.  I like the fact that it has both a fully automatic position or an immediate manual setting.  As for price, buy the Panasonic considering it's identical (Leica Digilux 2 was developed in conjunction with Panasonic).  I've seen the Panasonic as low as $1200.  Either way, both are fantastic!","AESTHETICS: The Leica Digilux 2 can be described as a modern \"retro\" design. The body style is a direct descendant of the M6 and those before it. The body looks huge. It is about 33% larger than an M6, but this isn't readily apparent until you set it next to any Leica M chassis. There is a gaudy overabundance of faux chrome in the back. This is the least appealing part of the camera, because of the chrome finish that surrounds and accentuates the presence of the LCD monitor.  I would have preferred a more predominant use of either a black finish or the faux leather.  The rubber around the eyepiece is bulbous, but acceptable. Overall, it is a handsome camera.<br /><br />ERGONOMICS: What sold me are the traditional manual adjustments:  The focusing ring, the aperture ring, zoom adjustment, and shutter speed dial are so much more workable in the field. You do not have to take your eye away from the viewfinder like you would with touch pads and four-way rocker switches.  Leave that for reviewing the recorded images. The box construction has the familiar feel of an M body, but weighs less. The \"grippy\" black rubber finish is handsome and remotely resembles leather. The flash has two positions: press halfway and it will set up for bounce flash. Press all the way down, and it will point directly towards the subject.<br /><br />PRACTICALITIES: At the average price of about $1850 U.S. dollars, one would have to factor in the name.  But also figure in the build quality. There is the magnesium body, real metal hinges on the doors (which are designed beautifully), traditional aperture ring, manual & auto focusing, shutter speed dial, superior image processing (for markedly lower noise levels than the competition), aspherical Summicron lens, larger than average lcd monitor; and a few more, but the general impression is that it's built well.  The baseplate is bare, but there are three 1/8\" diameter round rubber feet, and one round plastic foot that is molded out of the battery door itself. Attention to small details are what I like about the Leica. For example, the camera strap also comes with two leatherette scuff protectors that fit around the camera strap eyelets. And not only is a lens cap included, but a lens cap for the lens shade.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE:  The photographs are the bottom line.  The images and image quality are on par with the pro-level dslr's. There is a real Summicron aboard this camera, and of it, I rest assured.  There are and will be cameras with higher pixel counts, but I've come to realize that if most of my photographs will be printed smaller than 11\" x 14,\" then I am not lacking with the five megapixels. I've compared identical images side by side with images from my Olympus C8080, and the Digilux 2's images can almost qualify as 8 megapixel images!! Magnify both the C8080 & the Digilux 2's images to 200%, and the Leica wins convincingly. This is not a point-and-shoot, as most would regard it as such. It can be set up for that if you wish, but the manual focusing, aperture and shutter adjustments make the D2 a capable tool for anybody who pursues photography seriously.","This is classic Leica:  Fantastic Colors, unbelievable contrast, and stunning pictures for even a novice!  There is no comparison to the pictures that come from this camera.  If you have ever seen Leica rangefinder slides, this is the digital equivalent.  They do something in the glass that no one else can duplicate. This camera will make your shots look like they were shot by a pro. The first picture I took was of my 3 year-old son looking up at me when I was sitting in a chair.  The cherub like quality of the image and the color in his skin tones it incredible. He had a red shirt on, and the color was perfect.  It is amazing.","Having used both Canon and Leica film cameras for years, I moved to digital first with a Canon S40 which took surprisingly good pictures, but I always missed 28mm wide angle capability. So had been thinking of getting a DSLR (e.g. Nikon D100) for a while but quite simply liked the aesthetic appeal of a Leica but in digital format (Digilux 1 was just too weak). Made the jump to the Digilux 2 for a number of reasons - slightly smaller than a DSLR, Leica lens (speed and sharpness), image contrast and definition, look and feel. Despite the hurdle of the expense - and it is comparably expensive - this is an awesome camera. For sure, you could technically get more quality/value per se in a DSLR for same price or less but is just isn't the same as the feel of the Leica. This is really the first time in the digital space that I feels like I'm using a \"real\" camera again.<br />Pro's :<br />- Fast extremely high quality lens<br />- Wonderful and intuitive manual-like controls for good \"flow\"<br />- Unless you're into action photography the RAW write lock times on a fast SD card (e.g. Sandisk Ultra II) is hardly noticable.<br />- Large LCD screen for good previews<br />- Actually not a bad EVF - despite what some of the reviews have said.<br />Cons:<br />- Expensive for what it is. Personally, I think it's worth an extra few 100 bucks for the feel of this camera..just makes you want to take more pictures.<br />- Supplied software, especially RAW conversion is terrible. Only practial way to do RAW properly is with raw plug-in for Photoshop  CS<br />- RAW mode also stores a JPEG on the card, which is odd. It's useful in that you can preview stuff quicker, although with CS file browser you can do this anyway. Downside is it takes up space.","Extremely high picture quality and the handling of a traditional camera. A great buy."]}]
