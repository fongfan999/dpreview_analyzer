I love the clarity and quality of the pictures. I also love that there is no delay when I press the button to take the pictures as I wanted to photograph my 3 young children.","Excellent camera but was very disappointed that there was no mention up front that it did not come with any memory card at all.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and realized there was no memory card and not only did I have to charge the battery, but had to take the time to go out and spend extra money for a card.","Camera works great, the wireless functionality and the app for my phone is great! I can take pictures remotely without having to worry about the timer haha. Really neat, great product!","I am still checking out this camera. There are two things I hadn't anticipated, 1) the camera has no viewfinder and 2) it only uses a rechargeable battery.  These things may seem petty but in reference to #1 above, there are times when a viewfinder or eyepiece serves better than a monitor screen - especially in bright sunlight. The lack of the ability to use off-the-shelf batters, i.e. AA or AAA also requires that a back-up battery is needed - adding to the expense of the product and eliminating a means of saving an event in case a rechargeable battery in unavailable or is too weak to cover an event.","Takes great pics for a \"bridge\" camera from macro to landscape. Could use a better and more versatile viewfinder.","Then camera is light and convenient to use.  The manual could use more details, like most of them.  I prefer an eyepiece to look through rather than relying on the digital screen.  Sunny days are very hard to see what you are going to photograph.  The light weight of the camera is great.","I love this camera! It's everything I wanted! Brings things right up to where I feel I can almost touch it!

My advice is to move up to the SX720 so you don't need a separate battery and can recharge overnight with whatever you use for your phone or other devices.  There is no AC adapter I'm aware of either, so even when shooting indoors in the same place, it'll need an extra battery to swap in and you'll also have to keep up with the external battery charger and be constantly swapping the battery in/out at least daily when you are using this camera.  (That was a deal-breaker for me, this is a compact!  If I had the room for the special charger and the extra battery--I'd just get a cheap D-SLR!)<br /><br />Otherwise, it does take good 'canon' pictures and the image stabilization is fast and good too.  Auto gets nearly 99.5% of my shots perfect.  For the price class, low light performance is great.  (people that say it is poor are used to $800+ cameras)  If you can tolerate the nutty battery strategy (canon thinks this is 1980 and this is the only battery powered thing we carry), this is a great deal compared to the competition and the SX720.  Being able to use your camera as a remote trigger (and you can setup/zoom shots from your mobile and use your phone as a viewfinder with canon's app!) and able to pull pics to your mobile is great too.  Canon got a lot right with this one, but the battery strategy, like I said earlier, was unacceptable to me.","Good camera for those who want more than the i-Phones and i-Pads can provide.

I am not knowledgeable in regards to the settings such as iso, etc and have only used this on automatic mode, but have gotten so great pictures. The zoom is fantastic, crisp and clear. Can't wait for nicer weather so I can shoot more outdoors.","About every two to three years I buy a \"pocket camera\" to use in our worldwide travels.  I find that after that time, carrying in my pocket, I have worn them all out.  The quality of the Canon pictures and videos taken, particularly without a flash, even when in very low ambient light, is outstanding.  That is, for pics, not so much for HD videos.  The video is excellent with good lighting.  The Canon brand is proving to be better than the other popular brand I have purchased the last three times.<br />All photos and video far surpass anything I can take with a highly rated most popular cell phone.  I use the phone to make phone calls, e-mails, and texting.","This is an awesome camera","Good camera, great optical zoom, high picture resolution.","It works as expected. Light and easy to use. Had one similar without wifi but now I can easily move pictures from camera to my smartphone. Recommended.","Great product and price.","This is not my first Canon PowerShot camera. For me they are one of the best point and shoots out there. My only complaint is the low light picture quality. Fine with flash, but I rarely am free to use the flash so some of my indoor shots are compromised.","Very good quality product and delivered on date promised. I highly recommend this product and this seller.","Very nice camera! The zoom is great! Wifi transfers pictures was quite simple","great camera, for small carry, and functionality.","Very nice camera.  It's a gift for my wfe, and it fts perfectly in the camera pouch in her purse ... which is a real plus.","This camera lives up to expectations, and has provided reliable photo shots in all kinds of conditions with the telephoto capability we were hoping for.  I recommend the camera as a good basic camera for us amateurs with features and options that provide plenty of room for learning.<br /><br />Dan Wilson","Returned after a couple of days. I didn't want to keep something that I didn't feel good last. I only took a couple of pictures. For me the issue was the camera itself felt extremely cheap. Super lightweight. I felt as though if it dropped once it would be over.","Easy to use","The zoom is SPECTACULAR!","We've had several Canon PowerShot cameras over the years. This takes excellent photos but has lots of features that are a bit excessive in most cases. It would have been nice for Canon to stick with the same battery profile, but I suppose the needed to generate more revenue.","The camera is great!","Extremely happy with so far in the short term. Only had it since Christmas","This Camera is great for vlogging especially outside","After wife uses it, then I'll tell you if it was any good.  After Christmas and then a few months.","Very nice and handy size camera.  It takes good photos and easy peasy to link to my smart phone.  A little more complicated to link to a pc but I found a video.  I probably won't use the wifi option because I take a lot pics in one session and it is faster just do plug the SD card in to the laptop.<br />Here is the link for PC connectivity:  [...]","I love this camera","I got this camera to replace my SX-280 which was stolen. Amazon suggested this as the \"newer model\" of the same camera. My two main requirements are shooting pictures for my food blog (Canon's color temperature is just right for this, across their product line) and taking movies and telephoto stills of kid sporting events. For the latter, it's a plus that the zoom is 25x vs 20x for the 280. (By the way, whenever I get a new camera I immediately turn off the digital zoom. You don't need that extra noise in your picture. Just use the optical zoom and, if you need to get in closer, you can edit your photo after the fact.)<br /><br />The reason this review is three stars is that Canon made the terrible decision to remove the settings wheel on the back of the camera (used to toggle back and forth between auto mode, shutter priority, aperture priority etc) and move those settings several levels deep on the onscreen functions menu. There's a lot of good stuff there--there is now a fisheye mode, for example--but you'll have to shoot with the manual at your side to make use of them. The 280 was a point-and-shoot that had additional functionality readily available if you needed it. This is still a good point and shoot, but I am afraid most folks (including me) are not going to make the considerable effort to train themselves in the more complex features.<br /><br />Also, I was hoping I would be able to use the wireless, which never worked for me on the 280. Unfortunately I am on the Apple platform. There is no software available for my OS (10.11) and the touch-and-transfer technology is for Android only. It would be great to wirelessly send photos to my PC, but I can't do that.<br /><br />UPDATE: after spending some time with the manual, I discovered that Canon has actually removed the Aperture priority and Shutter priority features entirely. Instead, you have to choose one of many special programs such as \"Nighttime Handheld\" which give limited ability to control settings. If you liked the idea of using a very low aperture so only part of your picture is in focus (for example) that's no longer a choice for you.","I love it! Very handy and light to carry around on my Europe trip did the works!","This 82 year old is trying to learn :)  Kodak of many years stopped working.  Professional children and grandchildren could help m<br />but none live near.<br />Living by the woods the zoom is perfect when I learn exactly how to use.<br />Sorry I need some personal instruction.<br />My son in Thailand has this camera and on his next visit he will tutor is mom<br />Good - my memory card in Kodak fit camera, also cable for Verizon account and went to Radio Shack<br />and bought another cable for $20.<br />Wish image of part names was larger<br />but I am taking to copying store to have a larger image to help me.","I couldn't believe my eyes; this is a very nice camera.  I had second thoughts but glad I bought it because this is a good investment.","A gift for our daughter. She loves all the features.","Great pictures!","I needed a small, point-and-shoot for times that I didn't want to lug around my Canon DSLR.  This PowerShot fit the bill perfectly!  It's lightweight and easy to carry but includes a 25X optical zoom.  The colors in Auto mode generally turn out very well, much better than a similarly priced Nikon point-and-shoot that I bought a year ago.  I do notice that when zoomed past about 15X the focus can sometimes be a little soft, but it's still more than good enough for vacation snapshots.  Besides, if I need high-quality pictures that can be enlarged, I usually use my DSLR.  Great camera and a pretty good price for what you get.","Great little camera!","The camera works well and has a great zoom capability. The autofocus is fast but not as accurate as my SX610. It miss-focuses more often than the SX610, when sighted on the same object at the same zoom level. Also the SX610 will focus on an object at a noticeably higher zoom level than the SX620 will, on the same object from the same distance. This was tested using only optical zoom, digital zoom turned off.)<br /><br />The SX620 is slightly smaller and takes a different battery than the SX610. Aside from the focus issues mentioned above, I like the camera and after having thought about it for awhile, decided to keep it.","Very user friendly with a smaller compact battery.  This is a relatively low cost point and shoot.  There are times a digital camera just out-does the smart phone and this meets those needs.","This camera was purchased as a replacement for a Canon PowerShot SD 770 IS. It was more expensive, yet it has a \"cheap\" feel to it.  Everything about it feels more lightweight and \"plasticky.\"  I am frustrated that I must manually move a button to activate the flash. Just when I am about to take a photo, a message may appear indicating that I should activate the flash.  By the time I find the right button and slide it, the moment is lost for the photo I may have wanted to capture.  Really? In this day and age, why can't the flash pop up automatically?  The flash on my former Canon SC 770 was activated automatically, and I never had to give it a second thought!  In my opinion, this Canon camera has been cheapened, and I do not enjoy using it.  I have not had a chance to print any of the photos that I have taken, so I can't comment on the photo quality.","Disappointed I can't use via computer.  Wanted to capture animals from my computer using the camera in another room.  Documentation implied I could but have found no App to allow me to do so.  So effectively just another camera!!","I have had this camera for a few weeks and have loved it so far!  The zoom is great!  My pictures have come out crystal clear, even when my kids are moving as I take them!  It is certainly not a professional camera, I have one of those too, but is great for travel!  I bought this camera primarily to take on vacations when my other camera is too big and bulky.  The size of this one is perfect and the features are great for what I need!  I have figured out how to post pictures to Facebook from the camera which is a cool little feature!  My friends have all asked which camera I have after seeing those pics as they have come out so clear!  So far I love this camera!","I purchased the SX620 as a pocket camera for special events, traveling, and so forth. The camera is quite easy to use and provides decent photos with very little effort. For the novice photographer, it is a great camera. If you simply need a simple camera for weddings, museums, galleries, parties, insurance claims, and those sorts of things, this is a nice camera to have on hand. The camera is a decent size, not too small, but also not too large. You can easily carry this camera in a jacket pocket, but it might be bulky for trousers. I did purchase an extra battery and extra memory card, which both came in useful during a casual day of shooting photos. The camera is still new, but I have had Canon cameras for years and count on their reliability and craftsmanship. You do have to get used to the flash not being automatic, as the user has to raise the flash manually. The quality of the photographs is great! For the cost, to include accessories, it is quite a good camera!"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot SX420 IS","amazon_reviews":["Love this camera. In particular the manual option.

I assume that the more expensive cameras are better but this one will be fine for hiking and vacations.","The zoom is amazing but the photo quality is not that great.","I am an artist who needed a simple new camera for my colorful artwork (and for personal nature hike photos). I have used the camera for a couple of weeks now (still figuring out some of the settings), but I am super happy with it so far.

I am really pleased that the self-timer will remain ON from shot to shot instead of having to re-set every time - very handy! The length of the lens takes a bit of getting used to, but I do like the way this feels in my hand compared to a rectangular point-and-shoot. The largest image resolution is HUGE and will yield crisp prints at a smaller size. I am very glad I ultimately chose this Canon PowerShot SX420 out of the literally dozens of cameras I researched over a month's time!

I am, IN NO WAY, associated with Canon, the Seller or their partners/affiliates and I am NOT required to do this review. I may relate my opinions during this review, but they are simply that... my own opinions and are not meant to coerce anyone into buying this product. I hate having to do this, but I do a lot of reviews and want everyone to know that my reviews are Honest, Unbiased, and Factual (you can thank Amazon for this Disclaimer being on every review that I do now).<br /><br />Why only four (4) stars? The LCD isn't as crisp looking as the actual Pictures and Videos really are and the Function/MENU settings are a bit cumbersome to learn (i.e. When/where they can be used as well as learning what options are available when using them).<br /><br />GETTING STARTED:<br />Before buying this camera I would suggest that you download the User Manual to familiarize yourself with the Features and Functions of this camera. Also, this camera doesn't come with a SD card, nor does it have internal memory to store your pictures and videos, so you will need to purchase one before you are able to use this camera.<br /><br />The first thing you will need to do is charge the battery using the included charger. Make sure to line up the Triangles when inserting the battery into the charger base and then plug it in to a power source (depending on which charger you have, USB or wall, will dictate your power source).<br /><br />While the battery is charging, take a moment and insert your SD Card. Make sure to insert it correctly so as not to damage your memory card or camera - the metal contacts should face the front of the camera as you insert it.<br /><br />I will not be going through every Feature and Function of the camera as it would be too in-depth to do so. However, you should be familiar with the Function Button on the back of the camera (It's the round dial on the back of the camera about in the middle on the right side). Here is a quick overview:<br /><br />* Green AUTO Button - Changes between AUTO and Programming (P) modes and is the UP Button<br />* Gray INFO Button - Turns on and off the Information displayed on the LCD screen and is the DOWN Button<br />* Lightning Bolt Icon Button - Changes the Flash modes and is the RIGHT Button<br />* Person Icon Button - Turns on the Auto Focus Feature and is the LEFT Button<br />* Func. Set (Center) Button - Accesses the Function Menu and is the SET (OK) Button<br /><br />NOTE: The Power Button is the Small Round Button on the Top of the Camera, The Shutter Button is the Large Round Button on Top of the Camera, The Zoom Lever is the Lever around the Shutter Button, The Playback Button is Button with the Green Play Icon just to the upper right of the LCD screen on the back of the Camera, The Record Button is the Button with the Red Dot just to the right of the Playback Button, The Delete Button is the Button with the Trash Can Icon just to the lower right of the LCD screen on the back of the Camera, and finally... The MENU Button (Self explanatory) is just to the right of the Delete Button. Watch the Video for the location of these Buttons.<br /><br />After the battery is completely charged (the Amber Light will turn Green), insert the battery into the camera by aligning the Triangle Icon on the battery with the Battery Holder Tab then pull the Tab back towards the front of the camera and insert the battery until it locks into place.<br /><br />Now that your camera is ready to use, let's get started learning how to use it.<br /><br />If this is the first time you are powering on your camera you will notice that there is an option to set the Date, Time and Daylight Savings Time. You do not have to do this for the camera to operate correctly. It is used to store EXIF data pertaining to your pictures and videos that you take as well as Date Stamp them. If you do not know what EXIF data is, please look it up so that you may understand the security issues that could be of concern to you.<br /><br />SETTING THE DATE:<br />You will need to use the Function Dial to set, or change, the Date and Time. Use the Up/Down Buttons to specify the current Date then use the Right/Left Buttons to move to the next option. Again, use the Up/Down Buttons to set the current time. If you are satisfied with how everything looks, you can press the Func. Set Button to advance to the next option or you can change the way the Date is displayed and select Daylight Savings Time. When you are satisfied with your settings, press the Func. Set Button to proceed to the next option.<br /><br />On the next menu you will be able to change, or select, you current Time Zone. Use the Right/Left Buttons to select your Time Zone and press Func. Set to complete the process.<br /><br />You can skip the above settings, but every time you power on your camera you will have to press Func. Set to skip the process. Note: You can change/set the above options at any time by pressing the MENU Button. Here's how:<br /><br />* Press the MENU button<br />* Move the Zoom Lever or the Right/Left Buttons to highlight the Tools Icon<br />* Use the Up/Down Buttons to move through the settings until you highlight the Date/Time... option<br />* Press the Func. Set Button and then use the Up/Down & Right/Left Buttons to adjust your new settings.<br />* Press the Func. Set Button to complete the process<br /><br />SETTING YOUR LANGUAGE:<br />If you are still in the Tools Menu, simply move to the Language option in the menu - it is the next to last option listed - otherwise proceed as follows:<br /><br />* Press the MENU Button and move to the Tools Icon<br />* Use the Up/Down Buttons to move to the Language option in the menu and press Func. Set<br />* Use the Up/Down & Right/Left Buttons to navigate to your desired Language and press Func. Set<br />* Press the MENU Button to exit the menu - NOTE: Use the MENU Button any time you wish to exit ANY menu you are in.<br /><br />TAKING YOUR FIRST PICTURE:<br />* Power on the Camera (As you power on the Camera look at the upper right hand side of the LCD display and note if \"P\" or \"AUTO\" is displayed - If AUTO is displayed then skip the next step)<br />* Press the Green AUTO Button to select AUTO Mode (The AUTO Mode simply tries to set the Camera to the best options respective to your immediate environment)<br />* Use the Zoom Lever to adjust your desired Zoom level<br />* Press & Hold the Shutter Button 1/2 way down to allow the Camera to automatically Focus and adjust the appropriate settings for your picture<br />* Press the Shutter Button fully to take your picture<br /><br />NOTE: Please observe the LCD screen when holding the Shutter Button 1/2 way down for warning information regarding settings that may need some attention. Also, while in AUTO Mode your setting options will be limited. In Programming (P) Mode, you will have full control of all your Camera setting options that it is capable of using. Again, I will not be going through these two (2) modes as they are very in-depth.<br /><br />TO VIEW YOUR PICTURE(S):<br />* Press the Green Play Button to enter Playback Mode<br />* Use the Right/Left Buttons to Scroll through your pictures for viewing - NOTE: You can press the Func. Set Button for more options during picture viewing.<br /><br />RECORDING YOUR FIRST VIDEO:<br />* Select AUTO or Programming (P) Mode, as previously mentioned, then press the Func. Set or MENU Buttons to set any options for recording your video<br />* Press the Red Record Button (See above if you've forgotten where it is)<br />* Use the Zoom Lever for Wide/Telephoto zoom level<br />* Press the Red Record Button again to stop recording - NOTE: During recording, the Lens movement (noise) while zooming In/Out will be recorded. Preset your zoom level to prevent this if it is an issue with you.<br /><br />PLAYBACK YOUR VIDEOS:<br />* Press the Green Play Button<br />* Use the Right/Left Buttons to find the Video you wish to view<br />* Press the Func. Set Button (Play Movie will be displayed in the Function Menu)<br />* Press the Func. Set Button again to play the Video<br />* Use the Up/Down Buttons to control the volume during playback<br /><br />NOTE: To exit Playback Mode for both Pictures and Videos, press the Shutter Button to exit out to the Camera LCD screen (Ready Mode).<br /><br />DELETING PICTURES AND VIDEOS:<br />* Press the Green Play Button to enter Playback Mode<br />* Use the Right/Left Buttons to find the Picture/Video you wish to delete<br />* Press the Trash Can Button<br />* Use the Right Button to highlight ERASE<br />* Press Func. Set Button and follow the prompts<br /><br />NOTE: To erase multiple Pictures/Videos do the following:<br />* Press the Green Play Button to enter Playback Mode<br />* Press the MENU Button<br />* Use the Down Button to highlight ERASE...<br />* Press the Func. Set Button<br />* Use the Down Button to highlight one of the following options:<br /> - SELECT - Allows you to pick the Picture(s)/Video(s) you want to erase (Use the Func. Set Button to select them then press the MENU Button and follow the prompts) NOTE: Use the Right/Left Buttons to move through the Images.<br /> - SELECT RANGE - Allows you to select a range of Pictures/Videos to erase<br /> - ERASE ALL - This will erase EVERYTHING on your SD Card that is unprotected (This is the same for the above two (2) options)<br /><br />WARNING: Please pay attention and follow the prompts to avoid deleting files that are unprotected - you can not get them back. If you want to protect your Pictures/Video, please do the following:<br />* Enter Playback Mode by pressing the Green Play Button<br />* Press the MENU Button<br />* Use the Down Button to highlight Protect...<br />* Press the Func. Set Button and follow the prompts<br /><br />OK folks... That's the Canon PowerShot ELPH in an nutshell. I've uploaded a short video showing the location of the above mentioned Buttons.<br /><br />[...]","great","Great camera, as described","all canon cameras are excellant","I purchased the Canon PowerShot ELPH 180 for my youtube channel as a side camera. It works great. It can take some amazing footage and pictures. It doesn't do too well in low light, but if you have a lot of external lighting, that shouldn't be a problem. I'll probably review this camera on my youtube channel pretty soon. I'll put a link to the video once it's uploaded!","Soo good.","so far so good","Beautiful camera - great service!","My elph 400 broke and I needed a replacement for my work.  This one is perfect for me.  Fits in my previous case too saving me the expense of buying a new one.  Reseller provided an item exactly as advertised at a great price.  Delivery could have been quicker but it arrived in perfect condition and was easy to get working with it.","Great !!!","Easy to use and super clear photos.","great quality, prompt shipping","a present for my wife great buy","Good","Love this class of camera but they keep getting lighter and lighter. I just hope it holds up.","this camera is fine for our purposes; however, there is a slight delay between pushing the button and the camera actually snapping the picture. it also has moments where the screen is blurry and you either need to wait for it to refocus on its own, or turn it off and back on to refocus.","If you're looking to take beautiful, breathtaking panoramas, this camera's not for you. If you want high quality everyday pictures, this is the one I would recommend. It's very easy to learn and easy to use. Not too expensive and it's great for beginners as well as pros.","A Service award gift for one of my staff. Great deal","Simple to use and easy to download pictures.","Easy to use. The simple buttons make this a fantastic choose for a novice. Great picture quality.","Nice camera but the Auto Focus doesn't always focus, resulting in some fuzzy pictures which I didn't discover until it was too late.  Not as good as my old Canon Sure Shot.","This is a nice camera. Small enough to take anywhere. Great pictures.","I do appraisals of a living, and this camera really does a good job taking photos both inside and outside.  It is a good \"bang for the buck\" camera.  It's pretty durable too.","I had some issues with it not wanting to focus at times.  I had to turn it off and back on to get it to focus right a few times.  Other than that, it is an awesome little pocket camera.","Excellent camera. Wife is very pleased with it.","So far so good, takes great pictures","Love it","Takes great photos","Exactly what I expected. Worked well.","Great little camera!","Small for my purse yet takes great photos!!","GREAT ITEM...I AM VERY PLEASE","This was a gift and she loves it so far.  Much faster than her old camera.","Easy to use","Got it as a gift for low tech MOL. She loves it. It's small and lightweight and takes great pics. Perfect alternative to filling up the phone space with pics and videos of your grand children ;-)","Nice and compact so it's great for traveling light instead of carrying a bulky DSLR.<br />Easy and quick to learn the functions.<br /><br />My only concern is that this camera DOES NOT seem to be 20 MP! I took the same shot with my iphone 6s and this camera and the picture on the 6s came out way clearer even though the 6s has a 12 MP camera.","This is replacing the Canon PowerShot I broke by dropping it. As always, it is a great camera. It is just the right size and I love the color.","I use this in generally low light areas to take photos of trailer damage. It works perfectly for what I need it for.","We recently visited Rocky Mountain National Park with the grandkids. One was trying to take photos with a V-Tech kiddie camera. One was taking photos with her hand-me-down Apple phone. The quality of the kiddie camera photos was very poor. The camera phone photos were poor quality and hard to view or download. We let them take turns using our backup ELPH and they had a wonderful time, took a few nice shots, and made great strides as photographers just with a little fooling around.<br /><br />The ELPH is so intuitive, the auto setting is so nice, the anti-shake is so effective, and the view screen is so big that this turned out to be a very newbie friendly camera.<br /><br />Don't underestimate the beauty of digital. You could burn off the cost of this camera in film and developing on a normal film camera in one family vacation. This baby will hold a few thousand high quality digital photos on a normal, (say 16 GB), memory card. That's a lot of pictures of the inside of a backpack, hands, feet, the rear end of the family dog, birds, ants and Mom's elbow. But among those will be a few really nice candid photos of the family at play, and I have to say we had the best time in front of the computer monitor looking at all of the easily uploaded photos.<br /><br />The camera is solid and will take a fair amount of reasonable abuse. The wrist strap is flimsy, but saves the occasional accident. After a few minutes of instruction and practice the kids were naturals with the camera. Over the course of a few days the quality of the photographs, in terms of composition, choice of zoom, framing, and the like, improved dramatically.<br /><br />This turned in to a great family activity, and got the kids totally invested in the vacation. It helped them to learn how to look and to see. And the operation of the camera never got in the way.<br /><br />So, it's beyond dispute that, technically, this is a fine product. But moreover, in terms of value for cost as a useful thing to own, this was a worthwhile and rewarding purchase.<br /><br />Please note that I bought this item for my family with my own real cash money.","nice \"pocket camera\" for quick shots","Nice little point and shoot for the money","only complaint, no panoramic capabilities","Great little camera for the cost. Takes great pics and 720p video. Very happy","Great camera","Great camera","Works great","Let's start with I like the color and the size.  It fits great into my pocket for bike rides and other outings when I don't want to use my phone and risk dropping my phone or draining the battery.  The picture quality is pretty good, I thought it would be better considering it is 20 MP.  I haven't had the camera long but can't seem to find settings to adjust lighting and outdoor back light. Also, the camera is so small, which is great for carrying around, I find that when I push the button I move/push the camera down causing a slight movement in the camera.  It almost feels like a toy.  So, there is a plus and negative to its size. Overall it meets my needs of a small portable camera.","Very nice camera and easy to use. I'd recommend it.","I have had only a short while to use this. Takes great photos, but you do have to spend time learning the function mode settings. I feel that the ones offered: tiny camera, monochromatic, pinhole are all effects that you can easily add while editing your photos on the simplest photo editing sites. You cannot quickly add the effect, take a shot, then get rid of the effect. In fact, it is hard do get the camera out of the mode and back to reset. The most useful modes are macro and fish eye lens. Again, it takes some thumbing around to access those modes. Jury is still out.","I have a camera that I take out for picture taking and wanted something small that I could easily keep with me for those surprise photo ops.  This is just what I was looking for and performs great.","Great item.  Small, lightweight and easy to use.","Love the camera but the instructions were extremely poor.","Meh.  Lightweight, old-style camera.  Does not auto-focus, so you have to practice using it before you take pictures.  I am annoyed that the description does not explicitly say that it does not come with memory chip or USB cord, so I had to buy these separately.  It also doesn't explicitly say that it does come with charger for the battery, so I was keeping my fingers crossed, and I am glad it does.","This point and shoot has been great to use and I have been quite satisfied with it considering its low price. I have attached test photos and videos so you can be the judge on the quality. I noticed that this camera is especially good at picking up accurate and bold colors in both the photo and video modes.<br /><br />Canon includes a \"Getting Started\" guide, a warranty card, a small lanyard, a 680mah battery, an external battery charger (which is nice if you plan on buying additional batteries), and the camera itself.<br /><br />With the popularity of smartphones, what is the appeal of this entry-level point and shoot camera? Well, unlike most smartphones, this camera features an 8x optical zoom. This is a great feature that allows you to zoom in decently close while experiencing a minimal degradation in quality. The camera's maximum video quality is 720p but it features quick auto focusing and as mentioned before, good accurate colors. The only issue that I had with the video quality is that the stabilization is not the best.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is overall a great entry-level point and shoot and I do not think you will be disappointed for the price. The 8x optical zoom is definitely my favorite feature and the photo and video quality is about what you would expect for a camera in this price range. There is no included SD card so you will need to buy one, and there is no included transfer cable (mini USB) so you will also need to buy one of those to load the photos and video onto your computer unless you have an SD card slot. The user interface on the camera is easy and simple to use. This camera is great for those who are not extremely technologically savvy as there is basically no learning curve. Nice job Canon.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I purchased this product with my own money for my own personal use."]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot ELPH 190 IS","amazon_reviews":["For the price, this is an amazing camera.

Plus my daughter keeps taking it to take random pictures. So I asked my husband for a point and shoot with WiFi built in and this is what I got. So far I'm really liking it. It was easy to connect to the app on my iPhone 6. I just wish I could figure out how to get it connected to Facebook and YouTube. It said that I needed to register the camera with Canon, which I did, but I still can't get it to work. I'll have to call next week.

I love Canon!","It seems cameras are getting smaller and therefore the inner workings are not as quality as a few years ago.

The sharpness is just not there like 5 years ago.","This Canon Camera is great I like how it fits in your pocket and it takes pictures really good and also the videos youcan record in HD and it is very clear. The zoom, I love how is so easy to zoom in and out and you can't hear in the videos when you zoom in or out.","Got the camera on Thursday and figured out the wifi and posted pics to Facebook on Friday. I am anxious to take pictures at my next concert and post them! The pictures should be a lot better than my android cell takes.","It was never mentioned the camera had no memory card nor a computer cable for uploading and printing pictures. I had to purchase all this after I received the camera. To me I did not get what I ordered.<br />I had to go buy additional parts to make a working camera.<br /><br />  I , quite simply, could have gone to Walmart and bought a complete unit. Less trouble and money.<br />Not happy with the entire experience  !!","Bought as a gift, and the recipient can't put it down!<br />Perfect for his needs.","So happy with my purchase. Takes much better pictures than my cell phone. And the wifo capability allows me to transfer them to my cell phone and quickly share with friends. Thank you.","Arrived on time and very nice. Needed a new one, i had the older version of the canon and are pretty nice in taking pictures.","Nice, compact, easy to use.","Excellent","Great product.","Excellent quality camera and the pictures are excellent. It is very easy to operate and small enough to take with anywhere. The pictures are much better quality than a smart phone's pictures.","Great little camera.  Pictures are of very good quality in a variety of lighting conditions.  Used it extensively on a European vacation.  The WiFi upload to Canon Image Gateway and supposedly automatic upload to Google Drive etc were quite daunting or I would give it 5 stars for value and price.","EXCELLENT point and shoot for macro. I use this for my online shop. I shoot tiny objects very close up, and its absolutely divine.","Bought this for my wife.  Her \"old\" ELPH was dropped with the lens out and caused the the lens to be jammed.  In trying to un-jam it, I cracked the glass.  We really like the Cannon ELPH so ordered this as a replacement.<br /><br />This is a very nice camera with more \"zoom\" and it takes great pictures so why 4 stars?<br /><br />Two reasons, first the cannon battery life is much lower that the old ELPH, I would say about 1/2 the life.<br />Second- Cannon changed the battery physical size so the old batteries won't fit.<br /><br />Knowing these issues, I would still recommend this camera because of picture quality, zoom and price.","I bought this as a gift for Mothers Day for my mom to use to take pictures of purses for her business. So far, she has been very pleased with its quality of the pictures taken, and how easy it is to use. She's able to zoom into the pictures with great detail to be able to look for any inconsistencies, and she loves the size/design of the camera as well. It's very easy to store, and turns on/off very quickly. I would recommend this to anyone looking to take quick, high quality photos on the go.","Excellent point and shoot camera. Gave it to the wife as a gift. Takes clear pictures and has decent zoom. Functions are nice and easy for a novice.","Bought for a two week vacation.  took around 1800 photos.  For the most part, all the pix are great.  the refresh cycle is pretty fast.  it slows as the battery drains.  but I got five days or 500 pictures per charge.  I have not set up any of the wifi features so I can not comment on that.","Love this camera!","as expected","I love the canon powershot!  It's a good HD small camera!","Update...<br />Camera worked fine during vacation except for the eyelid not closing over the lens (se below). It must be easy to use as my two-year-old granddaughter managed to pick it up and take some selfies with it :).  I received my replacement camera upon return from vacation and it seems fine.  That is my first exchange on Amazon.  Quick and painless.<br /><br />Just received it today.. leaving for vacation tomorrow.  Initial testing indicates it is okay except the lower eyelid does not raise to cover the lens when the camera is off.  So lens is only half covered/protected by the upper eyelid.  I'll return for another one when I return.  Also, it seems you have to remove the (proprietary) battery from the camera and place in designated charger to charge.  I'd rather be able to charge via the mini USB port.","Compact, easy to use, photos with good resolution.","Great camera.  Excellent for a small take it everywhere camera.  Wonderful images.","The failure here is not on the Amazon vendor. Failure is false advertising on the part of Canon. The wifi feature does not exist on this phone.","Very good photos for a small camera, very handy","Exceptional little camera.  I carry it with me continually when I'm out and about.  Never leave home without a camera.  The pix are sharp and the video works well.  I would recommend this camera to a friend.  I would buy it again.","I have been using the ELPHs for the past ten years, and waited for this CCD version to come out.<br />I do see the RAINBOW effect on the display but it does not transfer onto the photo itself.<br />Color Reproduction and focus is decent good for daylight shots.  Night Shots are bright as with all elphs but brightness is a bit overwhelming and not always compensated by the software. I waited for this CCD to come out, and I like it, softer tones then CMOS, but I am not a believer yet.<br />The Remote operation of of the camera via a smartphone is an outstanding  feature,  wifi transfer is great.  Optical zoom+ clarity is EXCELLENT for such a small and relatively inexpensive camera.<br />Overall I am  a bit disappointed by Canon with this particular model in respects quickness of focusing and color, or it is that Samsung has made Great strides in its cameras for its top-of-line smartphones.<br /><br />Samsung S7 Edge does better color reproduction.","For many years I had Panasonic Lumix cameras. Bought a second one for my husband after his first one was a sacrifice to the river while he was fly fishing, several for my children and for myself. Loved those Leica lenses and the small size, which let me carry them in my pockets. However, the quality has declined and the last two died with the same problem. Within a year. Thank God for Square Trade Warranties. I switched to a Canon at the recommendation of my sister. I usually don't purchase a new model, since it can take awhile for any bugs to be worked out, but so far, so good. I believe it's just an upgrade of the ELPH 180, which was highly rated. Haven't delved into the user manual yet, but downloaded it for reference.","Delivers high quality pictures for everyday use. You can turn it on and take a picture in a couple seconds and you can take multiple pictures super quickly. The battery seems to last forever and the wifi mode for transferring pictures is really nice. For the size the video is decent but you can't expect ultra high def from something so small so if works. All in all great value! It can fit in a pocket so you can have it anywhere and everywhere you want.","great pics","WHAT A COOL CAMERA!!","Lightweight and takes great photos.  I have has several Canon Powershot camera, I upgraded to get the 20 Megapixel."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix B500","amazon_reviews":["In box with everything, but the batteries. I love this camera.

It works well for video.  It DOES NOT take good pictures.  The shutter is very slow and all pictures are blurred - regardless of the setting.  Fortunately I have other quality NIKON camers for picture taking...this is not good for that.","I had the opportunity to try out this camera and I love it. I wasn't sure how the pictures would be using zoom. They came out perfect! I zoomed in close to one object and lost the object for a few seconds. That is to be expected with a zoom that powerful. It brought back memories of my younger days using a powerful telescope lens to zoom in on a planet. It's easy to lose sight of them if you're not careful. The camera was in my hand, not on a tripod so I held it as steady as I could but you know how that goes.  The pictures are nice and crisp with accurate colors. Beautiful. I'm going to enjoy this camera!","So far it works fine much like the older Coolpix that i wore out.","Takes good pics","I bought this in a store locally, so I cannot speak for any venders or shipping issues etc.<br /><br />I can however say I absolutely love this camera. Initially it was purchased as a step up for snapping pics of my kids and doggos. Now I'm obsessed with taking photos.<br /><br />I go to the local parks and walk a ton more simply to find good shots.<br /><br />Once you get used to the settings and various features the pictures you can capture are simply amazing.<br /><br />I've owned this for about a month now and carry it with me quite literally every time I leave my house.","Love my Nikon coolpix.

Has a cool Bluetooth and wifi feature to where every time I take a photo it goes straight into my camera roll on my iPhone. I can also control the camera through my phone. Absolutely worth the money!","Good Product I like it","It takes great quality pictures. The zoom is awesome and can take really good up close pictures.","this was a gift for our 16 year old daughter.  She loves taking pictures of nature and our dogs.  Easy to use, but also easy to play with settings for different looks.","Love this camera. Very easy to use, It is a wonderful camera, for a beginner. Now it really easy for you to download pictures from the phone.<br />Great camera, highly recommended.<br />Thumb up if you agree with me","As expected for Nikon, Awesome. Will always buy Nikon.","This is a great camera. Easy to setup and beautiful pictures. My reason for knocking it down to 3 stars is false advertising. It says that it does \"full hd video\". That's a lie. It takes a series (15 clips) 2 second long videos and then merges them together for a maximum of 30 second long clips. I bought this hoping to take full videos as well as pictures but it's simply not in the firmware. So just be aware that it's a great camera FOR PICTURES ONLY and not video... Honestly, I'm going to attempt hacking the firmware to give it full video capabilities and then return it if I can't manage it.","Love this camera. Very easy to use. It takes crisp photos and videos. The bluetooth/wifi feature makes it easy to transfer photos to my Samsung S6. I downloaded the Snapbridge app as suggested and I could choose which photos I want to send to my phone. You also have the option to send the photos to your phone as you shoot. These photos were taken with the B500 (included one action shot). Highly recommended.","Just bought. The blue tooth is cool. But focusing far away Is a issue. The instructions that came with the camera didn't go into details.<br /><br />The photos below show how far this lens goes. I was standing on my patio and took these. In the wide show you can hardly make out the apartments and the water tower!","Ok","I like the cost, the telephoto capacity, and the clarity of the lenses","Wish the instructions were better but slowly learning all of the features. Promises to be more than I hoped for.","I just got the camera, and I am loving it. Picture quality is great and taking photos is simple.","Got this camera for my everyday carry, really impressed with the photos and video. Would definitely recommend this camera for someone wanting a better quality camera to start with before buying a DSLR. Only giving 4 stars because batteries died faster than anticipated.","love this camera","Great camera.  Granddaughter took a picture of the moon and it looks like it is through a telescope.  I could not believe the quality!","It easy to learn and I am still learning new ideas....but love the pictures that I am taking..this is a good camera for me as I love trying different ways to take a pictures.","Nice camera but a little hard to use at first.","Love it.","This camera is all that I wanted it to be and more.  It arrived within just a few days of ordering, in excellent condition.  I strongly suggest that if you are a novice like I am, download the manual.  It gives a lot more info than the quick start guide that comes with the camera.","Great camera takes beautiful pictures","Gift for my mom. She loves it.","We love this camera.  I joke with my husband that, when taking photos indoors, it makes us look even BETTER than we actually do, haha!  I love the photo quality and the way the flash makes the pictures look.  The snapbridge feature is awesome, to get the photos onto your phone, and also to use your phone as a remote when the whole group wants to be in the pic.","I love it!  Very powerful zoom, sharp focus, and easy to shoot.  It's a little big and heavy, but this made it steadier for me to compose my shots, especially those with horizontal alignments.  My only negative comment is that it doesn't have a center indicator, or I haven't figured it out yet.  But overall, I'm satisfied.  I got the red one, and it looks very cool!","Everithing ok","The camera takes really good pictures. Wish it had Bluetooth capability to down load on the phone","Love it...","So far not super impressed. I like the features but too may images turn out fuzzy.  Seems any little motion throws off the auto focus.  Not sure if the camera has a flaw or if it's me. The tilting screen is very nice.","Great camera! Highly satisfied!","can't go wrong with nikon.  glad to have received it finally!!","as advertised","Love the camera!  Wonderful zoom and takes great videos!","Awesome. I didn't even know it synced with my phone with the pictures. What a great bonus for me. I was always do both, my phone pictures and camera pictures. No need of that two timing anymore.

I did adjust the contrast on one photo but it's still great quality you can see the craters on the moon","I'm not great with electronics, but I found this camera to be very user friendly.  And the quality of the pictures have turned out great for me.  I'm sure they are obviously not as good,in comparison to a DSLR, but unless you are wanting to take professional looking pictures, this camera is great!  I would also say it's great for beginners.","good","package wee, everything I wanted","I owned this camera a month ago.<br />This is an awesome camera for beginner.The settings are easy for a beginner like me.<br />Bluetooth and Wi-Fi features are very effective.","son loved it takes nice pictures","I bought this as a starter camera for my 14 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it. We take frequent trips to gardens, etc. so she and my nieces can take photos.","I gave my wife this camera for Christmas. She loves it. She's only taking pictures of the baby but it has good pictures and she loves that it transfers straight to her phone so she can upload them right away to social media.","I got this Camera for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.","I am very pleased with the camera.  It was easy to use and pictures really came out great.  It is a wonderful camera, for a beginner, or advanced photographer; the price was great, as well.  Pictures came out well outdoor as well as indoor.  The instruction manual was clear and easy to understand.","Before purchasing this camera I did my research and there were tons of good reviews. Not to mention that the zoom is empecable but it's hard to focus with the camera and theres no setting to help with that. Also another issue is how it advertises the snap bridge (an app where you can transfer pics to your cell phone) it worked when I first hooked it up but after that it would just say something between the camera wasn't on (it was) or my app wasn't set up (it was). I actually made several trips to the geek squad to hook it up for me but they also had a hard time. The camera overall isn't horrible It just personally bummed me out to know that focus is ","I received this camera as a Christmas gift. I really love it. I'm a complete beginner and I feel like this is a great starting point for any hobbyist. I can that the zoom on this camera is ridiculous and worth the money. I've come to realize that you can't simply pick up a camera and get blog worthy shots, there is some skill to it and this camera works great for trying to learn basic photography.","Incredible value.  Unreal focus at total zoom.  If you're trying to get that far away shot but stuck in the nose bleed seats, this is your camera.  Also runs on standard AA batteries, so no hassle with charging a lithium and purchasing extra expense lithium batteries that will last only a couple of years.","Bought this for our 14 year old aspiring photographer. Takes beautiful professional pictures!","Love my camera","great value easy to use","Item delivered is as advertised & functions as advertised.","Everything we hoped it would be.","great camera, easy to use and well worth the money","Excellent product.","Love","Quite handy","the best camera for miney","I would give this camera 5,if the Bluetooth working to move the pics from the camera to the phone looks like it its not.","Great camera!! The Bluetooth doesn't work as well as I think it should, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.","Great camera my daughter loves it great pictures.","I'm not a profesional camera man, because im not, but the features this camera has is the best i had in my hands, feels so well done, feels heavy and resistant, the flash is superb, and the clarity of the pictures is outstanding, eventhough it doesnt have too many megapixels is not a bad thing actually, is great that way pics arent that heavy to manage around devices. Excellent purchase, hightly recommended.","Even with fresh batteries the flash does not regenerate very quickly and it's bulkier than I'd like.  The instructions on attaching the lens cap and the camera strap are poor.  The quality of the pics however is outstanding!  And the high ISO means you don't need to use the flash as frequently as you would with most cameras.  Overall, I'm pleased for the price.","The zoom is amazing! Macro isn't all that bad either. The battery door is a little flimsy but that's the only thing I've found lacking so far. Nice unit.","I bought this camera for a trip to Eastern Europe and I took approximately 800 photos on one fresh set of batteries so that was a nice surprise. The light compensation setting worked really well and the focus is generally good although there were many times I wished I was able to use a different lens for filtering, etc.  The zoom is really good. All in all, this is a great little camera and I am very pleased with most of the photos. The nighttime shots of the chain bridge and parliament building in Budapest turned out really beautiful. When taking spontaneous photos you do have to take into account the delay between the time you push the button to take the photo and the time it actually takes the shot. I feel it is a little bit long but once you adjust to the timing you can work with it.","Bought this for my Wife she wanted a camera and she loves it it is beautifully made and comfy in her hands takes great pics and the Bluetooth feature is awesome.","Smooth transaction.  Great camera.  Still learning all the features but no issues so far.  The zoom is awesome.  Not the best for moving objects (like my daughter) as they can be blurry.  But this has been a good purchase.","Great camera!  Takes great pictures and the zoom is amazing.  The only drawback is that there is no viewfinder and the screen is difficult to see in sunlight, but for this price (I paid $250) this camera can't be beat!","Love, love, love this camera!!","This camera is by far the best thing I have ever used. I love taking pictures, but I am more into to it when you have a bad ass camera. I am learning to become a beginner photographer and this is the perfect camera to work with. Plus it has 40x ZOOM!!! WTF!! It is amazingly clear as well as the video.","Don't have the funds for a DSLR but I do a lot of photography in conjunction with Photoshop. The camera gives solid pictures with the use of studio lights and, though not as good as a DSLR, does much better than any previous camera I have owned. I also got an extremely clear shot of the Super Moon from a couple weeks ago. Not top of the line but definitely worth the cost.","I love it so far","A gift for me. Fantastic and light. So many different settings and options for me to play with. Barely scratched the surface of the interactive Bluetooth feature. As pretty as a Ruby, and lots of fun to use!","I have three \"Bridge\" cameras, a Leica, Lumix, and this Nikon one.  It cost 1/2 the price of the first two yet performs just as well in most every respect.  And its smaller, lighter than either of the others making it a joy to carry around.  On top of this, the 4 AA batteries in it seem to last forever if you install Duracell's Quantum batteries, their top-line alkaline batteries.  I have been on two substantial trips, to Hawaii and Carmel/Monterey (CA),  using this camera and have yet to install new ones.  Optically, it appears to perform as well as either of the others.<br />The resulting photo files are just as sharp with good color.  I'd highly recommend it.","I absolutely love this camera. The only thing is the batteries it came with already went dead..and I barely used to for it to die that fast. I noticed the camera's on/off button light stays on even when I turned off the camera. I don't know if it's supposed to that or not...and if that's the reason the batteries died? I'm a new Nikon user so don't laugh. Lol","works great except it used the four AA bateries in a 1.5 day of heavy shooting.","This is a good camera for beginning users. One reason I bought this camera was because I could use rechargeable AA batteries; however, upon receiving the camera, I learned that you can ONLY use Nikon brand rechargeable batteries, which are much more expensive than other rechargeable batteries. You can also use alkaline AA batteries, and other user reviews state that they will last for 600 shots or more. However, the AA batteries that came with my camera only lasted a week and a half, and I took less than 50 shots. Maybe the batteries wore out quickly because I was experimenting a lot with the movie feature -- but I'm not sure. The camera does have many shooting modes, all of which are easy to use, and the zoom on this camera is quite good. In Auto mode, I find that the camera's default exposure setting seems to be on the high side (meaning too bright), but this is easily correctable with the adjustable exposure setting. All in all, it seems like a good quality camera for the price.","Great canera","Being a long-time Nikon user, I was very happy with the CoolPix.  It is so much lighter and easy to use than my F1.  The only thing that I didn't like is that there was no memory card included.  I had to make a special trip to the mall to get a card before I could try it out.  It should come with a card.","The Coolpix B500 is a nice point and shoot camera that shares the limitations of its class.  On the positive side, it looks serious (at least in black) and boasts a solid feel, generous zoom range and generally effective autofocus and exposure capabilities. However, excepting ISO choices and exposure compensation in certain modes, there is not a lot the user can do to directly control the image making process.<br /><br />If not stated clearly enough already, be aware: aperture and shutter speed cannot be set nor prioritized on this camera.  And, notwithstanding a few modes of autofocus, any actual manual focus control is nonexistent.<br /><br />Thus, the \"point and shoot\" designation is appropriate, notwithstanding an impressive zoom and striking appearance. Taken for what it truly is, the B500 is a fine automatic camera and a fun one. Great images can be produced, along with misfires, blurs, and opportunities lost while the camera is deciding what to do. It may be best suited to subjects unlikely to move around much while being photographed. (Although multiple bursts can be had in sports mode.)<br /><br />Positives that should be considered are this model's image stabilization capability with long zooms, its use of easily available AA batteries and a hinged LCD screen which allows the camera to be held high or low to make the shot.<br />Negatives, even for a PNS, include a slight tendency to overexposure (easily corrected), lack of a viewfinder and<br />presets that offer hue, contrast and other choices best left to post production, not estimation via the LCD.<br /><br />I can't comment on the effectiveness of the Bluetooth and Wi-F- features and will eschew experimentation. This is not because I am technically obtuse and it is clear that such connectivity has become standard.  From my point of view, however, it will be easier to take and share quick snaps using just my phone and I don't see the need use it to view images in the field or edit them later on.<br /><br />The street price of the B500 hovers at around $250.00 and that seems reasonable given the splendid quality of the images it successfully captures.  For folks on a budget or looking to add great zoom to point and shoot basics, it is well worth consideration.","Love it!!!!  Best point and shoot ever!!!!","I got this at retail store because i wanted the plum colored one, which is what first attracted me to it. Then I read the reviews and all were mostly good. The one that got me the most was being able to take pictures of the moon. I was like no way. Way. I'm not a photographer by any means, just wanted a good camera for vacation and sports etc. This is above and beyond what I need and I love it. Got a great pic of my son's intense face from across the field, zoomed in on animals in the tops of trees or at the zoo. Still learning all the ins and outs but very impressed. It's made some fun Instagram pics lol. while i know im easily amused, i think its a great camera.","WIFES SHE LOVES IT LIKES THE ZOOM","Great product! Great seller!","Typical Nikon product, top line reliable, bulletproof. Takes great pics, menu is user friendly. Love this model line.","I brought this to see if I liked the Nikon brand and am happy with whatI have found. I  used it on cruise down the California coast and then from Vancouver to Calgary through the Canadian Rockeys. . Great pictures, shot 800 plus photos and a few videos. Only problem I see is that the video record button is right near where I place my thumb and I have some strange videos as you might imagine. I am disappointed that firmware updates are not done through direct connection to a computer but require loading the update to a memory card and then loaded through the camera memory card slot.","I did not purchase this camera from Amazon, so I can't vouch for this seller. I did buy the Nikon B500 from Best Buy, and the price was $259 \"on sale\" from $300. This is a great beginner camera, with a powerful zoom capability. I really wanted something that could photograph the starts, and I have yet to successfully do that with this camera. I'm pretty sure I need a heftier ISO setting, and manual focus, etc. I have, however, zoomed so far in on the moon I've seen craters (or maybe those are shadows?). I included a picture I took of the moon. I had been waiting for a moon picture all week, and it had been raining, and covered in fog/clouds. As soon as I saw the moon peaking out, I zoomed in and snapped the pic. So it is not edited at all, and was not taken with a tri-pod. By the time I got the tri-pod out for a better quality picture, the moon was long gone behind clouds.<br /><br />I easily connected this camera up to wi-fi, and bluetooth. The SnapBridge app is free, and I've not had any issues with it so far. I love that I can take pictures, and they're immediately sent to my phone. I had no idea cameras even did that, but it seems like a feature that a lot of DSLRs have now! Super awesome!<br /><br />The settings are pretty easy to figure out for this super beginner!","Brand new. Very happy with the product and speed of delivery.","This is a great little camera for the price.  Actually, not so little.  Has all of the features I was looking for.  I bought the accessory kit to go with it since I wanted a case.","Love it","it does SPECIFICALLY advertise as having the ability to send pics to your phone, etc.  it does not for iPhone.  not even sort of...this is false advertising","I love it, the controls are awesome and easy. The details are great and the zoom is astonishing.","VEry, very excellent NIKON camera.","Great camera for the price","A little bulky, not easily stored.","Works well, nice color.  Make sure you have unlimited data usage on your phone if you use it to show a lot of pictures.","I bought this because I wanted Bluetooth capability for a vacation. Nikon conveniently omits the fact that there's no iOS app. It's supposed to be available in August, but it's Aug. 12 now, and I'm leaving tonight. Thanks for the false advertising, Nikon. You've successfully guaranteed that for my next camera, I'll be going back to Canon.","Is so beatiful, medium size, excellent capture. Simply perfect!","Great camera","Love it","Excellent","My wife loves this and loves the WiFi feature.","What is not to like about this camera?<br /><br />I use it for daily photography.<br /><br />The SnapBridge software streams the photos to my phone. I have a (pretty quick) backup of everything I shoot and the ability to send photos out from the phone immediately. The ability to geo-tag the photos from the phone data is also very clever.<br /><br />AS a former professional film-based photographer, I accepted my wife's challenge to buy its' big brother with what i can make using this B500.<br /><br />Challenge accepted. Thanks Nikon for my first real digital camera!","Awesome camera","Great camera for travel. Shot some awesome animal pix in the Canadian Rockies first time out.","I am still learning how to use this... I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT CAMERAS.... but I really like it. I think this would be a good camera for beginners. I just bought this so I could take decent pictures at family events. So far so good. I haven't had any problems.","Love this camera great photos easy to use","Good little camera, takes good still pictures, videos & good night time photos also. however it does not take very good action pictures. most movement such as flowers blowing in a breeze will come out blurry. there is a button on the back side that takes videos it is placed next to the rubber pad for your thumb and I have hit it several times by mistake. there doesn't appear to be a port to plug into a desk top to retrieve pictures so  taking the card out is how we are transferring pictures to our computer. battery life is good, and it is one of the last to use AA battery's which is great on vacation.","Quality feel to it, not bulky. Super quality HD pictures. Only negative which I was suspect when I bought it is the super zoom feature, sounds cool but very difficult to hold steady by hand and get a quality picture. Nice camera for the money, comes with a nice strap and lens cap.","My poor camera of 10 years had a battery blow up in it. So it is done. Got this to take me another 10 years i hope. I like this because it does not come with a factory battery pack that you have to charge up and hope it does not blow up over time in your camera. I have yet to use it, but i must say it does look good with my red and black computer that i custom built.","1st review: (will update as i use) got camera and 1st thigk i learn - it needs a memory card ... grrr. now i have to wait 2 more days! Snapbridge appears to work on my droid device but am waiting for ios too!","I never read that Nikon SnapBridge was not yet available for Apple OS until Summer 2016. Surprise!","I just purchased this camera Friday. I am still waiting for the SnapBridge app on The Apple App Store to be available. Hope it's soon.

Typical Canon high quality.","Love it! The color is perfect n the pics are beautiful...","Camera came securely in original box, but then just dropped in larger box to bounce around.","Very good optics & features.","I bought this camera to take with me on vacation to Israel in May.  I have taken some pictures with it and is very easy to use.","Not as sharp as my older ELPH 310HS","Works good and takes nice pictures.","In my opinion, this is the best affordable point and shoot camera. I had an earlier version that finally wore out after years of use. Very easy to use and the software is user friendly.","The access panel to plug in the camera is a flimsy piece of plastic that most certainly would break off after a number of uses.  Also, the slopping shape (not rectangular) makes holding the camera awkward.  Camera ships without a connection chord.  Lastly, the preview window is grainy in low light.  Disappointing, returned.","I thought I was getting the cybershot, this one is a little bit flimsy. It does fit in my pocket.  But shipping was great and I got this really quick.","It's a normal camera, but it comes in my favorite color for more style and fun, It has great zoom capabilities and it's an amazing camera for everyday and for photography. It has some unusual settings that can be a lot of fun. The battery lasts me a long time, it's super easy to figure out and use. I do want to be forth coming and let you know I do not use it for video AT ALL. I can't say anything about video quality, recording voices or anything. This is just about the photos.","An excellent camera at a reasonable price.  Easy to use and the wi-fi connection is exceptionally convenient.","The zoom was better than expected.  Photos are great.","Gift","Be aware that the cable to connect to your computer is proprietary. Use a memory card reader to get photos tranferred to your computer. Cheaper. Low battery life. Extra battery expensive. Make sure it comes with charger. So far photos are decent for a novice. Better then cell phone.","Buy without reservation. Others have complained about battery life but I've had no problems. IF I HAD A PROBLEM I WOULD SEND IT BACK AS DEFECTIVE. Buy from Amazon!<br /><br />Agree with those who say instructions for connecting to other devices are bad. Check out the step-by-step video on the Canon website.<br /><br />Don't let the impatience or lack of follow through of others disuade you from buying this camera.","I like it. I don't love it. The Wifi capabilities weren't what I was expecting. Love the Color. My favorite of course. I wish it was easier to scroll and use the WiFi functions. Wish there were more choices in how you connect it to WiFi and other services. I haven't used the Camera all that much but I plan to soon on my next trip coming up.","Wife loves the camera, surprise how smaller it is. but loves it.","The pictures are more vibrant than those from the old Canon A1400.","This camera is easy to use and small enough to fit into a small purse.  It takes great pictures.","The zoom is awesome and the pictures have good color. The image stabilization helps tremendously. Unfortunately, we lost the camera and will probably purchase another one.","So far I haven't been able to down load the software needed to transfer them to my computer. Wish they would have at least included the cable to connect to two.","Had an old one (2001) and loved it so much I kept it for the beach and now use the new one for more important pix!!  Love it.","I already had this camera and like it well enough that I bought this one as a gift.","It has been performing as it should.","If you like having pictures of your kids on your phone but get frustrated with your phone's inability to capture clear pictures of them, this camera is a very convenient and affordable option. It's small enough that I can always have it with me in my pocket just like my cell phone, and it fires up about as quickly.<br /><br />If you're like me,  you constantly have your cell phone camera at the ready for those precious moments with your kids. But unless your kids are in broad daylight, or a full body cast, you probably end up with a bunch of blurry pictures of them because kids tend to move, and cell phone cameras aren't so good at handling motion or less than ideal lighting. With each new generation of phone, the camera is touted as just as good as a DSLR, so I would spend almost a thousand bucks on one, only to end up with slightly less blurry pictures of my kids.<br /><br />Eventually I noticed my 10-year-old point and shoot camera, which I used whenever we went on vacation, took pictures that blew my billion dollar cell phone out of the water, so I began to look for a camera that could transfer pictures wirelessly to a smart phone, since all the hooking up to a computer business is a pain in the rump.<br /><br />I went to best buy and they pointed me to this camera, and I couldn't be happier. It creates its own wifi hotspot that your phone can connect to using the free Canon camera connect app. It took me about 10 minutes to set up the first time, mostly because I'm bad with technology. After setting up my phone, I set up my wife's and it took me about two minutes.<br /><br />Once you're connected you can use your phone to select which pictures and videos to import, and they go straight into your gallery just like you took them with your phone. The entire process to connect and import takes maybe a minute (I've only imported about 20 pictures at a time, but the import itself only took a few seconds with that number of pictures. Obviously more pictures will take longer).<br /><br />As an added bonus, each of my cell phone pictures on my fancy phone took about 2mb of memory. Pictures taken on the Canon take around 800kb, meaning you can keep more than twice as many pictures with your existing storage.<br /><br />After testing it out, I returned my expensive cell phone and got a budget smartphone,  saving me about $800.<br /><br />Keep in mind I'm not a photographer. I don't have much interest in being able to count my kids pores in a picture, nor in whether the camera accurately captured every letter in a sign 50 feet behind them, or got the color of a roof six miles away right. All I care about is that I get a clear picture of my kids, and this camera does a great job at that. It may do those other things, too. I don't care enough to really notice.","I use it all the time, WiFi enabled so I can take pictures from my phone with Canon Connect app.  I was hesitant at first with the reviews I read online, glad I took the risk.  Small and compact, readily available for the shots but be prepared to buy more batteries, because you can't charge from the camera.","Love it!","I didn't purchase this camera through Amazon, but I wanted to stop by here and give my opinion. I rely on reviews and I was on the fence about purchasing this particular camera. I wanted to upgrade from my Canon sd750 which was getting old and moving slower, but still took amazing pictures. I got this camera yesterday and I do not regret it one bit! The pictures it takes are exactly the quality I expect from a Canon. The settings are great, I'm especially excited about the fisheye and toy camera settings. Also the wifi feature is HUGE for me..it's so great to be able to take photos and upload them right to my phone. You can instantly post right to social media instead of having to wait until you get home. If you are considering purchasing this camera please do it, you will NOT regret it!!!!!","Okay so far","Camera works great. Nice quality pics. The proprietary Canon software to extract pics to your desktop is a bit clunky.","I have loved and worn out ELPHs in the past and this one lives up to the name.  Good solid camera when you want something for pictures outside of your phone.  Mostly used for recording orchestra concerts, track and field events, and snaps of family events.","I like this camera for quick picks.  It works fine.  The pictures are smaller pixels which is great for news letters and on line communication.  I was spoiled by another camera that is no longer being made. This one takes a bit longer for it to think to take that perfect picture. It is fine for putting in your pocket and getting those quick picks you want to keep memories of. I am still learning about some of its features that as I learn, I am liking it more. I just miss my other camera, But I think this is a sturdier camera whose parts are not going to fall off with so much use like my favourite camera that took fantastic pictures but did not hold up under heavy use.  I think this may old up better.","I was hoping better pictures, they will look grainy or gritty. But it an ok camera when you don't want to carry your DSLR","great little camera","I actually like it a lot because it has the right features for the occasional photographer and is easy too use.","9 yr old loves it, especially the color.","love  it","We bought this as a gift for our granddaughter.  I was disappointed when I discovered the camera came without an SD card.  Once I purchased the card, my granddaughter loves the camera and its many features.","Low light sensitivity much better than the 340; especially for movies at dusk.","Wife loves it takes great pictures n wireless transfer helps tons.","Love the color. Easy to use the basic part haven't had a chance to get into more technical stuff. Love the size and weight, no bulk camera to cart around on trips!","Great convenient little camera.  Carried in my pocket on a recent trip to the mountains and the photos taken were much better than I expected from such a small package.","I took this camera to Europe and small enough to throw in my purse, but great enough to capture my experience.  I have been a Canon user for YEARS and you can never go wrong with a point and shoot!  It is user friendly and the wifi capabilities is a plus!!!","reasonable pictures especially outside,,,,,good zoom capabiliy.....wifi services not as straightforward","Could hardly wait to open the package containing this sweet little camera. The Canon PowerShot ELPH 360 HS takes very nice photos and videos. I am not a professional photographer and don't know how one would feel about this camera but for me it is perfect! I love the compact size and ease of using it. I have snapped quite a few pictures. I am so happy it arrived in time for the visit from my grandchildren! Hopefully it will last and last and last, etc...","Worked well as a gift for a non-photographer!","Took great pictures of my vacation. Easy to handle. Zoomed in nicely.  The wifi feature is good. I have it linked only to my home internet. I don't know how you would link it up on vacation while traveling.","I point, I shoot, it scores.  Buy it.","This is a powerful little camera. It's light but is sturdy. For its capabilities,  the zoom is excellent. The picture quality is better than average. It's fairly easy to use, especially if you have used a Canon before. It survived Disney World!","Fast shipping, nice variety.  It's difficult to get flavored decaf single serve cups.  I keep ordering these and will continue to do so.","Nice little camera, I have always had Nikon's my whole life and was a little skeptical that this camera would have the same features as my Nikon's did (forced flash, exposure compensation adjustment, different scene settings (i.e. sunset, beach, etc.)) but it has all that and more (fisheye lense, wifi to name a few).  Love the color as well and it's very easy to take video's.","Just bought basically the same camera I had last time.  It is great and being purple,  I can spot it in a flash when looking for it.","Great camera, this is the third compact Canon camera and they all have been terrific.","Zoom is amazing, and you can connect it to your computer or phone through wifi , awesome!","Really a nice and lightweight camera, takes good photos and 1080p video. Simple menus and I have gotten most of the<br />wifi to work, still struggling with some of it, but I expected that would be the case with new technology and is not a<br />deal-breaker for me. Love that it fits in wife's purse or back pocket easily. Good zoom and flash and battery are great. So far<br />happy with the purchase and would buy again, especially like how simple menus are.","The quality of the photos is amazing. I'm blown away by some of the shots I've taken in the vivid setting. I bought this camera to take with me on biking and hiking trips. It fits easily in my small pack. I haven't worked with the wireless features yet so I can't speak to those.","Quick ship, very pretty purple.  Great small size.","Item as Stated","It has the feature I needed.  It takes great pictures and it easy to use (intuitive).","Wonderful pictures for a point and shoot. Much better than a cell phone picture but still small enough to carry easily.","Needed something pocket size for  a month long trip to Belize and just didn't want to tote around my much loved but full size Nikon D700. I still own a Elph 35mm film camera and always loved the shots it produced so after looking at what is out there in digital I decided to go with the Canon based on the up to date features and a design Canon has been tweaking and perfecting for what.. like 20 years now. The purple color is beautiful and unusual and I recieved numerious positive coments on it. I got it because in a world where everything of quality seems to be black or silver it stands out and is also easy for me to spot when I leave it sitting around the house.","So far so good, I love the fact that I can take this small camera everywhere with me. My only complaint is that my hands shake and I have trouble taking clear photos because of that. Still reading the manual, hoping there is a setting that will help me with my problem. Otherwise I love it. Get a Case Logic QBP-301Purple Point and Shoot Camera Case  to go with it.  Small enough to put in your jeans pocket & take everywhere you go.","Great camera","Small, lightweight, easy to use and takes great photos!  It was the perfect camera for our trip abroad.","Excellent camera.","Small. Easy to carry. Longer battery life than my old camera. My old camera had to be connected to the computer to download photos. This one has an SD Card which is great for transferring photos. I would buy another.","Great camera, easy to use, terrific pictures","What i expected","Purchased for my Mother for her first trip to Japan.  My mom is not very technologically savvy. I allowed her to figure out how to use the camera and its' features on her own - partly to determine the user friendliness of the product but also to get her to embrace technology.<br /><br />She found the camera very easy to use and managed not only to take beautiful pictures of Japan but also bring back some video from her trip too!<br /><br />Attached is a photo she took with the camera.  Beautiful isn't it?!","Best camera I've ever owned! Does a great job on pictures though I'm no photographer. I really like the picture quality but this little thing shines on the video end. Nice and crisp videos and with the picture stabilization it is wonderful.<br /><br />I'm still learning about it so haven't gone through all the paces. Last camera I had was a Sony cybershot and I always hated it. Took forever for the shutter to engage after I pushed the button and I missed shots all the time. This takes the picture when I want to not when it wants to.<br /><br />Best part by far is the true point and shoot set up. I don't understand all the technical stuff and wanted something I could point and shoot period.","Takes beautiful sharp pictures.  The door cover for the battery and SD card is very fragile.  The booklet that comes with the camera lacks a lot of information to questions you may have.  I don't use the Wifi feature, very confusing with information in the booklet.  Overall I wanted a high pixel camera, small to fit in my purse or pocket, and fairly easy to use...this camera met these for me.  But I still love my small Kodak M1073 which is no longer available.","This is one of the most awesome point and shoot camera's I have had the opportunity to use!! I have a professional canon camera and had a nikon and this takes even better pic's than my professional canon and nikon!!  And it's PURPLE!!!","So far I like it.  The screen is very clear and easy to see.  It takes good quality photos and seems to hold a charge for quite a while.  I am so happy!","The camera slipped from my hand as I was getting out of the car and the front of the camera partially came off- not the same as it was. Cheaper quality. Still takes great<br />Pics","Love it great pictures","This a great camera","This is a very cool little camera.  It has many spify features for its size. If you want a small full funtion high resolution camera this is it. If you have small hands you will like this camera.","From a day one aspect, it does what it is supposed to do.  This is my 3rd Canon ELPH, previous models being the 110 HS and 330 HS.<br />No discernable difference in picture quality when compared to my 330.<br />Zoom has greatly improved, and has a bit better image stabilization vs the 330.  MP4 has replaced the aged MOV format for videos.<br /><br />I am NOT a camera techie, and don't use half the features on this camera, but know a good picture when I see one, and one of the main things that impress me with the ELPH line is how great pictures and videos look when displayed on a large screen TV.  That's the test for me... I've purchased other models that failed, and were returned.<br />It's true that today, many cellphones take WONDERFULL pictures and vids, but you are NOT going find  the kind of zoom that point and shoots have.  When on vacation, I'd have to say 50% of my pictures involve the use of the zoom lens.  Actual cameras are still relevant in today's cellphone centric world (at least for the time being).<br /><br />The REAL reason I upgraded this go around (my 330 is in excellent working condition) was that Canon FINALLY made MP4 the format for the 360's videos.  Although previous versions took wonderful HD videos, you have no idea how frustrating it is to transfer a video to your phone, and having to convert it from MOV format first!  Converting formats always involves a loss of quality, and I never understood why an Apple format had to be standard on a non-Apple device. MOV is an age old format and MP4 beats it hands down, and is playable on almost any PC or Android device.<br /><br />Nit-picking... this model has a flimsier battery/card door, and using the Wi-Fi feature I had to use \"manual\" steps to do so, as the \"auto\" feature would recognize the device, but not connect.... not a big thing, but would be nice if it would connect to devices as easily as cellphones do these days.<br /><br />Over all, I'm quite happy with the camera, and feel the ELPH series offer the best pictures and smallest size in the compact point and shoot category. If it didn't....I wouldn't be on my third model of the line.  My first ELPH (110HS) is still working wonderfully 5 yrs later, the only reason I upgrade is for the improved features .  I can't recommend this camera highly enough...it's GREAT.<br /><br />A piece of good advice is when buying a case...look for a hard/semi hard \"clamshell\" type case.  My ELPHs look and act pristine after years of use, because they are well protected when being carried or not in use.  Pouch style cases won't protect your camera from bumps or accidental drops, which I have encountered many times, and have had no ill effects due to the clam shell cases superior protection.<br /><br />Update 4-24-16<br />Just got back from a Vegas trip, where this camera was use extensively.  I had nose bleed seats at the T-Mobile Arena Guns n Roses concert.  My 1080p cellphone camera could not capture stage action, as the low light filter does not work in zoom mode (all it could capture at full zoom was a blurry mess).  Was able to get video with my HS 360 in zoom mode clear enough to actually capture facial expressions....GREAT video, from some of the worst seats in a 40,000 seat arena. How can you beat that from an ultra compact point and shoot?  When filming in full HD, I was getting about 45 mins a battery (I took 2 extra).  Low light ability is A LOT better than my Note 4's camera.  In DAYLIGHT....my cellphone takes excellent pictures and video....at NIGHT....not so much.  Glad I had this camera with me.<br />If you are taking pictures, expect to get 300+ to a battery charge....video, around 45-60 mins.  Extra batteries are cheap and quite fast to change out when filming extensively....well worth the money.","So I have only used this camera a bit but thought I would put up a first impression post now, and I will update it in a month or so. I am not a professional photographer but my main camera is a Cannon EOS Rebel T3 Canon EOS Rebel T3 Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (discontinued by manufacturer). I also have not fully read the instruction booklet yet either.<br /><br />Pros:<br />--------------<br />1) Small & Light Weight: One of my co-workers tossed the box holding the camera to me and didn’t think there was a camera inside of it.<br />2) Great Distance view: I will get a series of photographs I took during my lunch break from our back door. We are 0.7 miles from the cranes in the picture. I was able to get a good enough distance picture to read the manufacturers. I am not sure if I can do that on my Rebel T3 with just the normal lens.<br />3) Filter Settings: I have not gone through all the settings yet. However, there is a setting where the camera will take 3+ pictures and change the filter automatically. I just took a picture of the texture on the ceiling to test this and it was pretty neat.<br /><br />Cons:<br />------------------<br />1) The first thing I noticed while taking pictures outside is that it is hard to see what you are shooting in the display screen. I tried taking pictures in the shade and direct sun and in both instances I really had to struggle to see.<br />2) Close up images: I tried using this vs the camera in my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone to take pictures of my Beta Fish tank at work. I found that out of 8 attempted shots only 2 came out non-blurry while using the cannon. I have purchased the same SD card that I would use for my Rebel T3 so that should not cause the delay .<br /><br />Overall so far I am happy. I am marking it at 4 for now but mattering how things change once I read the directions it might be lowered. If I am spending $200 on a camera I want it to work outside. I wanted this camera to ride in my purse on the go since I don’t always want to carry the bulky DSLR.

Would differently buy again!","Ordered a green camera, but received a black one.  Somebody replaced the sticker on the outside of the box.  Other than that,  it works great.","Great camera!!!","great resolution and quality.","I used this camera for 2 weeks in salt water,  I have not had any issues with it. It also takes good pictures out of the water. Battery life is good. I can leave it on for most of 1-1 1/2 hour snorkel swim and not run the battery out. I ordered the green model but received black, but that did not change performance.  The only problem I have not found an answer for is when I use it in underwater mode, every time i turn it on it enables the flash. I have to manually disable the flash. As I use this snorkeling, the flash lights up all the bubbles. There may be a way to change this, but I have not found it yet. Nice compact camera for outdoor and wet use.","Waterproof is nice but quality of pictures is worse than cell phone quality","Great camera; fits in my pocket and meets expectations.","Love this camera. Glad I settled on this one. Took great pictures, even in murky water.","It did everything I wanted at a HIGH rate.  I video underwater is so clear.  Stills underwater also detailed.  Wonderful surprise how AMAZING the clarity it took as an action camera.","This camera takes GREAT pictures.  I purchased 4 for our business, they are durable and easy to handle.","No comment yet, still setting it up.","My wife loves it.","Great product. Fast shipping","Awesome camera","Great photos. Waterproof and durable. I was a bit surprised at how heavy the camera is. I guess that is the 'tough' case. That may be an issue if you want to lug it around the ski slopes.<br />Don't take out the warranty. I's not covered by Amazon but a third party called Warrantech. The registration process is nightmare. I thought I was all signed up but they send you and a goose chase of e-mails and web sites with links that don't work. I still have not managed to register the warranty.","Camera seems ok. Ordered it green...received black.","I love this camera. I had the first generation of olympus waterproof cameras and nearly cried when it died after four years of extensive use. I made the mistake of purchasing three nikon versions before returning to Olympus, and I'll never switch again. I love my Nikon professional camera, but for waterproof point and shoot, this does the trick.","Great camera but think hard about the warranty, this will be my second Tough camera, the first one still works but the flip screen doesn't anymore. Had I purchased the warranty four years ago I would have been out that money too, the flip screen stopped working almost four years to the day.","The best camera the information buy really good  picture and waterproof","I love this camera! Works great. It takes great pictures and videos and I don't have to worry about it when I am in the water. I use it for taking more than under water pictures too and they turn out great. I did buy a wrist band that snaps on and off and floats so it wouldn't sink!","We love it","This camera is awesome if you're on the fence just jump over and buy it already.","Great camera, good video/picture resolution. Just as good as a GoPro, but to be honest I feel the GoPro has a slight advantage on quality of picture.","Awesome little camera! Used this on vacation in the virgin islands and captured tons of great footage. Easy to use and small enough to tuck in a bag or your board shorts. No issues with leaking. Had this under water for and in the sand for a week. It can def take a beating. Highly recommend! Hard to beat something that has so many functions for the price.","It was good for our honeymoon, but I really didn't like the pictures it took at night.  I couldn't find the right settings for some situations, but it worked alright.","I had the older version of this camera, and I love this one even more!<br />1- the battery actually stays in the camera when its charging<br />2- the flip screen makes it easy to take a selfie or two when you are traveling by yourself","Overall, this is a decent camera. I like the overall build and the flip up selfie screen. The front button is in an awkward location to use your left thumb for a selfie and it's easier to use the regular button on top. The photo quality is nothing to brag about and the battery life is not good. I have 4 Canon cameras from an SLR to a small point and shoot and you can't beat the battery life. Olympus definitely needs some tips on batteries from Canon. I used this camera underwater 5 or 6 times with no problems. I recently went to Cancun and I had taken a lot of photos and some while snorkeling. I later went to review the photos and the camera would not turn on. I opened the battery compartment and it was dry but there were signs of moisture behind the lens. There were NO photos on my SD card and I was highly disappointed. The only good thing was the warranty claim procedure through Amazon. I didn't have to do anything but put the camera and accessories in a box and tape it up. UPS picked it up and even put on the label. This was awesome Amazon!!!!  Unfortunately, I received a camera back about 2 weeks later and it was a refurbished one and the screen was all scratched up. The camera seems to work fine and I've not tried this one in water yet. No longer than I had it, it should have been replaced with a new one!<br /><br />I'm still stumped as to why my photos disappeared from the card. I've washed flash drives and SD cards and they are pretty forgiving. A big electrical short maybe? Who knows but that card still works in another camera.","Before this camera I had another waterproof Olympus that I loved for 5 or 6 years before it finally broke on vacation. I haven't had a chance to use this very much, but it's definitely held true to being waterproof. The green color is really fun, and so far the photo quality has been great. The flip around screen is also super helpful!","I am an amateur photographer; this is my first camera in 13 years.  I bought the TG-870 before going to rain-soaked, rough areas of Costa Rica.  I replaced the default 1 GB flash (which would hold a relatively brief video or fewer pictures) with 32 GB storage.  I read the camera's user manual and practiced before I left. As stated elsewhere, the battery case double lock feature prevented water from shorting out the camera and it was also not affected by the rough travel.<br />I had difficulty with two features:  1) The battery life is very short.  After taking 50 to 75 pictures and no video each day, I had to recharge the battery every night.  2) The \"super macro\" focus software is hysteretic: I had to get within ~10 cm (4 in) of an insect to get the camera to focus even though the display showed the auto focus transitioned through an \"in focus\" picture.  After the S/W achieved auto-focus, I could pull the camera back twice as far and auto-focus worked.","Purchased for my daughter's month-long trip to Spain for a language immersion class.  It was a great investment as she shared photos via the Internet.  Now it will join us on float trips and hikes.","Interesting camera. Works well. Waterproof so far.  Flip up is nice for selfies. Screen is a little hard to see in bright sun.  Larger screen sucks on batteries a bit which is expected.  Pic quality is pretty good but I would prefer a bit better for the money.  But a broken camera does not take good pictures and this one seems pretty tough. It will sink if you don't have a float on it so beware.","wow i love this camera!! I bought it for a vacation to greece.  I snapped a few pics around the house and there were just ok, but this thing shines in an outdoor environment.  the screen flips and reorients for selfies.  the Wifi works perfectly and the app is really solid.  It is also really rugged, it was banged around on hikes and showed no signs of wear.  I took a few underwater pics that were just ok, but they are not really ever that good.  ALSO the buttons are really intuitive.  There are separate buttons for photo and video so you aren't rotating a dial like most cams and there is a \"quick shot\" button for an instant photo.","Best camera I ever own I have fancier cameras but the thing about this camera me and my son can go on a trip and I don't have to worry about the camera ,it can get wet ,I can drop it still works. Footage is not bad and it's practical<br />Like I said better cameras out there but for the convenience of this camera is so much more worth than it cost .<br />Check out my channel I shot 3 days with my son 2 days at Disneyland and 1 at soak city you'll see how it shoots day and night and in water<br />[...]","Love it.  Connected to wifi easily.","I use this camera for hiking and not for everyday use.<br />I use this camera only for hiking in the tropics so its relatively slow lens is not an issue for me. If you hike in the forests of North America then the TG-4 with its much faster lens is probably better for you. I do like the better video quality from this newer camera than my old TG-3. But it does have the noisy autofocus that puts loud clicks on the audio track when recording video (other reviewers have also reported this so my camera is not a one-off). I usually replace my video with a music bed so this significant defect is not much of an issue for me. If you intend to use the sound track when recording video, this camera is not for you. I can't image how a bunch of Olympus executives would o.k. a camera with this *defect* for sale.<br />The best things about this camera are its wide wide lens, it's 1080 60p video, and its remarkable close focusing capability. In summary, this is not an \"average\" WP camera. The good parts (video quality, wide wide lens, macro photography) are very good for the price IMO.<br />The bad parts (audio \"quality\" and slow lens) are significantly bad.","haven't had a chance to use it yet...but I owned one previously and loved it.","I've taken this camera through a lot of water, both salt and fresh. How nice to not have to worry about how good the seals are. I love that the camera's lens is wide enough for tight shooting. My only disappointment is the quality of the photos.  Lots of purple fringing on distant foliage against clear skies.  Photos are not quite as contrasty and snappy as photos from non-waterproof brands. I'd still purchase it again.","This camera takes the picture but you have to know where to take photo upclose. You stand too far then the subject looks too small. Simple enough for just pics in the water.","everything good but, the blades did not cut.","I bought this camera because of the beating it can take. My intentions are to use it for just my vlogging camera and snap a few pics here and there while out hiking. so far the camera hasn't really let me down. here is a video I did using the 870.<br /><br />[...]","Great camera","I bought this specifically for a 6 day river trip.  It's worked well with my Apple software.  The picture quality was good and it was tough on the outside.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I've seen other photos from similar cameras that seemed sharper.  Could be the user (me) but not sure.","great camera I recently used it on a trip to costa rica and getting it wet almost everyday. Used it in the ocean catching the kids surfing used it under waterfalls and in downpours . Nice wifi to transfer pictures it is a great feature. It takes a nice photo with some great options. While I simply point and shoot my daughter had some fun with the art features","[[VIDEOID:734bd6df62247ecc1eb19a67905133ca]] This is an amazing camera.  Bought it for our vacation to Punta Cana and was SO SO SO happy with it.  Pictures in water and out came out great.  This is a very durable camera that can go with you to capture all the exciting moments!  Would recommend to anyone!","Camera is excellent quality and we used it while snorkeling without a single problem.","Cool camera","A plus","my wife loves the selfie flip screen feature. She has broken her last couple cameras so hopefullly this one lasts longer.","Gave this camera as a gift to someone who constantly has problems taking clear and pictures in focus...I won't mention who (ahem..MOM).<br />She loves taking pictures of the grandkids, but with all their funny faces and crazy karate moves, it's super hard to get a clear picture. I specifically was looking for a camera that had a super fast shutter speed so she could capture my son practicing his high kick skills (probably right into my daughter's head). So far this camera has been working great. The pictures are MUCH more in focus and the calls stating that she is having camera problems has stopped (Thanks Olympus!)","My third. A VERY good camera.","This is the best point & shoot camera on the market.  Helps that it is shock proof and water proof.  This is our second Olympus Tough!","I love this camera! This is my second Olympus Tough series camera and as a world traveler, I can say they are the best kind of point and shoot for adventurous people. Mine has been skydiving, snorkeling, rafting, surfing, rock climbing and trail running. . . it still works after getting wet and being dropped multiple times. It is a wonderful product.","I love this camera.  It is my 2nd Olympus Tough Water Proof Camera.  I broke my fist one by jumping into the pool while the battery compartment was open.  Totally my fault.  I've owned the Fuji XP and the Nikon Cool Pix water proof Cameras.  Neither lasted a full summer.  I have used this on in the Ocean, Pool and Creek.  Pictures turned out Great.  I use it as a 2nd camera for when I don't want to take my bigger camera out.  Attaching an underwater pic my 7 yr old grand daughter took and a picture out of the water.","It works well and easy to use and dry","great camera with a wide vareity of shooting and mounting options. Several different underwater modes.","Great camera for the money. Got it for a cruise and had a blast with it. No problems with leaks and pics turned out great. Loved the selfie feature with the flip screen!","This has been a great little camera for taking action shots of pets at our animal hospital.","Great little waterproof camera. We use it daily in our body shop because we need to take pictures even in the rain.","We owned an older model of this camera, so we bought this model to update our aging point and shoot. This camera has 'neat' wifi technology and a swivel view-finder.<br /><br />BUT, I wish this model of waterproof and 'tough' Olympus camera had a lens cover; although we haven't scratched the lens yet, I am sure it will happen as we are using it in non-delicate situations. I have already noticed that without a lens cap, the lens is often dirty or streaky when I pull it out for a quick picture.<br /><br />I am also disappointed in the quality of pictures this camera takes. In regular light situations, I don't see much difference from my phone's camera.<br /><br />I think this camera is also lacking the ability to switch it's focus point.<br /><br />Because we were so happy with our 2005-6 model of this camera, I am disappointed that the technology and quality of this camera didn't improve in 10 years.","I have taken this down the river twice and in the lake once. It has been wonderful! I recommend this camera. It is tough and takes exceptional photos.","I went the Caribbean in April 2016 and I used the camera on the beach and at the pool and it took amazing videos and pictures! Well worth the money. Be sure to follow instructions and after every water use, rinse it for about 10 min or so to get any debris left off from it. And it should work like you just took it out the package. I would suggest purchasing an extra battery. Battery life could be a little better.","What a great camera. As a mom with three kids, we are always on the go. It's nice to have a camera that is so durable. It's definitely held up to the shock proof test! I've dropped several times and it is just as perfect as the day I got it. The kids of course are always wanting to see and it gets manhandled pretty well. It's easy to set up and program.","Perfect!","This is purchased for the intention of using at Hershey Park & Dutch Wonderland. I did use a waterproof/shockproof camera before and this is ALMOST just as good - which is why it's not 5 star.<br /><br />During the daytime, taking photos is good. It does take some time practicing with different scenes/settings to get the photo you like. I found it annoying trying to use the specific scene that it's programed. For instance if I was to use the underwater setting, and then get out of the pool, I would have to change the setting. And it takes quite some time. There were a few times where I missed a great moment (my 2 YO was doing) because I had to change the setting. If I don't change the scene setting the image would be a blur, or the colors would be weird. The scenes also take a while to write which I found to be VERY ANNOYING. I would snap a picture and it'll go \"busy......\" for maybe 30seconds. During that 30 seconds writing it's very difficult to stay still - like mentioned I have a 2 YO.<br /><br />At night, all the annoyance is 10x worse! It's SOOOOOOO  hard to get a picture with out having it either a) super blurry, or b) orange. I still can't figure out how to take night time pictures with this camera. Maybe I just need to play with the settings more but it shouldn't be this difficult. especially since there is an 'outdoor night' scene.<br /><br />Videos. I tried taking videos the first few days getting this camera. It ate up so much battery!!! I used it for 2 hours and the battery drained to 1 bar! I was so upset because I wasn't even at the waterpark yet which is what this camera is bought to used at!!!!! After maybe 2 days (our last day at PA) I finally found out that if I put the camera to iAuto it took up less battery. It also surprisingly took better pictures too - still doesn't work that well at night time though.<br /><br />Like mentioned earlier, I did use another sport camera too and that camera was so much easier to use than this.<br /><br />Charging is easy. Don't need to take the battery out and charge (though you can if you have one of those chargers). It charges like you charge any device via USB. I think it charges pretty quick about a couple hours and it's fully charged.<br /><br />I think the wrist strap that came with this was horrible. It's thick and wide so it got in the way of the buttons. Aside from that, it was also uncomfortable on the wrist. So I had to find another wrist strap that's narrow and comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Overall, the camera's not bad. but there is room for some improvement.","I've used this camera for a few months now, and so far it works well.  The zoom function is smooth, and will work during the movie mode.  The movie mode uses .mov file extension, which is a pain to work with, but with a good converter, it isn't a show stopper.  The flip up \"Selfie\" feature is interesting, but I think over time it may weaken the display, so I don't use it much.","Really is very rugged. We are a large active family with 4 kids from 8 to 16 and thus camera stood up to them! Beaches caving snorkeling hiking being dropped dragged etc. there is a scratch across the screen but it has not been \"handled with care\" so not surprised. Functioned well in and out of water. Have been traveling for a few weeks so haven't transferred photos to large screen yet but what I've seen in playback so far looks great. We had extra SD CARD and bought the travel charger and an extra rechargeable battery and switched out each day which has worked great for us.","This was purchased to take on an 8 day Disney Cruise to avoid bringing our big nice camera. It was surprisingly fantastic! It took great pics, was small, easy to carry and we discovered that you can flip the screen on the back up to do a \"selfie\" with the camera! Definitely would buy this! The only negative is we wish the battery would last longer. We used it a lot! Good thing is not knowing how the battery charge would last since it was new before the trip, we did go ahead and buy two extra batteries and a charger so that we always had enough battery power!","I love my Olympus  waterproof cameras. They are great for those beach trips when  you don't want to worry about ruining your camera!! This camera allows for many different lighting situations. I have also  charged from my car charger-- that is great!","Awesome point and shoot camera! Bought it for an upcoming trip to Hawaii. Gave it a spin on a recent trip to the adirondacks.Took beautiful pictures all around. So easy to use! Love the various settings you can select Mountain panoramas, group selfies, fireworks. The best was the day we floated on the lake and were able to toss the camera around in the lake and shoot various pictures. I was then able to upload my favorites to my camera with ease using the wifi connection (even with poor cell service in the mountains). HIghly recommend this little camera.","I have been using it everyday for work as I am a full time home inspector and it has worked really great! The only thing I would improve is when taking video it light up the led for some light in dark areas.","We bought this camera to take underwater photos on our trip to Grand Cayman.  Unfortunately, we FORGOT to buy a memory card and so couldn't use it on our trip.  It had been so long since we had used a digital camera, we totally forgot you need a memory card.  We noticed, however, that our tour guide on our stingray excursion in Grand Cayman had the same exact camera and his photos were spectacular.  We discovered this for ourselves when we finally got the memory card and took our own pictures.","Amazing camera great pictures!","Completely perfect! Nothing wrong besides the buttons Are a bit close and harder to press, but that's not a big deal.","It was put to the rest fresh and salt water forgot and left it in the sink all night no problem takes great pictures.","Love the color and the durability and the fact that the camera is waterproof makes its a much needed option for a camera that you need to use in environments that may not be the perfect location. Not overly fond of the battery tho.","This camera has been to the Caribbean for a week of diving and snorkeling, has been used at the pool and every other trip we have gone on over the past several months.  The camera takes great photos above and below the water.  The wide angle lens can easily capture large groups for the selfies or inside when everyone is around the Thanksgiving table.  The fact that you can flip the screen up and use the button on the front of the camera for self portraits is fantastic....especially when you want to prove that you went diving too.  Battery seems to last for a really long time and as long as you can keep the flashes to a minimum you can really get a lot of daytime pics.  Well worth the money, you will not be disappointed.","Excellent tough camera.  As stated often by many reviewers, you will get the best results outside in good light.  It is very responsive, and the focus is quite accurate.  It gives good color and resolution.  I have owned every olympus tg product and this did not disappoint.  The articulating screen is really great.  It belongs on the TG-4 as well.","easy to use, beautiful pictures, awesome quality","I used on vacation. It took great videos & pictures. I took photos & videos under water, they turned out great.","Great camera! have used it multiple times in all different types of settings and it does not disappoint! I would buy again in a heartbeat","This camera is amazing. Ritz camera shipped it and I got is super fast in perfect condition. I have taken beautiful underwater shots, and indoor shots too. It works great for what I bought it for, outdoor use. My only complaint is that the zoom in and out is slow to react, other than that great camera.","Purchased this camera to take on a Florida vacation.<br /><br />In terms of construction and toughness - we used it in the salt water at an ocean beach in Miami, several hotel pools and had no issues with it. The camera held up against everything we threw at it, including my 9 and 5 year old kids =)<br /><br />The pictures we got off the camera were actually surprisingly awesome. In daytime light, the pictures are great. In the water, things also were better than expected. Lower light situations the camera seemed to struggle a bit but that might be to be expected for a camera in this price range.<br /><br />One feature I like playing with is the time lapse feature. It's pretty interesting to set up an interesting scene and let it capture for a while and then see what you get in the end.","So far this is a great camera, i went diving with it a couple of times. Under water its difficult to see the screen so you rather have to guess","I don't know what all fuss is about this camera not taking good indoor photos. Mine works indoors just fine. The camera is so easy to use. Just set it in \"P\" and flash in automatic. The indoor photos are awesome.","This is a great rugged point and shoot. Took it snorkeling and was amazed at the photos it took.  If I had anything to complain about it would be the app the remote control functions needs refinement.","nice camera, take wonderful pictures. 1080p video is awesome.","So tbh I haven't tested this in the water which is my main goal, but the pics I took just to test it are so far so great. Easy to use and maneuver through settings. I'm super excited to use this in the water!","Really like the camera. Great!","This was a great camera. We picked it up for our roadtrip through Utah national parks and dido it's job perfectly. Kept our expensive phones safely packed away and had this guy out and didn't care if it got bumped or wet. Pictures synced up to phone and had everything backed up without having to plug anything in.","Amazing!!!","Sent it back not because it wasn't the tough camera for me; for new technology's ; it's GPS works off the wi-fi  from your phone that's 2 batteries that must be in-tuned. The G4 has its own internal gps. & compass. If this is not important for you get The TG-780","I was looking for a reasonably priced camera to take underwater pictures. It camera was a very good choice. I took fantastic pictures. It was a little hard to figure out, but once I did, it was great. the colors is very lifelike and the pictures are very sharp. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to take great pictures and video.","So I had the TG-860<br />It says waterproof, however my Screen broke off in a snowy day. It's just dark, not showing anything! Camera is still working.<br />So, I call the Olympus, they say they don't take any responsibility if it breaks with any water, I got confuse..<br />I tweet they say they will help, call that number, I call, and same thing! No help! Unless I pay them $100!!!<br />I wish they stay behind your words!!!!!!! If you say it's waterproof, and if gets water in, maybe take responsibility and see WHY it happened!<br />So I hate them! Such a TERRIBLE customer service, that you have to talk some oversea countries!<br />---<br />But camera is so good. Especially outdoors, if you're taking videos.<br />Or with a natural light. Both photos and videos are wide angle. Amazing colors. You can see them in my instagram @girlonthebikeny<br />I bought the newest version http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01950SVFQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01950SVFQ&linkCode=as2&tag=nesliozdem-20&linkId=VYMZIBSZR3FFZDO2<br /><br />I bought it because it's awesome, the new one is with the WIFI, I can take and then post on instagram immediately with many features in it. You can even do cartoon feature! Love it!<br /><br />Company sucks with their customer service though.<br />Wait for my YouTube review!!!!!!<br />Camera is awesome!<br />I'm soooo scared, I don't believe it's waterproof, so I'm not taking it to water this time!<br />MOFOS!","Great little underwater tough camera. I love the flip screen. I have the Olympus TG-4 also which is superior but I purchased this as a backup. Very good quality and fun to play with selfies. I really like that the flip screen allow me to see what I'm shooting when holding the camera low. I haven't had it long and will post an update later after more use.","Indoor shooting is horrid, but that was expected and not the intended use for the camera. Composite shooting with non-moving subjects works great inside, but don't plan on using that on people. Seems well built, but I can hear a slight rattling from within the camera's body. Not concerned about that, but this thing is supposed to survive a 6-foot drop. Powers on VERY quickly, has integrated GPS and the wi-fi functionality is dead simple. If Olympus would just upgrade the optics, this would be an amazing camera. As-is it's a very portable weatherproof camera that will take acceptable pictures in sunlight. Attached is a sample 10-second composite shot shot in my bathroom and another picture taken in natural light.","Great camera with nice features. Software for transfer to phone freezes and a pain to use.","I bought this camera as a gift.  My daughter-in-law loves it.  She loves the fact that she doesn't have to worry about it getting wet or dropped in the pool.","I have to return my first one due to a leak after using it during caving/underground river activity in Mexico-- It's a good thing my memory card was still working after that. Very stressful :(  The GOOD thing-- Seller replaced the item free of charge (and after i returned the damaged product).  Now I am \"breaking in\" my new one to see HOW Tough it can get. I bought a green one for a friend as a gift and that one (if the color has anything to do with it) is working great since day 1.","[[VIDEOID:fb0e8bc0784f3c94ee7e03eb8d84c177]]As a semi-professional photographer with a lot of experience using professional grade Canon and Nikon cameras, I was somewhat leery of dropping $200+ bucks on an Olympus point and shoot with a supposed 16MP, with \"tons\" of underwater features, and wifi.  I have always found that when a product attempts to pack in a ton of features, quality suffers...however, with a last minute snorkeling trip to the keys planned, I swung by my local Best Buy on the way down (for the same price as Amazon) and picked one up.<br /><br />Before you go looking for the instruction manual, let me save you some trouble...there isn't one in the box. You will have to go online to look at it, however, the interface is extremely intuitive and you probably won't need it.  Most of the camera settings can be adjusted on the fly while shooting from an on-screen flyout menu that you can control with the up and down arrows.  I like that a lot, and it made switching settings extremely easy.<br /><br />The camera has a nifty little thumb-turn knob, that lets you easily get to 'scene' mode. This is where you want to stay if you are shooting underwater. This mode automatically deactivates the flash so you don't get the debris cloud, and this setting is where this camera really shines. With the press of a button when in scene mode, you can select from the side fly-out menu between \"Underwater Action\" for fast moving shots, \"Underwater Scene\" for those nice landscape shots, and \"Underwater Macro\" for some up-close shots of coral and shells.  The underwater mode adds natural looking saturation and color adjustment, to accurately record what you are seeing with your eyes. They did a great job with this.<br /><br />...but wait, in the middle of shooting you see a Peacock Parrotfish swim by and want to switch to video!...<br /><br />NO SWEAT!  If you are in macro, just a click of the button will put you back in either Underwater Landscape or Action modes, then you just press the red record button. That's it!!  I can tell you from personal experience, this came in extremely useful when I came across a spotted moray eel!  The battery lasted us about 3 hours of continuous use, so if you are going to be out all day, I highly recommend purchasing 2 additional batteries to bring along, which we did.<br /><br />There is also a nifty high speed recording feature that records at either 120 or 240 frames per second, for super slow playback when jumping into the water for example.  Even though the camera also offers 1080p 60fps, the best quality, color, and contrast was when shooting is at 1080p 30fps.<br /><br />It does have a lot of other features as well, one which surprisingly, were also of very good quality and just as intuitive.  Olympus offers a smartphone app, that is extremely easy to use.  You turn on wifi on the camera, and then from the app on your smartphone, point the camera at the QR code that displays on the phone screen.  This is a one time action, and from there on forward the wifi will auto connect when using the app after you turn it on in the camera.  You can view photos and video from the camera on your phone wirelessly, download to your phone, or share right from the app.  With no internet out on the boat, sharing to facebook via this app and my phone was an amazing feature to have! Great thinking Olympus!<br /><br />I had a lot of fun with this little camera.  Even though it is only rated for ~44ft depth for about an hour, I will be purchasing the external case that will allow it to be used for deeper scuba dives.  For just over $200 it really is a great buy and I am extremely pleased with this purchase!<br /><br />NOTE:  The photos and video posted are without any post-processing or adjustment. They are displayed exactly as taken by the camera.","Bought this for our son and he loves it.  The features are many and the quality is excellent.  We'll see how it holds up over time as he spends a lot of time outdoors.","I pre ordered the camera in January before a planed trip to Maui, I wanted a camera that was water proof and count take HD video,we used it snorlking, hiking,indoors and outdoors I'm very happy I spent quite some time going over all the settings so to know what to use indoors outdoors and underwater,for the price I think it's a very good action tough camera, the flip up LCD screen is great for selfies you can see exactualy what your framing in the shot","Compact and versatile. Would recommend to anyone.","Great camera for what I wanted to use it for!  This takes great quality photos in bright, outdoor locations.  I bought it as a vacation camera to use while scuba diving and swimming and all around activity.  I love the flip up LCD for selfie photos.  I do have a different point and shoot camera that takes better quality photos, but for it's class of tough and waterproof camera, I feel like it can't be beat.","Not impressed","My camera was stolen a while ago, so I needed something new for an upcoming trip to Australia. My iPhone is coming of course, but I don't want to take any risky chances with it. This camera fits the bill perfectly. I could knock it for not taking the best pictures, but this isn't that type of camera. This is a take it with you and never worry about the fragility of it type of camera. I got a bundle for it that included a floaty wrist strap, extra battery and wall charger, and a form fitting rubber case. The wifi capabilities means I can use the iPhone as a remote and upload pictures and videos to the iPhone for sharing purposes. And the GPS tagging comes in handy but be warned, it and the wifi sap battery power significantly. So turn this and wifi off when you don't need them. The fact that is has the wide angle lens and flip up screen for selfies is what won me over.","Excellent","This was purchased to be used in a warehouse for pictures of merchandise be shipped to customers and for returns on damaged items.  The warehouse is not a clean environment, but this camera is holding up well and very reliable.","Received camera quuckly. Largest capacity SD card is 128G.","Thanks","Great little camera. The widescreen shooting option is great, it lets you capture more. The panoramic mode offers great shots and underwater shots are really clear. The selfie mode took a while to get use to, but went on a trip recently and used it quit a bit and the extra wide screen helps capture more in the background. Indoor shots are average at best. One note, don't leave the battery compartment door open for long periods. Humidity can get into the camera that way and cause fogging in the lens compartment. I learned that the hard way and used a hairdryer to get it dried out!","We were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the photos. Brought this with us to Disney and used on water rides and in the pool. Camera is nice and sturdy and settings were pretty easy to use. I just wish it had better low light settings. Overall, it's a great camera. If you plan to use aggressively throughout the day though, would suggest getting an additional battery.","Extremely impressed! These pics are just as good as my canon rebel T5i. In fact, I use it more just because it's much smaller and easier to take on excursions. I'm still learning the underwater pictures and such, but it is meeting my expectations for sure! A nice simple, small camera that takes good quality pictures. Easy to use. Well worth it! I've already dropped it and dunked it in the river and took pictures with it in the river! My only complaint, is that they should've made the screen flip. Meaning, flipping all the way around in every direction rather than just up and down. But other than that, two thumbs up! And yes, I've also played with it in the rain.","Finally got a chance to put this to the test last weekend while fishing. The clarity underwater was amazing.  I was able to see clearly what I was filming and the camera caught the fish in action as my nephew reeled it in.  I was even able to hear myself talk as he fought the fish!","Great size and weight. Seems to work well although I've only taken it on one trip. The only downfall I see so far is the zoom function. It doesn't have a lot of zoom capabilities.","Best water camera I have ever used!","Bought this as a gift for my wife for upcoming international trip and as it presented the ability for her to play in the pool with our godchild this summer. SHE IS THRILLED. Just as pictured and... ability to use smartphone as remote, quick shutter speed, high megapixels, long charge, lightweight and compact, simple user-interface, etc. - picture quality is the number one attribute, but she was effusive about the many qualities of this unit.","While the camera has lots of bells and whistles, cool features and appears well made...hence the 3 stars to be fair.  Despite hours and hours of messing with settings and taking photos, the only photos that were in the acceptable range even for its class were outdoor sunlight.  Anything else was noisy.  The movie capability was the most disappointing.  Camera struggled to maintain focus but most annoying of all was the internal warbles, clicks and hum that was captured on the sound track.  I had heard about this on prior generation of the series but assumed rare or you'd have really listen to hear.  But no, it was a very prominent electronic sound that competed with the sound intended in the movie.  I tried various approaches to minimize but I couldnt.  Also while I have a relatively current Android smartphone, the Olympus app would sometimes freeze the phone such that it was inoperable for a minute or more were you couldnt do anything at all.  I dont recall any app doing that and I have many of them.  In the end after only a couple days I sent the camera back, loss of 2 stars.","Great camera.","Great camera! It feels very well made and takes fantastic pictures/video, we're looking forward to taking underwater pics of our dogs swimming. Got it as a B-day present for the Mrs and I can definitely say this camera will get you laid!","[[VIDEOID:b66b40eb66703b0db8b150dec536cfaf]]The TG 870 looks great and feels comfortable holding right handed. The TG 870 also takes great photos and video for a camera with a 1 2.3\" sensor. The new 900,000 resolution flip up screen makes it easy to get low angle shots and the images look great while reviewing photos and video. This camera is suited to anyone looking for a action type camera, it delivers quality images in a tough compact package.  It's nice to setup this camera on a Gorilla Pod and not have to worry about rain, or if the dogs crash into it, or whatever.  I've tried every tough camera on the market and none of them are perfect, for what it's worth, the TG 870 is my favorite<br /><br />This website compresses the video.

Now I'm not much for reading manuals and I like watching You Tube videos of syuff I buy which is really helpful.  But one thing that did drive me crazy at first was the pop up viewfinder.  At first I thought it was broken because it always seemed out of focus.  But what I didn't know was that you can pull it out and adjust the clarity with a little lever on top.  Keep this in mind because of all the reviews I've read I've hardly seen this mentioned.  I almost returned the camera because I thought it was defective!  But after the adjustments the viewfinder is a great addition...especially when photographing outside!<br /><br />The video is pretty awesome too!  1080P...it's perfect for uploads to You Tube and having the ability to zoom up to 30X is great!

He enjoys photographing cars and this camera is compact and dies a beautiful job.","Amazing camera. Tiny, lightweight, incredible zoom, a usable eye piece, I have it with me most of the time. My computer is too old to be able to take advantage of the wifi connection which I didn't understand before I bought it","Great long zoom camera that fits in your jean pocket!  Amazing! Sony has done it again. Before this pocket camera, I would use my iPhone in situations where I did not want carry or shoot a larger camera.  Of course, in low light, the iPhone photos weren't great, particularly when I tried to zoom in in the subject, such as a Congressman at a political celebration.  With this camera, I was able to get long zooms in low light that came out surprisingly well.  It's never going to match a long zoom full format camera but those are 4 to 5 times the size of this camera.  This camera is a real winner and makes taking a great camera with you anywhere so much easier.","I like the pop up viewfinder and movable view screen. These make it easier to take photos in bright sun. This camera doesn't have all the features I had on my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX50V.","I am an amateur photographer.  I need a camera that does the work for me.  The zoom is fantastic.  The wifi transfer of photos from the camera to my phone and my computer is really easy.  The video and panorama features work really well. The panorama feature corrects for movement and uneven speed as you turn the camera.  The results are so smooth, it looks like you were on a trolley. The battery lasts quite a long time.  I could not be more pleased.","Nice simple point and shoot camera. Takes great pictures. Wish I would have paid $70-$80 more for the similar model, but has the added GPS feature.","great!! highly recommend","Still learning the camera operation, but so far it's easy to use.  But there is an awful lot to learn.  A hardcopy of the manual would be helpful.  Fully expect this would be 5 stars once I become proficient in it's operation.  Only complaint so far, while shooting it's very easy to 'bump' a button on the back and change a setting, especially if wearing gloves.  Maybe there's a way to disable these buttons, but I have not found it so far.  Otherwise, a very good deal, especially for the price.","Pleased with performance.  Compact and easy to carry.","The size is perfect.  I was able to zoom in on the eagles for some great pictures.  Still more to learn but very pleased so far on the performance.","Nice camera and lots of features. Need small hands to manipulate the dials, etc.Batter and memory card slot not too sturdy and you need tweezers to remove memory card.","Love this little camera.  I have DSLR cameras - and I wanted a tiny camera to complement such - i.e. when out shooting nature with a DSLR and long lens - I would also like to have a little pocket camera to capture the near scene and scenery.  This HX80 fits in the pocket of your trousers with a 30x zoom and a view-finder - and can take amazing shots.  With the tiny small sensor in the HX80 - will photos be as clear as a DSLR with a $2000 lens?  No.  Of course not.  But this camera for what is does - is genius.  The electronic viewfinder is critical for the images that I will attach here.<br /><br />I was out bird watching with my SWAROVSKI binos - and spotted this iguana (St. Maarten) sunning itself on a dead snag far in the distance.  Decided to try out my new HX80 to see what the zoom could do.  Zoom is really good - but it would be worthless in this case without a view finder.  See attached hand-held images for wide angle - and the 30x zoom on the iguana.  The red arrow in the wide angle shows where the iguana is sunning itself.<br /><br />Highly recommend as a nice pocket point and shoot.","I love this camera. I had originally purchased the Sony DSCHX90V/B but was not happy with it. One of the main reasons I purchased the 90V was the imbedded GPS. I learned that without the proper downloads no one else could see the GPS readings (as per Sony) so  that was a waste. I alos had difficulty ( as in  never) getting the WiFi to  connect with my computer.<br />I did a bit more research  and  decided to try the HB80 and I am very please with it.","I received this camera last week and have been shooting all weekend with it.  I've been shooting with Pentax products for years and this weekend I've been out with my Pentax k3 and the Sony HX 80.....  Birds along the sea shore and boats coming in and out.  I found the picture quality of the Sony was way above my expectations at all levels of magnification. Of course it doesn't shoot raw but the jpegs are hard to distinguish from the Pentax jpegs when displayed on my 40 inch monitor.  This camera is small and my hands are large but even so after a few minutes of use I found the controls easy to use and the view finder for the size is excellent.  I don''t shoot video and I haven't tried to figure out the wi-fi.  But frankly I'm astounded by the quality of this camera's images and coupled with the size and price, this is one great camera.  I had never shot with a 30x lens before.  What a new dimension that adds to one's photographic horizons.  Amazing photos; amazing quality.  Highly recommended camera.","Love it. fits in  my pocket and has many more features than I will ever use.","Absolutely thrilled with this!  It was everything I had hoped it would be.","didn't care for the small viewfinder","I have been a photographer for about 35 years, I have worked in high capacity photofinishing plants, and I have ran a 1-Hour photo shop for over 10 years. I have had all types of cameras, in all formats. I have had a number of digital cameras as well.<br />This camera, is one of the very best I have owned! The camera is fantastic in every category. The feel of the camera is incredibly solid, the quality of construction and assembly is beyond belief. The features and functions are truly unmatched, at this price, and at this compactness. Finally, the image quality is excellent. Anyone thinking about this purchase, that is worried about any aspect of its form or function, should not be worried at all. Grab this camera as fast as you can! (I purchased this camera on my own, I have had no compensation for my opinion, nor have a been given a camera for evaluation.","(comments added at end) I just bought this camera (from BestBuy), my 4th Sony p&s (most recent was HX30, which has been superb) and was somewhat taken aback when I kept getting a 'No memory card' error when I tried testing the video recording. Unlike the previous cameras, this one has no usable internal memory ( I had a chat session with Sony to verify that), though it will hold & display a single photo you've just taken. If you buy this camera you must also have a memory card for it in order to do anything (including verifying that it in fact works correctly). One other somewhat irksome 'feature' - it uses a different battery than the HX30, which required my purchasing a new wall-plug-in charger for it - I want a 2nd battery charging while I'm using the camera. The reason I upgraded from the HX30 is this camera's pop-up viewfinder - regardless of what camera manufacturers think, an LCD screen is utterly useless in bright sunlight! Finally using & experimenting with it, I've discovered that the icons in the screen display cannot be edited to one's preference! Really aggravating given that (a) there are only 3 different screen displays, (b) only 1 of which keeps battery strength on-screen, and (c) it's not possible to alter those displays to contain ONLY the setting icons that matter to the user. I chatted with Sony support and posted this question/complaint on Sony's FB page and they agreed - no modifications of the displays. Bad software design!!","I’m not overly impressed with the picture quality. I do like the selfie-type flip screen on the HX80, but don’t think the RX100 fully flips up?<br />Also, I like the extra wide 24mm angle. If I were to switch to the RX100 iii, is it that much better than the HX80 to give up that wide angle? Is it worth losing a ton of optical zoom in the HX80 (30x) to go to 3.6? Is the approx. $$350 jump in price of the RX100 iii worth it?<br />I just wish there was an HX80 ii that had a bigger CMOS.","I'm still learning some of the features on the camera, but it takes good pictures and is easy to function.","Great camera for daily vlogging","Used it one weekend when I forgot the battery for my Nikon D7000. The view finder is reasonable. Not the image quality or ease of use of the D7000 but usable if you are not doing sports or moving wildlife. Color rendition is also better then most other point and shoot cameras I have used. The auto focus is reasonable, again, not a sports camera but otherwise good. I did not try using the \"face finding\" mode.  I always use a fixed focus point so that I have control over it. At least this camera gives you the choice.","Love love love this camera! I have a larger SONY (A6000) but enjoy the point and shoot of this one. Albeit a very nice point & shoot this camera is LOADED with capabilities and features. I love the pop up viewer, especially when the glare is high on the screen. GREAT purchase!","excellent small point and shoot.  Easy to use, takes great pics. Nice and small to carry in your pocket or belt case on trips if you don't want to lug around a SLR.  Would purchase again.  Had another Sony for many years with no issues, expecting same from this.","takes great photos.  I wanted the longer optical zoom (my Fuji with 20x had an exposure meter failure so was replacing that), and the reviews about shakiness at extended (i.e. digital) zoom distances is accurate, but I can deal with that.  I have no issue with the max optical zoom.  It is taking some time to get used to the different menus and how the back rotary dial changes what's on the screen - more complicated information choices than the Fuji - more than I need.  But the panorama works well also (a feature I wanted to retain which is why I did NOT go to a Canon Powershot).<br /><br />And the battery seems to last forever.  Tho I'm disappointed the camera does not come with a battery charger included - I purchased an extra set of batteries with charger to solve that problem).<br /><br />All in all, a nice light long-zoom point-and-shoot","overall, happy with it.","GREAT POINT AND SHOOT!!  love the ultimate zoom on it!  perfect to fit in my purse and go!","I really love this camera. I would give it a 5 star but it is a little complicated to get the right setting. But once you understand how to set it for the environment, it takes great pictures.","Very good product, with good features. A little delicate as is very compact.","Takes amazing pictures and the zoom is super.  Highly recommended","This camera far exceeds my expectations. My only annoyance is when it very bright outside and it's on auto, the camera won't always adjust the brightness leading to some very bright photos. Other than that it's wonderful.","100% the best point and shoot camera I've ever purchased! Sony is the best in my opinion. Okay it's not the RX100 but close enough for the price point. Amazon warehouse deals/used good. Camera is near perfect. And the the flip up selfie screen is one of the best features. Highly recommend.","Amazing pictures and loved the flip up screen for selfies. The download to phone feature not requiring wifi was really cool...Was able to transfer to my phone in the middle of nowhere and later share with friends on social media from my phone when I had service.","Returned my camera, was not happy with the video quality.  Thought this would work out just as well as the G7x or RX100 but not even close.  If looking to use this for blogging do not expect the best quality.","Wow this camera is amazing i made Some very beautiful pictures. And my new favorite hobby this camera is great and durable and will not dissapoint.","I mostly use Canon Digital SLR cameras, but I needed a small camera for a trip abroad.  I particularly like the active viewfinder.  It works great in very bright sunlight.  So far the camera has met my expectations.","Excellent camera, easy to use. Vivid colors. Good choice for shooting moving objects.","NICE! Would have 1 for everybody on my family, If I had known that this camera is the BOMB!","Disappointing color.","This is my fourth Sony product after my purchase of Sony a7s, RX100, and RX100III (wife's cam).  I currently also have the Lumix GH4 as I like to take videos as much as photos.  I bought the HX80 as a gift for my niece.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't quite need the prosumer 1\" sensor point and shoot or who wants the extra zoom capabilities that the larger sensors can't pack in such a small form.  I will work backwards and start with the cons then the pros.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*  Smaller 1/2.3 sensor as opposed to 1\" sensor (then again price is reflective of smaller sensor and the 1/2.3 sensor on the HX80 is back illuminated which makes it much nicer than other comparable sensors)<br />*  No 4k video<br />*  No manual zoom<br />*  No touchscreen<br /><br />Pros:<br />*  Pop up viewfinder<br />*  Flash that's semi-tiltable<br />*  Quick menu with 12 customizable functions<br />*  Full PASM modes for manual and semi-manual controls plus full auto modes if that's the preference<br />*  Monitor that tilts 180 degrees for selfies<br />*  30X zoom fantastic for travelers<br />*  High quality XAVC S video format up to 50mbps at 24p, 30p, and 60p (requires SDXC memory cards)<br />*  PASM modes all available for video<br />*  Video manual mode has auto-iso option (not all cameras allow video auto-iso in manual; i.e. the much more expensive RX100 doesn't have this option)<br />*  5-AXIS image stabilizer works great<br />*  WIFI/NFC included plus downloadable apps<br /><br />There are many more features that I could go on about this neat little point and shoot, just check out the spec sheets.  At this price level, especially for those that like to shoot both photos and videos, the Sony HX80 in my opinion is one of the best 1/2.3 sensor pocket cameras.  I hope you find this review helpful!","This is another great camera from Sony. I have cameras from every camera manufacturer you can think of but none of them beat Sony. One of my favorites is the Sony HX200 which is my go-to camera but I wanted something smaller with long zoom to go along with it. This camera has everything you need in a pocket-sized package. I used it recently to photograph my grand daughter's high school graduation and, at full 30x zoom the pictures and movies were extremely clear with great color even though the subjects were highly backlighted by the sun. The popup finder was a plus because it was impossible to see anything on the display.","Very nice product,<br />Viewfinder is rather small and take getting used to - every time you locate the eye inside take additional 3-4 seconds so get to the point you can actually notice things proparly","The camera works very well for what I purchased the camera to photograph, which is bird ID photos. I am having trouble hitting the wrong small buttons accidentally. I have not taken enough photos to fully evaluate this camera and wish it used raw.","First class camera - was looking for a camera with adjustable LED screen and optical view finder and this camera is it! The zoom is ample and meets all my needs. Since I'll be going on a three generation trip I wanted a small Pocket camera with great optics","I have the Sony RX100M2, and for traveling I like the HX80 better.  Why?

Please with purchase and size","I bought this right before an overseas trip because I wanted something easier to carry than my DSLR camera.  It's less bulky and much easier to carry than larger cameras, offers a variety of photo options and most importantly, takes beautiful photos.  I would definitely recommend this camera.","Awesome camera and will not disappoint.","Better than I expected by a long way.<br />The 40x zoom changes how you take pictures.","I love this handy little camera.

Fits in a belt loop case and is perfect for on the go. Check it out on YouTube.","Love the camera! Bought it for a vacation and am very happy with it.  It is easy to throw into my purse or backpack; small enough to hold in my hand as I walk and take pictures.  The only thing that confuses people is having to manually push a button to raise the flash - I always have to show that feature to someone who is taking our picture. Other than that, I am very happy with it.","Amazing camera! Zoom is awesome and photo quality looks great. Easy to use and understand.","Great little camera with 40X optical zoom.  You can charge the battery and start taking great pictures, but studying the manual (You can download it free before purchasing camera.) is needed to take full advantage of all the great features.

Pictures turned out beautiful. I easily sent them to my computer via wifi.","seriously great camera!<br />I took it to a concert and I didn't have great seats, but I was able to get some really good shots. The lighting was actually pretty terrible, it was super bright, but the camera was still able to take good shots.<br />video quality is pretty good (though mine in particular weren't great because I was screaming and jumping up and down)","Absolutely love this camera. It goes with me everywhere I go. It's so small and powerful at the same time. I chose it because of it's zoom! And boy did I make the right choice! I can take awesome pictures of the moon. I took it on a trip to Los Angeles and got amazing shots of the Hollywood sign! The speakers are terrible which made me think the audio from the microphone would suck but once I played it back from my phone or laptop, it sounded much better.","Great camera.Photos are spectacular and I love the 50X zoom.","Canon did it.  Sharp images.  Light and slim size to carry on hiking.  Wow!  I took a shot on moving flowers in wind and each flower was shown.  A garden ornament was moving in the wind; and I took a shot on it with AV setting; Servo, Continuous highlighted.  That moving yard ornament looks still in my shot.  My society garlic blades look so clean and vivid in my picture.  The sky does not look dark.  I am convinced Canon crews worked their brain out to make this camera.  My 3 year old Canon G1X is not nearly as good as this.  What 3 years made difference!  I added some photos I took with 720 below.  The flag picture was taken 0.6 miles away with AV, Continuous, Servo setting.  First, Zoom in all the way to the blur; then slowly bring in the image.  I had to set the camera on the rock to stabilize it.  All flower shots were with the same setting, same technique.  I sat down; stabilized camera near my knee.  You can't do it in just hand hold camera standing up.","so far I love it....the photos are great.","Good basic camera. This one developed shutter issues after 9 photos and the got worse.","Great camera!  Love it because it is small and compact and I can take it anyshere.","Bought this camera as a gift because of the reviews .It did not disappoint. My son even got extraordinary detailed shots of the moon with the zoom. Great value for the features","Haven't gotten a chance to test it out as I'm charging the battery right now. But the camera doesn't come with an hdmi cord. So I will need to go purchase one so I can download stuff to my computer.","So far I have really liked it. Easy to work with and takes a nice photo. Very nice product for the money.","This is the best point and shoot I've ever owned. I am an amateur photographer and was super impressed with the quality of shots this thing takes.....I have a camera that I have to changes lenses out depending on what I'm shooting. I find myself reaching for this camera more often and leaving my expensive camera behind. I've taken shots of the same thing with both cameras just to see the difference and I swear this little camera takes better pictures.","Bought this as a gift for my mom, this will be her 3rd or 4th Canon SX type camera... easy to use and she loves the zoom on this one for bird photos!","I enjoy the camera. It works fine and I continue to explore all of its options.","This Camera is like future tech.  It blows me away every time I use it.  And I have a huge collection of L Lenses collection dust because of how small and easy it is have on me at all times.","Great camera! Great zoom, makes wonderful photos!","Great travel choice.","Great photos and an unbelievable zoom.","This is a fantastic camera!  The small size is great for travel and the camera is easy to operate.  I was looking for a compact point-and-shoot with a powerful zoom and this camera does not disappoint!  The directions are concise and have you up and running in no time.  Have been very happy with the pictures it has taken.  For someone who has a Canon Rebel with multiple lenses, I have found this camera to match in the quality without having to lug around a big camera bag.  Would highly recommend this camera!","We have loved this camera since purchasing.","Great camera. Typical Canon","Too soon to write a review on my new Canon SX720.  My previous little pocket camera worked okay for the snapshots of family, friends & our \"four-legged\" kids but eventually I wanted more zoom.  After researching & reading many reviews, I finally decided on the SX720.  I was very excited when the camera was delivered & have mainly taken pictures & only a couple videos.  Now I have more megapixels, sharper pictures & much more zoom if needed.  For the amateur photographer that I am, I look forward to learning more & more about this camera & will update at a later date.","Awesome! I'm very happy with this purchase!!","there is a learning curve, but so far I am really happy with this camera.","?????????? The best camera  light, small, professional & easy to use.","Great quality of pictures and movies: color, zoom, detail, etc. We like our pictures and the people who look at them are also amazed. Great purchase for a reasonable price.","This camera is easy to work with and the photo pictures along with video are excellent.","everything I was looking for in a camera, easy to use with great results","This is my first Amazon review after many purchases.<br /><br />I researched camera's for weeks. Including the Sony with the View Finder. Even tried both in the store.<br />The Sony felt like a cheap toy. The view finder was a good idea, but you really had to strain to see<br />anything through it. I compared the zoom and the Canon completely blew away the Sony also.<br />I really don't need a flip screen or a view finder. So I purchased this camera.<br /><br />Its completely fantastic. And I am shocked people would say cameras in this range are no better than cell<br />phone camera's with optical zoom. This camera takes incredible pics. And yes, the zoom is nuts too<br /><br />If you are debating like I was. Don't listen to the silliness about GPS and view finders, etc etc.<br />And take the plunge and buy this camera. You will not be disappointed!","Love!!","Great product and exactly as vendor described!","I bought this item for a family member and so far they are very please with it. Very easy to understand the function of this camera. And there are lots of features with this item.","Perfect!!!! The zoom is amazing!!","good pics","I've owned PowerShot cameras in the past, but was not happy with this quality - at all.  The images were not crisp, and very feathered.  Perhaps I had a lemon, as Canon is an otherwise fine company.  The return was simple, and refund was very quick.  Thank you.","No computer cord so I can download the photos? Are you serious? That is crazy that it doesn't come with one.","I Just received my camera today, and I am very pleased.  The WiFi setup was extremely easy after downloading the app to my cell phone.<br />What I found very interesting, was that I could use the app to take pictures if I were using a tripod from a distance!.<br />I am giving this product 4 stars due to the positioning of the pop-up flash.  This makes it difficult when placing my left finger on the camera while taking shots.  I just have to get use to hand placement.","Great camera for the price and I really like the level of optical zoom. Moon shots are a hobby for me and this one ranks well with the quality on the digital zoom side. Takes a little getting use to for making sure pictures are clear. I changed a few settings and am happy with what it is producing.","Very good compact camera.","Works great. From what I have used it so far it takes great pictures even at 40x optical zoom. I did disable the digital zoom as recommended in a photography article that I read.","This camera was bought as a pocket camera for when I travel and can't carry my DSLR. It works good for subjects that are close to you. The \"super zoom\" is just a gimmick. The camera body is too small (no grip) to get a clear stable shot at a distant object. I was trying to replace a Samsung Galaxy Camera 2 (no longer made) with this Canon and it is a poor substitute. I gave it three stars because it does OK close up.","The person I made a gift to...Loves it. Thanks so much.","The quality of the images this takes is fantastic.","It would be 5 stars except that I can't get the wifi to connect to my computer, and wifi is one of the big reasons I purchased this camera.  Very disappointing.  But excellent camera otherwise.","It is a powerful little camera. I wish it had an optical viewfinder also","I had the SX260 before buying the SX720. I was hoping for richer image quality and faster processing after each shot. I got both and more. The battery also lasts forever. Images are much better quality, rich color and there is not much to no delay after each shot. Battery and cords are not compatible between the SX260 and SX270 cameras (but my phone cord works to download), although the cards are. Same camera size.","This is the third Canon camera I've owned and they continue to not disappoint! This is replacing my Canon PowerShot SX130 IS, which is still a fantastic camera, but I wanted more megapixels, more zoom and less bulkiness. The SX720 HS meets all those requirements and adds new features that I have yet to learn and explore.  The only drawback seems to be that when it comes to connecting wirelessly to other devices (smartphones, computers, tablets, etc.) the camera seems to prefer Android devices. I may be wrong, but as of this writing, I still have not been able to successfully connect to my laptop or iPhone.<br />To highlight the effectiveness of the zoom, I uploaded photos I took of the control tower at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. They were taken on a slightly foggy day. The first photo is no zoom, the second photo is with max optical zoom (40x) and the third photo is at max digital zoom (160x).","I love it!","Works great, good auto focus, need more time with it before I fall in love with it. Probably stay with the small point at shoot cameras after buying a Canon DSLR that I don't use and don't really like very much.  Breaks down, is very expensive, not much value left in a originally priced $3k setup that is yesterdays news.","Great camera with a terrific zoom lens. I've always used a large 35 mm camera but this camera does all the functions without the need is several lens. Good quality photos without spending a fortune on lenses.","[[VIDEOID:638343f1ddf83d34d5db19dd946ed763]] Love it....video stabilizer is just fabulous :) Zoom is amazing!!!","I thought about this camera for a long time but the kicker was a $100.00 dollar price drop to $279.00.  So glad I bought this I hike every other day this camera is perfect the long zoom makes wildlife shots easy.  Wireless works perfect and a 32 gig card will store 10000 shots.  Thanks Amazon!","THe Cannon Shot 720x is an amazing camera. I have shelved my larger more sophisticated ones.  I have had the Powershot series for several years now, and the amateur photos I take with it, have earned me 4 awards including \"grand prize\" and \"people's choice\" in 2 years, against professional photographers with much more complicated equipment.  This camera is lighter and more compact that its predecessor model with a better zoom. It also take better landscape photos.  The Image World is also first rate to deal with, I did have an issue with the first camera sent, and the staff of The Image World have been quick to respond and are sending a new replacement. I take wild life photos and there is often no time for set up, so if you want an amazing wild life or people shot taken with a great zoom, this is the camera.","This was a gift for my wife.  She loves it.  It works GREAT.","Very nice little camera.  Excellent features and good quality, high resolution images all in a compact size.  Very happy with this camera.","I actually bought this camera from eBay.  This camera is amazing.  I wanted a camera, which had great optical zoom in a compact size.  This one fit the bill.  I mainly wanted to show that the 40x optical zoom is incredible - check out the pictures I posted.  My husband and I took a trip recently, and from the balcony of the hotel room, we got a beautiful sunset shot with the moon in the upper left hand corner (one uploaded).  But when we zoomed into the moon (also uploaded), we could even see the fine details of it.  Absolutely incredible.  It takes a few tries since you have to keep your hands still (unless you have a tripod), but it is well worth it.  Also, I was able to connect my iPhone 6 to the camera.  This is an amazing feature when say you're taking a selfie, but since you can't see the screen, you have no idea how it will come out.  My husband and I connected the camera to the phone, and we were able to zoom in/out on the phone, control the settings and take pictures from the phone since we were trying to take pictures together.  That alone is pretty incredible.  Regardless, the zoom on this camera is great!  I also included a few more sunsets and sunrises to show you that the color this camera picks up is great.  And these pictures were just taken on the \"Auto\" setting.","I'm an avid hiker so I carry the Canon XS720 HS in a pouch on my hip. It's light weight so it doesn't feel bulky. When I need to take a quick shot the camera starts up quickly. The zoom range is really useful for the different subjects I want to shoot on my hikes. The colors a really nice when the camera is set on the vivid color setting. A couple critiques I have is that the shutter speed slows down in low light conditions.  I also avoid subjects with any type of shadowing. Overall the camera performs well.","I am a professional illustrator and traveled to Europe. left my big camera at home and stuck this in my pocket. Was amazed to see fellow tourist lugging their camera bags and video cameras around. When I got home the pictures and movies I took were just as good as my work camera. great zoom too!","great little camera","This one did not disappoint on my vacation. We were able to get so many more pictures I was not able to previously with my old point and shoot camera. The zoom was truly awesome getting us very close to everything even if we were not! It was ready every time I pulled it out, I had one back up battery with me at all times but it seemed to go and go. Its small enough to carry easily when I was hiking on trials and even where there was not trails. :)","Wish it has a eye-level viewfinder like my Sony RX100 III especially for long zoom use.  As it is, it is vey hard to handle at long zoom settings.","Great camera that you can carry in your pocket.  Takes good pictures.","This is my 4th Canon PowerShot.  I am replacing a SX410.  I own a Nikon 7200, but like to take my PowerShot along with me to use for those photo shots when I don't have time to change lenses.  Canon makes a nice camera.","I needed a quality, compact camera to carry while riding horseback, and this one is almost perfect. Taking outdoor photos without a view finder is a challenge and I wish they would put them back on cameras! If not for that, I would have given this 5 stars. The 40x zoom is great for taking far away shots which we often do, but its difficult to hold still and get a sharp image. That combined with the lack of viewfinder makes this camera almost perfect but not quite.","This has been the best camera ever, great zoom, fantastic image stabilization, great low level lighting performance, have taken over 15,000 pictures on a 4 week trip, performed circles around full size DSLRs, and it so small, fits in shirt pocked,  its now my go to camera for future trips, highly recommend it to be the primary camera","Very easy to consistently take clear, sharp, vibrant pictures outdoors that have Canon's trademark rich looking, yet accurate color.  Camera menu is easy to learn. Only downside is that the photos of the SX720 are similar to camera phone photos in that they do not retain much detail if greatly enlarged on a computer screen.  If you do alot of on screen enlargement then you should get one of the larger and heavier traditional Canon DSLR's like a T6i, 70D, 80D etc.","First ever camera!<br /><br />I was looking for a camera that I could not only take amazing pictures with but that was going to be simple for a beginner like myself. I searched and saved for two years trying to decide. I couldn't wait any longer as a concert date was creeping up on me. I needed great zoom and sound quality and I found more than that.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Beautiful design sleek, stylish, and up to date look!<br />Easy to use.<br />Stunning video and picture quality!<br />The audio is HD I was nervous I'd need an external mic for the Demi Lovato concert but I didn't.<br />Optical zoom makes every detail pop even when fully zoomed in!<br />Battery life was well beyond what I expected.<br />Sync pictures and video has never been more easy!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't have a flip screen to take selfies.<br />Could use a bit more of a grip to it because it is very small.<br /><br />I would honestly recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for a wonderful camera!","Nice standby to my D70 DSLR.  Love it and it's features.","I love it! It is small & fits in my purse. Plus it takes really good pictures. It goes from just taking normal pictures to very far away or very close up! Just what I wanted. Perfect little powerful canon.","I had to return the camera after few shots and films taken (I always buy from Amazon for hassle-free return/refund). I did not meet my expectations of a 20mp 40x optical zoom specifications. Also, it is on the heavy side in comparison to few Sony CyberShots that I have had. The quality of photos, in my opinion, is lesser or equal to the photos taken by my iPhone 6s and iPhone SE. Now looking for better compact digital camera for my upcoming trip...","Its OK.  Bought this to replace a 6yo 12MP Canon that we wore out.  This one has more MPs and a greater Zoom, but it is missing many of the features our old camera had.  It does take a great picture and the zoom is AMAZING.","Great camera","I just bought this camera (in red). Unfortunately, Canon does not support WiFi download with Mac OS El Capitan and has no expected release date for the drivers to make this compatible (just spoke with Canon). As WiFi is one of the major features touted, I don't see how they can sell it with this being the current Mac operating system for sometime now. Very disappointing. Otherwise, seems like a fine camera.","Very good product, Wonderful","I love this camera! Especially the zoom is amazing. If you take the camera to a concert you can shoot close-ups of the band and the pictures look amazing even from 100 yards away (see the 3 pictures from the same concert). It's so light and compact that I don't even use my DSLR anymore!","I bought this camera for a trip oversees I was taking. I did not want to bring my huge dSLR. I wanted a small ZOOM camera that would fit easily in my pocket and took incredible pictures. I was impressed with the results. It was easy to use (I didn't even read the instructions, just point and click using the auto setting. It was also easy to connect the camera to my iPhone using WiFi in order to transfer the images from the camera to the phone. It was NOT easy to connect the camera to my laptop using WiFi, however.<br /><br />I included sample pics. Mind you these were taken from the balcony of a cruise ship while moving.","I am sure this camera would have met my high expectations had I not dropped it when I turned my kayak over on the Snake River in the Grand Teton National Park on my 70th birthday. The camera was a birthday present to myself. Instead of enjoying the pictures I had wanted to take of Oxbow Bend I was just thrilled to be rescued before I suffered hypothermia and/or floated into the more dangerous parts of the river.","great camera, great price","Easy to use great 40x. Zoom","Great, great seller!!","Like others, I upgraded from this from the SX260HS.  I live on a sailboat and upgraded for the 40x optical zoom.  I am very amateur and just snap pics that are later shrunk to 400 Kb and posted on a blog, so the fact that this camera doesn't shoot massive RAW files didn't bother me.  I love how it can go from wide-angle to ultra-zoom -- perfect for travel!  I find I tend to shoot a lot in LIVE mode, with two clicks up on 'vivid' for my outdoor landscape shots, as it produces a more subtle look right out of the camera than just upping the saturation in Photoshop afterwards.  This camera is also better in low-light than my old camera, although it doesn't come close to a DSLR with its massive lens, which is expected.  But if you are walking around a dark cave or cathedral without a tripod, setting it on 2-second self timer to reduce shaking when you press the button and leaning your hand against a rock while it fires a pic without flash results in much better shots than with the old version.<br />I have only two complaints.  The first is the flash.  My old 260SX was annoying as well in the fact that the flash came up right under your finger while you held the camera.  This camera has the same location problem, which I can deal with, but my flash stopped smoothly popping up after just two weeks of use.  Now I literally have to pry it up.  It's possible I got some dirt or something in the mechanism, but I can't find anything.  This flash seems more complex and breakable.  I don't use flash much, so this is not a deal breaker.  The other problem is the autofocus.  It is quite touchy without a tripod.  Even without zooming out a lot one has to hold the camera quite still to get the focus to slowly come to a decision, regardless of \"image stabilization\". I find I have to take two or three shots to guarantee I have a focused one.  I also often have trouble getting it to focus on what I want -- if a rope close to me is in the foreground of a pic of a boat far away, it prefers to focus on the tiny rope in the corner of the giant autofocus area, instead of the big boat, despite my attempts to lock the focus on something else.  This may be my inexperience or just what happens with a pocket cam versus a DSLR that's five times the price.  Regardless, I still make this my go-to travel cam as it has to be the best compact cam for travel given its amazing 40x optical zoom (I even use it as post-hoc binoculars to see the names of boats from far away!) and I am very pleased with my purchase.","This camera is a 'MUST HAVE'!! Honestly,It reeeally is the best point and shoot camera to have! I love the 40x optical zoom and the photos are crystal clear! If you're like me, you take your camera EVERYWHERE you go! You just never know what your going to see at any given moment :)  I would definately recommend this to a friend. Here's a shot I took with the camera, taken on the Burlington Waterfront in Burlington,Vermont","Great camera","Bought this for my birthday Mexico trip and man, does it take clean, vibrant pictures. I'm no pro by any means, but the ease of use and picture quality was astounding. I was zooming up El Castillo and saw details I couldn't see my last time there","Love this camera!  Easy to use. Takes great pics. Has an incredible zoom.  I love that it is small and compact.","I got this PowerShot because it took better photos than my old PowerShot.  Unfortunately, this camera will not display movies on the screen.  You get a \"Incompatible JPEG\" message.  Neither Canon Community nor JustAnswer could give me a solution.  JustAnswer said my files were corrupt or unsupported.  NOT!  Here is my solution, but I don't know why it works:  when the \"incompatible\" message is on the screen, press the FUNCSET button, then select \"Play Linked Digest Movie.\"  The movies will run on the screen.  This also works when \"SET\" appears in the upper left corner of the screen, with or without the JPEG message.  After writing this review, I still had problems viewing photos on the camera, so I sent the camera, battery, and memory card to Canon Service (before doing so, I copied all photos to my laptop).  Canon Service's report said the camera was working normally - no charge.  I got everything back, but the photos had been erased, presumably through reformatting.  I prefer to leave my photos on my camera, so I can share them with friends.  After a while, I copy them to my laptop and delete them from the camera.  I've taken a few new photos with the camera, and I haven't had problems viewing them.  I'll be taking more tomorrow at the zoo.  This is just to let other buyers know what to do, in case they encounter the same issue.","Very good","Great camera.  Sharp lens and works well for taking pictures of convention panels especially when you are not allowed to use flash.  It does take a bit of getting used to as when shooting at 40x a slight camera movement can have you completely miss the subject. I used to take photos of flying aircraft at airshows using an early DSLR and an 800 mm lens so I am used to doing things like this.","The camera was easy to use and takes amazing pictures.  I couldn't be more pleased with this camera!","This camera was for my granddaughter who took it to Italy. Loved the ease of using it.","You can spend thousands of dollars on photography equipment and in my layman's opinion not produce a better pic than this camera. Love the super zoom on this bad boy. Only issue is the shutter door is defective and I have to mess around with it to fully open and close it...","As a bicycle tourer and enthusiastic point and shoot amateur photographer, I look for maximum performance in the smallest package. I found that in the Canon PowerShot SX720 HS. It is a little bigger and heavier than other compact digital cameras but the advantages you get from it easily make up for this. Between this camera and my iPhone, I am as compact as possible. I can capture quality images, wirelessly transfer them with the Canon Connect app to my phone and then send them to family and friends. The fantastic zoom gives me the ability to reach out and grab the shots which were not possible with my previous camera. The Super Vivid mode can turn a boring dim sunset into a print you are proud to show to others. I almost feel guilty when I receive compliments on the photos as the camera did it not me.","Just received this from my husband as a gift. I'm an arthritic old lady who loves to photograph wildlife, especially birds. I've been walking around with an SX710 in my pocket for months and love being able to quickly pull my camera out of my pocket, take a telephoto picture, upload it to my cell phone, and post it online in a matter of a couple of minutes. The SX720 does all that even better. The longer optical zoom is great, and the inage stabilization is noticely better with the SX720. The camera and wifi interface is identical for both cameras, so if you are accustomed to the SX710 there is no learning curve at all when you upgrade. And last but not least, the SX720 seems to be a trifle smaller and lighter than the 710.","Update:  I've had the camera for while now and it's grown on me.  The missing panoramic function is still a problem for me.  Although I can stitch pictures together for a panoramic image in PhotoShop, it's extra work.  I really miss that function on this camera.<br /><br />I found that I can overcome the slow shutter speed in \"Auto\" by using the T function and setting the shutter speed - but most of the time, \"auto\" does the job for me.  The camera turns on fast and there's little shutter lag.  Color is good under almost all conditions.<br /><br />The battery can be charged in the camera by connecting the camera to a wall wart that has a USB connector.  Charges just fine.<br /><br />I don't use the WiFi to move pictures from the camera to my PC. I just hook up a USB cable and download them.  It's easy and foolproof.<br /><br />Overall, I like the camera.  I upgraded it one star (from 3 to 4) but the fifth star is missing because of the missing panoramic function.<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />I haven't had this camera too long yet but I do have some first impressions.  The camera seems to be well made.  It turns on quickly, the zoom works quickly and it has a long zoom. Very little shutter lag.  Image quality seems to be good.  The camera physical size is what I want, which is to fit into my pocket.  While my iPhone takes very good pictures, I wanted a zoom lens to get in closer to my subjects.<br /><br />Operation is similar to other compact digital cameras so it's easy to learn.  Layout of the knobs and buttons is good and intuitive. It does NOT have a touch screen like my previous camera and that's good.  It's too easy to touch the screen by accident and bring up some function that you don't want. The menus are easy to get to and easy to set the various functions.<br /><br />A few things I don't like.  The first is that there's no panoramic function.  I can stitch photos together in Photoshop Elements but it would be nicer to have the panoramic function in the camera.  Second, there's a number of functions to modify the look of photos.  I guess some people might do that in the camera, but most would do it in their photo editing software.  When I look at the \"useful\" functions, it's Auto and the various priority modes, plus manual.<br /><br />In auto mode, the camera seems to favor a slow shutter speed and a smaller aperture. Maybe that's to get more depth of field.  But the problem is that if your subject is moving, you get a blurred picture.  There should be a way of telling the auto function to prioritize to fast shutter speeds.  I'd give up depth of field to get pictures that were not blurred by motion. [Update] I now use the T function instead of Auto and set the shutter speed to 1/125 second.  Everything seems to work fine with that setting, similar to Auto, but with a faster shutter speed.<br /><br />The WiFi function was difficult to set up.  Maybe I had trouble with the directions, but I had to call in to get help setting it up.  It does do what I want it to do, which is copy the pictures on the camera to a directory on my PC.  The way it names the directory is a bit different from what I do, but I can rename the directory.<br /><br />Another thing I don't like is that if you leave the camera connected to your PC with a USB cable, and you shut the PC off, the camera is not smart enough to shut itself off when it detects that the power is gone from the USB cable - so the camera battery is dead when you get back to it.  It also seems that they expect you to remove the battery from the camera and charge it in the charger provided.  That's a good approach if you use multiple batteries, but if you only use one battery, it would be much nicer to charge the battery from a plug with a USB cable.  While you can do that with this camera, it's not nearly as easy as it was with my previous compact camera.  It appears that you have to have the camera \"on\" to charge the battery.  There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to charge the battery with the camera in the \"off\" state.<br /><br />So, all-in-all it's a straightforward compact digital camera with a long zoom.  Too bad they didn't include a panoramic function in the camera. Overall, I'm somewhat disappointed in the camera.","LOVE LOVE this camera.  I wanted something that would be small enough to carry in my purse but also take fantastic pictures.  This is it.  It had the megipixel's I wanted and also the optical zoom.  Not to mention the wifi.  Took several pictures while my husband was driving.  I captured many things I would have missed using my phone camera.","Great point and shoot camera.  Pics are turning out great.","I'm pretty smitten by this camera.  Sure, the full zoom requires more stabilization, but I can get pictures of the moon that show its crags and crannies while I'm standing in my commuter parking lot.  The colors are true, the images sharp, and it's a tiny little camera that I barely notice is in my bag.  The perfect travel camera, for sure.","rerally great camera. pictures come out very clear. easy to use","I'm no pro, viewing this latest Canon as a more full featured point-n-shoot. Yes, you'll see some fringing when dark and light meet, but if you want pro quality get a pro camera and pay accordingly. This thing has been great on vacations, where I usually leave it hanging from a lanyard around my neck or even in a front shirt pocket so it's handy for taking spur of the moment shots. The super zoom is pretty amazing for getting close, detail shots, especially in this day and age when so many attractions are using fences to keep the unwashed masses away. The preview screen on the back is bright enough to use in full sun, and the controls are well laid out and mostly follow the same conventions of previous Canon cameras I've owned. Some of the features are buried in menus that are not at all intuitive, so I keep a copy of the owner's manual on the iPhone for reference.<br /><br />The camera is more battery hungry than previous models, and charging seems to take longer as the battery is bigger. The good news is that it will charge off the Canon version of the USB cable, though it seems to want to be nearly fully discharged before it will trigger the charging mode. So now for the first time ever I'm keeping a spare battery and using the wall wart charger for topping up.<br /><br />The other issue is the lanyard ring, which is so small and poorly positioned it is very difficult to get anything larger than the small thread like end of the supplied hand lanyard through. I finally managed to find a 4mm split ring to fit it, but it doesn't swivel freely. It works well enough, but it's not \"right\".<br /><br />At the end of the day this is a great snapshot camera, providing detailed 20 Mb images aided by that wonderful 40x super zoom lens. In other words, just what I was looking for.","Awesome little camera. Better battery life than the last model, but no GPS, which I suppose is the reason for the better battery life. Fantastic zoom and amazingly acceptable digital zoom!","Love this camera! The pictures are clear and the zoom is amazing!","I've been using Nikon and finally went back to a Canon. A great camera.","Best camera yet.  Great features, powerful zoom.  I use it every day for work.","When my Nikon S9700 committed suicide by jumping off the counter, I did a lot of looking for a replacement. I chose the Canon Powershot SX 720 HS.<br /><br /> I am really glad that I did.  If not for the WIFI, I would have called it a 5 star camera..<br /><br />My main use is taking snaps of the grandkids. The 40X zoom gets a close up head shot even when I am sitting on the first base line and he is in left field, deep left field of a little league ball field.<br /><br />The antivibration feature really work well. The problem with the 40X turns out not to be the vibration, but finding a moving subject in the field of view. There is a special  button for that..<br /><br />The attached pic was taken as a snapshot, not planned, and freehand, no tripod or even a rest on anything like a post. If you figure the plane was at about 30,000 feet??, then this was taken of a plane about 8 miles away . No, it isn’t the greatest quality, but it sure does say something about the antivib and 40X.  I would point out that to the naked eye, the plane was a silvery speck at the end of the contrails.<br /><br />As evening falls, and it is hard to see the players well, the light sensitivity is so good that the pics and videos look like they were taken on a bright day. Awesome..<br /><br /> The controls are intuitive for the most part. The pic trigger and video trigger are where I would want them.<br /><br /> Autofocus is great unless you start straying off the beaten path. Some of the options will cause the focus to get a little weird.<br /><br />I was surprised that the image size didn’t jump way up from the 5 meg I was used to on the Nikon. Compression in the jpg format??<br /><br />The one thing I really didn’t like was the WIFI upload option. I downloaded the drivers, and was able to get the camera to talk  with the network. Even when I can see that the router has the connection, the program to upload doesn’t pop up reliably. When it does load and start to run, in looks like it is shipping the files into the Comcast backbone according to the Netgear  Genie program. It ties up most of the 30 mbps that Comcast gives me. I don’t understand why it would be touching the internet, and by the way, it was extremely slow uploading.<br /><br />The attached pic show what Netgear Genie thinks the load on the internet is while loading pics from the camera to the laptop. I really don't know why it even touches the internet, maybe that isn't what Genie is telling me?<br /><br />I called Canon tech support and they told me that I could hardwire with a USB2 to mini-B cable. I ordered it, and it didn’t fit.<br /><br />Another call to Tech support, and no, it wasn’t the mini-B, it was the micro-b cable.<br /><br />I ordered it, and after tuning the software options, it works. Every time, and a bunch faster. My recommendation is that you get the hard wire USB micro-B cable.<br /><br />One more comment about Wifi. The camera is designed with a thicker section on the right hand side while holding it. It is natural to use this thicker section to pull the camera from it’s case and put it back. The location of  the wifi button is right where you would hold it to put it  away. Twice, I have had a dead battery because I accidentally hit the wifi button when storing it, and it drained the battery.<br /><br />Given a choice, I would have it removed…<br /><br />All told, I am EXTREMELY pleased with it. Focus, speed. Light sensitivity, small size, 40X zoom, 1080P video, large memory options, what looks like accurate colors, and a good path to upload to my laptop. What more can you want??<br /><br />An addition, After some quality time on a \"great Adventure\" with the grandkids. The Pic review button does the same thing the Wifi button does. Both drained the battery when pushed thru the soft case. I have yet to find the right hardcase that the camera will fit in. I intend to make a cover for those buttons and tape it in place. Really a pain when the battery is dead when you want to take that magic pic!!  Too bad there isn't a firmware option to disable them.<br /><br />Canon PowerShot SX720 HS (Black)","Canon PowerShot SX720 HS (Black)<br /><br />I have only had the camera briefly, but using just the auto focus and without playing with any of the options, I have relatively pleased with the ability to get a clear and vibrant picture, even from a distance.  I have managed to read a tiny bumper sticker on a car through waving tree leaves using this camera.  I feel that I can accomplish a lot with the camera once I learn to use the settings, so do not hold my lack of technical ability and lack of stability on the camera (all pictures were distance photos and I really need to get a tripod to keep the minor shaking down).  Maximizing the zoom, the stability was a bit difficult, but I have been pleased with the vibrant colors that I was able to achieve.  I have tried in different light from bright daylight to encroaching darkness, sunlight and overcast days and I have found the camera adjusts for those conditions extremely well.","a great travel camera and the 40x zoom lens takes sharp pictures","40x optical zoom and Made in Japan.","Excellent camera! Amazing zoom and fairly easy to use!","So far so good.  I love the camera.  The pictures are excellent and the zoom is awesome.  Looking forward to learning more features and taking better pictures.","Easy to use with great photos.","Playing with the camera a few days... a few thinks bothers me. It's color noise, especially on the video and low light. And... I left camera on hooked to the computer, and it didn't even charge the buttery(!), it actually completely discharged it! I found camera still ON with flashing empty battery signal... That was very unexpected and inconvenient!..  wtf, Canon?!","Use it with my Rebel T4i and the pictures are just as good. Love size. Needed a smaller camera for trip to Alaska that had a good zoom and took great pictures. This does it.","I love my Canon PowerShot SX720 HS - I haven't learned everything the camera has to offer but it is very easy to  use and takes great pictures!","Excellent camera. I love the 40x zoom, it amazes me that you can get such shots from this tiny camera body. The scene modes work well, although there is some shutter lag depending on conditions. It may have image stabilization, but for perfect zoom shots a tripod is needed. I do like that the flash has a dedicated button, and can be toggled on the fly. This takes very good photos and videos, much better than my iPhone 6+. My biggest gripe is using the wifi. The app and camera have to be used in an exact pattern to get things going correctly, otherwise it can be a hopeless mess. My other wifi cameras were not this finicky, what gives Canon? Battery life is rather poor, 200 or so shots and it's a goner. Invest in a spare battery if you can. I recommend getting a product bundle. I got one that included a spare battery and memory card, cleaning cloths, an LCD screen protector, a carry case and an articulating tripod snake.","Amazing camera. Love it.","I haven't had the opportunity to use this camera as much as I would like but so far when i have I find that the quality of pictures it<br />takes are comparable to a DSLR camera at a fraction of the size. It is like having a DSLR in your pocket and for the price it's a great<br />bargain.","Perfect small camera with incredible zoom. This is just the thing for nature lovers who love to zoom but don't want to haul heavy equipment all day. I love mine and have been using it for several weeks. I bought it at Best Buy (sorry Amazon) because they carry it in red.  The dragonfly was about 15ft away. I was very impressed with the clarity. I'm an amateur photographer with quite a few cameras and this is my current favorite.","What a great little zoom camera.  It has much better image quality than my Galaxy S7 phone and also an amazing zoom.  I had to return it because I needed something more for Video and a wider angle but if it wasn't for that I would of kept it as I love that zoom.","I was trying to decide between the Canon SX710 and the Nikon S9900, both being 30x zoom, and leaning towards the Canon, but was fortunate in seeing that Canon was about to release a 40x zoom in the SX720 HS. I am delighted with the SX720. The screen is beautiful - as clear as an actual photograph  and the zoom is just amazing. The built in electronic 2x converter makes that an 80x zoom with even a 160x possible digitally. The software is just amazing - the camera can even take pictures by itself if a designated face in the picture smiles or winks! I primarily use the \"Auto\" setting but every other conceivable option is available - shutter or aperture priority, manual just being a few. I really like the separate button for HD video too. It has an option to take about a 4 second video before each still shot it you want. It then collects these video shorts into a monthly album. All in all it is a beautiful camera, light and sub compact as well, so I can carry it at all times. It fits perfectly in the hand and has a pop up flash to reduce red eye. I highly recommend it for those like me who enjoy super zooming.","Really cool camera. Haven't used it yet but looking forward to doing so!","Pros: Nice quality for a digital. Very good zoom. If you know nothing about cameras, this will serve you well. Just point and shoot. I almost never have to use the flash (very good quality in low light). Captures the image very quickly. Does very good quality video. Wi-Fi works well with the phone.<br /><br />Cons: the view screen is not touch screen. Wi-Fi to PC is difficult to get working, so some will have to use the USB to transfer images. You have to go to Cannon's website and download software for windows.","Still getting used to it.<br />Purchased for hiking as an alternative to lugging an DSLR around.<br />It takes nice shots.<br />Easy to use.<br />Everything it is advertized as being","It takes really good pictures but since they don’t put eye pieces on point and shoots anymore, it’s very hard to brace it to get a focused picture.","Awesome camera & Lighter and smaller than the 710.","[[VIDEOID:a910ca657b0531bfe901dbb17a32d54a]]I've been buying Canon PowerShot digital cameras since the first Powershot Digital ELPH (S100) came out in May 2000.  I've always placed a very high premium on small, light cameras that allow me to take photos while I travel without making me feel like a working photographer out on assignment.  So when I was looking to upgrade my 4 year old PowerShot ELPH 310 HS Canon PowerShot ELPH 310 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 8x Wide-Angle Optical Zoom Lens and Full 1080p HD Video (Purple), I narrowed my choices between the PowerShot ELPH 360 HS Canon PowerShot ELPH 360 HS (Black) with 12x Optical Zoom and Built-In Wi-Fi and this new megazoom camera (Powershot SX720 HS).  The ELPH 360 is nearly the same size and weight as my old ELPH 310, but has the advantage of a 12x zoom vs a 8x zoom.  Initially, I thought that anything more than 15x or 20x would be overkill because I thought it would be impossible to hold the camera steady enough for a clear photo or video that would not be shaking all over the place.  But now that cell phone cameras are so good, I thought it was time to see what these megazooms can do with their image stabilization.  And all I can say is \"wow\"!  The attached video was shot hand-held and zooms in all the way to 40x.  NOTE: Amazon has horrible degraded the picture quality of this video, but you can still see how steady the picture is even when zoomed in all the way.  (I was leaning against a wall to help steady my shot.)  The attached pics show the new SX720 compared to the old ELPH 310 (which is very similiar in size to the ELPH 360).","Love this camera, and zoom features. Here is the zoom test video of moon I took couple days ago. [...]","I have had the SX720 for a couple of weeks now and have taken several hundred photos under various conditions. I have owned about 5 other Canon compact cameras but this is by far the best one yet. I find the long zoom and \"motion control software\" to be quite remarkable for a camera in this price range. I also have several DSLR's so know what is reasonable to expect from a compact. This camera is a bargain and won't disappoint. No...it won't compete with a DSLR with a $5000 lens on it but then again....this camera costs $379. I am totally satisfied and highly recommend it! I am attaching a few shots I took \"hand held\" of an osprey fishing out over the Deschutes River from quite a distance.","Great Photos<br />This is my third Canon point and shoot, and I am not at all disappointed so far.  The second in the PowerShot SX...HS line.  My previous SX260 HS is still going strong -- though scuffed up from heavy use.  I will miss the built-in GPS feature of my previous Canon, but since it didn't work indoors anyway, I won't miss it that much.  I bought this model to go from 20x to 40x zoom.  The wide-angle is 24mm equiv. full telephoto is 960mm equiv. (which on a DSLR that would be a VERY BIG lens).  ( For comparison only - the 20x zoom of the SX260 HS was 25mm equiv. to 500mm equiv. both have the same sensor size)  The 40x is a tiny bit wider and way closer, so it isn't twice as close as my old camera (more like 1.9 times closer at max zoom).  The 20 MegaPixel rating doesn't change the actual output resolution much.  Max Res on this camera is 5184 x 3888 (compared to 4000x3000 on the SX260 at 12MP).  I attached a comparative max zoom to this and my review on the SX260 HS.  Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black) (OLD MODEL)I plan to do some low-light shot comparisons soon.<br /><br />Sharing<br />Maybe I'm weird, but I often find myself photographing something really cool and taking photos, and then pulling out my smart phone to take a smart-phone picture that I can share immediately.  Maybe it's not as good as the one I took a minute ago (for one thing, the zoom just isn't there).  No need anymore.  Just tap the back of a smartphone to the side of the SX720, and 30 seconds later, I have a list of photos on the camera that I can copy over to my phone.  Select, Menu (to signal I'm done selecting), OK, Confirm screen: OK again, and the selected images appear on my phone.<br />From there, I can e-mail or post to social media without compromising on quality.<br /><br />The very initial setup did take some time.  There's a sweet spot on most smart-phones that are not obvious (the sweet spot on the camera, is clearly etched into the side).  Once that was found, everything else was set up within about 15 minutes.  There are tutorials on Canon's web site and YouTube if you want someone to show you.<br /><br />I didn't really consider this feature deeply when I pre-ordered this camera, and I've been surprised that it is already a game-changer for me.","Great product would buy from again."]},{"name":"Nikon D3400","amazon_reviews":["My first DSLR and I have to say I'm in love with it!!

Image quality with the two stock lenses is on par with pretty much any other DSRL in this range, which is excellent to all but the most trained eye.  However the SnapBridge transfer-to-phone app is horrendous.  I'm a network engineer and don't think I have been as frustrated with an application in many years.  My daughter has an iPhone and I have an Android and we both experience the same issues.  Sometimes the camera will connect to the app and sometimes it freezes.  Sometimes the images start to transfer then freeze and the process fails.  I'd give this camera 5 stars if they could figure out a better transfer process.  I wish I had better researched the SnapBridge app before the purchase as there  are many similar stories.  YMMV of course.","Great camera. Replacing my D80 which is a great camera in itself.

It's fairly lightweight for a DSLR, but heavy enough to prevent my hands from shaking during photos.<br /><br />I'm a bit iffy about Snapbridge. The app can be kind of tempermental at times, but it generally works and is super useful for sending pictures to people or uploading them to instagram/facebook.","these cameras, in the DX market, are criticized for many reasons. I have used the high end Nikon and canon cameras in the past and as a traveler I can say there is a huge difference between those high end cameras and these consumer products. I don't have the same issues which some have complained about when discussing setting changes during use. anyone needing a button to change every setting instead of going into the menu is simply adding weight to the camera they heft from place to place. I usually carry three cameras, each with their own lens, and it can get very heavy after a few hours of hiking or picture taking on the neck. if I placed a picture from camera on a table with a picture taken with a higher end camera, you wouldn't be able to pick out which was which unless you factor \"correct guessing\" as a mathematical formula. you then have to take into consideration camera shooting speed for action photography or for pure reductions in pixelations when cropping and printing purposes later. if price is an issue, I cant give this camera any less than a 5 star rating. if you are talking about using this professionally for weddings and such which require small photos into the 8x10 16x20 range, they will still do the work without issues. with the quality of cameras taking video, I really don't need a FAST firing camera, as I would just set the camera on video and take shots from that.  no professional is probably going to use this camera for a swimsuit photo shoot, but for the average shooter, it will work just fine when you learn the features in the manual","I have been using Nikon and Nikkormat slr cameras since 1974, when a Christmas present purchased by my parents for themselves proved \"too complicated\". Within minutes, it was mine and I still have it and it still works perfectly. That said, I am quite partial to Nikon slr cameras, and have never, ever blamed the camera for my mistakes. I see a lot of reviews and a lot of reviewers blaming the camera for poor images. There's an old saying: \"a craftsman never blames his tools\". Keep that in mind as you read camera reviews, or any product review. Anyone, and I mean anyone, that blames the Nikon D3400 for image problems is simply an unskilled photographer and not ever likely to ever learn the craft and skill of photography.<br />The purpose of any great camera is to provide the ability to make great images. The D3400 succeeds in every way. It has it's limitations, but none of those limitations affect image quality. It is marketed as an entry level DSLR by Nikon. And yes it is Nikon's current definition of \"entry level\". Features have been added and subtracted from previous models as Nikon tries to find the elusive balance between value and performance in a world dominated by people that think their phones take great pictures. And for the most part, a high end smart phone does in fact take an excellent image, and as all photographers know, the \"best camera\" is the one that's with you.<br />And that leads me to the D3400. It is light, and that is huge. It can be carried almost anywhere without weighing you down. It uses the same Nikon lens mount that has been in service for over 50 years. And while old lenses can be used with the D3400, none of the metering or auto focusing functions will work. Anyone familiar with real, manual photography will know this already. For those that don't, all you need to know is that the D3400 will work properly with any auto focus Nikon lens without a separate aperature ring. All modern Nikkor AF-S lenses work, as do all the new, virtually silent AF-P lenses. If you have a photographic light exposure meter, you can use the previous era lenses, but that is not the target audience for this camera. Nikon hopes to move people obsessed with social media and \"posting\" to the world of advanced cameras with the D3400 and they will bring some people over, but only the ones that really want to make the move.<br />I read complaints about the bluetooth connectivity not working well, written by people with no understanding of the design limits of this camera and bluetooth technology. Bluetooth and wireless connectivity are \"throw ins\". They are not a component of making good images. For those that insist on the immediate posting of the moments of your life, use your iPhone, it's much easier. This camera is designed for anyone wanting to capture lfe's important moments for all time, not the next five minutes.<br />And I will agree with other reviewers taking exception to the removal of features included on previous Nikon entry level DSLRs, most notably the external stereo microphone input and more importantly, the ultrasonic sensor cleaner. Buy the D5500/D5600 if you are into video. The D3400 is designed to produce excellent images, and it succeeds in every way.<br />I cannot respect any review that downgrades a product for not including features that the buyer wants, but is unwilling to pay for. These features are available in other, more expensive Nikon cameras. If all the best technology and every feature were included in the entry level D3400, no one would ever buy the more expensive models, so like everything else in the world, you get what you pay for.<br />I purchased the D3400 at a Christmas 2016 promotion with the two AF-P zoom lenses, camera bag, plus other accessories for an extraordinary fair price. I couldn't ever ask for anything more at that price, and though I might be better served long term with an upgraded model, only the 11 point auto focus system really concerns me. Nikon could have, and in my opinion should have, upgraded the focusing system to at least 39 points. That would really help with eliminating some out of focus images, especially in group photos and some fast action events. It's not a huge problem, but since I typically use single point auto focus, it's not a big deal.<br />My biggest area of concern is the DX format itself. I have the same complaints with the D3400 as I did with my D200. The reduced sensor size yields somewhat flat, minimal depth of field photographs. I find the lens choices very disappointing. Nikon should at the very least make DX lenses in equivalent focal lengths to the old 35mm standards: 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 85mm, and 105mm. These are essential sizes and Nikon's unwillingness to produce them shows the true lack of respect and commitment by Nikon to the DX format. These are \"toy\" cameras for Nikon. I don't mean just the D3400, I mean the entire DX lineup up to, and including, the D500. Nikon does make one lens, the 35mm DX, that is close to a 50mm, but in reality, is a 52.5mm lens. They can and should do better.<br />An experienced photographer can produce stunning images with the D3400. There are no features missing that prevent making great pictures. Features easily accessible by separate controls are accessed by the menu system, which might seem cumbersome to some, but is only a minor problem easily managed by manipulating the \"recent settings\" list to provide quick access. There is no practical reduction in quality for only having 12 bit raw files for anyone, but since nearly every D3400 buyer shoots exclusively in jpeg, it's a non issue.<br />For those experienced enough to understand the camera, adjusting the menu settings will provide much more control. The default settings make the D3400 a point and shoot camera which is fine for anyone wanting a fully automatic camera to take family pictures. Remembering that this is the target market for the D3400, Nikon elected to make default choices that are different than what I would use, but that's ok. I know how to make the camera work for me and my needs.<br />I have taken a few images with the included AF-P lenses. They are excellent. However, I use my Nikkor 16-85mm AF-S lens, or a 35mm f1.8 DX lens. They are familiar and work well for my needs.<br />I don't take video, so I will not comment on the video functions. I'm not really into all-in-one products. For me, a camera is for taking photographs. That is all. If I wanted a video camera, I would buy one.  As said before, wireless connectivity is not a concern, as I view it as a gimmick. Those wanting to post a picture online should either take images with reduced file size to begin with, or wait until the end if the day and use a proper camera to computer connection. While there is tremendous detail available when using the sensor to its maximum capabilities, storing and sharing images will be very cumbersome. Most will benefit from using a medium size file.<br />Remember, this is not a smart phone, it is a serious camera in experienced hands. Everyone complaining wants the benefits of a high resolution DSLR with all the convenience and ease of use of a smart phone. Sorry to inform you of the bad news, but you cannot have both. You need to choose and you must accept the limitations and advantages of your decision. No one was forced to buy a D3400. That is a decision that each of us has made. Don't complain about \"missing\" features. Nothing is missing. Other features are available at higher price points. There are only two choices. Pay more and get more OR pay less and get less.<br />The Nikon D3400 is the best entry level dslr that Nikon has ever made. The next one will be even better. That is the way of electronic advancement. But for now, I thoroughly enjoy the D3400. It has met all my expectations. That is all I ever ask from a product, and Nikon has delivered. What I hope Nikon will produce is a full featured FX camera with maximum commitment to minimizing weight and mass. That's my wish camera. Maybe someday. And yes Nikon, I am willing to pay for it.","Excellent","bought for a friend, but he loves it.","I researched for weeks before buying this camera....I did NOT make a mistake.<br />It's suggested that this is a beginners DSLR....but honestly, I'm not sure what more you could need.<br />Light weight, versatile, and great pictures.","Great entry level DSLR! Very easy to learn on and takes beautiful pictures. Deducted a star because while snap bridge is a good concept,  it's poorly executed.","First off I would like to say I really like this camera.  Having said that I should point out that I am old school.  I started out with the Nikon F2 & then the F4.  Here is my point; I don't think of this as a beginner camera.  It has some great features (photoshop) practically built in but if you are looking to take snap shots & selfies then save your money.  It can do some amazing things with amazing features but what is it you want?  I am not knocking the camera but those who buy it.  It does come with a quick overview manual guide (111 pages) but the online guide is roughly 356 pages (does this tell you something?)  This camera can do an awful lot.  To break it down it is sort of like buying an extra large supreme pizza when all you want is 2/3 slices with cheese.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong!!!  I think it is a quality camera but be sure it is right for you is all I am saying.","When we received it it did not work we had to send it back but in a very short time we had the new one and it works fine","Amazing camera, high quality and exactly as specified! I'm so in love with my new camera!","Great little camera.  Even without all the bells and whistles it still gives you an amazing image quality on the screen and on paper.","Daughter loves it; great features very versitile even uploads automatically to her phone","Great camera to begin a reflex way!","It is amazing","Everything is just perfect for beginner photographers. Mic option would help to make video. No Mic plug kinda sucks.","This is a great entry level camera. I like the snapbridge feature. It connects to your phone via Bluetooth and transfers a reduced copy of the pictures which is nice for posting to social media. Lots of auto and effects settings","Incredible product for the money. Excellent value. Perfect camera to get started with and to learn the basics of photography.","It does more than I expected. It's a great camera for the price.","awesome..not bad for the price.","After using for a couple of month, I really like this camera.  It is easy to learn to use quickly out of the box and fun to play with.","I started with a Nikon d3000  years ago and have loved it! They're user friendly without being a dummy camera. I am impressed with the video quality and photo quality of the d3400. It feels much sturdier than previous models. I use this camera mostly for amature videography.","The  camera is awsome, the photos are really good, but the connection with celphones is bad, its dificult to have a connection with out a problem. Often it disconects, so this make difficult the prosses to download photos","Seriously!  I can't believe I debated so long!  I kept reading reviews, comparing different models, different brands.  I am IN LOVE!  This is a fabulous<br />camera.  Very fun to use!  Simple manual (no 100 page boring and confusing manual)!  Both lenses are great!  ZERO complaints so far!  Very easy to start using right away on manual mode, but with additional advanced options!  So looking forward to really diving in and learning all the ins and outs!","Had to choose between the Canon and nikon like, I love this camera I fine the pics are very shape, I am still getting use to it but I think I chose the right camera the pics are great. I got this camera to do photography on the side. Love it ","I love this camera, I bought it as an upgrade from my Canon SX50hs. The image quality it's outstanding and blows away the Canon. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a step up without killing your wallet. Easy to use and the Snapbridge app is a fantastic addition, go out and buy one today.","I am beyond happy with this camera. It shoots like a pro and has so many settings and features on it that I have yet to learn everything, but love what I have tinkered around with so far. This is my first \"nice\" camera. I was researching the best \"cameras for beginners\" and the Nikon D3300 was rated as the top, but this model, the D3400 has built in Bluetooth so that way you don't need the external adapter. Anyways, you should all buy it and we can conquer the world, one beautiful picture at a time!!! ","Yes it did, it takes good quality pictures, and the price fit my budget, thank you..","Awesome Camera Great Pics and I love how it sends too my phone automatic","This is a great DSLR camera with big lens","This is my first DSLR and even as a newbie it is helping me take great photos.  I'm very impressed with all of the features and it encourages learning more about camera settings and how to setup great shots.","good camera","Exceeds my expectations. Great camera.","We love our camera! There are so many settings that make it an amazing camera to work with. I like to just keep it on automatic, and takes amazing pictures. My husband plays around with the settings, and takes great pictures as well. It comes with everything you need, but make sure you get a memory card.","Great camera","This camera as a beginner one, it actually brings you the same sensor quality as D7200, if you don't care about the focusing speed. It's cheap, it's light, comfortable to carry it outdoor. The battery lasts long, convenient wireless transmission. If you don't shoot wildlife or sports, don't think about other APS-C but this. 11 focal points are absolutely enough for non-sports shooting. I know everybody who loves photography has a full-frame dream. However, the truth is, only few of us can afford that price, and many of those few they don't insist to taking photos. I love this camera, it writes down every drop of my life.","I got this camera for my husband for Christmas and he is absolutely in love with it.  We both recommend it for everyone.","love it","Nice little camera if you want travel lite. Has lots of easy features. don't forget its not a pro modle.","Love it!!!  Just starting out with my new found hobby, and it has me looking very professional. . .Love It!!!","She loved it!","Nikon never disappoints. Loaded, lightweight, quality camera. Lots of bells and whistles, could be too many. Still getting familiar with all the features. I started using Nikon over 30 years ago when my father passed down his Nikon FE 35 mm, circa 1976. Finally went \"digital\" in 2000. Thought about trying a Canon, but I think I shall stick with Nikon.","Great price. Arrived quick. Better than costco.","I've been wanting to move up from a point and shoot digital camera for quite a while. My Sony DSC-H3 (8.1MP) is limited in what I want to do; although it's been a good camera and I'll continue to use it some,  having the higher resolution and greater versatility of the DSLR opens up my creative streak. So far, it's been a steep learning curve for me, but it gets easier very rapidly to utilize the features the D3400 has. The lenses are a bit basic, but do a very nice job even though their max aperture isn't as large as the much-higher priced premium lenses. I have not found the lack of image stabilization on the 70-300 lens to be an issue, even hand-holding at 1/70 sec shutter speeds.  All the buttons and controls fall naturally to fingertips when holding the camera, allowing quick adjustments with a minimum of fumbling. I can't imagine what one of the upper-line Nikons is like to use, as well as this one performs. This is an outstanding entry-level DSLR and has quite a bit of room to grow with, simply by using premium lenses. Youtube has numerous videos devoted specifically to the D3400, by quite a few professional photographers, so you can get a varied education in its use. My last SLR camera was a Minolta XD-11 film camera from the '80's, and I am amazed at the versatility of the new DSLR's compared to it. Being able to bang away, making lots of pictures without worrying about film cost, is also a big plus. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to move into photography as a hobby, or even to start professionally. Below are a couple of photos from a recent beach trip.","Excellent purchase. The wife wanted a second Nikon camera so I bought this one for her. The camera takes excellent pictures and the wife is happy. So, I strongly recommend this camera and lens set.","The discription was accurate","Take great pictures, my wife love it.","Perfect camera for getting photos of wild game and landscapes as the basis for my watercolor paintings. Easy to use, change of lenses, etc. and very good definition. I was a little disappointed that two days after my purchase the same combination of camera and lenses were on Amazon for $100 less that what I paid!!!  Bob C","Amazing camera and lens kit! So happy with the photos and ease of use.","disappointed in the NIkon name here. expensive camera with results less than expected.also heavy to hold with long lens, that really wasn't long. my images looked tiny by comparison with my Lumix point and shoot. never again ... maybe canon next time.","Great camera","Cameras came on time and it is perfect for my friend as a xmas birthday present. He is using it as a beginner camera","This is my first venture into the world of SLR cameras since I stopped using film. The D3400 is fairly easy to understand and quite easy to use.","Bought for the wife since she was wanting to get into photography.  She absolutely loves it!  Easy to use and the bluetooth to device lets her edit pictures with ease.","It was OK.  I wound up returning it for a slower than desired shutter speed and no HSS flash capability.","I am loving this camera.  snap bridge is easy if you just go to the nikon website and follow the instructions for setting up.<br />Follow and do eaxctly as they say and it will work like a charm.  Great camera!","This camera take very nice photos and has some very nice features.  One of them is NOT Snapbridge.  The app won't work with the IPhone, so I wonder how Nikon can market a product as having bluetooth connectivity when it clearly does not work with IPhones?  This is very disappointing and Nikon support says they are currently working on updating the app.  So, when will that be????<br /><br />The camera does not have WiFi, an external mic, automatic sensor cleaning, and has a reduced flash output.  It does, however, offer a lighter camera body, longer battery life, and affordability.<br /><br />The package deal does not include a 70-300 Vibration Reduction lens.  Not a deal breaker.  It takes great photos and has some nice features.  The package my daughter received as a gift included 2 batteries, charger, SD card, camera, 2 lenses, and camera bag.  Not bad for $500.  It did not include cable to connect to a TV or computer.<br /><br />Costco had the best Black Friday price.  The extra battery ($40 value) was a winner.  But ask yourself how important WiFi or Bluetooth will be for you.  For most people, they will hardly ever use this feature.  But if you want it, then you may want to consider a product that offers WiFi, instead of Snapbridge at this time.  Clearly, Nikon marketed a product before they perfected the App for Snapbridge.<br /><br />I think this camera is very good and you will like your photos.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with Nikon.  I use the D5300 and love it.  Just figure out what you want our of your camera, then do your research.","Bought it for my daughter.  She loves it, loves the Wi-Fi capabilities. Shoot and send.","Too difficult to figure out the settings to take a picture of the moon for a novice.","I love this camera so much! It's easy to figure out and takes beautiful pictures! Best birthday present ever!","Excelent photos and automatically download each photo to my cellphone. Great Semi-pro camera for begginers","Nice kit!","Compared to my mothers Canon T6i, this is just about up to par with functionality. The quality of the image isn't as great, but for that price, you really can't get any better. It's a great camera!","great camera","All around great camera. Options are good. Good for a beginner.","I love this camera, so many features and Bluetooth straight to my phone say what!!!! I love it 100%","After many years of shooting basic photos with a smartphone, we decided to make the jump to a DSLR when we saw a nice sale on the D3400.  I'm so happy we did -- couldn't be more pleased with this camera!  Even without delving into its more advanced settings, the image quality is just incredible.  In the first few days with it, it's been fun capturing detailed close-ups of wildlife, or low-light scenes that would have resulted in a washed out, blurry mess with the phone camera.  It's easy to take nice-looking portraits with sharp, detailed subjects and soft, blurred backgrounds.  I'm pretty excited to learn more, improve my skills, and capture even better images.<br /><br />Its versatility, ease-of-use, nice price point, and fantastic image quality make it a real winner as an entry level DSLR.  All of a sudden, the quality of images that I'm able to capture is more limited by my own creativity than by the camera I'm shooting with, which is pretty neat.  Highly recommended!","After learning digital photography on an inferior camera, this one is a dream come true by comparison.<br />That said, it's only as good as the person aiming it; you probably want to start off with something more economic  until you know what you're doing or you might as well use your cell phone.","this camera is so great! the pictures really come out super clear","This is a great camera combination. Works great and was a perfect gift.","Great pictures, read the instruction manual, follow the instructions and everything works.","great","I love the bundle deal. My camera works beautifully. I attached a photo I took of my friend.","Picture clarity is next to none however, I was expecting a product that is made in Japan. The product received was made in Thailand and adding to my disappointment, the camera sometimes would take two pictures under self timer and majority of times it will only take one picture. I know cameras of this quality can take more than one picture under self timer, but it is not discussed on the operating manual.","After using a Sony NEX c3 for awhile, I wanted to get something newer and better. The Nikon had a learning curve, but the quality of photo it produces is worth it. Pulling photos off the camera was a struggle, as Nikon has a dedicated FINE format, but shooting in JPEG solves that. All in all I'm happy with the camera for the price.","Really like this one actually. Last DSLR I used was a Canon and it was much heavier.","Great camera!","works great; easy to figure out","So far so good. I haven't been able to test its full functionality yet but from what I've encountered it's extremely easy to use for a beginner like myself","On time and as advertised","The Nikon D3400 with the new 18-55mm and 70-300mm AF-P lenses cannot be beat at the current price ($500). The D3400 camera body and compact and light for a DSLR. The 18-55mm lens is what you would expect from a kit lens and has VR (vibration reduction, the Nikon version of image stabilization). The 70-300mm is great for when you need more reach and is fast focusing. Nikon sells a VR version of the 70-300mm lens, however, they included a non-VR version in this package. That is disappointing, as the image stabilization would be helpful at longer zooms at slower shutter speeds. I plan to use this lens primarily for outdoor sports with faster shutter speeds, so it won't make much of a difference for me, but it would be nice to have the VR for indoor or low light outdoor situations. Also, Nikon has added software to this camera so it will not function with 3rd party batteries installed. I learned this the hard way and will be sending back the 3rd party batteries I purchased. However, I've been told that there are new 3rd party batteries that have found  a way around this. I'm waiting for mine to arrive to confirm this.<br /><br />I've attached some sample images I took from both lenses on the D3400 from a trip to the zoo's Festival of Lights. I used the 70-300mm for most of the outdoor animals while the sun was up, then switched to the 18-55mm for indoor animals and to take pictures of the lights (using a monopod) once the sun went down.","As described...haven't had a chance to use it outdoors but is great for family photos","My daughter wanted an upgrade camera from the Canon Rebels they were using in school.<br /><br />Her review: \"This is an awesome camera, easy to use and takes fantastic pictures.\"<br /><br />The telephoto lens is a $200 lens and works like a champ.  Some of the bundles have a slew of accessories that are worth about $40.  Definately go for the better lens and buy the add ons separately.<br /><br />Two caveats: you need to manually clean the dust as this model does not have the automatic dust cleaner; the flash is not as bright as the older models.<br /><br />Neither is a big deal.  We bought an air blowing bulb for $8 that works very well.  According to my daughter, none of the entry level DSLR cameras are great with low light, with or without a flash, so less flash power is ok.<br /><br />All-in-all, a great camera and I am a hero for finding this deal.","Love it","Great camera","Only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars, is because the Snap Bridge app doesn't work well. I can't send selected pictures to the app either. It has to be all or nothing, and I can't save that many pictures on my phone. I'm still learning how to use this, but so far, it's a great camera.","Costco offers the same items, in addition, it provides 32GB SD Memory Card, Camera Bag & Extra Battery.<br />The price.","Great camera at a great price.","Excellent entry level DSLR. Feature packed for the money. If your looking for an upgrade to your iphone camera, or a tradition point and shoot camera this is the only way to go. My fiancé spent the better part of a weekend delving into all the different modes and reading up on how to take excellent quality pictures. I noticed it does very well in low lighting conditions, better than any camera I've owned before. The auto focus feature is quick and the shutter speed is extremely fast. If your looking to fully immerse yourself in the photography hobby, then this is the only way to go. My sister has the Canon counterpart to this particular Nikon, I found it to be both slower in focusing and shutter speed, and for me personally the ergonomics were terrible, also the Canon just felt more cheaply built. Excellent value in the Nikon d3400, feature rich and just an all around good camera.","awesomeness","Very versatile outfit.","Works perfectly!","Everything I hoped it would be, beautiful photos great for an entry level photographer.","Excellent camera my wife loves it!","New learner, but very happy with the whole package !!!!","Great for a beginner. Very easy to use and its also light so its easy to carry around when traveling.","The package that contained the camera was damaged. The camera and all of the components were fine though.","LOVE IT","New to the photography industry but this camera and lenses included are an amazing beginner package!","Nothing to say. It's really work.","For a beginner like me this camera is perfect. I put it to use the first day I got it 2 weeks ago! I rated it 4 stars because they ripped me off. Lol I bought it for $595 and today it's $495 smh anyways here are some pics I've taken so far!","Great product, I bought this for my wife and she couldn't be happier. The assist features help get you started but you can take over when you feel confident.","I am loving this camera.  Have wanted one for a long time, the price dropped so I jumped at the chance.  So glad I did!  I am having a blast shooting with this camera.","I really like this camera. It's my first DSLR and the quality is great. Only disappointed that the Snapbridge bluetooth thing doesn't work. I knocked off a star for that issue.","Bought the D3400 with 18-55mm and 70-300mm lenses, along with the free \"Starter Bundle\" including a sling backpack and 16 GB memory card as a Cyber Monday deal for $500. At that price point, I'm exceptionally happy with this camera. The body is comfortable to hold, as well as the strap. Battery life has been good so far, although I haven't tested that fully. The picture quality on automatic settings is very good. This is my first DSLR, and the controls took a little getting used to, but they're pretty intuitive. The lenses are nice. I do wish the 70-300mm lens had image stabilization, but I've been able to take some nice pictures without the stabilization.<br /><br />A lot of reviews have been pretty critical of the SnapBridge functionality. It's not the greatest, but I've found that the automatic transfer of 2 MB previews happens reliably. Sometimes it doesn't pair with my phone right away, but it will do the whole pairing/transferring in the background - may just need to wait a minute. Being able to post a photo you take to FB or Instagram right away is a nice perk.<br /><br />The free sling backpack in the starter bundle is great to have. I've just been keeping all the camera hardware and charger in there - no need to store them separately. The compartments are reconfigurable, and the padding is pretty sturdy. It won't survive being run over by a steamroller, of course, but I don't have any concerns about breakage if the pack drops on the ground from shoulder height.<br /><br />Bottom line: for the $500 price point for the 2-lens deal, I'm extremely happy with this camera. At the non-cyber monday price point (currently $600), it's still a good deal - if you're not interested in the 70-300mm lens, you could forgo that to save some money.","Great Quality and picture","great, love it","Excellent camera, excellent customization, nice for begginers.","Prompt shipping and delivery, exactly as described. My son wanted a dslr camera and I wanted an entry level price. Rated highly on various consumer review sites and my son loves it. He is extremely picky about electronics and he is happy with it.","It takes good pictures even in low light, its very light, can take good video recording too","I am in love with this camera. I've been taking photos solely with various Apple camera phones over the past decade and finally decided to step my game up, especially with how many nature photos I take. I've been on 2 hikes and 1 random adventure since buying this and my photos have been revolutionized (of course). I have not been using the snapbridge feature and I'll tell you why. My connectivity is fine, everything paired well. The issue is that it will only download one photo at a time out of the however many you add to your library. So imagine my frustration when I take upwards of 80 photos on one hike and in turn need to wait 5 hours to individually upload JUST to my smartphone. Not to mention that the quality is reduced. What I do is just simply plug my camera into my computer (you will need to provide your own standard USB cable) and upload all of them to there. Bada Bing bada boom. I can also simply upload to Facebook from my computer, then download the image from there to my smartphone with pure quality and with a quickness. I could also just plug my smartphone into the computer and do it that way. So I knock off one star for this Bluetooth feature not being the greatest idea, but the camera is superb with stunning photos. And as any photographer will tell you, you will need to learn the tricks of the trade to produce top notch photos. But this camera already gets you most of the way there.","I brought this camera for early Black Friday sale, I got the 2 lenses bundle.<br /><br />I want to get into photography, point and shoot cameras, GoPro as well as my phone have only so many settings that can be adjusted. I decided with D3400 as its newer version of D3300 which is top rated beginner camera. The only thing I know that D3400 has and D3300 does not is Bluetooth.<br /><br />The camera is easy to use, changing lenses is easy, set up was a breeze. Bluetooth works well, after I take a picture within seconds its automatically uploaded to my phone.<br /><br />So far I have been just practicing takings pictures around the house, my son, car and Christmas lights and I love the way they look. Before purchase I learned about the ISO, shutter speeds, aperture settings which made it easier to learn.<br /><br />I have mostly been using the 18-55mm lense as its pretty much a universal lense, its great for most situations, the 70-300mm I just played with the zoom and like it so far but have had no real use for it yet.<br /><br />I would purchase it again as its an amazing camera for beginners. Don't let few people who do not know how to use it steer you away. D3300 is highly rated on Amazon as well as every website, this is the same camera but with Bluetooth built in.","i cant believe this camera at its price did not come with a memory chip. not cheap and it should have been included","I love the Nikon D3400 because it is a great ENTRY level camera. It might lack some features found in higher-end camera, but it comes at a cheaper price for those just getting into dslr's or photography in general.","its super","The sensor is much improved. Shots taken at ISO 12,000 are very usable. Makes shots in darker scenes possible which is a big improvement over the D-3200.<br /><br />I like to use the SB-400 flash .<br /><br />The AF-P lenses focus instantly as VR keeps things steady.<br /><br />This camera and it's performance means DX is here to stay...DX now out performs past platform's costing thousands more. The day will come where a DX Nikon is equal to FX.<br /><br />Very pleased. My former D-700 just can't keep up on image quality where 800 ISO was the max that could be used..we now have a ISO 12,500 that's equal or better.","Upgrading from a Kodak point and shoot camera.  So far I'm loving the quality of the pictures especially with the great zoom.  Can't wait to try it out at the zoo.","Wifey gift.  She fell in love with the capabilities of this camera.  Coincidentally,  we had the occasion to talk to a professional photographer who was at the same party and he went out and brought in his previous generation version of her camera.  Wifey uber happy with performance of this camera.  Auto downloading pics saves so much time!","The main reason I chose this camera over the 3300 was for Bluetooth. It basically never works. Disappointed.","Great","—————— BUILD QUALITY ——————<br /><br />To start off with, let’s take a look at the build quality and features of the Nikon D3400.Now if you’ve ever used a Nikon dslr before, you’ll feel right at home with the D3400. It’s got that familiar Nikon feeling with with the majority of the buttons placed vertically on the left of the screen.<br />If this is your very first DSLR you might feel like it’s quite heavy in comparison to other point and shoot cameras or your phone, but in fact the Nikon D3400 is one of the lighter DSLR’s you can buy. It’s really quite amazing just how light it is.<br /> <br />And to me this is a good thing. <br /><br />Even compared to the previous Nikon D3300, the D3400 is now even lighter, coming in at 395 grams vs 430 grams. Now that might not sound like too much, but if that gets you out taking more photos and enjoying photography more, I think that’s great. <br /><br />—————— LCD SCREEN ——————<br /><br /> • Let’s turn the camera around now and talk about the LCD screen on the back here. <br /><br />I’ve actually been very impressed with the screen on the back of the Nikon D3400. For a beginner level DSLR It’s got very good brightness and detail. Now coming in at 921,000 dots, it’s a similar display to that on the older version. For me though one thing that I would have liked to have seen and I’m a little bit dissapointed in is that we are still missing a touch screen. <br /><br />Having a touch screen really can be great, especially if you’re used to shooting on your phone. <br /><br />That being said even in bright daylight, the D3400’s screen is very good and should work well when you’re not using the viewfinder. <br /><br />—————— WIFI & BLUETOOTH ——————<br /><br />Now one of the stand out features on the Nikon D3400 is the inclusion of it’s new Snapbridge technology. Essentialy, Snapbridge allows you to take a picture on your Nikon camera and have it be automatically transferedt o your phone or your tablet. <br /><br />Overall it worked really quite well in my testing. <br /><br />This might seem like a bit of a small inclusion to the seasoned photographer, but for people getting into photography this is a great inclusion. Especially for younger users who might be used to posting to Facebook and instagram, it’s great that they will be able to share their photos taken on their DSLR online. <br /><br />—————— CANON T6, NIKON D3300 ——————<br /><br />So the D3400 just got released a few weeks ago and being in the beginner market, it’s actually got a lot of competition.<br />Firstly the camera most people will be comparing it to will be the Nikon d3300 which came before it. Now the cameras are actually really quite similar but the fact that he D3400 does have wireless capabilities is a big bonus to me.<br />And then we’ve got Canon. They’ve got their Canon T6 which has been an incredibly popular camera. To me it looks like the D3400 is going to be slightly better with a larger sensor and higher burst rate, but I’ll have to test that more in my comparison review which will be up shortly.<br /><br />—————— VIDEO ——————<br /><br />Let’s quickly talk about video for a second. Overall I was pretty impressed the video quality on the D3400, especially for a beginner level DSLR. <br />Generally I tend to recommend Canon or Sony over Nikon if you really want to take your video seriously, but for every day shots, the D3400 will be totally fine.<br /><br />One thing however that I was disappointed with with the D3400 is the lack of an microphone jack. <br />The old d3300 had the mic jack which was great if you wanted to plug in a mic to get some great sound, but it seems Nikon have thought that it wasn’t nessecary in the new version. For most people it’s not a big deal, but for budding cinematogaphers it’s a bit of a bummer. <br /><br />But overall, for most video occasions, the d3400 will do the job well. <br /><br />—————— BATTERY LIFE ——————<br /><br />Now one thing I really wanted to touch on was battery life, and this is huge. I’ve found that the battery on the D3400 is a huge step up in comparison to the D3300. Nikon are claiming that the battery life is around 1200 shots per charge on the d3400, compared to just 700 shots on the older model. <br />And in my testing, that’s about right. <br /><br />But what does this mean to you? <br /><br />Well it essentially means rather than taking a spare battery with you on your weekend away, you should be pretty fine to just take your camera and go, without the worry that it’s going to run out. Great job on that one Nikon. <br /><br />—————— AUTOFOCUS & BURST MODE ——————<br /><br />Now let’s talk about the burst mode on the Nikon D3400. The D3400 can shoot at 5 frames per second.<br />For a beginner DSLR, that’s actually very impressive, especially compared to the likes of the Canon t6 and will be great if you want to take photos of sports and wildlife. Autofocus was also really quite good. Now compared to a higher end model like the Nikon D5500 or D7200, it is a little slower, but for nearly every other occasion, the D3400 performed fantastically. <br /><br />So overall as you can tell I’ve actually been very impressed with the new Nikon D3400. Apart from a few things like the missing touch screen and mic jack, this is a very capable entry level DSLR and is definitely going to be one of the most popular DSLRs for 2017 and on. ","I can't tell you how much it was worth the wait for this camera. I was so close to buying the d3300, and when I saw this one was being released a few weeks later I decided to wait. The most important feature of this camera is the bluetooth connectivity. Instantly having my pictures downloaded on my phone to share has been an incredible convenience (not to mention it gives the green eye of envy to all my friends!). I have been completely satisfied with my purchase, had not even one issue come up with it. Also, I highly recommend buying the bundle with the 300mm lens, I use both of them all the time, it's well worth the investment.","The Nikon D3400 is a very good DSLR that appears to take a step backwards from it's predecessor, the D3300.<br /><br />The Good:  The D3400 takes high resolution (24MP) photographs in a very small and light package (for a DSLR).  Higher ISO photographs do not show too much image degradation or image noise.  The very light Kit lens is surprisingly sharp and collapses to about 2/3 of its size when not being used.  Like all DSLRs, an optical viewfinder is very convenient when shooting in bright sunshine.  Nikon (and third party vendors) offer a very large selection of DX  lenses. Image Quality appears almost identical to the more expensive D5500.<br /><br />The Not so Good:  Almost every feature found in the D3400  can be found in the older, and now much cheaper,  D3300 (the only new feature I observed is the ability to transfer photographs easily to most cell phones).  The D3300 has a very important feature the newer D3400 lacks; automatic sensor cleaning.  The internal flash appears (to me anyway) to be much weaker than the D3300 and most other DSLR cameras.  Also, the new kit lens no longer has a switch to turn off the VR (Nikon's Image stabilization system) useful when shooting on a tripod.  The screen does not move.  The Auto White Balance (especially indoors) is not nearly as good as the Nikon D7xxx series; The AWB  is very warm with a definite orangery tint; Skin tones are almost always innacurate.<br /><br />Recommendations:  Unless you greatly value the ability to easily transfer photographs to your cell phone, you will be much better served by purchasing the cheaper D3300.  Image quality on the D3200, D3300, D3400 and even the D5300 and D5500 are all very, very similar. If your budget permits and the size/weight is not a factor, consider the MUCH better D7200 (or the D7100 or even the older D7000).  The built in flash is not great; an external speedlight with bounce capabilities is really essential for properly exposed photographs (or alternatively not using a flash at all and shooting at a higher ISO/slower shutter speed).<br /><br />Like all cameras, the most important component is the skill and imagination of the photographer.","I have had great results with color accuracy and sharpness. I had real issues using my old zoom lens that I like to use. The auto focus was terrrible and missed a few pictures. Had reall loved the camera and was under the impression the older lens would work. I will add that my other zoom lens up to 200mm worked fine. The greater the zoom the more I struggled to get a focus read. The rest of what I had done really was an upgrade from my older body. Will keep that handy until I can trust the greater zoom.","Love this camera kit. Yes, it's a kit lens set, but it takes great photos. I love the blue tooth transfer of pics to my iPhone!","This is my brief review of the Nikon D3400, a bit of background, so I am photographer at a theme park I also do events on occasion and they supply us with mostly D3000 series cameras so I have 7 months of experience with D3100 D3200 D3300 and now the D3400 and all of them have proven to be durable and reliable with fantastic image quality. Now to go a bit more in depth with the D3400, so immediately I noticed how much quieter and faster the AF system was but it also had one issue right out of the box that scared me at first when I swapped lenses from the kit lens to a 35mm f1.8 lens I have the AF stopped working all of a sudden, I turned off the camera prior to swapping and I carefully removed the lens cap along with the inner cap for the 35mm and the AF worked fine but when I put the kit back on the AF was frozen like I could see it selecting the focus points but nothing happened, so I thought nothing at first and I switched it on and off and nothing happened so I removed the lens and put it back on and nothing happened  and on the third attempt to remove the lens and put it back on it finally worked and hasn't occurred again, so its not a big issue as it resolved it self but at the same time it may happen again. Image quality is amazing very very good even with the kit lens but low light is a little rough its a tad noisier then id like it was very similar in low light to a camera with a 1 inch sensor so i was quite surprised with the low light having the noise it did with it being a APS-C and a 1 inch sensor camera doing better. So going from a D3300 (Which we normally shoot with) to the D3400 you don't see that massive of a upgrade actually its barely an upgrade I would personally just get the D3300 with the kit lens of the D3400 and you would be golden, however as a personal camera the snapbridge is amazing I used to hate the wifi from most cameras it was slow I had to fiddle through menus to get into it and it would never work but this is something else I simply turn the camera on take the shot turn it off and boom its already in my phones photo gallery automatically and since it saves a 2MP to your phone its not massive and wont take up much space but you can turn this setting off if you'd like but I can't live without it now. Its super simple to use for someone just getting into photography and it works great for me as a backup cam for when I dont have my 5Dsr with me its also easier for travel being a tad smaller and having unbelievable  image quality. It feels very solid in the hand the material its made of feels great and durable I would not think its weather sealed or shock proof but its not crappy and doesn't feel cheap. So all in all its one great little camera I give it a 7 out of 10 kudos Nikon for making this little beauty. Now if you have a D3300 I would not suggest you upgrade to this you wont notice anything new other then the snap bridge and lack of a mic jack and slightly better battery I would consider your next upgrade to go up and beyond a D7200 because its the same sensor and processor the image quality will be the same.","Great camera, Bluetooth is a major key, can send all your pictures straight to your phone.","A Bit of Background:<br />I upgraded to the D3400 after the auto-focus on my D3300 died and getting my old refurb repaired was likely to cost half of what the new one would. I loved my D3300 as a beginner's camera. I wanted to develop my photography skills, and be able to take a shot at astrophotography without spending too much. For these purposes it worked really well, but when it started to malfunction, I knew I still wasn't ready for something with more settings I probably wouldn't use.<br /><br />This Camera:<br />  This camera is very similar to its predecessor, which in my opinion is good, if you liked your D3300.  The only real differences I have detected as of yet are as follows (I will update these as I use the camera more):<br /><br />Bluetooth:  I really like the Bluetooth. Being able to post my photos to Flickr or Facebook because the camera sends them directly to my phone is pretty satisfying. I read some complaints about the app, SnapBridge, but have not run into any issues myself yet and had no trouble pairing my devices.<br /><br />Different ports to connect to PC:  UPDATE, I do not know what the exact difference in ports is, but they are different than the ports on the D3300 and the micro USB cord I used to use to connect my camera to my PC is no longer compatible. (I posted photos of the difference between the ports on the two cameras. The D3400 is the shiny red one.}  Not only are the ports different but the camera did not come with any cables that would allow me to connect it to my PC. Also something of note, and this is part of why I gave the D3400 4 stars instead of 5, is that while the camera does come with a battery charger, it does NOT come with a battery or a memory card. Luckily for me, the battery from my D3300 was compatible. If I had ordered this camera without having owned my D3300 previously, I would have been really annoyed at the absence of these.<br /><br />Image Quality:<br />The D3400 does not disappoint when it comes to image quality. If you are upgrading from the D3300 you can expect the same beautiful image quality as you had before. The attached photos were taken with the 18-55mm lens that comes with this package. I love the lens as an all purpose default lens to have on my camera. It can zoom up really well for great detail, which are my favorite shots.<br /><br />In Short:<br />This camera is great and doesn't disappoint, aside from the lack of peripherals that are really required for getting going taking photos. Not coming with a battery, memory card and necessary cables really rubs me the wrong way, especially considering how much we are paying for the camera.<br />I will likely update this as I play more with this little beauty. If you want something similar to your D3300, but are not expecting a lot of upgraded bells and whistles, this is the camera for you. If you are coming from no camera, or a different one altogether, I still recommend the D3400 for beginners or casual photographers that want good image quality, especially in low light conditions, at a reasonable price. Just remember to order your peripherals, as all you get in this package is the lens, the strap and a charging port."]},{"name":"Canon EOS Rebel T6 (EOS 1300D)","amazon_reviews":["a great value and pack. very happy with this purchase. i had another canon rebel before this, but it didn't have the wi-fi connectivity. that connectivity has made me open up to so many new angles for photography and i'm really happy with it","Arrived right on time and in perfect shape.

Really awesome for a beginner with dslr","Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she really likes it.","We need a camera for our family business so we decided to go with the Canon T6 and it was a great investment... We were  taking pictures with our phones before we purchased the Canon T6.. It was okay but not the best...Since our business is considerably making custom cups & T-shirts.. Anything to do with sublimation ink..Since we bought the Canon T6 our business  improve at least 40%....That my friend is call a great investment....","I love this camera","Bottom line ... I was expecting something amazing. I got something okay.<br /><br />So, I should start off by saying I am probably the prototype of the consumer this camera is marketed for. I have a great eye for photography. I've won a few photo contests and anyone who has ever seen my Instagram feed cannot believe a smartphone user took the photos I post. However, I know nothing about photography. To me ISO sounds like a ticker symbol for a stock and Aperture sounds like a night club in Miami.<br /><br />I have always wanted to learn photography but did not want to spend a grand on a camera unless I was sure it was something that would stick. Enter my wonderful girlfriend who surprised me by getting me a Canon T6 Rebel for Christmas. I read up on it a little bit and figured I'd use the auto mode and then gradually figure out how to go off auto mode while I was using it and learning.<br /><br />First of all ... Every picture looks amazing on the screen after you take it. Scrolling through I could hardly believe how crisp and vivid the photos looked. Then, I moved them from the camera to the computer and ... Blah. The photos looked grainy. Slightly blurred in dark conditions and the shots during the day taken on a picture perfect blue sky day in LA looked as if the sky was white and overcast. Very dissapointing.<br /><br />I figure maybe they have to be cleaned up. I put them into Canon's photo editing software and soon discover I'd have a better chance of editing them with an etch a Sketch. The 3 included Canon software programs for 'editing' are basically useless. (web search verifies this) Okay, so now I have washed out, sort of blurry photos and will have to buy Photoshop. Not off to a good start.<br /><br />The wifi feature is basically useless. I'm usually pretty good at techie stuff but this wifi has me stumped. No matter what I do or how hard I troubleshoot, I cannot connect my smartphone and it will not recognize my network. I spent hours on it with no luck.<br /><br />The menu on the camera seems easy but oddly my T6 will all of a sudden switch me into some random mode. One time, no matter what I was doing, the camera refused to take photos in autofocus mode. It would focus over and over, the lense would white and buzz and then it would give me a red square. No photo for you. So, I switched it into 'quick focus mode' after I'd line up the perfect shot only to be denied a picture by the camera's auto focus. The photos looked great on the small screen for playback. But when I downloaded them onto the computer, it looked like they were taken underwater through crinkled celophane while shaking the camera. Again, they look great on the LCD screen but then look blurry and gross when blown up on a big screen. So quick focus definitely doesn't live up to its name. Forget about using manual focus. It's impossible. The area you have to put your fingers on for manual is beyond small. And when you do it, the photos NEVER look crisp.<br /><br />After a while, I tried using the semi-manual settings and then going full manual with the help of several 'Canon for dummies' sites only to find that a smartphone photo run through Instagram looks like the Mona Lisa compared to any pictures I take with the Rebel T6. (Also, you don't realize how much you will hate a fixed LCD screen until you have one ... Should you make the mistake of buying a Rebel, spend the extra for the T6i.)<br /><br />Overall ... Extremely dissapointing. Maybe for someone who has taken a ton of photography classes, you can get through the pitfalls of this camera. But no pro would be buying this cheap a DSLR. This is made for movies learning photography. Given that I am the market of those this camera is made for, I really am not thrilled by it. I'll go back to a high res point and shoot any day as I just do not see any difference in image quality between this and a $400 top of the line point and shoot pocket size camera. The size of this thing doesn't make up for the awkwardness of the performance.<br /><br />Also, I feel it is very awkward to hold. It feels lost in my hands and I always worry about dropping it because it's so awkward to hold. Skip this ... Buy a Sony.","Still learning, but for  a youth challenged woman (senior), I'm making progress.","Been using the camera for about a month and I love it.  Great camera.","Perfect item!!","It finally came! I'm in love with my camera. I just need to learn how to work it better but with just simple settings, the image quality is amazing for beginner photographers!","Very pleased with this camera! It came promptly, and all pieces and everything I needed to get  started  shooting were in the box.<br /><br />I purchased this for casual photography, I wanted to be able to take photos of my son that were better than smartphone quality, and this did just that. I wasn't so sure about jumping into getting a DLSR camera with no practice, but this really is quite easy to use once you spend some time playing around with it.<br />I chose this camera specifically for its wifi capabilities, I wanted to be able to instantly connect my photos to my smart phone and be able to edit there on the go if I so chose to. It connects like a dream, you DO have to download an app to get connectivity, but its simple to operate.<br />The 18-55mm Lens is a great starter, I have no complaints so far about using it to capture the photos I am wanting.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about which camera to get, I recommend joining a Facebook group for the cameras you are interested in, or just a beginner photography group, and look at the photos posted there and see if they are the quality you are looking for.<br />Overall, Its the person behind the camera that will affect how they look in the end, but it gives you a good idea what to expect.<br /><br />However, I would unequivocally recommend this camera if you are a beginner to using a DLSR camera.","Wy wife who is a freelance writer got a gig that requires her to include photos with her text. She's only used a point a shoot and takes awful pictures. Using the presets on the Canon, she can take passable pictures that are good enough to be published.

Great beginner camera.","I had to return it. Bought to replace my old Nikon D3100, but it wasn't even close in quality. The colors were not accurate, too much red, and contrast too high. It does take beautiful pictures of nature though - makes it look even better than reality. But I needed a camera for product photography, and had to get precise colors and contrast. I bought Nikon D5200 instead, and very happy with it so far.","Lots of features. I really like the video and WiFi. Still learning it, but so far, so good.","Cannon makes great cameras.  Upgrading the wife from her Rebel T3.  She loves it and especially loves the WiFi option for downloading the photos .  The additional photo lense works perfectly and takes great photos!","I bought this camera knowing it is an entry level camera. I was tired of the photo quality I was getting off of my Galaxy S5 and this camera went on sale on Black Friday for $450 with an additional lens bundle. It takes great photos for what I use it for. I use it to take photos outside and it does a great job even on just automatic settings. I have still not had the time to sit and read through the instruction manual and watch videos online. I can only imagine what it is capable of once I learn all the ins and outs of the manual settings.","Great camera","Great Camera with perfect adjustements!","The camera and lenses are perfect.  The hard part is learning all the bells and whistles.  I am working on it.","outstanding product","Bought for my daughter for Christmas.

My wife has an older model and I'm afraid I'm going to have to buy her one of these now. Great product","super quality, easy to carry, si not heavy at all, best of all that  worth the price","The Rebel 6 replaced my Rebel 1. It's basically the same thing, with upgrades. I don't notice any changes in performance, though. Generally reliable and easy to use. Lighter.","This camera takes amazing pictures. The addition of the larger lens was a bonus. I'm sure this has way more features than we need but I'm hoping to learn more about it with time.","Well after purchasing this canon eos rebel t6 camera kit i will say it is a very good camera. Well to be honest im not a professional photographer im just a regular guy a beginner no experience so i just bought this camera a month ago and well its my very first camera to buy this i wanted to take unique pictures and pictures of everything and including family to. So yeah when it arrive on the first day i open the box read the manual and follow the instruction but some of the parts of it are easy that i understand i kinda learn already and how to use it but there some parts i don't know so probably going to understand it in the coming months im still inexperience but i know and how do it at least. I took some pictures and it came out great and wonderful to think realistic picture and just wow very nice i took. Its been one month since i been using it and just wow the difference between pictures plus i switch the lenses to take far away picture very happy with it. Also i sometimes do half like auto mode to automatically take pictures and manual. So yeah Great Canon EOS Rebel T6  Camera Kit very happy with my purchase.","Very Good!","Nice camera!!","great camera and work fine  Would recommend it","Exactly what my husband needed for his new camera!

The camera is very simple to people like me that only wants a good camera with a good quality photos. This camera will be my new best friend for my travels.","Love it.  I'm by no means a photographer, but wanted something for my upcoming birth/baby for the future.  I would recommend photoshop and getting actions offline to help when you do not take the best pictures:)","This camera was perfect for me.  I am a beginner  and this has been great for taking the pictures of my grandkids and giving me a professional look.  I am really satisfied and glad I purchased this.","I am very satisfied with the camera and items received but upon receiving the camera bag the strap on it was ripped. For such a large price item  I wasn't happy about receiving the bag in the condition  it was is in","wonderful product","Great camera!","Purchased it as a replacement for my 5 year old Canon T3. Incredible difference between them. Downloaded the App on my iPhone and noticed that to take pictures with the phone is not very useful, but it is nice to be able to access the photos right away and share with friends via WhatsApp for example and not waste time attaching on emails. A really nice upgrade, very happy with my xmas gift.","The product met my expectations as a great beginner camera.  I enjoy taking it out and the kids love it too.","This is a great little camera, and good replacement for T3/T4.. However, I would recommend adding new lense to the kit, not staying with the default, and older lenses could have some focus issues on the T6.","Received as expected","Maybe it's a learning curve, but it takes too long to finally focus and shoot even in daylight and general scenery. Put it manual mode and play with the focus ring, you can shoot faster. The manual doesn't explain terms. I know it's not a point and shoot, but it would be nice for it to take a shot before the bird leaves the feeder (example).","My daughter absolutely loves this camera! Good starter one for just getting into photography! !!","Really nice camera. I cannot give a very detailed review since this is my first camera, but the price-quality was excellent in my opinion","Exactly what I wanted. Love this camera","100 % love my camera! especially the wifi function, that you can see what the camera sees  on your screen, and that you can basically control EVERYTHING from your phone when it comes to taking photos. also that you can view all the pics on the camera on your phone, and download the ones you want to then upload on social media. its just fantastic. and the long lens that comes with the kit is amazing as well, I'm really glad i chose to take the one with it.","I love this camera,  but the kit lenses have some limitations, so I replaced with a f1.8/50mm for everyday shooting and I'm fairly happy now. Still a beginner so trying to overcome some frustrations in landscape photography, which is my true love, but this will likely get me there as I learn more. Gave a lower review because I got gipped buying this kit over the kits that are more all-inclusive.","Takes wonderful pictures both up close and far away!<br />Best one I have ever bought !!","I love this camera","I'm just starting into photography myself, and this fits the bill perfect. Its sturdy, very functional, and takes pictures with great clarity. Also it can wirelessly transfer pictures to my phone! Couldn't have picked a better starter camera.","Great camera for beginners!!! And budget friendly","Nice camera, great picture quality. If you know some basics of photography you can exploit more features out of it.","I love the canon rebel t6! It is fairly simple to use and the quality of the pictures are fantastic!<br />This is a wonderful camera!","My 16 year old is loving this camera. It's perfect; not basic yet not overwhelming. Easy to upload to social media sites.","Great Entry Level SLR","This is a great camera. You can really do a lot with the two lenses. Plus, the camerA can be as simple as putting it on automatic and pushing the button or you can individualize the settings to customize the shot.","The Canon is everything we expected including good value.","Worth the money!","Still reading the manual and getting acquainted with it. Would have liked to have had at least a minimum card to learn to shoot with, but no big deal, I have others. Lots of information, very small book with very small print. It's going to take a while or I'm going to find a class.<br />Referred this camera to a 20 year pro. she gave it excellent ratings/","Great Camera takes wonderful pics. What A deal<br />@ that price great deal.","Fabulous package.  Camera is excellent and easy to use.  FAST.  Great pictures.  Switching lenses is a breeze.  Padded case is great size.  Very happy with this purchase!","SUPER FAST SHIPPING.  AS EXPECTED,  EXCEPTIONAL CANNON QUALITY.","I've been using my EOS Rebel T6 for about two weeks now and have to say that it is a terrific base level DSLR.  It offers the full flexibility of settings, with easy to navigate menus which allow easy access for quick changes during a session.  The camera is equipped with both a traditional viewfinder and a spacious and colorful easy to read/view 3\" LCD screen.<br />There is a broad selection of shooting resolution and format options - my preference is always to shoot in RAW at the highest quality setting, but you can shoot in JPEG format too with lower quality settings to conserve disk space.  The 18MP sensor produces images with excellent detail and a wide color gamut.<br />This kit comes with two lenses - the standard 18-55mm and a 75-300mm for zooming in closer - I'd recommend getting a good wide angle lens to fill in the lower range, as the 18mm setting is a bit limiting. Both lenses will focus nicely, but it can take some time. They are not nearly as fast as the higher end Canon lenses. The 18-55mm lens is equipped with shake reduction, but it is only marginally reliable - so keep a steady hand, or tripod up!<br />There is a good range of ISO settings, but anything above 400 produces more noise than I like to see. (Revision: there are some excellent settings under the Custom Settings menu for dealing with noise both for long exposures, and/or ISO related.  Its not a 100<br />% solution, but coupled with a good program like Photoshop, you can pretty much eliminate noise from your image without losing sharpness!)<br />This camera is wifi equipped - which means that you can connect wirelessly to upload images to a smartphone or tablet - it also means that, if you download the free Camera Connect app for IOS or Android, you can control your camera from the comfort of your mobile device.  I like using my iPad because it gives me an enormous view surface, so I can really see what I'm shooting - and this more than makes up for the lack of an LCD swivel feature - you can control the camera and see your framing from almost anywhere in the shooting area. If you want to put yourself in the picture you can set up either a two or ten second delay - there is a flashing amber light onboard to give you a countdown!<br />The flash is basic popup.<br />The video quality is excellent too.  Get yourself the biggest SD card you can afford if you plan to be doing any serious moviemaking.<br />The T6 gives you a lot of options as to how to make your settings. Most settings can be accomplished with buttons on the surface but you have the option of navigating the menu to get to them too.<br />A few minor issues I should mention. When shooting in continuous mode, I find that three shots is the max for efficiency. More than that and your camera starts giving you the \"busy\" signal between shots.  When I fire off five shots, there is a minute or more wait while the camera clears the data.<br />If you are accustomed to using a small infrared remote, you are out of luck with this model.  Remote shooting is done via mobile device or with a cable release.<br />The shutter sound is pretty loud so you might not want to use this one for concerts.<br />Overall, this is an excellent entry level DSLR.  If you are moving up from Smartphone photography, or from a point and shoot digital its a great first step. You can shoot simply to start but have the luxury of custom settings when you are ready to learn to use the camera more efficiently.<br />I'd recommend a few spare batteries. The rechargeable made for this camera gives me about 300 shots on a charge - so for longer shoots I'm careful to bring a few spares with me.","Good product, awesome","I love it. It works super. Its easy to use. The first time I printed pictures that I took with it I had to sign that I was the photographer. They looked to professional to the clerk. I'd definitely recommended it to anyone looking for a camera that takes great pictures. I admit I stalled a little at the price but after seeing how good it takes pictures I don't regret buying it.","Arrived timely and perfect as expected","It is everything I thought it would be !!!!<br />I'm in love<br /><br />I wish it had touch and flip screen but I knew it didn't when I purchased it.","Gave to my wife for Christmas. Started using immediately with excellent pictures in auto. Now she wants to take photography class. Easy setup for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth even as a novice. Nice start up kit.","Excellent cost benefit. If you wanna start in to the DSLR world, this is a good choice.","Absolutely love it! I can easily hook up to wifi and share my photos to my phone and my computer.","very very good","As expected... working great... value for money","Very grateful","Get it and feel it..!! You wont get disappointed..","I'm very pleased on how fast I received this , still learning how to use my camera so far very happy thanks","Excellent camera, received 1 day earlier than expected!","Great product","Love that I can use the camera connect app to operate the camera and view photos on my phone instantly. Took a few tries to figure it out, but it works.","excellent service.Good product.Recommend for you.","I received my camera yesterday and decided to take some photos today. I must say I am impressed… I have gotten some good pictures off of the stock pictures alone. It's easy to use and its exactly what I was looking for. I think the only downside I could think of is some of the pictures are kind of blurry. Other than that its a good, solid camera so far. Exactly what a beginner needs. I can't wait to get other lenses and try them out.","I love it.Has very high quilty","Great quality","Excellent.  Love it and would recommend to others","Great camera","also bought for a gift. It's still in the box.","This is a great camera for a beginner! I only been shooting for a month and now people are asking and willing to pay me to take pictures of them(: i am planning to upgrade soon to the Sony camera series because i like the video options better on Sony! Anyways this definitely fits me as a peter parker personality person lol, I totally recommend this for a first camera and soon I'll be getting pictures of the northern lights(:","Awesome price and for Amazon prime members you got a camera back pack and memory card!! This is a Christmas gift for my mother in law and it's an amazing price for such a great quality camera!!! Thanks Canon!!!!","I bought this camera to replace my Canon Rebel T2i that was water damaged irreparably. When choosing this model, I preferred the options of the T6 over the more expensive T6i. For example, I do not need stabilization because any lenses I have which may require it (mainly telephoto) incorporate that feature. I recommend any buyer carefully decide what features they'll actually use (not just what sounds good) before choosing between this model and the T6i. You may save yourself some money, and still get a good camera. Also, for anyone who may need it, this model is very good in low light. If you shoot natural light photos (no flashes here, I shoot insects and arachnids) you'll have more color range in lower light settings.","im from the caribbean and this camera is my 1st professionally oned one and i love it sooo soooo much thanks guys for having thi","Amazing camera!! I sold my Nikon to purchase this one after my mom got this one and I had a chance to play around it and fell in love.","Good","Takes wonderful pictures. I still need to learn how to use it well but the auto functions are great for someone like me who doesn't know much about photography.","I looooooove this camera. Super clear, super gorgeous video. Great for a novice like myself, or professional who wants a good base.","great camera kit. price is very good","Arrived in one piece now I have to learn how to use it","Just the camera I wanted! Thanks Amazon!","It is amazing! ???","I really like this camera very easy to use and takes great pictures. Came in mint condition. I took this to NY a few days after I bought it and to the ocean here in CA. SSo nice and not heavy to carry around. Super fast shipping. Thank you","good as a basic camera, if you cant afford the T6s then this is the one for you. If you do video-ography the T6s is the one for you because of the rotating screen","Canon really are being a bit naughty selling this camera with the old version of the standard zoom lens and not the latest STM model. Presumably they have a large stock of the older ones and decided to unload them with the EOS 1300D. This would put me off buying this overpriced camera, as the newer lens does not have a rotating front assembly and is a bit quieter and faster in operation.","I bought this camera for my thirteen years old daughter, a budding photographer, to use for her yearbook staff. It is an excellent camera! She loves it and it takes great pictures and seems very easy to use.","Pretty happy with this camera — I upgraded from an older Rebel — but I'm really bothered by the red halo around half of the focus-finder dots on the manual setting. It's how I shoot (I photograph food and drinks). I returned my first order because it had the halo and the replacement had it even worse! I called Canon and they said it isn't supposed to look like that but I'm two for two. Thinking of returning one more time, as much as I hate to do that. Maybe third time's a charm?","Love this camera. Easy to use and for my first expense camera, I can't find anything to complain about! Love the wifi connection!","Love this camera it's awesome for a beginner like myself. Here are a couple of pics I've taken so far. '","This camera exceeded my expectations. The camera had many features I was looking for. The range of the lens was terrific.","I'm mostly a novice photographer with a specific interest:  product photography for wood turnings I make and sell online.  I purchased this camera after a couple of other failed attempts and overall, I'm pleased.<br /><br />This is a basic camera and lens combo kit and if you're looking for some bells and whistles like an articulated LCD display, this isn't for you.  However, the photos are outstanding, it has both a wide range of automatic settings as well as convenient access to more advanced controls if you want to set your own shutter speed, aperture, manual focus and so on.<br /><br />It is comfortable to hold, but I have mine tripod mounted all the time.<br /><br />Build quality is good and comparable to the Sony A3000 and the Nikon that I bought earlier.  I do prefer this camera over these others, although I will say that the Nikon LCD interface is very intuitive.  Having said that, it's basically what all low-end DSLRs are these days:  plastic. That's not a bad thing, and it makes for a nice, lightweight camera if you're out in the field shooting.  Likewise, the lens is also plastic and with a plastic mount so if you want something heavier you're better off with a bare camera and a separate lens.<br /><br />The LCD screen on this camera is of decent but not huge size. Still, it is fine for displaying settings.  In Live View mode it's pretty good in my \"studio\" but I can't comment on contrast and visibility outdoors. However, it is clear, seems to have a fine resolution and does the job. However, it isn't articulated like some people prefer so that may be a deal-breaker for you.  For me, not so much.<br /><br />Software:<br /><br />On-camera is good. It also has a \"feature guide\" that helps you along if you want to stray from the automatic settings.  For example, you can change to aperture priority mode and it guides you through other settings. Very helpful for a newbie like me.<br /><br />Bundled is non-existent. I went to the Canon site and downloaded a set of utilities (this camera is also known as the 1300D).  Included are a sort of Lightroom clone, another editor that I haven't even loaded, and a tethered shooting utility that I use.  A lot.<br /><br />So for some reason Canon doesn't provide any software with the product, and not even a manual.  That's mystifying to me but can all be found online.  I got the manual and the utilities above.  By the way, Canon is really aggravating about how you download software.  Once you find it and choose to download, be prepared to provide your body serial number in order to link to the download. Sheesh!<br /><br />The main thing I wanted was to be able to shoot tethered to my computer, and, since I've been using Photoshop forever, I also use Lightroom (and also Gimp and UFraw for those of you who know what those are :-)<br /><br />So how is that going? Pretty well. However, you have to have a tethering cable and Canon will sell you a cable for twenty-five bucks, or you can get this: \"IFC-500U Compatible USB Cable\" right here on Amazon for $8.<br /><br />Shooting tethered is great for me, because as I age, my vision is getting worse. I can now shoot products from my computer and use a 22\" monitor as a live view screen and then take the shot without touching the camera (after I've turned it on).<br /><br />Looking back, had I realized then what I now do, I'd have bought the T5 instead.  Why?  It's $100 cheaper, and really what I got for the difference is a slightly faster processor (don't need it), a better LCD screen (that I don't use), and WiFi (which sucks on this camera.  Big time).<br /><br />Why do I say the WiFi sucks? Well because it isn't really compatible with a standard computer OS.  You can shoot and dump off to a phone or an iPad but really, not to a computer?  So my hope was to fire up the camera, have it seen as another resource on my home network, and move the photos to my 2TB NAS.  However, the camera will not work in WiFi if a cable is attached, and vice versa.  Which really is rendered moot anyway by the fact that it doesn't work with a PC or a Mac OS.  C'mon, Man!<br /><br />How many photographers spend hundreds of dollars on a camera to put photos on their phone?  I mean, you can just use your phone for that.<br /><br />Hence the three stars.  YMMV","Live Canon cameras","Beautiful pics and easy to use","This is my third Canon Rebel camera and I have loved all of them. This camera can be as simple or advanced as you'd like. My old one was still taking great pictures but this has the added bonus of wireless connectivity, which I love. The price is just about perfect. It's worth every Penney because the picture quality far surpasses that of the phone. When you want to take some really special quality pictures to preserve one of those important life moments, you'll be so glad you bought this. You can change and upgrade lenses, a thoroughly addicting hobby.<br /><br />My daughter has the more expensive and more heavy Canon 5d. That camera is a definite upgrade and she loves it, but at thousands of dollars, it's too much camera for me. I mostly use the auto function and the results are awesome. My daughter, on the other hand, is a photography and camera expert. She uses all the manual adjustments and knows everything there is to know about exposure and all that. Even she says this is a fabulous camera. There are plenty of fun tools as well!","It's a cannon. So... It's better than a Nikon.","Love this camera.","nice works fantastic","Great for starting out photographers that want a point and shoot option when unsure but can still operate the professional features a DLSR is meant for!","Great camera performs well for general photography. Should meet most of the needs of any novelist.","I'm a semi-pro photographer. I have a full frame camera that I use for professional shoots which I love dearly, however I wanted an \"everyday\" camera that I could take everywhere and not be devastated if it gets stolen/broken. Also, I wanted a camera that I could hand off to someone else (like my son or husband) without fear and one that they will actually be able to use. This camera fit the bill perfectly! So a few questions you might have:<br /><br />Should I get the T6 or T5?<br /><br />They are basically the same camera. The only difference is that the T6 has wi-fi and has a Digic 4+ processor whereas the T5 has just the basic Digic 4 and no wi-fi. To me, the wi-fi was not a feature that I would use at all. I take so many photos that transferring them over wi-fi would be a joke. However, the fact that the Digic 4+ is faster and better was what prompted me to go with the T6. Plus, the screen in the back has a better resolution. However, if these features are not a big deal to you, the T5 does present a huge savings and it's basically the same camera.<br /><br />Does it come with software?<br /><br />Yes. But for some reason they didn't include it in the box, nor do they really mention it prominently in the instruction book that comes with it. The software is Canon's Digital Photo Professional (DPP) which is a raw image processor. It comes with a bunch of other software as well and they're pretty powerful/useful. You have to go on the Canon's website to download all this.<br /><br />Does it come with a manual?<br /><br />You would think the answer is an obvious \"yes\" but actually, no. It comes with a quick start guide that tells you how to use most of the automatic features and how to get started. The guide is great for beginners as it really breaks things down to basics. But you do not get the full camera manual. You have to download that from Canon's web site. (Which is a shame)<br /><br />Should I get this camera?<br /><br />I think if you're a beginner and want to explore photography, you can't go wrong with this. There are so many guided automatic modes that gently help you and the photos from these auto features actually come out really well. There's full automatic where the camera does everything, to semi-automatic where you control several things but the camera does the rest. There is shutter and aperture priority where you want to control most things but still need a helper for aperture or shutter speed. And then there is full  manual for when you feel ready to control all things the camera is capable of.<br /><br />When I'm ready to upgrade, what is the next step?<br /><br />The next step to is to get the 50mm 1.8 lens. This will enable you to work with lower available light and give you some awesome background blur. And it's probably the most affordable lens you can possibly buy.<br /><br />All around great camera for a beginner, enthusiasts, or a pro who needs something smaller and lightweight.","Item is as described.","awesome for begginers with a small budget","I have only had the Canon EOS for about six weeks but am thoroughly enjoying it.  This is my first camera that is beyond the point and shoot variety and it has been very easy to learn and use.  Takes wonderful pictures so far and I am continuing to learn how to get the most out of it.","AMAZING CAMERA! The quality of the images it takes are absolutely breath taking and on par with higher end 1,000+ dslr's. Extremely pleased with my purchase","Great camera purchased as graduation gift.","It is stunning! It was packaged so perfect and even came with a strap that I didn't know it came with. I've used it many times already and it takes amazing pictures!","I bought this camera because I dropped my version from 10 years ago. I loved my old one and I love this one even more.

I have been very pleased so far and I am learning something new each time I use it. There are some very helpful guides and communities online to give you a crash course in shooting in manual. It takes great pictures in the auto setting. But I seem to get much more enjoyment out of taking pictures in manual and playing with the settings!","This is the great camera I have ever purchased.","Outstanding value. Easy to use. Great photos. Would recommend to any aspiring, relative newcomer.","This camera is the nicest one I have owned and everything I could ever want as a novice.  Ease of use and quality of photos are superb.","Good but the cannon 80d or the T6i is a better option than this, if want the T6, get the T6i not this one.","good product quality - wifi functionality to send pictures to a smartphone is not easy to handle and is not compatible with all phones.<br />I found out the hard way as my phone cannot connect to the camera either to action through the phone or to receive pictures taken by the camera.<br />I whish I had known this beforehand so I could think about choosing a different camera (Nicon d5500 for instance).","Positive :)","Excellent.","I am brand spanking new to photography and DSLR cameras. Thanks to a few hours at the University of YouTube, I think I have the hang of it. So my review is partial, but from the perspective of a total novice to photography and something other than a point and shoot camera.<br /><br />Feature guide<br />I'm putting this first as this may be the most amazing and useful component of this camera for a complete newbie and the #1 reason this is an AWESOME camera for someone getting into photography. Since I didn't want to use my camera on auto mode (I could stick with a Coolpix if that's what I was looking for) and my goal was to learn how to use a DSLR in manual mode, the feature guide has been vital in helping me learn quickly. When changing modes (manual, aperture priority, Quick Control, etc), a brief description of the mode will pop up on the LCD. This is SUPER useful for a complete novice that has nearly ZERO knowledge (Thank You YouTube!) of what the different modes/controls are supposed to do. Seriously - best.feature.ever! For those that already know all of this like the back of their hand (I deeply admire you!), you can turn this feature off so it doesn't annoy you.<br /><br />Camera body<br />This is a heavy piece of equipment compared to the slim, simple point and shoot cameras (read: Nikon Coolpix). However, it is fairly comfortable to hold. The body has a nice curvature in the front with a rubbery grip which helps to keep it from slipping in my hand - for all I know, they all have this but again, I have little to compare it to. My son has a Canon EOS 30D (released in 2000?) and I can say that this model is significantly lighter than his.<br /><br />Lenses<br />I did some research on lenses and boy are these puppies expensive! I appreciate having both the 18-55mm and 75-300mm lenses with this kit. As a beginner, this will allow you to get all the basic pictures you could hope for all at once. I can take close up pictures and landscape pictures (the pictures I have included here were all taken with the lenses that came in this kit on my first few weeks using this camera). I'm sure there are much better lenses out there that come with a hefty price tag but for a beginner, this kit will give you everything you need to get started and take some pretty decent pictures.<br /><br />LCD monitor<br />The picture on the monitor is pretty clear and I used this a lot my first couple days. Instead of looking through the eye piece, I used the LCD display to shoot my pictures. As I became more familiar with the various ISO, F/S, and shutter speed settings, I switched up to shooting using the eye piece and used the display to quickly see/adjust my manual settings.<br /><br />Picture quality<br />I'm pretty impressed. The pictures come out clear and sharp (assuming its correctly focused when on manual focus). The colors are bold and vibrant in my opinion. I don't think the pictures of my kids have ever turned out so good. Side note: I did start using the auto focus feature recently while on a road trip to be able to shoot faster and I am very please with how well the pictures turned out. It was quick to focus and will likely be using this feature often when I am out and about (with little time to set up the shot).<br /><br />I am incredibly happy with my purchase and if I had to do over again, I would pick this model. After purchasing this camera, I purchased a used Canon 30D for my son as he wanted to learn as well. In comparison, the Canon EOS has come a long way in terms of design, ease of use for a beginner, and features but if anything, I know based on having both a new and used (old) camera in the house now, that they can stand the test of time if cared for properly. Oh, and having a bag in the kit is also pretty handy.","It's a good camera and it takes amazing photos.","Wow let me start by saying the 550$ bundle is so worth it but to be very fair this is cheaper than getting a point and shoot for the price of you want to start YouTube or want to start taking professional pictures I would really recommend this camera best for the price.","everything is fine but it is hard to rator the lens","Excellent, better than COSCO deal","Love it.","I am starting with photography and this camera is perfect for beginners<br />Excellent pictures and very easy to use","It was a gift for my grandson, and he says he loves it.  He  sent pictures from a Memorial Day camping trip<br />in the mountains, and the mountain ranges in the background were well defined and the boys in the foreground<br />were very clear.","I just love my camera !  My husband has this expensive complicated camera that I don't understand, this is why I bought the Canon EOS Rebel T6 !

Will probably by more lenses now !","Awesome camera and I'm just a beginner  !!","I like it so far.  Have not used it too much yet.","This DSLR Camera is amazing. I loved it. When I took the pictures from it people asked me what Camera I used. I would highly recommend this camera to buy.","Fantastic buy .","The Canon Rebel T6 is also known as the 1300D throughout the world. Without getting too technical, this model is a great entry level camera for novice photographers to learn the art of photography. The two lenses that are included provide the ability to take desirable photos near and far. It would be useful for anyone ordering this camera to remember lens filters, in order to protect the lenses from debris and damage. You will need a few memory cards and extra batteries are always useful. The wifi feature means easy uploading to your smartphone for social media posting or sending via e-mail. I have used the Canon Rebel series in the past and have had good luck with the model.","BUILD QUALITY<br /><br />To start off this review, let’s first take a look at the build quality of this lens.<br />The first thing you’re going to notice is just how small this camera is for a dslr. The T6 is one of the smallest DSLR’s you can buy from Canon and pretty much any company for that matter.<br />But to me, that’s not a bad thing. Being a very lightweight camera can sometimes mean you’re more inclined to pick it up and take it out with you, rather than being worried that’s it’s going to be too heavy.<br /><br />On the top of the camera right here we’ve got all of the buttons that’ you’d expect to see on a beginner dslr and also this mode dial which allows you to select the mode you want to be in.<br /><br />Of course you’ve got all of the basic beginner modes, like sports and portraits etc, but also aperture, shutter and manual modes for when you want to get a little bit more advanced.<br /><br />The buttons on the back are actually pretty nice. I would have preferred to have had the menu and display button on the top however as I use them pretty often.<br /><br />So overall the camera’s build is good for what it is, a lightweight dslr, but i’d always be a little bit careful with this type of body.<br /><br />Oh and guys if you want to see some sample images I’ve taken with the Canon t6, i’ll put a link in the description box below under this video and you can check them out.<br /><br />LCD SCREEN<br /><br />So let’s turn this camera around now and talk about the screen.<br /><br />We’ve got a 3 inch screen on the back which has 920,000 dots and after testing it out for a while, it actually looks pretty good.<br /><br />Even in bright daylight it was actually pretty easy to see.<br /><br />It is however missing something that I really do like to see and that’s an articulating screen.<br /><br />Whereas on cameras like the Canon t6i and t6s, you can swivel your screen around to get better composition, with the t6 your kind of forced to take the photo even if you can’t see the screen.<br /><br />And that’s a bit of a pity to me and something I would have liked to have seen. I also would have liked to have seen a touch screen on the back of this camera, because they’re especially good for beginners.<br /><br />The screen itself is actually pretty nice, but i’d like to see those improvements made in the next camera.<br /><br />MENUS<br /><br />So let’s quickly talk about the menus on the T6.<br /><br />If you’ve ever used a Canon camera before you’ll feel right at home with the menu system. It’s incredible easy to get around and change the settings you need.<br /><br />A little tip is that if you switch the dial on the top to manual mode, you’ll get a lot more settings that you can change which can be great.<br /><br />Again it would have been nice to have a touch screen to make it quicker to change the settings not eh fly, but this little d pad right here isn’t too bad and it’s pretty responsvie.<br /><br />So overall the menus are good, but make sure to check out more of the fearless in manual mode.<br /><br />WIFI & NFC<br /><br />So one of the new inclusions to the Canon T6 is wifi & nfc.<br /><br />So essentially what this allows you to do is connect your camera to your phone and do a number of things like transfer your photos and also get a live view of what your shooting.<br /><br />To me this is the perfect camera to have this feature, because it’s targeting a younger generation of users who love to share their photos on instagram and Facebook.<br /><br />It was pretty easy to setup the wifi, but not as intuitive as the 80d that i tested a few weeks ago.<br /><br />BURST MODE & AUTOFOCUS<br /><br />So let’s talk about the burst mode of the Canon T6.<br /><br />So essentially what this means is how fast the camera can take photos in a row per second.<br /><br />The Canon T6 isn’t super quick and can only shoot 3 shots per second.<br /><br />Now most of the time when you take a photo you’ll only be taking one shot anyway so it won’t make a big difference, but if you want to take some photos at a sports game or of a bird, this might not be the best camera for you.<br /><br />Autofocus in stills mode is actually surprisingly good, it’s snappy and should be fast enough for most situations. Now the lens that comes with the camera isn’t great, and is noisy in autofocus, but if you can get passed the noise, which sounds  bit like a bee, it’ll work pretty well in well lit situations.<br /><br />VIDEO<br /><br />So let’s talk about using this camera for video.<br /><br />It’s pretty basic for video and will be fine for day to day videos.<br /><br />Unfortunately though the autofocus in video isn’t great.<br /><br />The lens that comes in the kit with the t6 isn’t an stm lens, which means it’s not going to have smooth and responsive af in video mode.<br /><br />My tip would be to switch it over to manual focus o the lens and then just shoot like that.<br /><br />One thing howver though which was good to see is that we have full manual control over our video and audio settings.<br /><br />Where as on some older rebel cameras, you could only shoot in auto mode, the t6 does allow to have some manual control. We are missing a microphone jack though unfortunately, so if you are in need of some better audio, I might advise looking at the t6i and t6s.<br /><br />PRICE & VALUE FOR MONEY<br /><br />So let’s talk about price and more importantly value for money.<br /><br />Now the T6 comes in at $549, which is one of the cheapest DSLR’s you can buy on the market today.<br /><br />You also get a lens with that so all you need to get up and running after that is an sd card and you’re good.<br /><br />To me it’s not a bad price, but there are definitely some very competitive options that I might look at, for example if you pay just a few hundred dollars more you can get a Canon t6i which is very good camera.<br /><br />-<br /><br />So overall the Canon t6 isn’t a bad little camera, and for beginners, it’ll be a lot of fun to learn on. If you’ve never owned a dslr this is a good camera to learn on, but if you want to go a little further with your dslr, I’d definitely be looking at a camera like the Canon t6i or t6s."]},{"name":"Fujifilm XP90","amazon_reviews":["Everything works OK but the delay before a picture is taken can make one miss the shot you wanted.","love this thing, perfect for underwater shots. this is my 3rd one and would not hesitate to get another but hint hint, get the warranty with it.

I could not be happier with this camera and the pictures I get,  it takes great underwater photos too. It is small and compact and easy to carry in my purse.

The waterproof feature is great and it takes very nice pictures under water.","Beautiful under the sea images. I would definitely recommend this product.","Great product, timely delivery.","great","This camera came in quickly and in perfect working order. I have used this for videos and pictures and it looks amazing! Great price and everything went smoothly :)","This is a great camera, but you MUST be extremely careful and patient.  In case you have not learned this in your life yet, water will get ANYWHERE and EVERYWHERE!  With an underwater camera you have to be right 100% of the time.  The first mistake is the last.  And it only takes ONE drop or even part of a drop to ruin an electronic device.  So you must follow the precautions in the instructions 100%.  And I have a couple of more tips to help.<br /><br />Among other things, the instructions say to wipe the battery compartment seal with a lint free cloth, rinse the camera well after submersion, and wait until the camera is completely dry before opening the battery compartment.  Let me add this:  After the suggested rinse, shake the camera several times, battery compartment lid out, to get out as much of the water that is trapped in the tiny seam around the battery compartment cover.  Believe it or not, there is a significant amount of water trapped in there.  I discovered this by accident when I held the camera a certain way.  Even though I had dried it very carefully with a towel and paper towel, water basically POURED out of this tiny area.  It was really onl a few drops, but it was way more than I would have guessed.  Startled, I shook the camera, kind of slinging it to see how much water would come out.  I shook it many times before hardly anything was coming out.  Once I did this I set the camera in an area with a steady draught blowing toward the battery compartment end and still waited MANY hours, like 8 or so before opening it.  Upon opening, the first thing I did was inspect the area around the seal for the slightest trace of water.  Fortunately, I have never detected any, and all has been well so far.  I suspect that if a TINY amount of water got in, it would not be disastrous IF you leave the compartment cover open for another many hours to assure everything dries out.<br /><br />Because of the above lengthy procedure before opening the battery compartment cover, I would say that one battery worth of use is all you should count on each day.  I bought a couple of extra batteries, which could certainly be handy, but I realize now that for snorkeling/scuba there really is no swapping out batteries during the day.  One battery per underwater adventure is all you get so make sure it is fully charged when you start out!<br /><br />Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about the camera.  I LOVE it!  On a recent trip that involved several snorkeling sessions, it took great photos and videos.  The only problem, and it is not the camera's fault, is that between glare on the screen, and the mottled, muted underwater visual environment, it is literally impossible to see anything.  This means that you should point the camera as best you can and take 3-5 images.  Usually, I get 1 out of 3 more or less as I hoped.  Video is great, and usually I can extract a nice image to show a pretty fish I was hoping to get.  Let me clarify that video quality is great, but if you are snorkeling there is going to be a lot of jerkiness due to water motion, etc.  Again, not the camera's fault.  Both of these issues might be a lot better if you are scuba diving.  If you are well under the surface you might be able to see the screen better, and your video may not be so much at the mercy of the wave action.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, this camera has already paid for itself.  I bought it for this specific (epic) trip, and it performed admirably.  I have beautiful photos and videos from this trip, and I expect to get more on future trips.  Just remember:  Water is insidious!  It WILL get in given half a chance.  BE PATIENT, AND YOU WILL BE REWARDED.","As a pro photographer for over 10 years, I wanted to buy a fun little camera for our cruise that I could take underwater without endangering my BIG camera. This one was great.... I will say it was totally counter intuitive to take a camera into the water at first but once we got the hang of it, it was a blast! Pictures are quite clear and colors are beautiful!","Nice camera, great shape for refurbishe. Seems as though it is new..","Bought the product specifically for a trip to Mexico where I planned on snorkling.  Half way through the trip, my photographer sister snagged the phone.  Photos aren't perfect, but for the price.  This camera gets the job done.  Transferring to your phone takes a few more clicks than I wanted, but ultimately was pretty easy .","takes great pictures","It's okay. Took decent pictures, but it's hard to see tge display under water.","I have enjoyed this addition to my camera collection.  I love the results from the point and shoot feature.  The waterproof aspect means I can have it with me in many more places than I would take an ordinary camera.  The zoom is adequate for my needs.  The ability to set for many different conditions makes this a very versatile camera for me.","I love it, it works great, especially in the water","I was ready to be super impressed, but most of my photos were overexposed and the underwater ones were extremely blue even with the underwater setting on which is intended to reduce the blue.","Nice camera.  Easy to use.  I happen to like the big viewer screen in the back.  My eyes are not great and with the viewer being bigger is a great help.  The directions don't really explain the wifi clearly.  I played with it and finally figured it out.  There was a sheet enclosed with the camera which asked that I review.  It noted to email if you needed help.  I emailed but never got a response.  The camera takes a nice picture.  I haven't printed any but what I see on my iPad are nice and clear.  I would recommend to a friend.","She still enjoying it","Great Camera for outdoors and good image quality","The Fulifilm FinePix XP90 Waterproof camera is one of the best cameras I've ever used!  We travel a lot - particularly on cruises - and this camera fits in just about everywhere!  It takes great pictures in both the bright outdoors and the low lit areas inside.  But for me, the best part of this camera is that it is GREAT for taking underwater pictures when snorkeling.  It even takes video - and my husband, who uses a Go Pro - even said that he feels that this camera took better, smoother video than his Go Pro did! There are many settings you can choose for different types of photos. It's really easy to use - you don't have to be a \"camera pro\" to understand how to operate this camera.  It is also a rugged little camera. I have used quite a few of these \"small\" cameras and by far, this one is the camera I have liked the best!","quality item!","Easy to use. Pictures came out nice.","I used this camera kayaking in Alaska and Baja and snorkeling in Baja.  I am very pleased with the picture quality both above and underwater. I thought the above water pictures were particularly good. Users need to remember it is an underwater camera and zoom is limited.<br /><br />I downgraded the camera because the designers did not finish their job.  They had limited imaginations and did not consider how the camera might be used. They only provided one eyelet for the skimpiest wrist strap possible. I upgraded the wrist strap with some nylon webbing I had laying around but never used the wrist strap. Try kayaking or hiking with poles with a camera hanging from one wrist. When snorkeling I like to use my hands to swim and maneuver.  Sometimes I hold onto a rock or push away from one.  Having a camera on your wrist is a great way to damage it.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to find a 1/4x20 bolt in my junk box.  I pirated a strap off of an audio show badge and fastened it to the tripod socket on the bottom of the camera.  It works great for kayaking and snorkeling.  Downside is the camera hangs upside down and the strap is too short.  Nobody should have to go through that much aggravation to modify a new camera. Not everyone is a MacGyver wannabe.","Have only taken a few pictures so far.  The quality is very good.  Can't wait to take it in ocean in March and see how it does.","I purchased this camera to replace the predecessor model, the discontinued XP200 which survived a month shy of 3 years enduring hardcore abuse mounted to r/c vehicles, being hurled across the ground, submerged, knocked around in pockets, backpacks, car storage areas, hit with various objects at high speed, and too many drops right up to the stated former limit of 6.6 ft. I am giving the XP90 one less star than I gave the XP200 because it is slightly less rugged, but mainly because I dislike the material selections for the camera body. They aren't terrible, but I preferred the XP200's painted surfaces' smooth high-grip finish to the cheaper-feeling and more difficult to hold plastic surfaces used on the XP90. I also miss the rubber surfaces around some of the edges (and on zoom buttons) and suspect they're deletion on the XP90 has something to do with its reduced 5.8 ft drop rating. All in all, still a wonderfully versatile camera for the money. I just thought the previous model had a higher-quality feel going for it, although the XP90 seems to be pleasantly lighter by a significant margin.","Worked great. The WiFi worked better than I expected based on some reviews.<br />Underwater picture quality was fair, but the water was pretty murky. Overall I'm happy with it.","great item came fast and brand new","This is my second Finepix camera. The first one was the earlier model, XP70, which I accidentally dropped in a lake without a floater. I liked the XP70 because it was affordable, and it took okay pictures. I've just acquired this latest version, and hopefully, it is a better version of its predecessor. Time will tell!","Fun & easy to use. Makes great pictures & video!","Beautiful pictures at daylight, but, regular nightly photos. The worst? 2 days using it at the sea and the flash doesn't work anymore even when I cared about no crashing it or leaving the camara wet.<br />If you record a video in a strong wind zone, you won't be able to hear anything but the wind noise.","I want the canon 720.  this shutter speed is slow land I would not buy it again.  I wish I would have sent it back, but the ability to take it underwater to about 60 feet (check me on this)  made me keep it.","I bought the camera for underwater photos on a trip to Mexico.  I just got back and downloaded them to my computer and really liked what I saw.  Very vivid pictures.  The closer you are to the surface, the more vivid the picture.  And the clarity of the water also helps.","Ordered a refurbished unit and it looked fresh and new, except for the budget packaging. Camera tested waterproof in my bathroom sink, hope it does as well on my snorkeling vacation this summer. Camera feels comfortable to hold, but controls not very ergonomic, especially the very tiny video button. Changing photo modes requires you to go through the entire Menu. Picture quality is not too good, especially shadow area details and low-light photos. Enlarged details from high-contrast subjects taken with this 16MP Fuji are not as sharp as those from my seven-year-old Nikon S-610, and that is only a 10MP camera. One reviewer said the images from this camera were not as good as those from a modern smartphone, and he was right. But you can't take your smartphone scuba diving.","Bought this camera for a trip.  I have another camera that I take but it is not waterproof and not designed to be as durable.  This camera worked great.  The video and pictures were clear.  Very rugged.  I worried at first about taking it in the water but no problems.  I took it kayaking, snorkeling and on the boat deep sea fishing.  Got great video of the fish and good pictures from the kayak.  I have a Canon EOS that I love but hesitate to take sometimes whereas I took this one every where.","Love this camera! This is the second one of these that I have had. The first one lasted for several years and had taken a lot of wonderful pictures and video under water and out of water. The only reason I had to buy another one is because during out last adventure the camera got sucked into a motor (long story) and got beat up pretty bad. I love this camera better than any I have had. I highly recommend this camera. It's easy and fun to use and takes a lot of abuse. I don't recommend letting it get sucked into a motor though...","Camera is great and picture quality is good.  The zoom is not very good though.  would recommend it","Great camera with lots of features.  Great buy!","Overall it is a great camera. Durable and waterproof just like it says. I take a lot of underwater videos and it works just like the first day I got it.","Takes great photos and videos underwater and even out of the water! Glad I bought this to try out!","I bought this camera at the last minute to shoot photos on a trip to Costa Rica.  I wanted an affordable waterproof camera I could take waterfall rappelling and rafting.  This camera was perfect.  I was particularly pleased with the warning I received if the waterproof \"door\" was not properly closed.  The camera survived numerous waterfalls, and me being dumped out into the river during rafting.  For the price, I give it five stars.","Ok at taking photos, I have had better cameras.  Since it is rugged and water proof it will probably last forever.  That's too bad because it really takes pretty average photos.  I won't have an excuse to get a better camera for ages.","Wonderful camera. Worked great and takes good pictures and videos","Love it!","I took this snorkeling in Hanauma bay in Hawaii on its first trip and it worked great.<br />Takes great picture in or out of the water. the panorama mode is easy to use as is the video.<br />Make sure to get a Camera Float like Nordic Flash Waterproof Camera Float - Pack of 2 - Green & Orange","Purchased as a gift, has not been used by the recipient yet so jury on the picture quality is still out!","I love it, and can't wait for summer to test how waterproof it really is!  I have taken pictures while snoeshoeing with it and they came out very clear.  It is user friendly.  I also purchased the float strap for it.  I think it will prove to be money well spent.","Took to Florida for swimming with manatees.  Took great underwater photos and even better photos above water.  Was very easy to transfer my photos wirelessly to my smart phone.","Very nice light weight and water proof.","Have been using it for about a month.<br />Not very impressed with the flash ability for indoor picture quality.<br />For the price the camera is a good value.<br />I have not had to use the waterproof features yet, so I will update if that gets to be a problem.","I love this camera - this is my second one, the first met an untimely death when lost to a river. Love the bluetooth feature - makes image sharing so easy. Great for travel - if you have an android you'll only need one charger - no removing the battery and remembering the wall charger any more! The only thing I don't like is the lag in successive picture taking. Just discovered some fun color/effect features the other day-I'll be having fun with those next week when I'm snorkeling. Picture quality is great. I totally reccommend this camera.","Was a gift for my wife but so far this has been an amazing product.  She downloaded the phone app and set her camera up outside on a tripod and can view through her phone and snap photos of the birds while sitting inside.  It does go through the battery charge fairly quickly but I think when she turns off all the remote and geo functions it will last longer.","More than expected! Really great resolution, Wifi, pics passed to my cellphone instantly, making them faster to trasfer to email, great for my kind of job!","I really love this waterproof camera - it is an excellent quality for the price.  We took this camera with us on a cruise and it worked quite well for snorkeling and was great to have on the beach/during rainy downpours.  We've had no issues so far after a week of heavy use and I look forward to using it on future vacations.  As noted in some other reviews, we found we received better quality under water with the video function than the still photography, especially in places where water was less than clear.","Greatest little camera around!  Especially for family vacations, whether at Sea World or skiing in the mountains.  Great water pics and still pics.  My friend had one and we borrowed it all the time for our vacations so I finally broke down and bought our own because it worked great!","The camera quality is mediocre at best, especially if you are an avid photographer and have fancier gadgets than most. I predominantly use my DSLR for photography, and there's really no way to compare the two.<br /><br />Indoor photos are really sub-par, especially if you zoom in for a closer look. I took some pictures recently at some of the Newport Mansions with their Christmas decorations, and the focus and sharpness is pretty poor, especially when I took photos of Christmas trees (could have been the Christmas lights throwing things off). Even outdoors, I took photos by the pool and they were very blue (I edited them later in my computer to adjust the white balance a bit more). I used some of the basic camera settings and didn't go nuts manually tweaking anything myself (and I imagine most people who are in the market for a point and shoot would do the same).<br /><br />I will say the photos and videos underwater are actually pretty good! Video outside of the water is okay. The microphone is facing away from the camera operator so if you are talking while recording video, the sound is a little weird, but it's okay. I can live with it. I purchased this camera with the purpose of using it underwater, and thus far I haven't had any leaks, and I'm generally happy with the underwater results. Using the underwater setting is also probably going to be your best bet, but I still got some decent photos when I left it on the \"smart\" setting where it adjusts automatically.","This is for the XP80.  I plugged it in to charge with the supplied wall adapter and USB cable and it fried/died.  I don't understand it.  I charged it that way when I first got it 10 months ago.  Subsequent charging was done off my computer's USB port.  Getting it ready to take to SeaWorld with the daughter and it up and dies when I plug it in to charge.  Ahh, well, I have a 3 y.o. Lumix I can use instead.  I just have to drop it on the ground to get the CCD to work -seriously.<br /><br />Good camera, good video.  Never tested it in the water tho, just on the boat.<br /><br />I've gone through a good half dozen of 'tough' cameras in nine years.  The only two which have lasted are a 2010 Olympus Stylus Tough 10MP and a 2013 Panasonic Lumix 14 MP -the one I have to drop to get the CCD to turn on.  Gives a new meaning to \"Tough Camera\".<br /><br />The price is pretty good though for what you get.  My recommendation is to charge it only off a computer USB 2.0 port.","I wasn't as happy with this camera as I thought I would be. The pictures are just ok but when underwater they are great.","Nice camera, rugged,takes good picture's  very rugged construction","Camera works very well.  I wish the video worked a little better - color was not as bright as when I use my Samsung S5 phone.","amazing deal works really well underwater","The camera takes pictures, but I bought it so that I could transfer my photos to my cell phone for upload. Fujifilm should hire a high-school student to write a transfer app for the android. Whoever wrote the one on their website is incompetent and you will find hundreds of posters who agree. The app works so bad, it is not worthy of distribution. I should have read the reviews before I ordered the camera.","The four star is only because my fiance went down about 15 feet after using it for two days kayaking around the springs down in Florida and the screen froze up with rainbow colors and all menu options lit.  It wouldn't even turn off with the on/off button.  However, when we stopped and were on dry land again I opened the battery compartment and popped it out and in and it went back to working perfectly.  I thought water got in the screen somehow.  It could have been user because he did keep hitting the video button when he meant to turn it off.  I get they wanted to make the video easy to operate but he has big fingers. :).  So, if something like that happens to you, don't freak out just pop the battery when you are somewhere dry again.  That being said he was carrying it in the open on a wet kayak and snorkeling in the springs for two days straight and not a problem.  It takes awesome pictures.  We haven't played with manual picture settings yet but it looks to have almost as many as my DSLR.  We haven't had it long enough to use it in salt water but I don't think it will be a problem based on its performance in the springs as long as we clean it after using per the included instructions.  The other companies cameras that were similar were twice as much for what looked like the same camera.  Right now I am very happy with it.<br /><br />Update 2/19/17:  He went back with friends to the same place we were when we first used the camera and it did not mess up at all this time.  He even found manatees and got some awesome underwater shots of them.  He did not touch them. :)","The camera took wonderful pictures while snorkelling.","You will love this product. It’s the best. Is this okay Amazon? Am I allowed to say this?","Great little camera.  We have not had a chance to see how it works in the water.","once we figured out how to pass images from camera to computer it was wonderful and did great all day in the water!","This does every thing I want, better pictures than our phones and very rugged. Goes in water and snow. 2nd XP90, the first was run over by a tour bridge","Good solid camera being used outdoors for work.","It was exactly what I expected.  Easy to use and great to have on our cruise excursions.","Went on a trip to the Caribbean that included both dry land and snorkeling excursions.  The camera took great pictures both in and out of the water.  For the money, this camera is a great bargain.","Have not used underwater so can't review that;  but does seem to take nice pictures and seems easy to use.  One negative though is that the battery seems to run down rapidly even with a few photos and short videos.","Loved it. Worked great for the trip I took and still love it.","Great photos. Used underwater with very good results. Still trying to learn how to use all the features.","I had an XP70 but my girlfriend lost it on Grande Anse beach in Grenada. You can drop it in the water or worse SAND without worries.  I highly recommend a floating tether for it because it WILL sink.  The tether I got a TETHYS.  One suggestion is to epoxy the quick release so it doesn't accidently come loose in the water.<br /><br />It is great for what it is. Decent memory photos and with a little luck one you can show of to impress your friends. On the surface it works fine but one problem is built in is the flash.  It faces forward which you would expect.  However for UNDERWATER use the reflection causes backscatter unless the water is gin clear.  I have other UW cameras that use arms to get the flash to shoot from the side to prevent it.  But like I said.  GOOD point and shoot for memory pix.<br /><br />I'm considering a video lighting setup like a Sealife Seadragon on a tray and arm.  Then use it with flash suppressed on the next trip.<br /><br />The enclosed photos were taken at the Vissitudes on Grenada at about 25 ft.  As you can see lighting can be a problem  between being a weak flash and facing forward but can be helped with software.  Here you can see a photo I used vivid-pix for. I highly recommend it for simplicity and capabilities.  Although I know Photoshop can fix nearly anything, I just don't have the time to learn it.","Very nice camera for the price! I have only had it a few days but very impressed. You get many feature and quality thata you would only expect in a much more expensive camera. Thanks Fujifilm!","Great camera worked perfectly in salt water in the Bahamas and perfect in florida.","Love this camera for vacations as I love to snorkle.","I love this camera! And works great underwater!!","I've had this camera for a month, there is still much to learn about it but I like it very much. So much better than using the smartphone. All you have to do is press the on button, and then snap. No need to log on, swip, start the app, then take the picture.  I also think it takes good pictures. However, don't buy it for the wifi. The wifi is mostly useless. I for one cannot figure out how to use it.","I am truly glad I got this camera easy to use, and a camera that you are not so paranoid of dropping it that you don't use it, which is my DSLR camera.","Works great! I took this on my trip to Thailand and the quality is great, both underwater and while out and about. I know it's waterproof but I was a little wary to take it underwater. I soon got over my fear and used it while snorkeling with no problems. Make sure you have it on the correct settings and you're good to go!","no problems","Great camera. I used it on a trip to Jamaica. Good quality pictures in and out of the water. I mainly used it above the water, but I had no issues with the underwater pictures. And the camera is still working fine (no leaks). Great performance for its value.","Easy to use.  Love that it is waterproof!","awesome","I have not taken this camera under water yet but have tested out the picture quality! I am very impressed!","I am so happy with my new camera. Is beutifull. Thsnks","I have used it twice, in my pool and in 8ft of water catching scallops. I can give a better report next year after our trip to the .Bahamas.  Having been doing underwater photography for years understand that in deeper water the camera needs light.","Camera worked perfectly underwater. Battery was not installed all the way making me think that camera had low life -- reinstall to click and problems vanished. Washed camera in freshwater after snorkle -- looking at seal hatch I'd recommend using i tiny amount of plumber's silicon grease on the port every few times camera is opened to keep seal in good shape. Haven't owned long enough to see failure, but took nice pictures from kayak where spray was too much for non waterproof camera -- and had good optical zoom. Only issue is the HDF mode is not usable at all for moving objects - and there is no warning in quick use guide.","Outstanding pictures.  I even take great pictures while driving the motorcycle.  It stops the action dead in its tracks. Very easy to use.  It is very fast from on to the first picture.  About 3 seconds.","It really works underwater. Made beautiful videos underwater.<br />Outside of water just average.","I've had this camera for about a month now and want to give out some information that might be useful.<br /><br />LIKES:<br /><br />Tough: I'll confess, I abuse my stuff. I don't use lens caps and I get scratches on everything. I take stuff to the beach, drag it on the sand, and take stuff into the water and hot/humid climates. I need a camera like this to withstand my abuse. Kudos.<br /><br />Timelapse: Without purchasing an intervalometer and/or a high end camera, most cameras don't have this feature. I like it and I use it.<br /><br />WiFi: So, this is a really great feature especially since the LCD screen doesn't flip open so you can record selfies (I'm 50 and I take selfies - duck lips and all - deal with it). Although a bit tricky to sync, you can use your smart device to be the screen and move the camera away from your face. Nice feature.<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br /><br />The Battery: The NP-45 battery is essentially a rectangular cube (we'll call it rotational symmetry), which means that it's pretty easy to insert it (3 incorrect and 1 correct). Seems like such a simple thing to make a battery fit one way and not another. That's a problem with the battery that the manufacturer choose, not necessarily about the camera itself.<br /><br />The Manual: It's a lot of pages of almost nothingness. Not enough information in the manual to know enough about all the features. I've relied on YouTube videos to get most of my tutoring.<br /><br />Controls: I'm guessing that in order to help with the waterproofing, they've not put on much in the way of physical controls. Cameras I've had in the past have had a knob to choose quickly between shooting formats. This does so with a familiar, but slightly awkward 4 direction thumb navigator thingy. There's a videogame cheat sort of maneuver you need to do in order to get a shot set correctly - right, down, down, down, right, down, enter.  The waterproofing is also probably why the lens is contained behind glass and does not extend past the body of the camera. No problem for me since I don't zoom that much. YMMV.<br /><br />Waterproofing: Now, I'm a certified diver and I've been diving with my share of waterproof cases for cameras and my GoPro. I know that this is not a diving camera - that's not my point though. My opinion is that the rubber seal and locking mechanism are insufficient for underwater (25 ft) use as the product ages. I suspect that the very thin rubber gasket will fail after the first year or so. It's just not even close to the same spec of any of my other housings.","Great product and takes awesome underwater pictures!","HAVE NOT TAKEN A PICTURE WITH IT.","Excellent pictures.","It met my expectations. In fact we left it in the sun in 100 degree weather for 24 hours and it survived!","We just came back from the Cayman Islands and my daughter wanted an underwater camera. We were afraid because there were some pretty compelling negative reviews, so we bought this camera from out cost club store thinking that we could return it if it leaked or had any problems. So, was it? It was AMAZING! There are several shooting options, and if you are going to shoot underwater make sure you use that option because it makes a HUGE difference! I do wish the zoom was bigger, but I understand the limitations, and still, it is not bad. Video quality is very good, and the images are excellent. I took this free diving into about 20 feet of water without any problems. It even warns you to check that it is closed correctly. The strap actually floats the camera....yes, I tried it (the water was very calm so I wasn't afraid of losing it). I have to say that both my daughter and I took some great video and pictures and this camera was SO worth it! I will dig up some videos to add to this, but I can't recommend this camera enough. If you have any questions, let me know and I will do my best to answer them. The only thing you have to be aware of is cleaning the lens when you get out of the water because water droplets might mess up your shot.","I have a few cameras but wanted one to just take quick pictures wherever I go. Also, better pictures than a phone takes no matter what<br />people tell you. That's why they call it a camera and not a phone. Get a memory card and spare battery, that way you won't miss a shot.","Love this camera!!! Takes great pictures both underwater and out. It is sometimes hard to see the display underwater, but the pictures are great. I love how small and lightweight it is.","We've been using this camera now for 2 months. We've used it during trips to the water park, the river and in swimming pools. It's good, pics are decent. No issues with water leakage. Pictures under water are OK, some are dark, a little blurry depending on water and weather conditions. Good for the price.","Great camera, especially since im a native floridian and even better for trips such as cruises and tropical areas.","Work very effective with my work!","Great resolución and vídeo underwater","Went looking for Dory/Nemo without issues.  Getting the flotation device is a must unless you want to risk losing your camera in the sea.  Great clear pictures.  You can even take pictures while recording a video.  Bought a 64gig SD card and that will let you take photos for months probably.  WIFI connection is there.","Returned for the package deal of all the extras for the same price. Love this camera. Bought two","Awesome camera that's easy to use.","Very nice!  Seems to take good photos and controls are  well laid out.","I love this little guy. I bought the hand strap that floats, attach it to my life vest for kayaking or my hiking sticks when hiking. If I want a picture, there it is at my fingertips. The picture quality is great too. I'm not a photographer, but I love to take pictures of my travels be it in water or rain.","At the moment, it's a great option for what I paid. The only thing that is not working properly is the 360º option. I can take panoramic pictures at 120º but not 360º nor 180º. Por some reason it stops before and does not complete the degrees.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Compact, easy to use<br />* Many modes to take pictures<br />* The app/wifi very easy to use<br /><br />Cons:<br />* It doesn't come with an external charger, so you can't use your camera while batteries are getting charged (you can buy a charger separately)<br />* Mode section it's a bit hidden, should be on the main screen without accessing the main menu.<br />* The battery doesn't last long. On a canopy tour I had to use 2 batteries.<br />* Manual configuration is very limited.<br />* The shutter button may be too hard to press sometimes.","The underwater photos were not stellar, a little lackluster as the colors just don't show up as nice as air photos. But it held up to snorkeling and beach play just fine.","Nice underwater shots.. Not too great for everyday standard pictures, but i bought it for only an underwater video camera and am very happy with it so far.","It works really good and the battery last long. I tried it in the sea and the pool. Works good!","Resolution and zoom could be better but otheraise it works fine. Phone seems better choice though.","great camera for kids we recieved it quickly","It doesn't take the greatest pictures in the world, but if you want to keep your DSLR safe, this is your best bet.  Great function for waterproof, decent enough photos. The buttons are a little hard to press, but other than that it works fine.","It's hard to take clear, beautiful photos under the water because water flowing. You'd better not to expect take photos like sample photos.","I OWNED THE SAME MODEL BEFORE.SO WHEN I SAW THE PRICE,,,I ORDERED IT.IT SUITS MY NEEDS JUST FINE.EASY TO CARRY,WRIST STRAP HOLDS IT ON YOUR WRIST.PICTURES COME OUT GREAT..BUT IF YOUR IN THE WATER CLEAR OFF THE LENS BEFORE YOU SHOOT,,YOU'LL GET A WATER BUBBLE IN YOUR PICTURES...","I like the product.  Very handy, solid waterproof... It has snorkeled with us with several underwater pictures taken and unit is great.<br /><br />The reason for giving the 3 start is the picture taken is not very dependable.  I am not a professional photographer and I am not sure if there are adjustments that can change.  In my unit, in open sunlight I am able to take amazing pictures.  However, when I go away from the sun, into a room or in the night, the pictures are not as clear.  It becomes a little grainiy and flash is not giving enough light as well.<br /><br />Recommendation: Great camera for outdoor use","Great camera, light weight, good design, perfect for travel. Easy to follow instructions.","I was skeptical about purchasing a camera online but so far do not regret my decision. Purchased this for a trip to Fiji. It took such great photos my mother decided to get one herself. Says water proof but I didn't want to chance it so besides a drop on wet sand I didn't rest it. I love the idea of durability because I'm great at breaking things and so far this held up.","The menus and camera settings don't give a lot of control over shooting modes outside of presets.  I love the wireless transfer interface, and the battery life is pretty good.<br /><br />This camera loses a star for one reason: the placement of the video record button is right next to the power button.  I have now accidentally recorded videos at least three times while taking going down rapids instead of turning off the camera. Seems like a small issue, but when you're operating while paddling it becomes a problem.","Very pleased with how it works and the pictures it takes!","Very fine picture quality. Two complaints  1) we got a HDMI cable but no USB cable, 2) no neck strap.","Great Product!  Delivered same day through Amazon Prime...Would definitely recommend this product, and would purchase again.","Great camera.  Takes amazing pictures under water.","Good camera for price. It is water proof and accidently left it out all night in the rain but had no issues","It doesn't take great pictures inside, but that's now why you're buying a waterproof camera.  I was very pleased with the underwater pictures of my kids.  Lots of fun to play with.  The video works great too.","Let's start by remembering that we're not talking about a top-of-the-line SLR camera here.  However, for the price, this is a nice camera.  The picture quality is good, and it has lots of settings for taking pictures in different situations.  Best, we had a blast using it in the pool!  We got some great pix of the kids swimming underwater, and they had fun playing with the camera too.<br /><br />I haven't tried using the app or wireless features, so I can't speak to those, but otherwise, it seems quite easy to use right out of the box.<br /><br />If you're looking for a little, less expensive camera, especially one that's waterproof (and shockproof and coldproof), I would recommend this camera.","I purchased this camera to use on our trip to Australia where we would be in the water a lot... it worked great, pics were fantastic, easy to use, takes a standard SD card, I loved it and 100% waterproof","Loving this so far! I have had it depths as far as 15ft and it has functioned very well. Still working with the settings so that I can get better quality under water photos.","I love this camera. It is perfect for what I wanted. I needed something that would take quick photos and link to my phone.","This camera exceeded our expectations for taking pics while snorkeling. The colors in the photos were fairly true to what we were seeing, maybe a bit less vivid. While it is a bit bigger than most slim point and shoots, that was an *advantage* while trying to take photos and find buttons underwater. The camera was easy to rinse and dried quickly for photos out of water (just make sure there are no water spots on the lens!) I recommended it to a family member and they also bought it!<br /><br />Another advantage is the FujiFilm app that will allow you to back up the photos from the camera's wifi to your device (we used an iPad). This was a relief so that if the camera is accidentally lost in the ocean, we still had the photos from the rest of our trip backed up already!","Has gotten a full week of  Caribbean underwater work and has taken close to two hundred nice shots.","SUPER awesome camera! Worked great on our honeymoon!","I'm giving this a 5-star even though the camera was shipped with a charger unit suitable for European users!<br />The XP90 is an excellent choice for a small waterproof point & shoot camera. I tested it during two days at the beach, taking water shots and general scenery shots, including use of the zoom feature. For a small waterproof P&S, the results were better than expected: colors were vibrant, contrast was clear, resolution was sharp, detail was very good, ease of use was great, and handling was secure. I'm a dedicated DSLR user, but I need a camera to use on a sandy beach at the ocean or lake. I really don't want to use my DSLR or bridge camera at these places, so I'm confident that the Fuji XP90 will do a good job with both in-water and general scenic shots at the beach. For the price, this is an excellent choice.","Works as advertised.  Used it for scuba, snorkeling and pool.  No problems.  Good quality.  Good price.","Can't wait to take on cruise & fly fishing trip this summer.  have not had the chance to take underwater pics. It does takes beautiful pictures, easy to use.  Perfect for vacations, small, light weight rechargeable & waterproof.  Here is an example of the many shooting modes: Macro, Flower mode.","I used this camera on our cruise to the Bahamas.  It was easy to learn and took great pictures. I was nervous to use it snorkeling because I never used an underwater camera, but there were no problems.  (I bought the floating strap) All the pictures on board and in the sea were awesome!  I would definitely recommend this camera for the average consumer who wants great fun pics for your vacation.","Perfect for snorkeling and underwater photos. Will use on upcoming trips","The Fujifilm FinePix XP90 is an excellent waterproof camera for its price class.  It takes great shots and is the only camera you'll need on vacation.  It holds its own against standard point-and-shoots  -  and so you don't have to take one for the water and a separate one for \"real pictures.\"<br /><br />I was able to compare the XP90 it to the Nikon Coolpix AW130, which costs twice as much.  Although the AW130 did take SLIGHTLY better pictures - specifically for high-speed/action shots, I think that the XP90, at half the price, is the better deal.  See my photos pics taken with the XP90, as well as some side-by-sides compared with the AW130.<br /><br />The XP90 camera is truly waterproof (see my pictures - I put the camera completely in a plastic bag filled with water, and all the electronics held up beautifully.  I was able to zoom and use all the controls with no issues.<br /><br />I had zero issues with this camera's performance, and was impressed with all the features and ease of use.  It packs a ton of punch into a well-priced point.  The pictures I've shared are just from my clicking away amateurishly in my garden.","I really appreciated the quick receipt of the batteries.  They have worked wonderful in my new Fuji camera. I am ready for my trip to Yellowstone.  Thank you for your quality product.","I was interested in getting a dedicated camera for some projects I am working on, so when this came into the queue I was happy. However, this thing is cumbersome to get set up and use. Once you get it set up, it takes high-quality images. But the actual set-up is excessively convoluted. It didn't help matters that my camera didn't come with any actual instructions, so you are left to your own devices figuring it out.<br /><br />Dear Corporate America: Seriously, I don't understand this movement toward not including instructions with products. I see this more and more. Not everyone wants to hunt on Youtube for an instructional video that spends 20 minutes explaining something I COULD have figured out in five minutes if I had written instructions!<br /><br />Once you figure out the set-up, the camera takes very nice pictures. There is a Wi-Fi function built into the camera but I haven't been able to get it to work properly. I am fully willing to admit that is probably a user issue and not a camera issue, as the wi-fi in the house sometimes gets spotty.<br /><br />The micro USB cable for recharging is VERY micro. My CPU sits on the floor in my office, and the USB ports are sort of two-thirds of the way up on the tower. If I wanted to charge the camera from the CPU tower, I would have to actually let the cable hang because it isn't long enough to sit the camera on top of the CPU. Fortunately, my keyboard has ports so I was able to work around it.<br /><br />The camera appears durable. I didn't exactly throw it against a concrete wall or submerge it in a pool to test it, but seems to stand up to mundane wear.<br /><br />I guess my rating is only three stars because, despite taking nice pictures, the pictures aren't THAT much better than what I can get with my phone. No, I can't go swimming with my phone and take photos, but I really don't \"need\" a waterproof camera. I just wanted an easy-to-use camera that takes nice pictures. This takes nice pictures, but it isn't easy to use.","I absolutely love this camera, However I am leaving it 4 stars due to the fact is only semi-works now. We purchased this camera to take on vacation with us to some water parks and to the beach. the camera worked great at the water parks, we took it on rides, did videos in the water ect... Once we got to the beach, I was still iffy about getting sand on it and putting in the salt water. So I would hold it up out of the water, and set it in our bag when not in use. After two days at the beach, it will still turn on , but it will only let me take one picture at a time and I have to turn it off and turn it back on again to take another picture. I am still giving it four stars, because 1. it still works, and 2. I feel I got enough use out of it while it did work and got tons of great pictures of my kdis with it. I would absolutely buy again if needed.","I am a camera nut, and I have several that have cost me $2,000.00 or more, but this camera was able to let me use settings I needed to make a tough shot.  The Fujifilm FinePix XP90, also, was able to duplicate those tough shots when set in an automatic mode.  Overall, it is an outstanding camera, it's not perfect, but as a camera that takes pictures underwater, can be used with your phone via WiFi to take remote shots, and it will take movies, too, it gets pretty close.<br /><br />This is not a camera that is intuitive, and that is not meant to scare off anyone.  You can take pictures and movies easy enough, but this camera allows you to do as much with the pictures as an advance DSLR camera.  Several buttons, like the WiFi/Burst button, have two functions.  Some functions, such as setting-up your WiFi, require the camera to be in \"playback\" mode before you begin setting-up the Wifi (I will be uploading a photo that gives you those instructions).<br /><br />Speaking of instructions, if you purchase this camera, do not expect to receive any instructions in the box.  There are a couple of product sheets, along with a charger, the battery, a USB cord for charging.  It would have been nice if they had told you where to go online for a manual, or even given you a \"Quick Start\" sheet, but they don't.  The manual isn't difficult to find, just google it, and download it.  The manual is 138 pages (18 for the Preface, 116 for the manual, and a two-page synopsis sheet of the Restrictions on Camera Settings.  Download the manual keep it handy.<br /><br />This camera can be a \"point and shoot\" one, but if you used it only that way, you would just see the tip of the iceberg in the pictures you took.  Its capabilities are endless.  To give you an idea of them, I am uploading two pages that show the \"Parts of the Camera,\" two pages that show the displays for \"Shooting\" and \"Playback.\"  I will upload a couple of screenshots that show how connecting the camera to your phone via the WiFi will look.<br /><br />After spending over an hour looking at other digital cameras to see if any other had the capabilities of the FujiFilm Fine Pix XP90 in a similarly-size camera, I didn't find one, even at twice the cost of this one.  In some ways, just being able to take a \"burst\" of 5 frames per second, or in continuous mode 10 frames per second, is enough to get most photographers excited.<br /><br />The only issue I had in my testing of the camera involved taking movies.  If the sound was rather low, there seemed to be some \"fuzziness\" to the sound at its lowest when you played the movie back using the camera's speaker.  In talking with Fiji support, this seemed to be a result of the speaker being water proof.  Playing the movie on a computer or TV resulted in no fuzziness.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good camera that will allow you to take outstanding pictures.  I wish one didn't have to search to find a manual, or I'd have given it five stars (if the sound issue turns out to not be a problem).  If you purchase this camera, you will need to get an SDHC or SDXC memory card (it takes the full size, not the mini sized one).  The transfer rate of when you take a burst or large picture was very fast, so either will be fast enough for most.  BTW, if you card ever fills-up, the camera does come with 96 MB of internal memory.<br /><br />With the new format for reviews, I've had so-so luck adding comments to the pictures.  Of the pictures I've posted, 1st and 2nd are the parts of the camera listed (note that several buttons have two purposes), 3rd shows what can be shown in the display, 4th shows what is shown during playback, 5th is a sheet in which I give the steps to take to connect your camera to your phone through WiFi (I used an iPhone), 6th shows what choices you have when your phone is connected to your camera, 7th is what one sees when your phone is connected to your camera (you can take a picture or a movie from this screen), 8th shows you what is on your camera (you can check off what you'd like to download or delete, etc., 9th is a picture I took of a McDonald's sign on the night of the \"Strawberry Full Moon.\"  There is actually a flood light in front of the sign and a bright moon behind the sign.  The camera allowed me to vary my focus on the moon, the light in front of the sign or the sign.  I chose the sign.  I was hand-holding this under very low light conditions and I was able to take the shot in between heart beats.  There was a little haze in the air from the river that was a block away, but I thought this picture will give you an idea of what this camera can do, and the choices it gives you.","Agree with previous reviews. Does not take sharp photo's like a dsl, but is easy to carry and I love that I don't have to worry about dropping it or getting it wet on hikes. I think it is a good value.","We all really love this camera.  It fit our exact needs, as we own a middle range Canon SLR, but wanted something small, powerful, and rugged to take to the beach and snow, and to give to kids for their exploration without worry of it being broken.<br /><br />This camera's first use was on my 9-year old daughter's school field trip.  She learned how to use it in about 5 minutes, and came home with loads of great pictures and videos.  She was able to scroll through them, and operate the videos using the camera's buttons very easily and intuitively.<br /><br />I find the picture and video quality outstanding, and the camera extremely easy to use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!","So I’ve only used this for a little while, so I’m only going to cover basics now and I’ll update as I use more features.<br /><br />In the box:  The camera itself, a tether/lanyard, a micro-USB cable + plug to charge and connect to a computer/USB, a bare-bones “quick-start” sort of set-up guide (no true owner’s manual)<br /><br />The camera<br />You can see from the description that this is meant to be a rugged-use camera and it certainly feels that way. It’s a small point-and-shoot but thicker than most (almost twice the thickness of our Elph point-and-shoot) and heavier than most as well. It feels well built and while I haven’t shot underwater I did use it in light rain with no impact.  Otherwise it has the basic seen-it-all-before controls of a P&S—flash/no flash, macro, trash, zoom in and out via two buttons on the back.  And it has the usual shooting modes—snow, night, portrait, panoramic, burst, and the like, as well as some filters.  It also has remote control via phone and wi-fi, and a few other nice touches. You can read the description and specs above.<br /><br />There’s not a lot to say about ease of use save to say that there’s nothing to say about it. In other words, it works exactly as one would expect and hope with no issues at all so far. No problem with fit in the hand, no problems with buttons being too close to each other, etc.  The pictures and videos are sharp and vivid.It’s point-and-shoot as it should be.<br /><br />The wi-fi involves a Fuji app you have to download. I have a Mac and I downloaded the app and was downloading photos immediately—no problems connecting to my computer and the photos download surprisingly fast (no videos though).  It was all quite simple and I’ll certainly not bother with cables anymore if it stays this way.<br /><br />As mentioned, as I use more of the special features, I’ll update with how pics/videos come out in low light and in burst. But so far it does what it should easily and conveniently, and I like not having to worry about using it outdoors in inclement weather.","As a budget entry, the Fujifilm FinePix XP90 digital camera is just okay. While there are lots of cool features that are pretty fun - remote shooting via the downloadable app opens a lot of creative possibilities - the \"main thing\" is missing in quick shutter time and lens. F3.5 is okay in very evenly lit circumstances, but underwater? Don't expect too much from it. Lots of motion blur and fuzzy focus.<br /><br />The onboard software has a number of editing features and filters for your saved photos. But this reviewer would have liked to have seen a little more invested on the hardware to take better photos and videos. There is only so much that editing can do to improve an average photo.<br /><br />For shooting other circumstances, the XP90 does just fine. Day out with the kids? No problem. Soccer game? Done. Family party? You're golden. I'm not certain that this is much better than what one finds on any current camera on a smart phone. For that reason, it's hard to rate it an higher than three of five stars.","This is a sturdy camera that is very easy to use. So far I've just used it on automatic, but it has lots a different settings. I don't have a smart phone, but don't really need it. I just put the card into my laptop to transfer my pics. I just can't use the remote.The pictures have all come out very sharp, but I notice a very slight blueish cast in them. (I've mostly photographed my flowers.) I hope I get a chance to use it underwater. I don't know why it says for use in the USA only. With a power converter and adapter, I don't see why it can't be used anywhere. (I have taken some wonderful photos while diving and snorkeling in Balinese coral reefs with my old Canon Powershot in a waterproof case.) I wish it had a lens cover, and the manual is pretty bad. But I'm satisfied with it, and will play around with the different settings. I love taking pictures!","Has all the features you'd want in a camera.  This is my first that connects wirelessly, which Is so convenient!!  We've used the waterproof camera in a pool so far with no problems and some fun pictures.  The battery doesn't last super long, especially if you shoot any video.  Picture quality comparable to other cameras I've owned.  I don't blow them up, but 4x6 prints look good.","Perfect and easy! Bought this for summer trips and I couldn't be happier!","Fun little camera for vacation.  The kids had a blast being able to take pictures in the pool.  I liked the ability to just throw it in my bag and not worry about it being too fragile.  Down fall is the zoom.  There is no zoom feature if you are using certain settings such as \"action\".  This made it difficulty to take pictures at an amusement park.  The zoom is minimal to begin with.  I also had a difficulty time finding the right setting for lighting outside on a covered patio.  Despite various attempts, the pictures came out dark.  Worth the price, but don't let go of your higher end point and shoot!","I've had a number of point and click cameras in my life, mostly Canons. This one has similar functionality, with very intuitive buttons, and while I haven't tested it to its full extent, it seems quite durable. It feels nice in the hand, and the blue version is very attractive.<br /><br />I haven't played around much with the modes yet, but the burst mode is a very cool feature. There's a dedicated, physical burst mode button on the back of the camera that makes it easy to capture fast moving targets.<br /><br />The 1080p video is nice as well, with a solid slo-mo option.<br /><br />Many other reviewers mention that the WiFi isn't intuitive, but I haven't really messed with it since my laptop has an SD card reader, so I can't speak to that. I just pop out the card, and it works like a charm.<br /><br />Though I got this camera as part of the vine program, I've been happy to use it because I am a huge beach bum, and while I haven't gone snorkeling with it yet, it's been fun to play with in the waves. I can't think of any real cons, but then again, I'm not a huge photography person. I'm just a bodysurfer who's stoked on a legit underwater point and click!","Great camera for the price, takes great pictures and is durable.","So, so, so pleased with this purchase. I bought this camera to replace my previous Fujifilm FinePix camera, which I bought about 5 years ago. The old camera held up very well, and I used in underwater, in the desert, on a glacier, and in all types of circumstances. But I don't have to explain that 5 years is a long time to keep a camera, given the speed technology develops. I think this one has fully twice the MPs! My main complaint with the old camera was the battery life. I just drained the battery on this camera on purpose, and I had to leave it with the screen on bright for 3 hours or so. The button and screen on this version are an improvement as well. I was a little disappointed that it did not come with a float strap, as some prior models did, but I will purchase one separately. Great quality photos, and a really durable little camera. I'd highly recommend if you are a frequent traveler and don't wish to fret over keeping a more delicate camera safe.","This camera takes beautiful photos. The zoom is excellent and doesn't make pictures blurry or fuzzy like some other cameras  I have used in the past. The waterproof photos come out beautiful as well. They are very crisp and clear and I had no problem with water messing up the camera. The video mode is great as well. The video and audio comes out clear and crisp and I love that it is HD. It's wifi enabled so it's super easy to upload photos and videos just with the touch of a button. It is perfect size to fit into your pocket so you don't necessarily need a separate camera bag unless you want to. It didn't take long for setup as directions were simple to follow. Charging is easy as well and doesn't take long to do. You can either charge it by a USB cord or by a wall outlet. The initial charge took about 2 hours which is good in my opinion. The only downfall is it does NOT come with a memory card so make sure you purchase it separately.","I do a lot of hiking, walking and rambling about the woods.  One of my favorite hobbies is “creek wading,” a hobby fraught with the possibilities of taking a dunking at any given time...particularly at my extreme advanced age.<br /><br />This is the ideal camera for my particular interests.  It is rugged, easy to use, water proof and most importantly, takes better than average pictures for a camera in this price range.  It most certainly does a better job than any of our three smart phones and the water proof aspect, in my case, makes it a no brainer as to what to haul along with me on my jaunts. With this and my old faithful and almost indestructible ancient flip phone I am pretty well covered.<br /><br />Once you figure out how the camera works, it is quite easy to use.  The only complaint I have is that the directions that came with the camera are absolutely wretched a pretty well useless.  I was forced, being a non-techy type of person, to go to their web sight and do some digging.  All in all though, now that I found out how to use the basics on this I must admit that it takes very nice pictures and it is a wonderful addition to my arsenal of toys that make my life more enjoyable.<br /><br />The one missing star is due to the lousy directions that came with the camera.","My only real complaint is the two attempts I made at taking a picture at night on the beach didn't come out very well, which may have been operator error. All the pictures taken during daylight (some even from a dolphin watching boat by my 7yr old) came out very good. I'm pleased with this unit. I didn't test the waterproof capabilities of the camera, but based on the gasket seal, I am certain that it would live up to the maker's claims.","Great cam<br />Just started to use it and am very happy with operation","This is the future. A year ago we went to Puerto Rico and bought a waterproof disposable camera. Now here we are with an option to take more than 24 pictures. We took this hiking today and it's perfect size to slip into the pocket. I tested the waterproof feature in a stream and got some sweet pictures of some baby fish. It's really easy to setup too. I had it put together within seconds and it was fully charged in just a couple hours. Amazing! I'm really excited to take this on my next beach trip.","The camera has a rugged look and feel. It is by no means a compact camera, and is a bit on the heavy side compared to most modern digital cameras. The LCD screen is large and well lit. The buttons are placed fairly logically.<br /><br />One of the best things about the camera is the quality of the zoom. I'm attaching two pictures of my cat to compare; one without and one with zoom.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had to take the pictures off of the LCD screen using my iPhone because the WiFi on this camera is very confusing and difficult to set up. That is the worst part of this camera. I'm too lazy to connect it to my PC by a USB cable. Why can't the WiFi just work? The instructions were pretty much no help. When I tried to do the 'PC Auto Save Setting, Simple Setup', the camera actually locked up and the only way I could unlock it was by removing the battery.<br /><br />So the shockproof, waterproof, dustproof, and freezeproof features are all nice. The picture quality is great, especially the zoom. Just don't expect the instruction manual to be very helpful, and don't expect the WiFi to be easy to set up. Maybe I will eventually get it working, but it has already been more trouble than it should be.<br /><br />Also note that there is no alkaline battery option; just the rechargeable battery that comes with the battery and the only way to charge it is to open the side door (but I'm sure that this is required for the waterproof feature).","This is a VERY cool camera. I just got it and have been having fun playing with all the settings!<br /><br />Fujifilm packaged this with a memory card so I could use this as soon as the battery charged, which didn't take very long. The regular packaging does not come with a card, so you will either have to buy one separately or order the accessory package, which seems like a good deal. (For about $25, you get a case, the card, an EXTRA battery, an external charger, and a few other items that may come in handy. )<br /><br />Anyway, this camera is solid and easy to use. There is no trick to the auto setting, but if you want to get a little more involved, you can choose settings that best suit your needs. I used a close-up flower setting in my backyard and was pleased with the stunning detail. (I hope this practice shot shows up--I did not edit this.)<br /><br />Any lighting situation you can think of is addressed. Scenery? Action shots? Night shooting? Taking action pictures with scenery at night? You got it.<br /><br />The movie function is also easy to use and the resulting video is pretty high quality. No, I did not use this at a ski jump where Olympic hopefuls were trying out. (I used it on the cat.) But again, happy with the results.<br /><br />I have not used this underwater, and I doubt I will, but it's good to know that if this gets wet while I'm outdoors, I don't have to worry.<br /><br />There are some fun novelty settings you can also try, which may be useful if you're working on a project that depends on interesting visuals.<br /><br />One setting that I really like is the side-by-side flash/no flash. You press the shutter once, and you get two exposures that show the subject with both lighting settings. Very cool! Sometimes a flash ruins the effect you're going for, but sometimes you don't get the chance to re-take and you wish you would have used the flash.<br /><br />I take a LOT of pictures, and I am by no means a photographer. I wouldn't even call myself an amateur photographer, as that implies someone who is at least working on getting better with this medium.<br /><br />However, I am systematically photographing as many old, historically significant churches (mainly Catholic parishes) as possible before they are shuttered or torn down. In Chicago, that has already happened to a lot of beautiful buildings, and much of the artwork is now gone (such as the stained glass). I am in my second year of visiting churches, archiving whatever is inside and outside, and documenting the history of these places.<br /><br />So: I take lots of pictures in dim lighting, and sometimes a flash is necessary but sometimes it ruins the shot. Case in point: St. Philip Neri parish has mosaic Stations of the Cross that are highly detailed (and often studied by Art Institute students). My flash totally washed out the gold-tinted mosaics for some stations, other stations needed the flash because the detail was lost without it. With this camera, I can pick the better of two otherwise identical photos. I plan to go back to SPN and retake the stations. This is the camera I will be using.<br /><br />The other tricky part of my project is highlighting stained glass windows that look best when backlit. The XP90 has settings that can enhance that, too. I have a stained glass panel in our bedroom, a gift from my husband. I took this with the Auto setting, and then with the Text setting, which may be good because a lot of stained glass detail is painted or etched onto the larger picture. This photo is on the Text setting. The window faces north, so it doesn't have sunlight directly behind it. (Haha, sorry, my printer is in front of this window, and this was just a practice shot.)<br /><br />My go-to digital camera is larger (it looks like a regular 35 mm SLR) and there are features I have come to rely on, so I will still be using that. But this makes a great back-up. For most other occasions, this will probably be my primary camera, because it's easy to toss into my purse and I know I'll get good results.<br /><br />Now, a couple of concerns:<br /><br />1. This would not recognize my phone. Everything on the phone AND on the camera SAID it recognized the phone, the proper app was downloaded, and WiFi was enabled. I tried several times and have not had the chance to really investigate why this is not working, but it isn't. Which, for me, is not really a big deal. I don't need to send pictures to my phone. But it would be nice to know I can use that function. What would be really great is if I could use the WiFi to send pictures to my computer. This does not appear possible.<br /><br />2. Like most physical manuals included with techy products, this one is really minimal. I downloaded the full manual onto my computer, so I will try to resolve my first concern, but I wish the manual that is included had more concrete information about using the camera. It is a cool camera. It would be great to be able to get a lot of use out if it, not just rely on the most basic settings and functions.<br /><br />3. This isn't the company's fault, but I am not a fan of the internal battery charger. I like an external charger with an extra pack. That's why, if you buy this camera, you should get the accessory kit as well. Even if you don't use some of the accessories, like the included tripod (pretty lame), it's a lot cheaper to buy the package than these necessities separately. The problem with the one battery/internal charger is that you have to make sure the battery is always charged up, so you will have to be very consistent with hooking this up to the charger when not in use, but not leaving it on the charger (fire hazard). My other camera has rechargeable AA's. I have an external charger and an extra set, but one time both sets were depleted because I forgot to juice them up before going out. No big deal: I bought some alkaline AA's from Walgreen's and that was fine. No options like that with this lithium battery, though. So spring for the charger/extra battery.<br /><br />4. The lens is always unprotected. Some cameras of similar design (Canon) have a little cover that recedes once you turn the camera on. This doesn't, so if you scratch the lens, oh well. I think this is the biggest design flaw.<br /><br />I think Fujifilm is excited to roll out this item and they anticipate that it will meet a lot of needs, whether you are active (a photographer for the alpine ski jump at the cat Olympics, for example) or if you just want to get good results when you take that annual Christmas picture. Which is sometimes as challenging as photographing the cat olympics, believe me.<br /><br />I am over all very happy with this camera and would not hesitate to recommend it. Thanks for asking my opinion, Vine and Fujifilm!","[[VIDEOID:1028020c9d038236fa78db738d929841]]This is a strange product - point and shoot cameras are disappearing, cell phones are so much easier to use and take reasonably good pictures. Cell phone cameras get better and better. Why would somebody want to carry around a point and shoot camera? This is a pretty good answer, it does seem to fill a niche.<br /><br />The camera uses SD memory cards. The box is super bare bones: the camera, a lanyard wrist strap, three paper packages (one basic manual), a battery, a microUSB cable, and an ultra miniature AC adapter. Here's something I really hate about this camera - no owner's manual. They include a really bad \"basic\" paper manual. That manual is written in tiny type and covers just about what a single fold up sheet of paper with pictures usually covers - and the stupid thing is thick. In order to really use this camera, you have to go on line and read the manual there. Fujifilm doesn't even include a clear web address for the manual. I hate this part of the camera. The only way to charge the battery out of the box is with a microUSB cable - either with the included adapter, a USB port on a computer, any other USB AC adapter, or a powerbank battery. There is no external charger included.<br /><br />The XP90 produces good pictures, it is easy to operate, very compact, and almost impossible to destroy. It is a lot less expensive than a cell phone - so if you really want to take pictures under water, at the beach, or out in the cold - this is a good choice. Adding a bulky water proof case to your phone, yeah you can do that, but it isn't really ideal.<br /><br />The camera is about the width and length of a iPhone 4 - yes it is fairly short and narrow. It is chunky though - over an inch thick. It also has a good heft to it, meaning you know you have it in your hand and can hold it reasonably well. After carrying around an iPhone 6 Plus in my pocket, this camera slips in my pocket easily. Because it is so rugged, I have no fear of breaking it in my pocket.<br /><br />The camera starts instantly. I've never seen a digital camera start up this fast, by the time I release the On/Off button, the camera is ready to shoot. Autofocus is OK, pretty fast, but not super fast. Honestly, it is about as fast as an iPhone. There is a very slight shutter delay, after achieving focus with a half press, it still takes a beat to fire the shutter. If you select a fancy filter (like star effect or sketch - stuff you wouldn't normally choose), there is a very long delay after taking the picture to process that filter. Burst mode at 10 frames per second takes a pretty long time to finish writing all the images to the memory card. This is not a sports / action camera for still photographers. It will do high speed bursts in a pinch, but not something you would use regularaly.<br /><br />The controls are super easy to reach and work really well. The shutter release is exactly where I expect it. The zoom buttons are just above the nice raised spots for my thumb. The zoom control works really smooth - medium speed to start with and then very fast. When holding the camera to view the screen, not taking a picture, the menu and selection buttons are very easy to use, and fairly intuitive. The only control I hate is the record button for movies. It is very hard to find, and I can't really press it by feel alone. It is hard to stop video (you'll need to clip off the very last few seconds of every video because you will wiggle the camera and make noise while pressing that button).<br /><br />The camera has fantastic low light capability. This is something most cell phones do really well. The Fujifilm camera does even better. There is very little noise and the blacks show up black and clean. I think the camera must be doing some kind of automatic processing for night time pictures. After taking a picture it takes a long time to write the image to the card, and there is virtually no blur from camera shake even at 1/4 second exposure. The camera does a lot of things automatically, so it is hard to tell what is going on in the background.<br /><br />Daylight pictures are very sharp and can support a lot of enlargement. Where this camera really wins versus cell phones is the lens. The optical zoom range is excellent - 28mm to 140mm 35mm equivalent is far better than any cell phone. 28 is just the right wide angle for group pictures, and is really well controlled with barrel distortion. The telephoto end is just good enough for people, kids, and portraits. It doesn't really work for sports photography, the lens just isn't long enough.<br /><br />Where a cell phone wins is with close ups. This camera is horrible with close focusing. With a cell phone I can grab a quick picture of a label on a device, something 1 inch by 2 inches. This camera just can't focus that close or do that much magnification. I use a camera to do product pictures - and a cell phone is the best choice for that job. I just couldn't use this camera for that.<br /><br />The screen is pretty easy to see. There is no viewfinder. That screen is about 3/4 of an iPhone 4 - not small, but not big either. It is fairly easy to see in bright sunlight. Composing a picture with this screen is not easy.<br /><br />Focus is another strange thing. The camera doesn't always do exactly what I expect. The focus sensor is in the center of the frame. A half press of the shutter release achieves and locks focus and exposure (yellow and green cross in the center, no focus the center cross is red and a A! shows up). I tried a lot of close up pictures and even pictures of people - the camera achieved focus and the screen looked like what I wanted was in focus, the resulting pictures were bad news. The camera actually grabbed focus way behind the subject. If the camera had a peeking function (quick button press to zoom in on the focus area), that would totally solve the problem.<br /><br />The advantage with a cell phone with focus, I've gotten so used to touching the screen to point where I want focus and exposure. The camera does not do that, you're stuck with center focus only.<br /><br />Movies are good, better than cell phone video. There are a lot of choices for frame rate, and resolution. It does have a high speed mode for short clips. The camera chases focus and exposure a lot. And the small screen doesn't really allow me to preview what the thing is doing. The image stabilizer is not great - you really have to hold the camera still to get good steady video. With all the image stabilization built into the camera I expected almost steady cam smoothness. That didn't happen.<br /><br />This is a rugged camera - it can be dropped, thrown in the water (down to 50 feet), frozen, and sand blown all over it - and it will continue to take pictures. Of course dropping it will chip the paint and dent the thing up, but it won't break. The battery, memory, and charge port cover is really well made. It requires a button press and twist to open. A really great design.<br /><br />Viewing pictures is an mixed bag outing. You can easily view pictures on the LCD screen even if it is super small. There is an HDMI port inside the battery compartment. It uses that super tiny micro HDMI connection (no cable is included in the box). You can remove the SD card and transfer pictures directly to your computer with a card reader. You can connect the camera to your cell phone with an app. Or you can go through one of the most painful set up processes I have ever seen, and transfer pictures wirelessly to your computer.<br /><br />The camera comes with no software. Fujifim expects you to go to their website or the app store and get their software. There is no bundled picture or video editing program. Frankly, finding their software on the website was a major pain in the neck. There was nothing intuitive about finding what I needed.<br /><br />It comes down to two programs needed for the camera - remote control, and computer download.<br /><br />Remote control is with a cell phone connected to the camera. You'll need the Fujiflim Cam Remote app from the Apple App store or the Android store. This app is heinous to work with. Nothing it does is intuitive, and it tends to quit after I try to do something. Don't ask all the steps involved to get the camera to work with a cell phone - I tried so many things and finally just backed into the solution. Basically, the camera and cell phone are connected via WiFi, and you'll have no internet access while connected to the phone. Yes you can \"live\" view from the camera, take pictures, and in theory download pictures from the camera to your cell phone (why you want to do that is beyond me, but OK). I was never able to get a picture to transfer. The \"live\" view lags so far behind real time, it is ridiculous. Phone to camera is a cute trick, but not exactly super useful.<br /><br />Connecting the camera to a computer is impossible to set up, but then once it is set up seems to work pretty well. Instead of removing the SD card or connecting the camera to a computer, you can use your WiFi network to transfer photos. You need a strange program from Fujifilm on your computer - find that and install it first. It is called PC Auto Save and there is a version for Windows and Mac (even though the stupid program is called PC, it is for both operating systems). Make sure your computer is connected to a 2.4 GHz wireless network, or plugged into your router (that's critical for the connection). Start up the PC Auto Save program, and run what looks like the help program for connecting a camera (NOT the settings option - go figure on that one), and get to step 2 for manual set up. Now connect the camera to the wireless network (you can use the WPS button - that worked really great for my application; or you can try selecting the network and entering the password - except there are no lower case letters in the password letters). The camera takes an eternity to connect to the wireless network. The whole time a green wireless logo flashes, and then magically the camera says it found a computer program, or (and I was this screen about a hundred times) it can't find a running program. Magically at some point the camera and the computer program will talk - you need to then activate the camera and authorize the software. Read the computer and camera screen carefully. Pressing OK at the wrong time starts the whole process over again.<br /><br />After spending an incredibly frustrating time getting the camera and computer to talk, I actually got the thing to do what I wanted, transfer photos and movies. I still don't know which of the six different places the camera has something about wireless I use to start the transfer, I seem to stumble on it every time after the fourth try. However, when my MacBook Pro is on, the PC Auto Save program is running (they tucked the program in the upper bar beside Time Machine), and I am connected to my 2.4 GHz wireless network, pictures transfer very nicely and seamlessly to my computer. I did customize the directory. And in a great way, new pictures are placed in folders with a date name. The camera does a great job of only transferring new pictures and video. If you are tech savvy and have patience, the camera can wirelessly transfer pictures and video.<br /><br />Overall, I'm super impressed by this camera. It does things in a nice way. It takes good pictures. It is rugged. The price point is really good, inexpensive enough that I wouldn't cry if it were lost or broken. And yet not so cheap that it sacrifices quality sensor and optics.","This little camera has an armful of features packaged into one small rectangle. There are different ways to charge it, lots of standard and advanced features. Armstrap, charging cord for USB or wall outlet. Easy to use. Small & Cute. Waterproof!!  There is a little more effort in opening the door with micro USB and memory card. AT first that seems like an annoying features, but it's really easy once you do it a couple of times, and you have to have your USB and card protected if you're going under water! So that's my one criticism. It's not as easy to change out cards, or plug into USB as other cards, but the protective & waterproofing feature more than compensate for that. I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews, but this one is really terrific.","For people on the go, whether your going to snorkel, swim, hike or go to an event, having a waterproof camera is not a bad idea.  This camera is also shockproof against drops.  For those features, this makes a solid companion for any occasion.<br /><br />Because of the protective case, it is thicker and wider than a conventional point and shoot camera.  That is a small trade off.<br /><br />The camera is supplied with a camera strap, rechargeable battery, but not a memory card.  It accepts micro SD card.<br /><br />The camera has movie, continuous shooting, single shot, and time lapse capabilities.  The sounds can be toggled on or off and the volumes can be adjusted.  A macro function is useful for closeup photographs.  There are numerous modes depending upon the subject for photography:<br />Sport<br />Night (with or without tripod)<br />360 degree panoramic<br />Landscape<br />Portrait<br />Natural (with and without flash)<br />HDR<br />Pro low light<br />Action<br />Program<br />Auto<br />SR Auto<br />Advanced filter (toy camera, high key, pop color and miniature mode)<br /><br />Color can be imaged in black and white, sepia, chrome and standard<br /><br />You can go full automatic or select different parameters in the programmable mode to set ISO settings, aspect ratios, etc.  You can select fine versus normal depending upon how much storage you want to take up and how much data you want to capture on the photo.  Built in features that can be toggled include image stabilization, digital image stabilizer, red eye removal, wind filter, autorotate, and the autorotate function.<br /><br />Movie mode can record in full HD all the way down to VGA.<br /><br />The nice and unique feature is that you can activate the photo mode by lightly depressing the shutter button, whether you're in the photo viewing mode, a menu tree or video mode.  So, you don't have to switch the camera from one feature to another by a separate switch. The same applies for the video mode.  The shutter button is easy to feel for without looking but the power and movie buttons are harder to go by feel alone.<br /><br />In the camera, videos can be joined and spliced. Photos can be cropped.  In the photo viewing mode, you can see the parameters for photos (however, there is no histogram), you can show no information or rate a photo from 1-5 stars.<br /><br />Video has excellent quality but the audio quality is quite lacking.  It is too sensitive for he wrong things and there is a lot of high background noise. The microphone is the weakest component of this camera.<br /><br />The menu system is user friendly and intuitive.  This does not operate by touch screen.<br /><br />The wide angle and telephoto functions by separate function in the back upper right corner, controlled by the thumb. You can opt for optical or digital zoom, but I prefer optical zoom for thes hardest picture possible.<br /><br />Power saving functions are built in to maximum usable battery life.<br /><br />I never tried a camera which had WIFI photographic transfer capabilities.  The video cannot be transferred by WIFI.  It is a bit cumbersome to transfer photos but still more convenient than taking out a memory card, using an adapter and putting it into a home computer.  You need to download an App from the App Store, select the WIFI function in the camera, go to the System menu of your phone or tablet, select and the FUJI WIFI signal, launch the App, click accept and then transfer.  It doesn't work 100% of the time and only one photo can be transferred, as opposed to batch transfers.<br /><br />What affords the waterproof capability is a lock that keeps the inner housing protected, and the rubber or silicone liner/seal which prevents water.  This can be used in the ocean or a saltwater pool but the camera must be rinsed off.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great companion to travel and/or fun.","A remarkable little shooter that may be better suited for some than traditional action cams<br /><br /> Fujifilm bills this as a sports camera with claims that it is waterproof to 50 feet and, more importantly from my perspective shock proof to 5.8 feet.<br /><br />  But what really strikes me is the convenience of this camera to people with certain disabilities such as arthritis. It has a very convenient form factor with easy-to-access and use controls. There’s a very nice grip that facilitates one-handed shooting. It has a 5X zoom lens and a flash. In this sense, the XP90 is an alternative to action cams which tend to be smaller and more difficult for a person with disabilities to handle.<br /><br /> Imaged quality in both stills and video is excellent, though the max aperture of F3.9 – 4.6 is somewhat limiting, but this is essentially a point ‘n shoot. Maximum ISO is 6400. As it happens, I shot a panorama at 6400 and while noisy, it was not unusable. Down at ISO 100 I did some selfies and noticed a facial mole in such glorious detail that I decided to have schedule an appointment with the dermatologist. The 28mm field of view is also somewhat limiting: I would have been happier with 24mm.I read one pre-release blog post that said Fuji woould be offering a wide-angle converter. I hope they or a third party do.<br /><br /> The 3 inch display has 920K resolution and is bright and sharp.<br /><br /> Controls are sparse. Across the top, there is a power button, a shutter release and the movie button. For people like myself whose fingers aren’t as dexterous as they once were, the movie button placement is excellent. The shutter release s larger than most and flush with the top surface, which I find beneficial. The shutter release is also embossed with a pattern which makes it easier to find with a fingertip.<br /><br /> Zooming is controlled with W and T buttons on the back as opposed to a ring or lever. Again, I find this a very helpful feature.  It makes zoom control very easy, especially if you’re underwater or have arthritis. Other backside controls include a Play Mode button, the ubiquitous 4-way selector with a very welcome larger than user Menu/OK button, a Burst Mode button and a Back/Display button.<br /><br /> Fuji has incorporated numerous modes including some surprising ones like a 320fps video capability. It’s well worth the time to read the full manual available on the FujifilmUSA site: the short user’s guide doesn’t have that much detail. On-camera menus are helpful, but somewhat brief.<br /><br /> Overall, I am impressed with the XP90, though I intend to use it in a different way than the manufacturer intended. For many people, this can be a less expensive substitute for one of the major action cam brands. For others, with disabilities, this may be the camera you’ve been waiting for – one that you can use.<br /><br />Jerry","the best underwater camera I have seen so far"]},{"name":"Fujifilm GFX 50S","amazon_reviews":["I am not a professional, just an enthusiastic hobbyist, and I can't say how much I love this camera!

Unqualifiedly recommend this camera, and Canon-brand lenses and Speedlite flashes, because they all WORK with the EOS80D, and are worth every penny extra when compared to low-price no-name brands.  It has been my experience with such brands that there are  ALWAYS compromises in performance you have to\" learn to live with\",  due to the lower price, and when this happens, what seemed like a savings almost always winds up being a bitter disappointment.","Yes the 80D bundle was what I expected. Everything has worked as supposed to.","Perfect mid range camera for my use. Love both Image and video capture capabilities","Amazing camera and super easy to run. I bought it for the video aspect and love love love it.","Amazing camera! Thank you!!!","As a video camera this thing is awesome! as a Photo Camera this thing sucks. If the LCD screen is on it will not take a picture, and teh view finder is blurry. so it's hard to see what I am shooting, The wifi feature is super convenient.","This is a great camera, especially for a beginner like myself. Three functions and menu is easy to manage, after learning some things from online, I'm starting to learn how to use it in manual mode, and great pics coming out. The app interfaces well with the camera and the pics get downloaded to your phone quick.","This is an excellent prosumer camera. There are plenty of tutorials on YouTube.","Fantastic package, everything you need for learning video or photography.","I upgraded to this camera from the T1i.  I was having issues with action shots and night shots.  I am still learning to use this camera but so far its a great improvement over the t1i and takes super pictures.","Received the product fast. Awesome price!!! Great service from DigitalAandMore. Will buy again.","Love it, it's a great camera and I would recommend it to anyone.","Good stuff! Works very well! This camera has a lot of features that digital cameras normally don't have and film cameras always did. I love it! Probably the last camera I will buy for the next 7 years.","The camera ia awesome and the kit has allowed me to up my video production quality. I am just really getting started with the DSLR. I haven't owned an SLR camera is almost 25 years, so a lot of adjustment is needed.  The 80D does a great job with it's auto settings that create some great pictures and amazing depth of field.<br /><br />The microphone is ok. It still picks up a lot of ambient noise, but is does it's job.<br /><br />The Power Zoom adapter, love that it comes with a protective plastic cover when it is not in use and the fact it can be controlled with the Cannon iOS app is a HUGE plus.","After searching in many blogs, videos, opinions and more, I decided to buy it and I'm really happy with it. It's not cheap, and perhaps that's the reason why it took me so long to buy it, but the photo quality help you to forget that.","Wow - great upgrade from my Canon Rebel T5, which is still a fine entry-level DSLR.  The 80d is not much bigger or heavier than the T5, but blows it away in performance and flexibility. I really appreciate the big, bright viewfinder, super-fast autofocus, and the touchscreen. Lots of new controls to learn, but it's fairly intuitive even for a relative beginner.  I mainly shoot high school sports, wildlife and astrophotography, and the 80d is great at each. Great speed for catching stop-action shots in sports, outstanding IQ even in low light for those dawn/evening wildlife shots, and easy to set custom manual settings for catching great shots of the moon or the stars.  The EF-S 18-135mm Nano USM lens so far is really impressive - super fast, silent focusing, and while it's not L lens quality glass, image quality is surprisingly good.  The excellent zoom range also means I don't have to tote around too many lenses, too.  Great job, Canon.","Best camera ever","I cried unashamedly when I unwrapped the Christmas wrapping to reveal what I'd saved up for for seven months, and my wife had bought for me from Amazon.com. This is an upgrade from a Rebel XSI. I really loved that camera, but it had been getting long in the tooth as I'd been reading about the new ones coming out the last three years. When this one hit the market, that was it! I told her, \"Yup, that's the one I want!\" Well, love is giving. She gave me this camera, and I've been ecstatic since. We live on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. Yesterday, there were 35-40 knot winds from the west, as is the norm. I took the 80D and got some photos of the lighthouse that two people have already said are \"award winners\", with the waves smashing up the side of the breakwall, the sun making a ghostly shadow of the lighthouse itself onto the spray. I don't know about the \"award winners\" part, but the photos wouldn't have been possible with the XSI; it couldn't take photos at 7fps, as the 80D did yesterday. Even with my shaking hands in that high wind, it did an amazing job with its amazingly fast focus capability. There's so much info right there for you at the press of a button on the screen before you start, and it's so easy to adjust anything you need to in just seconds. It's a dream to work with for me, and at 67, I'm kinda thankful for that.  If you're looking for a great camera that's better than a beginner's model, but won't run you the $3500.00 a 5D Mark IV will, THIS is the guy you're looking for. Man, this thing feels so good in your hand, it's silly. The Rebel was a touch on the small side; the 80D is perfect. It's really nice to have that info window on the top, too. That's a lot of help when you make yourself aware of and start utilizing it. Okay, I've said enuff. This is one beautiful machine, and I love it! Get one if you can. You won't regret it. Bioman out.","It has been 20 years since my last digital camera.  It was time for an upgrade.  The canon 80D was the perfect choice for me.  It's a midrange camera with fantastic picture and options.  While it doesn't offer 4k, it does do 1080p at 60fps.  For most eveyone, this is good enough.  The megapixel is plenty and most people know that the pixel count is not the only important factor.  The quality of your lens will be a huge factor as well along with proper lighting and focus.  For everyday shooting and for Youtube creators for example, this camera is prefect.  I highly recommend this camera.","This is a KILLER camera for an aspiring professional photographer or an active hobbyist. The flip out screen is a must have. Feels much closer to the size/weight of a full frame than my previous crop sensor (Canon SL1 aka 100d). Tons of great and useful features and buttons. A fully charged battery can get me over halfway through a 12 hour day of shooting photos. Feels well built and solid. Battery grip can be purchased for this camera. Two cool features: Program buttons to have different actions. Great 60fps video as a cherry on top.","The camera is amazing. 10/10 but it came out with a crappy mic input, and I had to send it for a repair right away.","Thus far, I m pleased with my purchase, but in fairness, I am still a novice category as I learn about the Canon 80D.","Great camera.","I've barely put this down since it arrived! All the added features are great to work with.","Very happy with the performance and features of this camera. Would love to have a full frame camera but budget won't allow it. Besides, I have a 60 D and a T2i, so I would have to upgrade all my lenses. The features are great..I love the touch screen. I am very happy with the noise level at high ISO although It's not as good as the 5D Mark 3 or 4 It does what I need as a Portrait and Wedding Photographer.. DO NOT be fooled by any price that is too good to be true because it is not the same camera or same warranty.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!!","Camera as awesome. I highly recommend.","love it!","Absolutely amazing camera. I upgraded from a 2009 Rebel T1i and it is a night/day comparison. Love this new machine, my photos are turning out great.","I am going to assume I got a bad one. I could never get the 80D to sharp focus. It was painfully bad. And not just on one lens. I had the 24mm pancake, the nSigma 18-35mm 1.8 ART, and the revered Canon 70-200mm 2.8 Mark II. This camera would pinpoint focus on roughly 20% of the time. And the focus was all over the place. In the end, I sent it back and replaced it with a much better 6D. Maybe my standards are high using Leica for so long. But, I expect more from Canon than what my 80D was able to do.","I LOVE this camera! I also purchased the new 100-400 lens and my wild life photos are so much sharper. I am very pleased!","Wow. Just absolutely in love with this camera. Finally got to upgrade and so glad I waited for this. Worth the money.","As someone who has always just made due with my iPhone or smartphone camera, finally getting a DSLR was a huge step for me and I am glad I took it. The EOS 80D was recommended to me by several people as I looked to start a YouTube Tech channel and it did not disappoint. Super easy controls, fantastic quality photos and best of all 1080p 60FPS video recording. At a hair over $1500 after taxes I had a true machine to capture the moments in my life and the opinions of tech gadgets that I wanted to post to the internet. It has yet to disappoint me and the point and shoot capabilities are awesome. It makes me feel like a pro photographer though I am only an amateur. Buy this camera if you can afford it, you won't regret it.","Excellent shooter with friendly controls.  I'm not a pro but was looking to move to a superior \"prosumer\" grade camera.  I wanted to find the right balance between cost and performance that offered a good value for my skill level.  This has been great so far and has great picture quality. The ability to rapidly shoot with little to no shutter delay has made all the difference when taking pictures of my small children, and it is light enough to easily carry around all day while on vacation overseas. The controls are not intimidating, and I'm looking forward to learning more about the many features the camera offers.","I stepped up from the Rebel T5 to the 80D this Christmas.  I had some growing pains, but I feel pretty comfortable with it at this point.  While I can't say my pics are worthy of NatGeo yet, I can say it is easier to implement what you want to do.<br /><br />For instance, as you are looking through the viewfinder and see a bird on a limb.  You can quite easily press the focus point button and cycle through to select a single point.  Then you can use the two dials, multi-function keypad, or touchscreen to select which point you want so you can quickly get it onto the bird while maintaining your composition. (Note I tried the touchscreen after I saw someone doing this live with an M5-- it only works in the select mod on the 80D, but it is still a cool way to select it-- again you can just keep your eye on the viewfinder the whole time).<br /><br />One thing I learned was the mic is pretty darned sensitive for video work.  I am so glad I threw down an extra $50 to get the 18-55 STM.  It is amazingly silent.  All my other lenses make some noise that the camera picks up.  There are lots of web reviews on that subject.  I wish I threw down a little more to get the 18-135 -- oh well.  Note: if you manually focus, then pretty much any lens is quiet enough.","I bought it for class and the instructor has told me I got a very good camera. Much better then the rest of the class will be using.","Love my New Camera its been a year now with no complaints...Thanx","More accurately, my wife loves it. This was her step up from her EOS Rebel, which was her first non-film camera (so you can imagine how long she has had that). This camera take great pictures right out of the box. Seems a lot of times it doesn't even want the flash, but still takes fantastic pictures. We love Canon.","Haven't used much yet because I need to micro adjust my lenses and haven't had time.  But I can say this far outranks my 7D for use in low light.  Very little grain when I used at 1600 ISO in low light.  I couldn't do that with my 7D or I would have to adjust the luminace to the point that nothing was sharp, no matter what lenses I was using.  Also the CA seems less with this camera than with the 7D - I tried both with the same lens on a tripod at the same distance and focal length and the CA that the lens causes didn't seem as prominent with the 80D.  I think I am going to absolutely LOVE this camera!","Great DSLR in a wide range of environments from city landscapes, animal macros, nighttime shots, etc. The articulated LCD screen is the real winner compared to many other similar DSLRs in this range - having the flexibility to tilt the screen up or down helps when either using a tripod or holding it above your head in a crowd. Combined with a 18-135 USM lens, this is a very versitile camera.","This was my first DSLR and I am happy with the results and the functions that it has. The pictures and videos are amazing and very user friendly. I do wish I would have purchased a full frame camera but I am happy with these capabilities.","The auto focus is magic","As much as I loved it, there was a uniform grain on the sensor and it would show up on all of my images. I did everything I could but it didn't change. I believe this is a great product so I think I just got the one defect.<br /><br />I do love the touch screen ability and being able to play with new functions is great! I also have a t3i so it was definitely a learning curve to get things going.","Camera came in perfect condition as promised. I like that ! 80D is amazing product to buy!!","Still learning the nuances of the camera and so far, it's everything I expected. I bought this for video production and have not been disappointed. Great results for Facebook and website promos for our radio station. Highly recommend the 80D.","Camera is well built and works very good! Thanks!","It's a great camera. Very high detail stills and the auto focus is AMAZING!<br />It takes great stills and is capable of producing  professional images.<br />For what you pay for, you get a camera that you can use for professional work.<br />The autofocus will let you take fast, accurate, crystal clear shots.<br />You will get sharp images 98% of the time.<br />So if that's what you're looking for do your research and make a purchase.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the video doesn't capture as clear as I need and I'm sending it back to get something capable of that.<br />I think 4K is actually important by 2016, compared to 1080p. It's just noticeable, on or off 4K displays.<br />This gap of quality will become exponentially noticeable in the future.<br />There is a lack of video work done on the 80D (like music videos or short movies) to make any solid decisions without trying it for yourself.<br /><br />4 stars because it is a great camera. great build, great service.<br />Just not what I, and maybe you, don't need.","Went to LA for a 60th birthday party. Brought along my EOS 80D to take pictures of the event.  The pictures turned out fantastic!  Received so many complements from those that attended.  The 80D was easy to handle and I was extremely pleased with the results.  I have to say that I was so glad I made this choice in purchasing this camera with no regrets.","Love it!  Previously owned- Rebel xt. Eos 50d. Eos sl1.  80d is awesome","it arrived on time and I like it so far","First copy:\"Bought this from Canon. Returning. I've had the 70D for many years, and it makes better pictures than the my copy of the 80D.<br /><br />The 80D's autofocus is, of course, much better than the 70D.<br /><br />The IQ is worse. Maybe I just had a bad copy, but the noise on the 80D, and the softness(on tripod, even) were just unacceptable. There is an improvement in dynamic range, for sure, but when you pull out those details, the noise...ugh. I don't know why the difference over the 70D, unless it is the more sensitive sensor.\"<br /><br />Decided to give this another go, as my 70D is really getting long in the tooth.<br /><br />The copy I now have(bought on Amazon) works flawlessly. Noise is not an issue and the pictures(when I am using the camera properly, ha) are tack sharp.<br /><br />THIS is what I was hoping to get, and am so glad to now have it. :)<br /><br />Really love the autofocus, and the feel of the camera in my hand.","Too early to say. My D60 didn't last very long. My D70 has to be sent in for repairs. If this D80 doesn't last long I'm switching to Nikon.","just awasome","Love! Love! Love! I love my Canon 80D creator kit. This thing is a beast for the price range.","I'm sure you'll read lots of specs about this camera in the reviews so I am going to talk about it from my perspective.  I am a massage therapist.  I use this camera to vlog about products and techniques.  Since I do all my own filming it's nice to have a camera that tracks my movements amazingly well.  It's nice and light to carry.  I get great quality video from it.  I also can plug in my mic and record sound with my video.  This camera comes with so many options that make your life easier in post production.  You can shoot time lapses, slow motion, etc.  People complain about no 4k but I don't care.  I'm not a filmmaker.  I'm a massage therapist that uses photos for my website, marketing material, and youtube vlogs.  This does the job perfectly.","I had the 70D and decided to upgrade to this for a few reasons.  It was a nice upgrade, but if you have the 70D already and don't need the few extras, then it's probably not worth it.  With a nice prime (I mostly use the Sigma 18-35mm F1.8 Art) and it thales really sharp pictures.  However, I do a lot videos and it works very well.  I bought this and the and a used 5d3 at the same time and I decided to keep this.  The swivel and touch screen is nice to have and I like the smallet size and weight.  No 4k and noise at higher iso is why I give it 4 stars.  With a flash and a fast lens it helps though.  Overall it's a the jack of all trades.  Happy with the purchase, but if the 6D Mk2 has an articulating touch screen, I may have to step up to that.","Love it.","WOW, WOW, WOW. I haven't even begun to digest all of the features on this camera. It's like driving a Corvette or Ferrari to work every day. So much more than you need....but when you get an opportunity to stretch its legs.....Wow Wow Wow!<br /><br />It is an expensive camera, but it's more solid-feeling than the TXi models...the battery lasts forever, and did I mention the features and versatility? I truly feel like this is the last DSLR I will ever need to buy (for now...).","Build quality:<br /><br />Top notch, nothing short of most Canon DSLR cameras, this thing is rock solid. It feel great in the hand, its decently heavy compared to other consumer cameras like a Sony but for Canon its normal. This thing is highly water resistant, I've used it out in the rain a few times and have no problems. The kit lens is metal which is nice but it definitely adds a lot of weight to the camera. Overall i cannot see anything being weak on this camera, i have been using it heavily for the last few months and it barely has a scratch on it. The only thing i could see being a problem is when you have an external mic plugged in, the plug hangs out the side which could be problematic when laying the camera down, you could break the port. Be sure to lay the camera on its other end.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Amazing auto focus on video. I use this camera for vlogging and it is fantastic, i never have to worry about the camera being out of focus, the dual pixel focus from Canon is easily the best out right now. It may not be the fastest, but its the best. Camera for stills is also amazing, customization of all settings are easy and this camera is much better than my previous t3i, this was a nice upgrade. The touch screen is a huge plus, it allows you to access menus and change settings so much faster and more accurate than using buttons. Another great feature is the flip out screen, i use this camera mainly for vlogging so it is perfect for that or selfies. Overall this is an amazing camera, whether you are shooting video or taking photos they are going to look amazing, you will look professional and this camera will last you a very, very long time.<br /><br />Cons:<br />No dual SD card slots. No 4K video.<br /><br />In all this is an amazing camera and i would recommend it to anyone. This is a perfect mid-level DSLR camera that works great for both video and pictures. It is a crop sensor so you will have a HUGE choice in lenses from both Canon and 3rd parties which will save you a lot of money. If you don't care about 4K video, this is a must buy over any other brand.","Great camera absolutely loved be it thus far.","Get a screen protector because the screen scratches easily.","The Canon 80D has great autofocus. Too bad it doesn't do 4K. I would highly recommend it for professional vloggers and people looking to create timelapses straight into video.","Recently picked up this 80D for studio shooting and actually prefer it to my EOS here: http://amzn.to/2e1A2MB as seems for me at least to be easier to configure and get light and shadow disciplines down, without having to sit for an hour trying to configure it.","Great camera!","Love it.","Certainly this is better camera than 60D which I used for 5 years. 24 MP IQ is better, 45-point AF is better. Touchscreen LCD with a new nano USM lens are certainly great additions. Build quality is great. Battery life is awesome. Video features are great on this camera except no 4K video.<br /><br />Despite all these improvements, high ISO performance (3200 and onwards) is worse. So this is not useful in low light without flash. People might argue about getting RAW images being processed and getting good results, but in-camera JPEGs must be of great quality for this camera at this price point. Though AF performance in tracking moving subjects is better than 60D, it is seriously lagging behind other competitors.<br /><br />I can still recommend this camera to others who are looking for an upgrade from T/Ti series or 60D as this is a great all round camera. It puts everything into one package which no one has right now. I would recommend using L Lens, as kit lens is not very impressive when it comes to IQ. But kit lens 18-135mm is very silent and very quick to focus.","One of the best cameras on the market. Wish i new more about crop sensor lens though just do some reserch be for hand would have got a different lens. Overall no complaints.","It is a nice upgrade from my Canon T5i and I am enjoying it a lot.","Nice camera.","Love this camera. Wish I could take HDR photos while using RAW format though. As of now, you can only do this using jpg format","I got this camera back in May, and I love it!","Nice back-up camera.","Totally amazed how well this camera is doing. Very impressed with the quality of the images that I have been getting with this.","I have owned many Canon DSLR cameras over the years and I loved this one so much that I sold my 1D X.  Lightweight, great image quality, fast focus acquisition, great high ISO image quality...really good tracking for BIF.  I could go on and on.  Mated up with the 100-400 Mk II it's a killer combo.  I shoot with friends that have the \"pro\" bodies and long prime lenses (like I used to) and find that I get just as good if not better shots than they do.","Incredible camera and the best Amazon seller.","after receiving a defective camera, the seller was very reasonable and worked with me so i could return it and get a new functioning camera. After sending the defective product back and receiving the new camera, everything was exactly how i expected and i was very satisfied.","Great!","Love my canon eos 80D, the microphone is ok, but the rest of the system is fantastic.","I've used Canon products for years, traded up from the 60d, which I dearly loved. So far I'm very pleased with the camera. Photos are very sharp, meter seems to handle all sorts of challenging situations very well. Seems like a significant upgrade from the 60d.","I have a 70D and always thought it was so difficult to get perfectly clear sharp pictures maybe 6 or out of 10 were good when using auto.<br /><br />I purchased an 80D from QVC for the same EXACT price as here, with no shipping charges(like here) but in 5 payments no interest!.<br /><br />I put on my 18-135mm lens I had from my 70D and took some pics. I immediately saw the pics were better than my 70D.<br /><br />SO I took out the 70D to make sure I was not nuts and sure enough out of 10 pics the 70D had 6 that were clear and sharp, the 80D 10 out of 10 perfectly clear and sharp! And the 80D had a better blurred background than my 70D pics. This was all done on auto same 135mm lens from the 70D kit.. For me to see such an immediate difference surprised me!<br /><br />Possibly my 70D was bad form the get go, but this 80D takes better pics with the background more blurred with a 100% keep factor using the same lenses I have for my 70D. I am so happy I purchased the 80D.<br /><br />In short the 80D gives better pictures with less fuss than my 70D. I had to work to get the 70D to take sharp pics, this 80D just never misses a shot, dam I am happy! I almost went to Nikon and getting this 80D was my last resort.<br /><br />Again QVC has this same exact camera for this same exact price with free shipping broken into 5 payments with no interest and return within 30 day for any reason policy, so now is the time to jump if you want this camera and cant afford the full price at once(I think this only goes on until Sept 18th 2016 on QVC).","Love the double exposure feature. Also, many features like HDR. Many features are accessable by the mode dial.","Perfect!  Exactly what I needed!  LOVE the action shots and obsessed wifh the handheld night shot feature.","Best camera I've ever owned!","Excellent camera !","Love this camera!","Love this camera - I shoot all my Youtube videos with this cam. You can see the shooting quality in all my vlogs in different lighting situations:<br />[...]","Many others have written and done video reviews about the 80D, so I'll try to keep it rather short. It's an excellent camera. The features I enjoy/make use of most include the following:<br /><br />--updated focusing system, which are easily accessible via dedicated buttons<br />--the touch screen controls, for which a quick pinch to zoom is very helpful for checking focus quickly<br />--the 7 frames per second shutter speed coupled with a quick buffer makes shooting fast moving subjects a reality that wasn't capable on prior cameras I've owned; even at 5 frames per second my prior cameras couldn't buffer the data fast enough<br />--an extended/improved ISO range that is usable, which is also superior to prior versions<br />--and the articulating screen, which even though I shoot 90% stills has come in handy a number of times when shooting higher or lower.<br />--Oh, and having time lapse and wifi in the camera is pretty cool, too.<br /><br />I went back and forth between Nikon and Canon in the lower-end spectrum (Canon SL1 & Nikon D3300) trying to see what family I would most like to stick with, and while both are fine cameras, at the end of the day the \"color science\" Canon has is more aesthetically appealing to me.  From what I have read, seen, and heard, it might not be worth it to move up from the 70D to this model, but if you are a couple models below like I was, it is a worth-while move to make. I'm an amateur who shoots a great deal right now, so if you are in a similar position and on the fence about stepping up with your camera gear, I think the 80D is a solid way to go.<br /><br />Technical stuff concerning the photos I've included: This photographs were shot with a variety of Canon lenses (none of which are professional grade): 24mm, 40mm, 50mm, 55-250mm, and 100mm macro. Light editing was applied to the majority of them using Corel AfterShot Pro II, but that doesn't mean it isn't replicable or they are a dishonest representation of what the camera can do.  As an additional side note, these were all JPEG images when I edited them because AfterShot Pro 2 isn't updated to handle the latest version of RAW files the 80D uses. I read that AfterShot Pro3 can edit the RAW files, but being a budget minded guy, can't confirm this through actual use. Programs such as Adobe Lightroom, I have read, are capable of editing the RAW files.","Very good cameria for the money. Good quality pictures in low light","Just picked this bad boy about a month ago. Was shooting with the t4i prior to that and it was time for an upgrade. The 80D is an amazing dslr with unbelievable AF in movie mode. I purchased the 18-135 usm kit bundle and it is a super fast combo. But this camera really shines while I use my 70-200 f2.8 ii when I'm shooting wild life. The cropped sensor turnes the 70-200 to 112-320 mm and the apsc sensor is really sharp in the middle. But the movie mode is where this dslr shines.","Great Auto focus,m when recording with this camera","This camera is a well rounded performer with excellent image quality and great dynamic range that provides pleasing results.<br /><br />But it's lots of little things make this camera great. The articulating touch screen makes vblogging a breeze.  The touch screen itself makes navigation of menus and camera set up so easy and the updated 45 point autofocus is a delight to use.<br /><br />Liveview operation is fantastic, not only for video but for macro or studio work.<br /><br />The 7 frames per second provides for entry-level sports and wildlife operation as does the wider ISO range (up to 25,600).<br /><br />While lacking 4K video, its 1080/60 FPS video is none to shabby and has the next generation of dual pixel technology which results in stunning focus pulls, all controlled from the touch screen.<br /><br />I've added a few photos to give people a sense of the image quality.","Amazing camera to use for wildlife, landscape, and sport subjects.  Build quality is great, layout of buttons/dials is exactly right.  Interface may be a little challenging, but time with camera will make it very easy to use.","Choosing an APS-C camera came down, to me, between the EOS Rebel T6s and the 80D.  On paper, both have similar capabilities such as a 24 MP sensor, an articulating screen, and ISO ranges (100-25600).  However, the 80D has a higher continuous shooting rate of 7 versus 5 FPS, records in 1080p (60 FPS over 30 FPS), has a weather sealed body, has a faster shutter speed of 1/8000 versus 1/4000, has a headphone port for video monitoring sound, a brighter viewfinder and better battery life.  The WIFI capability was a must for me for convenience sake.<br /><br />Construction<br /><br />The body is solid in feel and comfortable in hand.  There is a flip out LCD viewfinder that operates as a touch screen.  There is a dial to adjust the diopter of the viewfinder.  On the back, the menu button, info button, playback button, zoom buttons, and delete buttons are clearly organized and accessible for quick function.  There is a quick control dial and set button. I prefer this over the joystick mode of Nikon, and the touch screen makes the joystick an unnecessary feature anyways.<br /><br />On the right side of the body, the compartment for the memory card is located.  It accepts only one type of card and only one card can be inserted unlike the professional cameras which hold an SDHC and Compact flash.<br /><br />On the left side of the body, there are protected ports for an external microphone and monitor jack, a port for a wired remote, HDMI port and USB port.<br /><br />On the top of the unit, there are numerous buttons which can be overwhelming but it is highly functional and logical in orientation.  The power button is adjacent to the mode dial button.  Adjacent to the shutter button are four buttons to access ISO, metering, drive, autofocus, panel illumination, autofocus selection, and the main dial.  An LCD window shows various settings, such as shutter speed, aperture, mode, ISO and exposure setting.  There is a flip up integrated flash which is a nice feature but limited in the function that I wish to pursue with photography.  Instead, I ordered a TTL capable flash which can rotate, flip up and has a card diffuser from a third party:<br /><br />Yongnuo YN-568EX II 4-Channel TTL Flash Speedlite<br /><br />On the front of the body, there is a handy depth of field preview button.  Two built in microphones on either side of the lens, and an infrared sensor are located in the front.<br /><br />Touch screen/Menu system<br /><br />The touch screen is clear and crisp.  It is easy to read, and operate with an intuitive feel.  There are some embedded functions that are necessary to understand, though.  It operates very similar to a smartphone in operation, accepting swipes and pinch to zoom in for example.  Even the sensitivity of the touchscreen can be adjusted.<br /><br />The viewfinder for my manual purposes shows exactly what is needed when making the proper configurations.  I also enjoy the LCD screen when I'm just setting this up on a tripod to get my meter readings.  These features minimize my need on the LCD screen which can be an added drain on the battery.<br /><br />Operation<br /><br />As a DSLR, I am going to use this in full manual mode.  However, there are the standard program, shutter priority, aperture priority, automatic mode, disable flash mode, creative auto mode and scene modes for various scenarios.<br /><br />With respect to noise, it is quieter on average from other DSLRs I have handled, and there is a continuous option for single or continuous shooting.  The trade off for silence (you hear a minimal click) is the shutter lag for focusing.  With the STM lens system, the mechanism is very quiet for video already.  The shutter speed dial is right near the shutter button and the aperture is controlled behind the camera where the set button is.  The ISO button is also easy to reach and the settings are controlled by the shutter dial, also.<br /><br />This is very customizable.  I am amazed at what possibilities I have had.<br /><br />It is not recommended to use a screen protector for the LCD screen but I purchased a protector to minimize scratches that can occur.<br /><br />The neck strap is basic and has an integrated cover for the viewfinder.<br /><br />The manual is pretty basic. It easy to understand.  It has a DVD which goes into general functions but it is not all inclusively thorough.  I chose to acquire a separate text (Canon EOS 80D for dummies) to help me with some of the nuances of functionality which are quite extensive.<br /><br />Carry/Use<br /><br />I find the camera system to be quite portable and not as heavy/burdensome as a Prosumer.  I like the weathersealed body that the design imparts.  I have used primarily the viewfinder and quick access buttons over going with Live Mode through the touch screen.  The selector wheel is in a great spot to make easy adjustments.  The shutter button is responsive.<br /><br />The integrated flash is respectable but, as you may know, it is extremely limited in applications.  It is best to use an external flash.<br /><br />With regards to picture quality, I have been quite pleased.  I have gone with a professional grade high speed memory card saving on medium quality and RAW images.<br /><br />Wifi capabilities<br /><br />I have an Apple iPhone and iPad mini.  Use the Canon Camera App.  Activate the Wifi on the camera and go to your settings to connect.  Next launch the app.  The app looks simple but it has many capabilities.  Settings can be changed remotely, the phone/tablet can be used as a remote control and you can download the images from the camera to the mobile device.  Since it controls the function while recording video or taking photographs, you can see the effects of variables before taking the exposure.  It is helpful for an intermediate photographer, like myself.<br /><br />Video<br /><br />Video quality is great. Autofocus and metering can be customized.  The imaging is sharp and focusing capabilities when moving are excellent.  There is a big negative, and that is the built in microphone.  There is a background hiss.  My answer to this was to acquire an external professional stereo microphone.<br /><br />Accessories that I have used<br /><br />Other accessories I purchased included the following:<br />Flash Diffuser<br />Manfrotto Compact tripod and extra quick release plates<br />Rode Videomic Pro, Stereo microphone<br />Armor suit military shield protection for the touch screen and LCD<br />DSTE® Pro BG-E14 Vertical Battery Grip + 2x LP-E6 LP-E6N<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Overall, I've been extremely pleased. It's a solid camera with a balance of great performance, value, size and features.<br /><br />I will update the review after I have more experience with shooting videos and using WIFI.","Love this camera and its capabilities!  I upgraded from the 70d and am happy I did. Definitely a camera I can grow into as a photographer.","Wonderful product, great build quality and a great camera.","A solid upgrade. Although my 70D has served well both for bird and macro photography, especially of wildlife on night-time desert roads (I have Sony and Canon full-frame cameras for portraits, landscapes and other uses), this upgrade offers some valuable features for my particular needs, these in particular: 1) 24mp allows me to crop a little tighter, which is sometimes important when I've photographed a rattlesnake's head from a safe distance and want to tighten the frame without losing appreciable sharpness; 2) focusing in dim light is quicker than with the 70D--I often use a headlamp to focus on macro subjects on moonless roads, and that has sometimes been a problem with the 70D, especially with critters that are moving--the 80D does a noticeably better job; 3) an often unsung advantage that I consider major is the 80D's ability to let you use a 1.4 teleconverter with a 100-400 f5.6 lens--just by upgrading I now have a 600/5.6 birding lens, with solid focusing capacity. That might be the biggest advantage given my uses. Other pluses: a cleaner menu, more focus points, and somewhat better video (with better tracking focus). Both cameras include a fully adjustable articulating viewing screen, which I find indispensable for shooting critters at eye level on the road at night, especially rattlers and coral snakes, because I can both frame and keep an eye on the actual animal. That's the main reason I use this line of cameras rather than the 7D or 7D II, which are supposed to focus a bit faster but lack the articulating viewing screen.<br /><br />If you're mostly using your 70D or similar for general photography, spending a grand on this upgrade might not be worth it. Consider waiting for the 90D or equivalent, which I assume will be a bigger leap forward, with 4K video and more focus points, for example. Unless you're doing my kind of specialty photography, I doubt you'll see much difference in image quality or ease of shooting (the 70D is a really good \"prosumer\" camera). But I'm very happy with the 80D's improvements.","Great Camera for video!  This is the best Canon camera for easily shooting professional looking video.  I can't recommend it enough.","Just got in today but so far what I used on it is awesome, I also have a 7d, so it was easy to set up and use","Video footage is awesome. All my videos except 1  were filmed with the 80D [...]","This is the finest camera I have ever owned.  I am especially impressed with the LCD monitor.","This is an amazing camera.  I am so happy and very satisfied.  I read the reviews and they are all spot on.","Excellent video and pictures.  I'm still learning how to use the camera, but it has been an excellent purchase.  Even on automatic I have hardly taken a bad picture.  Video is almost too easy.  I did purchase a good Canon flash and have an external microphone for video,  All in all very glad that I bought this.  It is heavy if you are not used to a good camera and lens.","Very comfortable grip, seems ergonomic to my womanly small hands, and not too heavy. I have moved up from an (old) Canon Digital Rebel XT and this is not too much more weight or expense. I am on a hobbyist level and mostly photograph animals, people, and landscapes. Fairly easy to see menu. I still need to use the manual to go through the multiple levels of the menu.  Viewfinder is bright and clear. Auto focus is very fast. Swiveling touchscreen is a great asset. This is a really versatile Canon camera that produces great images for me without working very hard. Very enjoyable.","I LOVE this camera! I use it for filming videos. The auto focus and touch screen are amazing!","Absolutely love this camera! I would definitely recommend getting the 50 mm lens to go with it!","So far this camera is just what I was looking for.  I'm just an amateur photographer, and have been missing my old SLR since it got so rudely obsoleted when film went the way of the dinosaurs.  I got the Tamron 70-200 image stabilization lens for it, and it's working great, taking great pictures.  The focus always seems spot on, and is very fast.<br /><br />It'll take me a while to learn all the features, but the YouTube videos are great for helping to learn the features of the camera.  There's a lot of options!  But there's some settings that allow taking great photos with little thought put into the settings, so you can do as much or as little fiddling with the settings as you wish.<br /><br />It is a large camera compared to the point and shoot ones I'd been getting, but the images are so much nicer, and the focus is really great.  The zoom lens makes it an even bigger camera, but Canon also sells a fixed lens for this camera that is quite small, and would make it easier to carry around.","I love everything about this camera.  Met my expectations and beyond.","Love this camera. I now have 2 of them and they are great. If you are looking for an inexpensive camera that gives you high quality images then this is the one.","Excellent camera. I enjoy using it. Great upgrade from my t3i.","Excellent product! a very nice upgrade from the 20D and 40D models. great semi-pro camera body!","Love it!","I am so happy with this purchase! Video quality is amazing! I've been using Canon cameras for about 30 years now and I highly recommend them.","The Canon 80D is a huge improvement for anyone using a 60D or older or a T3i or older camera. The new features and improved AF system are worth the cost if you already have a bunch of Canon lenses.<br /><br />If you aren't really invested into Canon yet, however,  the 80D is a questionable choice. It's key features are geared towards video but it has inferior video capabilities to similarly-priced cameras from other manufacturers. The rest of its features make it a decent sports & wildlife camera body but, for those particular applications, the Canon 7D Mark II does a better job and is now at a much closer price point.<br /><br />If you are already invested in Canon's Prosumer/Consumer cameras and want a huge leap in AF capabilities, low-light performance and video capabilities, the Canon 80D is a perfect choice for you. If you are searching around for your first Digital SLR camera and are dead-set on getting a Canon, consider buying the Canon T6i or even the T5i and using your saved money on a really good lens. This body is more worthwhile to those who want the advanced AF and touchscreen system for videography but are too invested into Canon Lenses to switch brands. If you're not knee-deep in Canon glass, other companies are making video cameras that are technically superior (although the mirrorless options tend to  have really bad battery life in comparison).","Great camera for a vlogger like me ","I upgraded to the Canon 80D from the 60D and absolutely love it!!!","Believe the hype!  The 80D does what Canon claims, and more. Money well spent.","best camera i have own coming from a xsi the ddifference is huge, the auto focus is lighting fast, i`m using a 17-70mm ultrasonic lens what a pair they make.","so far I am not thrilled with the focus or picture quality.<br />I have an older 20d with an older sigma 20mm 1.8 - the 20d takes much better pictures IMO, but unfortunately it seems that the older lenses are not working so well with the newer focus system.  I guess this is to be expected.  IT also seems the newer Sigma lenses also are not working so well with the newer canons - but at least the newer lenses can have a firmware update.<br />It also seems ridiculous that Samsung can put 4k, 120p, fast slow video and Canon still provides the minimum HD video options.  I do home they can add 4k with an update.<br />Finally the kit lens is as to be expected not the best, again I'm not getting the sharp quality photos I'd expect when viewing at 100%.","I love it","A little better than the 70d in every way.","Very pleased.","Great camera and lens combination. Very versatile. Excellent picture quality and I love the wireless downloads to my computer using the EOS software. It's going to take months to explore all the features, but so far I am thrilled.","Excellent, excellent, excellent!  This camera is everything the hype says it is.  I picked the 80D over the 7D Mark II, and I am glad I did.","I love this camera, it feels great in my hand and I also love that touch screen.  The only thing I don't like is the Optical View Finder, I guess I am comparing it to my Sony.  Other than that it's a Great Camera.","Loving this camera. Major upgrade from the T1i I had. I can always wish for better, like GPS, and 4k video, but it is an all around great camera.","Came to this from years of owning 60D after testing a 70D and 5D III as potential upgrade options. It's like I have my old camera body, except with better controls, and the photos are better, and the video is better. If you're in the market for an enthusiast APS-C body and want to maintain the DSLR style over mirrorless, you really can't go wrong at this price.","80D is a great camera!  It is a great step up from my old DSLR.  So far I have not had any issues.","I have been a Canon user for some time now but not a fanatic loyalist so I have a good experience with Nikon and Sony as well. Since I do print media and video shoot for quick uploads to social media, I have relied more on Nikon D7000 and Sony HD Camcorder both of which have the still picture and video shoot capabilities. It has been my hope to see Canon come out with something similar in less than $1500 price range. But from what I have just seen on the video, the 80D does not seem to possess all that. I may be wrong since I have not tried it. But I do not want to jump into buying it just to try it and go through the pain od returning. The short video clip to this AD leaves a lot to be desired for serious users an d critics like me who are in constant need of products in the constantly changing environment and fiercely competitive market as far as cameras go. Keep in mind that smartphones with over 20 megapixels and capability for instant uploads to Facebook and You Tube are a major challenge that I readily use at various press conferences.","Awesome camera!  I moved up from the 60D but still use it, in fact I have 2 of them. I have had 2 days and the operation of it seems very good.  The button placement on the rear is different but the touch screen works great.  The pictures have been superb! with 45 focus points, it beat the 9 focus points of the 60D.  Very pleased!","Like","Absolutely love it!","I bought the 80D as an upgrade from my 70D. There aren't that many upgrades, but I wanted to give my adult daughter my 70D, so I figured this would replace it, plus give me more megapixels, and the additional focus points which will come in handy for my [flying] bird photos.<br />I absolutely love the articulated touch screen, and wish my 5D Mark lll, and my 5DS offered it as well. I do a fair amount of macro photography, and often do multiple exposures for focus-stacking. The 80D, like the 70D has rear screen magnification up to 10x, plus a moveable focus square, which is a real blessing when using the magnification features, and manual focus. The moveable focus square will also go to the edges of the rear-screen image, which is very useable when filling the frame with the subject image. I have no negatives to report on this camera, or for that matter the 70D...","Love this camera!","Great versatility. Manual focus includes ultra closeup for taking photos of artworks, etc. Multiple exposure features works great, but you must use in P mode only. User manual is a bit small but pocket size for field reference.","The 80D is a Jack of all trades and even though it may not be the master of any it comes fairly close.  The 80D doesn't shoot as fast as the 7D Mark II or do as well in low light as the full-framed 5D III & 6D but it performs well in all areas and is a tool suitable for all types of photography.  If you're looking for an all-around camera the 80D is a great choice.<br /><br />Edit:  After further use I've come to the conclusion that this camera has subpar performance in low light when compared to its direction competition (APS-C) sensors.  It's a great camera for regular use in normal conditions and it really shines when shooting video though.","OMGEEEEE i love my new camera!<br />I bought this camera to upgrade from my previous t3i. I received my camera yday and i am still in disbelief about how much of a jump up it is from quality, user interface, image outcome and all the 9 yards.<br />I was scared to pay over 1k for a camera, but now i can honestly say it was worth each penny and thought put into buying this.","It was everything I was expecting, plus features I had not thought of.","Dinner date. We're in love.","I have this camera now for about 3 weeks already. This review is based on my day to day usage in realistic shooting conditions.<br /><br />Camera tested With the<br />18-135mm USM Nano (kit lens)<br />10-18mm STM<br />100-400mm II<br />100-400mm II + 1.4X Mk I TC<br />50mm STM<br />55-250mm STM<br /><br />1. Battery<br />Lasts very long. Roughly for me about 1300 pictures with heavy chimping and sending to phone via wi-fi. I do not review my photos in camera much. With that way, I get close to 2000 pictures per charge.<br />Takes about 2 hours to charge<br />Camera battery meter is fairly accurate<br /><br />2. Auto-focus<br />Speedy and fast<br />Accurate even under dim light<br />Even with the 100-400mm II + 1.4X Mk I combo, it was able to AF quickly and accurately under really challenging lighting condition. The challenging condition I refer to is around 6:30pm in evening in Singapore after rain. Infact it was still drizzling. So the light condition was really low. The subject was a rufous woodpecker on a tree bark. Basically not much of contrast in the subject for camera to be able to AF. Despite this, the camera managed to get the AF quickly and accurately. So it passes the AF test for me with full marks.<br />I tried the 100-400mm + 1.4X TC for Birds in flight. The camera was able to get subject in focus quickly and reliably. Passes this test as well. BTW - I am a center AF point person and use AI Servo or AFC modes frequently.<br />The AF with all the above lenses was speedy and accurate.<br /><br />3. Viewfinder<br />It is bright and provides accurate results as in what I see in view finder is what the captured image contents will be. The viewfinder also has things like grid lines which could help with composition. Or for ensuring level of horizon when shooting landscape. The AF confirmation lights up bright red in dim conditions. It is a good implementation.<br /><br />4. Post processing lattitude<br />I always shoot in RAW and process photos using lightroom. I always found Canon RAW takes well to post processing and have no problems in recovering highlight and reveal shadow information. The 80D raw files allows a more lattitude in revealing shadow information without introducing noise. One time it happened that the exposure compensation dial accidently got dialed down by about 1.5 stop. Luckily I was able to get back lots of details and colours in post processing.<br /><br />5. Ergonomics<br />I find the ergonomics excellent for my hands. Everything is good. It is best you handle the camera in a store before buying as everybody has their preference to ergonomics. I can only say based on my own experience, a vast majority of people should be happy with the ergonomics. All the buttons and dialed required by most photographers are there and in th right place.<br /><br />6. Top LCD<br />There is a top LCD screen that reveals most shooting information a photographer will need.<br /><br />7. Articulating LCD<br />LCD rotates in various angles and directions. I compose mainly using the viewfinder. However I appreciate the fact that LCD can be rotated and stowed away to prevent damage to the LCD screen.<br /><br />8. Value for money<br />Given the specs and functions provided by the 80D, in my opinoin, the 80D is an excellent camera and well worth the money<br /><br />Overall it is a great camera and yes I recommend this to my friends<br /><br />Update on 4th July 2016: The camera is awesome. I am getting some really excellent images for landscape and birding. In fact my most frequently used lenses are 10-18mm and 100-400mm II with 1.4X extender. Added a series of bird in flight (pictures of red tailed hawk) captured recently at Mud Bay Park here in Vancouver suburbs.

The 70D with it's dual pixel sensor was nice for quick video work (I wouldn't call it professional but only a pro would notice) but the sensor gave me headaches when using lenses faster then 2.8 for photography. I kept getting soft focus which I guess was a problem among many 70D's. When I upgraded I so far have not noticed any such problems. The menu program looks nicer and is more intuitive, the build is great but it's just like the 70D in that aspect. Light and easy to hold. In my option the focus system is a great upgrade and it's fast but what I love most is the headphone jack. The 70D lacked this little addition and let me tell you, for my video work this is huge. Thank you Canon for listening on this for once. I probably wouldn't of bought it had it not had the headphone jack.","I will attempt the impossible in this Amazon review.  I will tersely assess the new Canon 80D DSLR and compare it to the Canon T5i, and the Olympus E-Volt 500 an old 8-megapixel camera.  All will be compared with “kit” lenses.  The T5i and the 80D with the Canon 18 – 135 STM and the Olympus with the standard Olympus kit lens that came with the camera, a Zuiko 42-150mm.<br /><br />The 80D has a 24-megapixel sensor, retails here on Amazon and at most photography outlets at about $1,200 body only and $1800 with an 18-135mm lens. The T5i has an 18 MP sensor, sells on Amazon for about $400 body only and $800 with an 18 – 135mm lens.  The Olympus can only be found used.  Here on Amazon it goes for about $200 with two excellent Zuiko lenses, the 14-42mm, and the 40-150mm.  The E-volt can also be found on E-bay.  My test E-volt 500 had an 8 MP sensor.<br /><br />Here are three photos of birds taken at the same distance on automatic settings at ISO 100 with the E-volt, T5i, and the D80.  All were taken by me with the camera on a tripod.  No post processing.<br /><br />E-Volt 500;150mm; ISO 100; File Size: 661KB (Photo of one quail, first photo below) -  Canon EOS T5i; 135mm, ISO 100; File Size: 2.7 MB(photo of the numerous sparrows) - Canon EOS 80D; 135mm, ISO 100; File Size: 8.2MB(Photo of two quail)<br /><br />At these sizes I cannot discern a difference in the pictures.  For sharing by email, viewing on Facebook or similar uses, or printing up to 5 X 7, a person viewing the pictures could not tell the difference between the photos.<br /><br />In my opinion the $200 Olympus E-volt 500 will take photos for the average person that the 80D (and T5i) can only match.  In bang for the user buck, the Olympus – and many other similar big brand older cameras – far exceeds the value of the newer 80D.<br /><br />So, why buy the 80D or the T5i?  Flexibility is the word I would use.  By this I mean the 80D will get a great shot under conditions where the Olympus E-volt would struggle.  If your kid is running to first base the Olympus continuous shooting setting is going to click away slowly and your chances of nailing a great moment might be missed.  The 80D will shoot at more than twice the speed of the old Olympus and improve the chances of capturing that wonderful split second of time that people cherish.  The same goes for shots attempted in gathering darkness and other environmentally challenging conditions.  The camera is a machine, and more money buys a machine that can perform under a wider variety of settings.<br /><br />Do more pixels matter?  Only if you want to enlarge your picture to relatively large size.  Even at 8 x 10 the 8 MP Olympus will do just fine.  Now, if you are going to crop the picture to its maximum and then enlarge it to 8 x 10 you will find the megapixel count becoming very important.  But most of us do not do that.  In fact, even though I have taken pictures for years with some excellent cameras – both film and digital – I have enlarged only two photos beyond 16 x 20 and both those photos were relatively uncropped so almost the entire negative was used.  If the entire 8 MP of the Olympus were used for a 16 x 24 photo the enlargement would probably look fine from a technical point of view.<br /><br />What is the most important factor for us “average” photographers when buying a camera?  This varies with the mission.  If you are a nature enthusiast the camera’s ability to focus quickly on moving objects will be key.  Landscapes require a camera with excellent resolution, normally achieved with outstanding lenses, but also controlled by the algorithm programs running inside the camera.  The iPad handles high dynamic situations well because deep within its little guts someone put together an excellent program to judge the exposure.<br /><br />iPad Air; ISO 32; file size: 772KB (Photo attached to this review - it is the last photo of the tree bud)<br /><br />Thus, specialist have narrower requirements; however, if you are an “all-rounder” and like to photograph everything you will need a camera with maximum flexibility and a wide array of functions.  Many pros will dispute this because in the film days, which I was a part of, all you needed was a manual camera and off you went, they say.  Not true actually, because a LOT of the photography in those days was accomplished in the darkroom.  If you wanted a soft focus look you normally did that in a darkroom.  Today a camera can do many things on site, so why not do them and view the results on site rather than hours later on a computer screen?<br /><br />My 80D was purchased in the hopes of improving on the flexibility of the T5i.  And it has.  The focus is quicker, and the continuous shooting is faster to name two advantages.  There are a few more special programming features, but I seldom use them.  The Digic 6 processor seems be improved in the dynamic range department, and the photos look like they are exposed better than the T5i or the E-volt; however, in bright light like the bird pictures there isn’t any difference.  In fact, properly exposing a picture in bright sunlight seems to overcome nearly all technical problems.<br /><br />Any teething troubles with the 80D?  No technical problems at this point.  However, non-technically I will point out that the menu system for Canon is deep and confusing.  The menus have changed since the T5i forcing me to carry my manual around most of the time, and I have used Canon cameras for years.  The photographer must simply memorize the menus.  This isn’t easy when you are dyslectic, old, and in pain most every moment of the day.  The menu screen is tiny, hard to read, and even harder to properly activate by pressing on a tiny spot with large arthritic fingers.  They don’t go where I want them to.  Thus, handling the camera is slow and awkward even on a tripod.<br /><br />I was anticipating a great new focusing system, but it is overly complex.  42 points of frustration they should have said. When I am taking close-ups of flowers the 80D often focus on branches or stems that are not part of the main subject and refuses to find my subject.  So, I turn to the single center focusing point, or manually focus, or choose live screen and touch where I want to focus – all examples of the flexibility of the camera – to solve the problem.  The 42 focusing points have been a problem for me and it seems I have paid for a detriment.<br /><br />The so called WiFi capability does not exist.  My wife and I have both tried to get the camera to communicate with our computers and our tablets with zero results.  Emails to Canon have resulted in nonsensical responses.  The manual on the subject is useless.  Downloads from Canon told me to apply for an SSL(?) certificate. I am waiting for a good aftermarket manual to appear and save the day, until then… (David Busch's Canon EOS 80D Guide to Digital SLR Photography is due out on Jul 25, 2016.  You can pre-order it on Amazon).<br /><br />The price is just barely OK.  The 80D is twice the price of the T5i, but it isn’t twice the camera.  Nonetheless, it is a very good camera with improved flexibility, an articulating screen, a clearer screen than the T5i, better algorithms (I think), faster continuous shoot, a leveling indicator, and other nice to have stuff.  In the field, any distraction can hurt your concentration.  Little things that require extra steps can kill your picture and your fun.  While the 80D hasn’t eliminated all, or even most, of these problems from the T5i it has moved up the chain to a less distracting more functional camera in many ways.  Is it worth twice the price?  Probably not.  Is it worth well over $1,000 for the average person who can duplicate the pictures in the majority of instances for about $200?  No.  This is a camera for the serious photographer that may never sell an image, but looks for that timeless moment of beauty or excitement that defines life for them.  At that moment, when you have to get the shot, this camera can do the job.<br />AD2","I love this camera. The thing is that i bought this camera for $1440 that is 95000 rs in india. I thought it is much cheaper in america, but that doesnt<br />seem to be the case.","Super!!!","I bought this to use with my 70D for video work and some stills photography.  It is a great camera for that video, as was its predecessor, but I notice the still shots are not nearly as noisy.  Getting better results than I expected.<br /><br />Other than that the other big upgrade is in focusing at higher depths of field.  I shot pictures at a scrimmage football game using a 70-200mm f4 and a 1.4x converter at f8 and had no problems with auto-focus.  It was fast and accurate.","I got the Canon 80D for a week. A happy upgrade from T3i. The 80D shoot significantly faster 7fps, longer battery life, larger  viewfinder, higher true resolution, it has a fully flip out touch screen easy to navigate menu set up, more cross type focus, weather sealed, reduce shutter shaking, much less shutter lag, better image quality, mostly I use it to shoot still images as a hobbyist, occasionally I shoot video clips, I don't have neither a 4k TV nor 4k monitor, so the 1080p 60fps is good enough for me. I don't need to worry about the overheat issue during video shooting. I am thinking about to add a tele zoom lens to shoot landscape and wild life images. I love this camera.<br />UPDATED: Set the camera on tripod at backyard patio @ noon 80F testing the video shooting 1080p @ 60fps, let it run 29 minutes and 59 seconds, NO overheat  warning. Nice job Canon!<br />UPDATED 5/14/2016 My Canon 80D  with Sigma 150-600mm  images.","A very happy camper I am! I upgraded to the 80d from a 60d and am very satisfied with the new 80d. The additional functionality the 80 brings is amazing compared to the 60, and by the way I was very satisfied with the 60. The 45 focus points and the 7fps is what made the decision easy. I have been using the camera for about 3 weeks and am loving it, the fast focus, the tack sharp shots, and the additional focus points are awesome. The internal wifi is great as well with the addition of the android app for viewing and use as a remote are great new features from the 60. I would highly recommend this upgrade if you are using a 60d or earlier canon!","I preordered the Canon 80D. The camera was sent to me,  which was a bit of a fiasco (took a lot longer to get for logistic reasons, and do not factor into this review). After reading the manual front-to-back, the camera AF was not working on the new lens.  I called Canon and advised of the issue. Per Canon, there's a lens or camera defect and needs to be returned. I returned the camera kit to Focus Camera for a new camera kit. So,  this makes week 3 since the release date of the Canon 80D...without a working camera. So far It's been a dull and agonizing pain, but hopeful this will resolve with the new replacement. Update to come!","I'm delighted with this camera. The colors and the dynamic range are amazing for a camera at this price point. My Sigma and Tamron lenses work great with it too!","This camera has come under a lot of criticism for its lack of 4K, and I think that resentment trickled over into a lot of the venom being thrown at it in some online reviews.  I know it deterred me from purchasing it right away. But then I saw a glowing review on Chris and Jordan’s YouTube channel (TheCameraStoreTV), so I decided to take the plunge.  And I’m so glad I did.  This is a seriously amazing camera, and a considerable improvement over its predecessor, the 70D (which I owned).<br /><br />First, the 4K issue.  I also own a Samsung NX1, which is more or less the gold standard in hyper-detailed 4K realism.  It’s a visually stunning image, and it’s no exaggeration that you can see every single blade of grass in a lawn.  But while stunning, it’s not “filmic.”  By that, I mean we’re accustomed to a certain “look” and “feel” in movies.  Film flickers past at 24 frames per second; and if it’s shot at 30 frames per second (NTSC video rate), it feels “off” – the so-called “video” look.  The same goes for detail.  The hyper-detail in 4K cameras feels off cinematically.  A cinematic image needs to be focused; but if you’re seeing pores on a face (which 4K is more than capable of rendering), then the image is no longer pleasant.<br /><br />The footage from the 80D is pleasant,  focused, and cinematic.<br /><br />I also wanted to touch on the ALL-I codec.  The immediate default for filmmakers is to shoot “flat,” and turn sharpness completely off.  The reasons for this are twofold – to reduce aliasing and moire artifacts; and historically, in-camera sharpness was just ugly.<br /><br />That’s not the case with the 80D’s ALL-I recording codec, which produces an impressive high-bitrate recording (I’ve heard it’s around 100 mbs).  Using ALL-I, and with in-camera sharpness at 2, I put the camera through the ringer on everything I could find that produced aliasing and moire in every other camera I’ve owned (a bookshelf of DVD’s, telephone wires, brick walls, etc.), and none of it resulted in aliasing or moire.  And the in-camera sharpness looks great!  It no longer has the harsh, scrunched up contrast lines; the 80D’s sharpness looks better than anything you could do in post, and still allows for a gentle falloff on highlights and shadows.<br /><br />As for the camera's dual-pixel auto focus, it's everything you've read about it and more.  It really sets the gold standard for video auto focus.  It locks in smoothly, and accurately, without any back-and-forth \"hunting.\"<br /><br />Anyway, that’s my two cents.","I received my 80D on 3/28/16 and have become familiar with its capabilities. (Owned T2i and T4i for years.) Without repeating other very accurate reviews I will just say that the 80D meets or exceeds every expectation I had after reading \"virtually\" everything available on-line including extremely detailed hands-on reviews posted in last several days. The 80D hits a huge sweet spot for experienced DSLR shooters who don't want the weight or cost of a 7DmkII or full frame. I have 5 other Canon lens and was happy to find a Canon that solved my sports focus issues and provided numerous other upgrades. I have the new nano 18-135mm lens. Bottom line is that the 80D is a fantastic product for under $2K. Although the Nikon supposedly has better image quality, the 7200 cannot do many things that I enjoy with the 80D. Great decision for me.<br />Update 4/11/16: Finally used the 80D to photograph a regulation soccer game on a sunny but bitter cold (27F)morning. I took over 1000 images with the new 18-135 nano USM, my old faithful 55-250 IS, and my new 70-200 f4 L lenses. The 80D is INCREDIBLY FAST focusing in the AI servo mode using the centered 9 point area focusing points setting. The large area center would work about the same. Shot mostly at 1/1500, ISO 800, f7, 7fps. The results are stunning for fast focusing relative to the T4i I used for dozens of soccer games in the past. If the camera missed the first frame of a sequence it was locked on by the 2nd frame. The accuracy of the focus point was excellent and when it was not, the reason was easily recognized with the desired player being off center or blocked by another closer player. My \"in-focus\" percentage was the highest I have ever achieved. Bottom line for those considering the 80D and requiring extremely fast focus is that every review says the 80D is superb and my results totally confirm those reviews. Hard to believe that the $3K and $6K Canon pro models are faster.<br />4/16/16 update: I have 1700 images taken with the first charge on the Canon LP-E6N battery. Half were taken at 27 degrees F a week ago. Battery menu shows 50% capacity. Wow! Now I will see how a fully charged STK LP-E6 does.","Easy to use, excellent photos, highly recommend!","i just love my new dslr camera..great photos and videos..fast shipping!","Coming from a Canon t3i, I have to say this was well worth the upgrade.","So far the Canon 80D is a champ, but beware if looking for an after-market battery grip:<br /><br />The \"Vivitar BG-E14 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 70D DSLR Camera\" DOES NOT work properly with the Canon 80D, although the battery grips are sold as interchangeable between the two.<br /><br />It will neither recognize Canon nor non-Canon batteries. Once installed the touch screen will prompt you to verify the authenticity of the installed batteries.<br /><br />If you say yes they are Canon batteries, the camera will shut off stating that they are knock-offs. If you go ahead and state they are not Canon, they will not be recognized and the 80D will NOT see them, thus never knowing how much of a charge there is nor how much of a charge is left.<br /><br />I have a 70D after-market battery grip and swapped them and the new \"Vivitar BG-E14 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 70D DSLR Camera\" works on the 70D and the battery grip I had on the 70D DOES work properly on the 80D.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />fyi -- the \"NEEWER Battery Grip Holder For Canon EOS 70D Camera DSLR Replacement For BG-E14\" will NOT work with the new Canon 80D for the same reasons.<br /><br />But, I did find a battery grip what WILL work with the new Canon 80D, for a lot less money than Canon's original stock battery grip, the BG-E14,<br /><br />I bought it for my Canon 80D, it works fine and I'm very happy with it.","I got mine on Friday and this camera is a beauty today I got to connect the camera to my iPhone through wifi and were able to share the pictures without having to transfer photos to computer first, the touch screen is another great feature of this camera.","I replaced my well worn 70D with a shiny new 80D and, although they look and feel similar, I found the 80D laden with new features and image quality improvements over its predecessor.<br /><br />CONTROLS: Buttons and wheels feel sturdy and may be used while looking through the viewfinder. Exposure modes are set with a topside knurled dial: manual, semi-auto modes and assorted full auto modes. Menus are easier to navigate than the 70D: five icons (reduced from the 70D's fifteen) and organized by category. If you've owned prior EOS models, the interface will be familiar and you’ll barely need to crack the manual.<br /><br />The VIEWFINDER is a joy to use: bright and clear and, with 100% coverage and .95x magnification, an improvement over Rebels and the 70D. I love the transmissive LCD display (transparent LCD over the focusing screen) as it’s almost like using an EVF: display of icons, AF and metering patterns, grid and plain matte screens and an electronic level.<br /><br />AUTOFOCUS: The 45-point cross type AF array is fast and sure-footed in low light, besting my 70D in most situations. It has the same AF modes as the 70D—single-point AF, zone AF and automatic selection AF—plus a fourth mode, large zone AF. I was surprised how much more “human aware” auto select mode is compared to the 70D. If a human enters the frame, it locks on them like glue.<br /><br />LiveView has a new AF mode: AI Servo. Tap the subject on the touchscreen, half-press the shutter button and it does a great job of tracking the subject across the screen. It’s perfect for low level shooting of moving critters or kids.<br /><br />IMAGES show pleasing detail, color and impressive control of noise. Specifically, there is a significant reduction in shadow noise over the 70D, allowing aggressive lifting of shadows should the need arise.<br /><br />VIDEO: HD video quality is excellent: less moire artifacts, cleaner in low light and smoother and more film-like compared to 70D files. I’m disappointed 4K HD wasn’t included. However, 1080P is fine for YouTube since audiences mainly watch on phone and notebook screens.<br /><br />Movie servo is faster than 70D servo and less prone to “hunting” in low light. Focus-pulls are a snap with the touch screen. Movie servo with face recognition works great, allowing me to both shoot and perform in video clips.<br /><br />WI-FI: Diddle settings, fire shutter, upload images and monitor LiveView and video on an iPhone/iPad, Droid or computer with the Canon Connect app. Wi-Fi eats batteries crazy fast, so carry spares. Video and LiveView are also available via wired USB or HDMI connection and are smoother and less battery draining.<br /><br />The 80D kit ships with the Canon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilization USM Lens (Black) lens. It’s a wonderful optic and I wrote a detailed review on it here.<br /><br />FINAL BURB: The 80D is a nimble and capable camera, and an impressive upgrade over the 70D in terms of AF, resolution and control of shadow noise. The bottom line is the many small improvements add up to an enjoyable experience and excellent images and videos.","This is the best crop sensor Canon available. This is not a full frame sensor and therefore takes images at a 1.6 crop factor. EF lenses may be used as well as EF-S lenses which are specifically made for these cameras. Pros might lean towards the full frame option. But it is significantly more money when this lens body is more than capable of achieving professional level results (for a crop sensor this is #1 folks) Canon's flagship crop besides ofcourse the 7D MkII designed for preofessionals.","I love it test it out the Images look so sharp the shutter is so soft sound to my ears I see the battery seem it has more power to last longer 1865m ah then the 1800m  I was little upset I didn't get a software and a cord like the 70d came with. I test the ISO on video not bad u still get grain if u go higher then 1200 the higher u go 3200 u can see it but u wont see red or blue grain its not bad in low light the canon 80d has some awesome features like Dream its like white around the edges and old movie, memory and  B&W  and your Fav toy, shoots in full HD up to 59.94 the head jack is amazing work wonderful, The HDR it has a lot of feature to pick from wonderful amazing colors, the built in bulb timer works amazing you going love this canon 80d haven't test it on sports yet just got it but I love it all ready u will to...  IF u looking to upgrade from your 70d to 80d well this camera is for u 45AF and 24mp its a step up from the 70d","- BUILD QUALITY -<br />So let’s first take a look at the build quality and design of the Canon 80d. Now I've been testing the 80d out for a while now and felt comfortable using it pretty much straight away. That’s because the body itself isn’t changed that much from the old 70d, which his the camera I’ve used for 2 years or so. There are a few new things that have changed though. The buttons on the back of the camera are different and feel a lot easier to use. They’re a little bit more pronounced and this is nice.<br /><br />The grip itself is nice. It’s not a very heavy camera like the Canon 5d or 6d, but it’s also got enough weight on it to easily deal with a heavier lens like the Sigma 18-35mm that I also use. On the side of the camera you’ll also notice a new port, the headphone jack which is something I’ll talk about in a bit. But overall the build quality is fantastic, and to me is the sweet spot size for DSLR’s.<br /><br />- MENUS -<br />Now when I first heard about the new Canon 80d, one thing I didn’t expect to change was the menu system. But it has. It’s now a little bit more compact and is using a new tabbed system rather than the old system. It’s taken me a little bit of time to get used to it but it does seem pretty easy. Fortunately it’s not too overloaded with options, especiaslly for beginners, but if you do put it in manual mode you do get a lot more options to play around wiht.<br /><br />- LCD SCREEN -<br />Now one of the best features of the old Canon 70d was it’s touch screen and I’m pleased to say the Canon 80d is just as good.<br />Because the Canon 80d has such fantastic autofocus, having the touch screen really makes things easy, especially if you want to do some nice focus pulls. I use this nearly overtime i make videos and it’s how I do those product focus pulls from time to time. Of course the 80d’s screen is also articulating and it’s something I couldn’t live without now. Being able to switch it around to any angel is great, especially for someone like me who films all my own videos.<br />It's also a pretty big lcd screen, especially compared to a smaller camera like the Sony A6300 and that’s something I like. It’s deinfitely one of the best LCD screens I’ve ever used.<br /><br />- AUTOFOCUS -<br />One thing that I’ve been incredibly impressed with on the new 80d is it’s autofocus performance. And to be fair I was a little bit sceptical at first. That’s because the Canon 70d’s dual pixel autofocus was so good. But Canon have seemed to have been able to make it quicker and a little bit more acurate. Especially using the LCD on the back.<br />It's incredibly snappy autofocus and when you pair it up with one of the dedicated Canon lenses it really is impressive. I’ve even used it with my Sigma lenses, and it’s pretty consistent across the board.<br /><br />-VIDEO -<br />Now the Canon 70d was one of the most popular video cameras over the last 2 years and for good reason. It’s dual pixel autofocus system was by far the best around. But it was lacking a few things. Firstly it could only shoot 60 frames per second in 720p. Now I’m not a huge fan of filming in 60p, but i was impressed with it. If you want to see a test video I made in 60frames per second, click the link here to see.<br />I didn’t really expect the dual pixel autofocus to be any better than the 70d but it is. Which is pretty incredible. Being able to quickly pull focus using the touch screen is great and the face tracking works pretty well. It does have problems every now and then if you are wearing a hat or sunglasses though. To be fair, the Canon 80d is still lagging a little bit behind in terms of resolution. There are a lot of cameras that have 4k now and it would have been nice to see it included, but I didn’t expect it to be fair.<br />Although it is still  only 1080p thought the video quality was nice and I’ll definitely be upgrading to the 80d from my 70d for my future videos.<br /><br />- HEADPHONE JACK -<br />One of my favorite new additions to the Canon 80d is a little inclusion on the side here, a headphone jack. This is something so basic that has been missing from a lot of Canon DSLR’s for so long and it’s great to see it in. Being able to really monitor your audio is huge and it’s worth the upgrade in itself.<br />If you’re going to be filming a lot, then the 80d is definitely going to worst the upgrade."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix A900","amazon_reviews":["Very good","Works as advertised and a great pocket companion for my photography when I don't want to log all my equipment around.","I love the features.

It's a little bigger than many point and shoots, but a great alternative to carrying lenses and my full-size DSLR.","More camera than I expected. Comfortable to use and takes great photos.","Reading the reviews here and based on my own experience with the A900, I'd say that the it is not the camera for the more demanding or sophisticated user. I'm not a demanding user or a photo hobbiest. I do mostly nature photography for my own study. I'm not out for National Geographic.  I want a compact, packable camera with some basic manual options, good zoom and good stabilization.<br /><br />I'm only fussy about ease of use, interface design that allows me to adjust for changing conditions quickly. Given the complexity of cameras these days, the layout of this one seems intuitive.  Your intuition may vary.  I tried it against the Sony and Panasonic competing models. I get the sense that the firmware for all of them comes from the same factory.<br /><br />I shoot mostly in P mode, I can quickly adjust exposure compensation which does as much as most of the scene modes, though they can be handy. I think the optical zoom works well, though under some conditions at full zoom (notably low light) you may get some blur. That is not surprising. But under even less than ideal conditions I have found the autofocus adequately fast (is it ever really fast enough?) and the image clear.<br /><br />I can't comment on the movie functions. It works OK,  but I don't use it much.<br /><br />The SnapBridge works transferring to my Sampsung tablet but it's a bit unpredictable and easier just to copy images to the computer.","Been using it for a few weeks now; took it on a few expeditions with exemplary results. The different settings work well; programmable options work as promised, and the scene settings have been very useful. Photos average about 8.7 MB each so be prepared to have an extra memory card if shooting for extended periods of time. 4K video fills up the memory very quickly as well. Positioning the screen has a smooth but sturdy feel to it. Notches on either of the top corners are available for wrist straps or a neck strap.<br />Only real caution is the flash feels a little flimsy; take care while it is extended. Despite that, would definitely recommend.<br /><br />Posted are a few of the photos I have taken so far.","Very good","Works as advertised and a great pocket companion for my photography when I don't want to log all my equipment around.","I love the features.

The lens cover looks a bit flimsy and I'm hoping the camera is sturdy enough to last a long time.","Love this camera with its extreme zoom, professional features and sharing options. It's a little bigger than many point and shoots, but a great alternative to carrying lenses and my full-size DSLR.","More camera than I expected. Comfortable to use and takes great photos.","Reading the reviews here and based on my own experience with the A900, I'd say that the it is not the camera for the more demanding or sophisticated user. I'm not a demanding user or a photo hobbiest. I do mostly nature photography for my own study. I'm not out for National Geographic.  I want a compact, packable camera with some basic manual options, good zoom and good stabilization.<br /><br />I'm only fussy about ease of use, interface design that allows me to adjust for changing conditions quickly. Given the complexity of cameras these days, the layout of this one seems intuitive.  Your intuition may vary.  I tried it against the Sony and Panasonic competing models. I get the sense that the firmware for all of them comes from the same factory.<br /><br />I shoot mostly in P mode, I can quickly adjust exposure compensation which does as much as most of the scene modes, though they can be handy. I think the optical zoom works well, though under some conditions at full zoom (notably low light) you may get some blur. That is not surprising. But under even less than ideal conditions I have found the autofocus adequately fast (is it ever really fast enough?) and the image clear.<br /><br />I can't comment on the movie functions. It works OK,  but I don't use it much.<br /><br />The SnapBridge works transferring to my Sampsung tablet but it's a bit unpredictable and easier just to copy images to the computer.","Been using it for a few weeks now; took it on a few expeditions with exemplary results. The different settings work well; programmable options work as promised, and the scene settings have been very useful. Photos average about 8.7 MB each so be prepared to have an extra memory card if shooting for extended periods of time. 4K video fills up the memory very quickly as well. Positioning the screen has a smooth but sturdy feel to it. Notches on either of the top corners are available for wrist straps or a neck strap.<br />Only real caution is the flash feels a little flimsy; take care while it is extended. Despite that, would definitely recommend.<br /><br />Posted are a few of the photos I have taken so far.","Not gonna lie, I have been an Olympus fan for many years.  But when I dropped my point and shoot Olympus and discovered they didn't make that particular model with the super zoom and features that I wanted, I had to go looking.  I was not happy about having to change camera models because the beauty of the Olympus cameras that I have previously owned, the batteries/chargers/camera cases were all interchangeable, so I could keep on using perfectly good batteries with the new camera.  Long story short, I am thrilled with this Nikon Coolpix - the zoom capability is superior to my previous Olympus cameras, the features are pretty much equivalent to what I was used to and the photos I'm getting are stunning!  This camera was very affordable and the battery charger/batteries are reasonably priced.  The more I learn about the camera functions, the better my photos are - I am a Nikon convert, this is a great little camera!!","This was a gift for my wife who loves it.  Great quality images.  Contains all the features she needs and then some.  Ideal camera for the casual photographer who needs great quality images without a steep learning curve.","This camera is really good.  Pictures are AWESOME!  Wish it had a regular camera strap to put around my neck.  Zoom is INCREDIBLE!!  A titlting screen is super convenient and I always use it.  Look at the zoom and the detail and sharpness!!  Never seen anything like this--- AWESOME!  Oh, and the zoom is held without tripod.","The camera itself is decent, a slight upgrade in picture quality over previous versions but the upload app, SnapBridge, is a NIGHTMARE to use. Why Nikon couldn't just use the much more reliable Wireless Mobile Utility app deployed with previous models is a mystery. SnapBridge adds nothing — except a GPS stamp, which was automatic in previous CoolPix roll-outs. This one requires WiFi and Bluetooth connections and even that fails more than 50% of the time.I hope Nikon finds a better interface.","Perfect camera for travel point and shoot as well as for taking pictures that demand more careful settings.","It was a gift for my wife and she said that she loves the camera.  She's not much of a camera buff but has found that the many cameras functions  are fun easy to use.","I LOVE my new camera.  It is so nice being able to take a picture that is so clear.  I am so in love with this camera","I think too many people here expected this camera to be DSRL quality, which is why they felt disappointed. The main reason I purchased this camera lies in its strong 35x optical zoom and the decent quality pictures it is capable of taking. This camera is the perfect balance for the travel enthusiast; taking far away objects of beautiful scenery in other countries is a joy. It has the ability to record 4K videos, which may make this camera future proof for many years to come. I highly recommend this camera for those who love to travel.","Awesome","This camera takes AMAZING photos. If you are just getting started, I recommend this camera. This camera will upload a photo right to your phone or tablet. You just need to download an app. I read if you have IOS it may take a couple times. I have Android and it works amazingly!  This camera is compact enough to bring with you anywhere.","Took this new camera on a recent trip to PCB. Works great! I read all the reviews before purchasing it. The person(s) who say the zoom doesn't focus doesn't know how to use a camera!!! Obviously, to max full zoom, you need a tripod or set the camera on a steady surface. Duh!<br /><br />Size is great for a large pocket or fanny pack. I bought a special case with wrist loop as I wanted to keep it out of the fine sand and wind.","Been taking photo-video since the late 70's. A few years ago bought a Panasonic GS500 camcorder and since then have bought about 15 Panasonic cameras (have 8 right now).<br /><br />So wanting to upgrade from my Panasonic ZS7 I bought a Panasonic ZS60. Loaded with features but although I got a few nice shots they were few and far between and required almost perfect lighting conditions so I returned it and bought the Nikon A900 (bought an open box deal elsewhere), even after seeing quite a few negative reviews on Amazon (not so bad elsewhere at places where photographers often shop). Youtube, flickr and some review sites convinced me that good photos and video could be had with this.<br /><br />If you want a camera simply for 100% automatic shooting this might not be your best choice, you will often get better output using the \"P\" program mode and especially if you limit the ISO settings which you can't do in fully auto. There isn't anything really complex about this, and maybe they will update the firmware but I have got some stunning video and stills after spending much of 2 days indoors/outdoors and even shooting good 4K video at night, flash shots, etc.<br /><br />I do not use the connectivity options so I can't respond to all the complaints about that but I have seen many, many people having connection issues with different models and suspect it might often be a lack of user knowledge. Can't say, but was able to get paired with a tablet using it's bluetooth pretty easily.<br /><br />People complain about the shake when fully zoomed, this will be the case with probably any long zoom, at least in a small camera. A tripod is really recommended at least for any video but the stabilization when not zoomed far is not bad. I have been able to get fairly crisp stills and video at full zoom, but I don't use that much zoom very often.<br /><br />No one camera can do everything (that is why I have several). This one does not have all the features of the ZS60... viewfinder, touch-screen, etc. but it has other features. One which I find valuable is a button which, when you are zoomed far out composing and you lose the object you were watching if you press the button it zooms you back out so you can relocate and then zooms back to where you were.<br /><br />I've now spent about 2 days testing this and got much more in the way of decent output than with the Z60... which I had about this long and then returned.<br /><br />There are a lot of features to consider but after trying a variety of settings (and I am no newbie) I am very happy with this camera for it's intended purpose.<br /><br />I don't usually upload samples here because they are so downsized as to make them almost worthless but will upload a couple here. The zoo pic(s) were taken in 4K video and then saved as still-frame, which is a great option (I did this using the free VLC Player but could also use video software) since the video is great and then you have both.","Easy to use and carry!","Pictures were way better in Low-light for my kids high school performances than my cell phone cameras, but the audio in my Samsung Note 3 blows the audio in this camera out of the water for the video recordings. If I could have this video with the Note 3 audio, it would be the perfect combination. I'm looking for some kind of audio alternative for the video now. The audio is a much better once you transfer the video to another device. I was really happy to hear the improvement there.

In all honesty you're getting what you paid for.","We just got back from Costa Rica, and I was totally amazed at the quick shots it would take on the move and the zoom on this is just fantastic I was getting closer with better pictures then any camera that I've owned before.  It felt really great to have a good quality camera, it has a great stabilizer on it. For the money this camera is hard to beat","This camera is very good for the price. It takes clear pictures and good in low light. With any digital camera the further out you zoom the less clear the picture becomes. If you want super duper crystal clear pictures then spend the money and buy a better (more expensive) camera or get a tripod. Also if you plan on taking low light pictures without a flash then you should also be using a tripod. I keep a mini poseable tripod with me at all times. I've used this camera in all light settings and haven't been disappointed. I had the s7000 for 2 days before I returned it and got this one. As for SnapBridge, I too was having connection problems. I think I figured it out. Once you're done with transferring your pictures unpair the camera from the SnapBridge app. You'll have to pair every time but it seems to work every time.","I've got to say that my experience with this camera is totally different from most of those listed previously.  I've only been playing with it for a few hours, but have gotten some very nice photos.  First of all, you need to remember that this is a point and shoot camera and not a DSLR.  Limitations with aperture and shutter speeds will necessitate the use of a tripod for long zoom and darker areas, although I've taken some very nice photos hand held.  Under some circumstances it helps to take the camera out of program mode and adjust the focus and exposure metering settings while in program mode.  Utilizing the scene modes is also helpful sometimes.  This camera is quite capable and can actually do quite a lot.  You may need to spend some time reading the manual and experimenting with some photos if you aren't already familiar with photography basics.","Waited long for this camera, Nikon 4K that is a wow factor. But it is disappointing, low light pictures are soft, it is struggling to focus most times in low light, long end focus is extremely bad. The zoom motor sound is loud in the video recording.<br /><br />No need to say, daylight pictures are good, easy to use controls and menu.","I have owned this camera for a week now. I am completely satisfied with the image quality and video quality. I have tried and compared it to a number of \"superzoom\" cameras as well as other compact models. I don't understand the negative reviews. I have had no problems using snapbridge. The zoom is one of the sharpest I have seen in a compact camera. I highly recommend it. It was slightly larger than I expected, but I cannot complain, it is a 35X zoom after all.","Although I didn't buy my Nikon Coolpix A900 from Amazon, I need to give my review here. I love my COOLPIX A900!  I've been looking for a more portable replacement for my Nikon 3200, and a random visit to a camera store resulted in the purchase of my A900.<br /><br />It has the same control / operating model as the 3200, so the learning curve was very short. I love the photos it takes. The Bluetooth link to my iPhone/iPad/Mac is easy to setup and use. I've been very happy with the low-light photography but it really needs a tripod for lowlight.<br /><br />The zoom is very, very powerful.<br /><br />The flip up monitor allows for selfies. It is true that the screen and flash assemblies are a little flimsy when extended, but they are well protected and robust when stowed in the camera body. So be careful when you extend them. Cameras that extend zoom lenses when in use are a little flimsy too, but no one thinks twice about it. When this much power is packed in this small a package, there will be some trade-offs. For me at least, this is a great little camera.","So far so good.  I bought this camera for a better image than I was getting with a samsung camera or my old Nikon D70.  Still Pictures: The images are good and the focusing is fine.  I selected face detection.  Video:  Focusing is fine once you change the default focus option to AF-F for full time focusing, not just the focus of when you press the record button.  If you don't do this and zoom in you may not be in focus.  Already looked at video from 4K 30p on our UHD TV and it is very good.  I zoomed, panned, tracked cars going by zoomed into a flag across the street to fill the screen and everything came out fine.  Not as good as a dedicated video camcorder (Canon HF G30).  But what I will take on our next cruise to get both video and stills, when I don't bring my much bigger video camcorder (only shoots 1080).<br /><br />I like the controls and menu options, my wife will be happy with the green auto.  I will like being able to tailor the shooting to the situation, either through scenes or manual.<br /><br />Other reviews seem a little out of whack.<br /><br />Complaint with Amazon packing on this, it came in a box without bubble wrap or any other cushioning material to stop the camera box from sliding around and banged up."]},{"name":"Fujifilm X-E2S","amazon_reviews":["I love it.","great camera sharp lens","What a great camera.

At first i thought 16mp is low but as a casual photographer I see this is not an issue at all. Can customize all settings and buttons. Love it and definitely would recommend for someone who wants a small yet powerful mirrorless camera.","I hadn’t planned on getting into the Fuji X system, but after handling the X-E2S I was impressed enough to buy one, along with the 18-55mm (May 2016). I’ve since added the 10-24mm, 18-135mm and 50-230mm. I was already using the Nikon D7100 and Olympus M1, but after six months of use the X-E2S is emerging as my favorite of the three.<br /><br />Both EVIL and SLR cameras have advantages, but after getting used to an electronic viewfinder I tend to miss it when using the Nikon. I like being able to review photos and access the menus through a viewfinder adjusted to my eyesight, as well as shoot video while using the viewfinder, especially in bright sunlight when I can barely see the rear screen. I also like seeing the results in the viewfinder when using the exposure compensation dial. Although the M1 is a higher-end camera, I find the viewfinder of the X-E2S brighter and with better clarity than the Olympus.<br /><br />Another feature I especially like on the X-E2S is the option of using the top shutter speed dial or the rear command dial to set shutter speeds. I use both depending on shooting conditions. The configurable Quick Menu and other function buttons make the camera easy to use. The tiny pop-up flash is nice to have for a bit of fill-flash outdoors, but used indoors part of the light is usually blocked by the lens on wider shots.<br /><br />I only shoot RAW, but my editing program, Photoshop CS6, doesn’t support the X-E2S’ RAF files. So I convert the camera’s files to DNG. I’ve also used the included Silkypix software to convert the RAF files to TIFF for editing in Photoshop. Both techniques work equally well. However, a major drawback with the camera is it only shoots in uncompressed RAW, so we have a 16 megapixel camera creating huge 33 MB files. Come on, Fuji, give us a lossless compression option!<br /><br />Another drawback with the X-E2S is its focus tracking, which is inferior compared to my Nikon and Olympus. In fact, when using continuous AF the viewfinder pulses, which I find very annoying. Fortunately the single AF setting focuses very fast and accurately and is fine for the subjects I photograph. But the camera wouldn’t be my first choice for action photography.<br /><br />The camera has two quirks I don’t understand. One is that you can’t shoot RAF files while using the extended ISO speeds, where I would think you’d most want to shoot RAW. The other is that you can only shoot in the square or 16:9 formats in JPG or RAW+JPG, not just RAW. These issues will probably be corrected in a future firmware update, but why do they exist now?<br /><br />Overall, though, I like using the camera and consider Fuji lenses to be among the best I’ve used. At this point I’m considering selling my Nikon and Micro 4/3 gear and expanding my Fuji system with an X-T2 body and a few additional lenses. I like being able to carry the camera and three lenses in a compact bag, such as the Think Tank Retrospective 5 pictured here.","I love it.","great camera sharp lens","What a great camera.

Not too small that it fits in a jacket but a winter parka for sure.<br /><br />The video is very secondary(as it should be imho) but using it with a vine lense gives pretty good results.  Way better than your cell phone (keep the Iso low imo).","My primary camera right now is a Canon 6D backed up by a 7D Mark II, but I wanted to add a smaller camera that I could carry almost all the time and still count on getting good image quality with some level of control (I mostly shoot manual since that's the way I learned way back in the film era).  The obvious route seemed to be to try out one of the mirrorless systems.<br /><br />I first tried an Olympus OM-D E-M10 and I was impressed by this entry level offering and by the line-up of lenses in that system.  I also tried Canon's EOS M3.  The M3's image quality and color beat the Olympus and I decided to keep the M3 despite the lack of a viewfinder and the limited selection of lenses (although Canon sells an adapter that lets you use all of its other lenses, I'd like to see more lenses dedicated to the lighter, smaller mirrorless system).<br /><br />Ultimately, I looked at Fuji and was impressed by the lineup of lenses (not as many as Olympus, but more than Canon and very high quality).  I didn't want to spend a lot of money to get into the Fuji system and the X-E2S was just the right price point combined with an EVF and a great range-finder look that reminded me of my father's Leica (the camera I learned on back in the 60's).<br /><br />Combined with the very light weight 27mm lens this is almost pocket sized.  It's light weight and small enough that I can carry it just about all the time so I've been able to capture photos I would have missed otherwise.  In the recent past I've used my phone, but even though IQ has increased dramatically even the best phone camera can't deliver the same quality as the larger sensors in dedicated digital cameras.<br /><br />Although I still tend to shoot in manual mode, I have experimented some with the \"scene\" modes that the X-E2S offers, as well as the film simulations (which I didn't think I'd use, but which I really like a lot).  The panorama shooting mode has also been fun to play around with.  In manual mode the controls are easy to use and I don't have to take my eye away from the EVF to quickly adjust shutter speed and aperture to get the results I want.  Changing the ISO does require that I go to the menus, but I'm going to experiment with customizing the function buttons to try to streamline that process.<br /><br />The only real criticism I have so far is that shooting in the camera's raw format (RAF) is almost entirely limited to conversion in the camera.  I shoot in raw mode with all my other cameras because of the ability to adjust images with the wide range of software available to photographers today.  So far the only program that I own that works with this camera's raw files is ACDSee's MAC offering and even that doesn't allow much in the way of manipulating the image. I understand that Lightroom and PhotoShop can also work with the RAF files, but I don't own those products. This may be more a criticism of the software industry (and my dogged determination not to use PhotoShop ;)) than the camera, however, and whenever I can work with this camera's raw images in programs like Aftershot, Capture One and DxO Optics Pro I'll revise this review with my experience of how much the raw images can be manipulated.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a great entry level camera in the Fuji system and worth five stars in that category.<br /><br />Update:  After working with this camera a little more I'm even more impressed with the extent to which it can be customized.  I've changed one of the function buttons to provide immediate access to ISO settings and now can change settings as fast if not faster than I can with my Canon 6D.  I continue to be impressed with the IQ that the Fuji lenses and this camera deliver.  It's also just a fun camera to shoot with.  I ran into a photographer for our local newspaper - a very talented photographer who shoots Canon 1D and the best L lenses (see photo).  I had the X-E2S with the 27mm pancake lens and (from a distance) he mistook it for a classic film-based rangefinder.  Loved it!","I've had this camera for 6 months now and can write an intelligent review at this point.  I bought it when it was first introduced and have put it through its paces on two trips to China where I do a fair bit of street photography and studio work while traveling on business.  Like most people, I've transitioned from a DSLR to mirrorless for size & weight considerations. I was traveling with a Pelican case full of lenses and bodies and now I carry a single small Crumpler camera bag with the Fuji X-E2S and a couple small primes plus the kit lens.  So right out of the gate I will give this camera an A+ for size and weight when compared to DSLRs.<br /><br />Transitioning from Nikon to Fuji has been a little bit of a challenge because there are all new menus to memorize.  Arrrgghhh. The only thing that has tripped me up a few times is the electronic shutter.  I go back and forth shooting with a flash (on and off camera) and I keep forgetting you can't use the electronic shutter and shoot with a flash (sync issues).  Now I think I've got it.  The flash sync speed is a little low at 180, but I'm getting use to that too.<br /><br />So far the idiosyncrasies have been minimal and easily overcome. (Like the lens mounts rotate in the opposite direction as Nikon)  The big payoff has been the beautiful image quality.  I bought several lenses to test (14mm, 18mm, 27mm, 18-55mm, 50-230mm).  I've found all of them on sale or as grey market lenses on Ebay, so not a huge investment.  For street photography my go-to lens has been the 14mm (with absolutely NO distortion).  For general walking-around I like the 15-55mm kit lens (it's painful to call this a kit lens because it's so MUCH better than a typical kit lens).  The surprise of the group has been the 50-230mm which I found on sale for an amaizing $199.  It's not a speed demon telephoto, but because I shoot outdoors I've caught some great shots using this cheapie long lens. I'm selling the 18mm because it's gathering dust after I bought the 14mm.  As we all know, image quality is a function of both the lens and the body (sensor), so I've tested this body with several lenses and give it a solid 5 stars.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Image quality<br />- Size & weight<br />- Available lenses are A+ (but wait for them to go on sale.  Be patient)<br />- Excellent low light performance<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I'm never sure where to put my thumb when shooting.  It keeps hitting controls.<br />- Learning new menu controls sucks - but this isn't the camera's fault.<br />- Off-camera flash solutions are limited (trigger systems).  Admittedly this isn't the primary use of this camera for most people.","Great camera. I've gone from a BIG Nikon SLR (D200) to this and couldn't be happier. I'll post a couple of cat pictures as I was using them as test subjects to test out my new toy. Notice the clarity and crisp color. Also, I have the kit lens (for now) and I just love it. The next lens I buy is the 35 mm Prime.","I love this little camera! After my Canon SLR gathered dust for a couple years and I found myself shooting primarily with my phone, I decided I wanted better image quality but a smaller camera. The X-E2S has been so fun. I've had it for a month or so and take it with me everywhere. I am so impressed with the interface and the customizable buttons! Took me a while to adapt from years of Canon \"reflexes\" but now I feel really comfortable w it. The kit lens is super nice, feels like an old school metal lens. I also have the 14mm f2.8, and the 35mm f2.<br /><br />I chose Fujifilm over Sony based purely on the stories of the \"joy of shooting\" it was bringing out of photographers and I have experienced it as well! You can see more of my photos on Instagram @klausphotos, if you're interested!","Very light and easy to use as a travel camera.  Incredible image quality - as good as my Nikon D750.  Excellent for stills but not as good as a DSLR for tracking movement such as sports or wildlife.  Two cameras with two different purposes.","Perfect camera....great capabilities and gives you either control or appropriate automation.  Wish good lens choices would be bundled with camera, and so I bought the body and am adding lenses as I go.<br /><br />The compact size is great....I am old enough to remember the Leicas, Nikon SP, and Canon rangefinders, and this camera feels like them, only with amazing control and functionality.<br /><br />You cannot go wrong with Fujifilm","I bought this camera as an addition to an XT1, XE2 and X100s I use in my wedding and portrait business. Right away I noticed a time lag when the eye sensor switches from the rear LCD to the EVF. Like twice to three times longer than any Fuji camera I'm using. It's enough of a delay to miss shots. I called Fuji and we found out it happens when you switch the rear LCD to display the data and not the shooting image. If you go from the shooting image on the rear LCD to the EVF the lag is diminished. It's probably a firmware bug, but it makes the camera unusable, unless you shoot with the EVF set to always on, which is undesirable. The Fuji tech has alerted Japan, and wants to see this camera back, though he did say over the phone all the XE2S's he had in the office did the same thing.<br /><br />It will be a great camera when/if Fuji addresses this firmware issue.<br /><br />I'm sending it back to AMAZON at Fuji's request and I'm replacing it with another XT1 for this wedding season.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** There is a rumor the most recent Firmware has fixed this issue, so I just ordered another XE2s and will give it a go and report back...<br /><br />***UPDATE 2*** Revised to 4 stars. Seems the firmware may have mitigated the issue somewhat. It now seems a little slower than my X100s to turn on instead of the 1-2 second delay. Not great but I can live with it, and the camera is much more usable.  Really a great bargain and entry point into the Fuji system. IQ is (has always been) GREAT!!","Excellent IQ and handling in a small size.  Paired with the amazing 14mm/2.8 lens, this makes for a wonderful street photography camera.  Out-of-camera JPEGs are surprisingly good.","Amazing image quality in a perfectly sized body. Easy to carry most places, tons of good Fujinon and third party lenses to choose from with the proper adapter. Best camera I've ever owned or used, I love mine and much prefer this over my short-lived X70 experience (a great camera in its own right, but not for me)","Very nice camera, good looking and high quality image. I definitely feel honor to have such a cute camera.","I read tons of reviews on so many different cameras. I finally decided to go with the x-e2s.<br />I wanted a new camera to replace my canon 50d (to big) and canon g16.(low quality)<br />I compared this camera to the Sony 6000a which was similar in price but past disappointments with Sony products pushed me away.<br />I compared to Olympus omd 5II which I really liked. The features were better but the larger price and smaller sensor swayed my mind.<br />My choice was made primarily because of the Larger sensor and price. I didn't want to spend much over $1000<br />I choose mirror less  because I wanted a smaller camera than an slr. I did consider advance point and shoot but to pricey for what you get. (their main advantage is they are pocketable.<br />There was only one big thing I sacrificed in choosing this camera I wanted a tilting lcd.<br />I have had it two days and so far I love it.<br />It looks great.<br />It is a perfect size.<br />All the settings I will need.<br />Menu is easy to use.<br />The pictures I have taken so far are great with no noise at 1600 iso<br />Downside I had to update lightroom 6<br />Update 5-27-16<br />This Camera is so much fun. It is taking me some time to get comfortable with (because I have only used canon cameras).<br />But is such a joy to use. Pictures are beautiful, focus is fast. The lens is perfect, I never need the Flash. (low noise and Lens IS)<br />This is simply a beautiful machine, small, light and does what it is made to do.<br />The one thing I do miss a lot is custom delay timer on canon cameras.","Very nice camera.  I went with the 2s over the 2 just because, I wanted to.  :-)"]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS60 (Lumix DMC-TZ80)","amazon_reviews":["This camera has tons of features.  I am really surprised at all this small camera can do.  It was a replacement for a very expensive mistake when I dropped and damaged my 5 year old Lumix.  I loved that camera, and expect that I will like this one even more considering all the bells and whistles it has!","Excelent Câmera !","I love it but I'm still trying to figure out how to use most of the features, and I haven't had chance to use most of them.","great little camera !","ok","Great camera","Excellent Camera and good seller","This camera has tons of features.

My favorite feature is the 30X zoom.  It is comparable to 10X binoculars in magnification when set to 30X zoom (because the camera starts off at wide angle, it takes 30X to equal 10X).  With the eye piece viewfinder, you can use it like binoculars. (or monocular to be technically correct)<br />Great battery life.  Easily fits in a standard pocket.<br />Nice selection of shooting modes.<br />4.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 inches.","Really excellent quality photos,  I absolutely love the zoom and steady-hand functionality.","I've only taken pictures with it 2 days now.<br />It is small enough to fit in my old point and shoot camera bag,<br />It has a REALLY FAST shutter and save so I don't miss shots waiting after taking the prior shot.<br />I turned on burst mode to try it and had it on H(igh) and just a touch of the button and I'd get 3 pictures ... tried M(edium) and I'd get 2 ... at L(ow) I could still take a single picture, but hold for multiple shots at less than 1 second intervals.  I didn't try SH (super high?) but it seems likely it approaches low frame rate video.<br />I'm loving this so far, but need to really dig into the manual to figure it all out before my big trip to Hawaii in 2017.","It's a great camera.  The trick is it does take some time to review exactly how all the settings work.  After some reading, it gets much easier to use.  There is so much the camera can do it's a bit overwhelming at first but with time, you learn the steps you need to take to get it to work.  I'm very pleased with the camera - I just have to keep reviewing the directions to get the most out of all the capabilities the camera has to offer.","Awesome camera","I will give it a 3stars for now. Box looked like it was opened before.  The LCD screen has smudges. For a brand new camera, I was expecting for the LCD to have a transparent plastic screen protector but there's none. I purchased this as a Christmas present and hopefully this is not a defective camera. The lollipop is a delight. I will upgrade the rating if happy with the camera and not defective.","I am a huge fan of Panasonic Lumix camera's and it was time for an upgrade from my old faithful.  I do wish they would make the back screen larger (I have a Samsung Galaxy 2 Camera with a 4.8\" screen, which is awesome).  Other than that, the camera takes great pictures and is very reliable.  Love the zoom lens and quality of photo's.  I will continue to remain a Panasonic Lumix fan.","Still learning how to use the camera but so far: Takes adequate pictures but design is very poor. Ergonomics and software are poorly done and not very well thought out. Not intuitive or easy to navigate either the mechanical buttons and switches nor the screen menus. e.g. the power switch should be  a slide switch not a push button; the setting of the camera to \"silent mode\" also automatically locks the flash feature in OFF mode with no ability to turn the flash ON. Also,in IA mode doing any menu changes or turning the mode dial automatically resets the zoom to widest view. This requires the resetting of the zoom each time another change is made. Also, the placing of the falsh on the right side where you grip the camera and operate the shutter button.","I like it!","Have used this camera a few times and had a good idea of the pros and cons before I received it.<br /><br />Some of the PROS:<br />Great travel camera that fits in pocket.<br />Zoom range of 24-720mm is incredible.<br />Would rate the IQ about 8/10 on average.  When you go out all the way, expect some slight reduction in resolution.<br />The auto focus is very good with decent lighting.<br />Shoots raw and has manual focus.<br />4K photo option is a big plus for action shots.<br />Battery life is good........go with two charged batteries if you are out for the day.<br /><br />Some of the CONS:<br />Smaller size sensor will reduce quality with noise showing up at plus 400 ISO.  Some decent reduction with noise software.<br />Camera is good when light is good.  Not really for indoors and flash is not great at all.  (I live in Florida so plenty of sun most of the time).<br /><br />My reason for buying included all of the features packed into a small size and will sometimes give me the incentive to leave the DSLR gear at home when I feel like traveling light.  However not a \"real\" substitute for larger sensor DSLR.  Also, price was reduced by $50 the day I purchased it and I had a $100 gift certificate so it wound up costing $297........It was hard to pass up!<br /><br />What the camera offers for its size is the big selling point in my opinion.","I think I will love this camera when I learn to work it properly. I called for tech support and they were helpful; I'm sure I will be calling for more support.  So far the pictures I have taken are very sharp, and I am getting more familiar with it the more I use it.","Panasonic makes fabulous cameras.  They take excellent pictures, are small and easy to use.  I returned the 30x one I purchased though - it would have been my 5th Lumix.  It worked fine.  The colors were vivid. but dark.  I took pictures with my 20x and the 30x of the same objects and made prints on the same printer.  Whites weren't as white and the over all colors were darker.","Had this one month, so far so good. The EVF was the main reason to buy it, quality of that is great. Having the pocket super-zoom is surprisingly useful, works like amazing binoculars for events.<br /><br />Can't push it too far, either ISO or long zoom photos, quality drops pretty dramatically.","I've now had a to work with the camera for almost a month.  I'm really enjoying find out all the things I can do with the camera.<br />Its a great camera for those times where bring my SLR would be too cumbersome.<br />If you are looking for an amazing zoom as well as 4K video and still photo images right from the 4K video,  this is your portable camera.<br />The features I keep coming back to is 4K burst photos and zoom features.  This camera also has a wifi transfer process that really works, and works well.  I find myself post Facebook photos while I'm traveling by using the wifi features of this camera.","Great pictures, ease of use, feels good in your hand. You have to make an effort to shoot a bad picture.","Great camera so far. Lets see how it holds up after time.","General purpose long zoom small camera with raw, what is there not to like","Love it.","Superb camera,","GREAT CAMERA>>>>> PREIOD","Fabulous camera. Used in Kenya. Great zoom and video too","The camera is pretty amazing. Once you get the hang of its numerous features, taking quality pictures day or night is a snap. With a 30x zoom and an amazing set of features, the camera is a versatile tool. I have a telescope that I use for lunar observations, with the right settings, this camera surpassed the capabilities and quality of that telescope. Dropping the resolution of the output image allows one to increase the range of the zoom by 1 to 4 times (720mm to 2936mm), without using the digital zoom. I have yet to test the camera at its maximum range, but I have at 2x (1440mm). I don't know much about cameras, but so far it has out performed any camera that I've ever owned.","I love Panasonic camera's, this one however is the first time I have been disappointed.  Sometimes when you zoom (could be a full zoom) it freezes, you loose the photo and you must pop the battery out and put it back in to get it to work again.  For the price this simply should not happen.  My older Panasonic also had crisper photo's. I still like it but the lens should not freeze in the out position.","I love it and it is everything as advertised!","I bought this camera after a fair amount of research, as a secondary travel camera to a Canon 70D primary. My principal criteria were that it shoot in RAW, have a long telephoto, a electronic view finder (versus just the screen) and be under $500. This research pushed me into this small sensor camera which tends to create noisy pictures unless you limit the ISO setting (which you can do with this camera). The telephoto is quite amazing and respectable for the size. The camera weighs 2.5 ounces more than my Samsung Galaxy 5 cellphone with rubber case. Despite its limitations you get a lot of features and options with this Lumix. You can however use it as a simple point and shoot only but it would be like buying a Ferrari to only drive two blocks to go grocery shopping. I have gone extensively through the manual to learn its features and there is a lot you can do if you take the time to learn how. Many of these features are reached through the elaborate menu which is perhaps not the most intuitive approach. Nonetheless with some effort you can enrich your use of this full featured small sensor camera. It is my first Lumix camera and will know more as I use it for a longer period of time. If only there was a 1\" sensor camera with the same telephoto, features and price point (there is the Lumix LX100K but it does not have the same telephoto lenses or price point). It seems all the camera makers carefully position their new products to fit structurally within their competitive product line.","Best point and shot I have ever had. VERY happy with it 6 moths and counting","What can i say? You cant buy a better camera for the price. I have owned this camera for about 4 months now have taken over 6k photos with it. I have viewed the 4k photos and footage on my my 4k and they absolutely amazing. Some of the photos look a professional took them. The camera is super easy to use. The low light performance of this camera is out of the world compared to other cameras i have owned in the past.  Takes wonderful videos and has great sound, wind does effect it a little but not bad.","Great camera. Good company.","Tons of setting I will probable never use. Picture quality is great and the overall size is great for me...","I'm loving this camera. I got it to take to concerts, for the zoom. My Sony WX300 was on its last legs so I upgraded. I wanted more bells and whistles, and I actually wanted a more substantial camera, size wise. This one is perfect. It still fits in my purse but has a less toy-like feel. I love the EVF, and I love the touch screen. One star off for the rather convoluted menu and really confusing wi-fi.  Picture quality is excellent. Video quality is also fantastic - seriously great- with some fun special effects (stop motion) and the ability to film or shoot in regular and \"effect\" mode (like black and white) simultaneously.<br />Updating my review to add some pictures I took at the Greek Theater.  One shows the entire theater, so you can see how far back I was sitting.  The second is the zoomed shot of the stage that I got from that distance.  First, it was nighttime, and second, the shot is fairly clear for such a distance.  Also adding photos of Ann Wilson in concert at the Wiltern Theater.  This was an indoor venue, so the lighting was difficult, and we were sitting up in the balcony.  Pretty impressive!","Camera delivered on time and works as expected. The Sony HX90V is a very close competitor. My wife and I use one or the other. Both are 5 star P&S cameras.","Bought this to have something smaller and easier to use than our full size camera. It is much larger than we expected and definitely does not fit easily into a pocket. It is also fairly heavy and weighs down your pocket, even if it fits. The quality of the pictures was quite nice and it does have many nice features to it. The size and weight, however, were much more than what we were looking for so we decided not to keep it. The 8 year old Sony CyberShot that we already have is much better for a small, lightweight, portable point-and-shoot camera.","This camera is light and easy to carry on vacation if you do not feel like taking your SLR.  It is easy for me to use as I had a previous Lumix and it is similar, but much improved.","Outstanding camera.  The picture quality is incredible and the camera is very easy to use.  I was about 200 ft from the podium during my sons graduation.  I was able to zoom in and capture a video with my son and his principled zoomed to full screen.  I couldn't believe how clear it was and simple it was to convert some of the scenes to high def photos.  This camera is worth every penny and you can carry it in your pocket or purse.","I wanted to love this camera. I was looking for a camera with zoom for travel photos. I took so many pictures with it over the few weeks I had it, and it takes great video and great photos in bright outdoor sunlight. It takes awful grainy pictures in low light. My iPhone 6 does a better job. I'm not a professional photographer and used the automatic settings most of the time. I just couldn't justify keeping a separate dedicated camera for this price when my phone tends to do just as well or better (except my phone doesn't zoom!).","Could not be happier. This tiny camera is a beast! Really. I have had over 10 cameras over the years and this one is by far the best. I had no idea such a small camera could be so fast and powerful. The image quality and the speed of the processor is superb. Also I was so pleasantly surprised to see how fast and effortlessly you can transfer the photos to your smartphone thought Panasonic app. The best camera I ever bought bar none ! Thanks Pansonic for such an amazing camera.","The zoom is very impressive but I was equally disappointed in the quality of high zoom & mid to close-up shots. I have had for several years, the Lumix 20X model (and the 10X & 12X before that) and have been very pleased with all aspects of that camera. I did side by side comparison shots with both of these cameras and my DMC-ZS20 was at least as good as or better in just about all pictures. The DMC-ZS60 is about twice the price (OK with me if worth it) and getting almost a little too big to be a normal \"pocket camera\". Any zoom much above 20X really requires a tripod (still shot or movies for sure) and the sharpness & clarity at that level really suffers. Also it is sometimes too easy to accidentally turn the camera on or the setting knob will change while putting it in or out of a pocket. I also like the GPS option on my DMC-ZS20 as I do a lot wilderness travels and like to be able to find some really good shots.","A great like travel point and shoot camera! Some things I really loved were:<br /> • Captures 4K-resolution video<br /> • 8-megapixel photos at 30 frames per second<br /> • 30x 24-720mm zoom lens<br /> • Built-in Wi-Fi<br /> • 3\" touchscreen display<br /> • Resolution 4896 x 3672","[[VIDEOID:5dcbe117c31e822857d36986ca03e1ee]]Just a quick note to highlight one of the unexpected features of this camera: taking pictures before you press the shutter.  That's right, you can record images before you click the shutter.  This is the 4K-Pre mode. It's been a breakthrough for me in taking bird pictures. Ordinarily, I spot a bird sitting on a branch, I focus on it, and as soon as I click the shutter it flies away.  I get a photo of an empty branch.  With the 4K-Pre mode, I focus and wait for the bird to make a move.  As soon as it flies away I click the shutter.  I get about fifteen frames of the bird before I've clicked the shutter: some of the best bird images I've shot, because on takeoff the birds really extend themselves and you can see their effort and technique frame by frame.  It's almost magical.<br />I've owned the ZS camera series off and on since the ZS-3 (still a good camera) but this one is on a new level. I might post a more extended review when I've taken a trip with it and shot a few thousand images. Just wanted to highlight this amazing capability.<br />P.S. This model also meets one of my long term wish list items: time lapse.  I'm attaching a short video of a sunflower in a vase recovering after being left dry overnight.","I have had my Lumix DMC-ZS60 for approximately a month, and right now I don't want to go anywhere without it. I am still learning all the ins and outs, but the learning curve is an easy one and it's so much fun to see the memories that are captured quickly, easily - and beautifully! The quality of my pictures has improved because of the ease of use of this camera. It's perfect for my lifestyle, that of a parent, a traveler, and a memory keeper. I received the ZS360 from Panasonic for review purposes, and I can recommend it wholeheartedly for those amateur photographers who want to see their pictures go to the next level - without tedious lessons or numerous lenses!","I'm still learning about all the bells and whistles on this camera, but what I did learn only took me about ten minutes. It's really user-friendly and pretty intuitive, which is not generally the case with cameras for me! I really love the dial allowing you to manually change the ISO -- I always struggled with lighting and never made the jump to a DSLR. This point and shoot is like the best of both worlds -- clear, crisp images, 4K abilities, and zero bulk!<br /><br />The battery is also a big selling point for me. Recharging is SO much nicer than being mid-shoot when you see the dreaded \"low battery\" icon blinking and you've got zero access to Lithium AA batteries! I have the travel kit which is really helpful, too.<br /><br />The 4K capabilities are nothing short of amazing. We have two kids that refuse to look at the camera in unison. Absolutely a nightmare for family photos -- now, we get winning shots where everyone is looking!<br /><br />Perhaps one of the neatest features, tagging on to the 4K magic is that you can control the camera with your cell phone! It's Wi-fi enabled, so once you set up that feature and get the free, easy Panasonic app, you open up a whole other set of fun features that make life a little easier!<br /><br />I'm super SUPER low tech and this camera has been easy for me to use and I'm loving it. It's high quality in-hand and I have several other Panasonic electronics that I am very happy with, so this felt like go-to choice. I'd absolutely recommend this camera to those in the marker for an upgrade to the traditional point and shoot OR a smaller camera that can perform like their bulkier DSLR.","As a travel writer I rely on photos to convey what my words cannot. I LOVE this camera. The different settings allow me to take optimal pics of everything from food to scenery to moving children. As a mother I cannot recommend this camera enough. Have you ever tried to take a picture of 3 kids? You'll end up with 100 pictures and in 3 of them maybe they all have a good face at the same time. Luckily the shutter speed on the LUMIX is great and with the wireless connectivity I can load the pics onto my iPad and scroll through them quickly to see if I got the shot. Which is way better than the year that I didn't realize until after that in the \"good\" picture of all 3 kids my 10 year old had put a Christmas tree light bulb up his nose.<br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","Best part of this camera is you can use it as a point and shoot (which I do most of the time), play around with the fun scene and artisitc features or use the manual settings. My son loves the 4K video. At first I wasn't sold on the 4K photos - I just don't need that many photos to go through, but now I'm a little excited to try it for my son's lacrosse games this summer. Seems like a great way to get the perfect sports shot, especially for a real amateur photographer like me, and it's got a great zoom so I can be on the sidelines, but still get in close. The WiFi connectivity is nice so I can send the better shots to my phone to upload to instagram or social media - that process can be a little clunky though and you have to make sure you have a good connection or it will drop. It takes a bit of patience to do the first few times, but does make it easier to just carry one device instead of trying to manage multiple devices. I still need to play around with it more to really understand all the features, but so far, so good. I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","The past few years, I've been taking photos exclusively on my smartphone or on a DSLR. Since I'm a mom of two young kids, I often find the DSLR is just too big to juggle with the little ones but the smartphone just doesn't get the photo job done right, especially at night. A point-and-shoot was long overdue. The Panasonic ZS60 was the perfect solution to both problems. Night photos are gorgeous and some of the special filters (like the star filter) make night photography really fun. I love the 4K pre-burst option that allows you to take 2 seconds of video and then select the best still from all the frames delivered - so nice for something in motion (like a kid!). And I especially love that I can sync photos to my smartphone via wifi and then share on social media on-the-go from my phone. Some of the menus could be more intuitive and that is my only reason for deducting a star (and really, I'd call this a 4 1/2 star product). Newbies to photography will need to spend some time with the manual but anyone who knows how to work a DSLR can jump right in with the features available with little learning curve. Disclosure: I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","I take this camera everywhere now!  I have never had a camera a wanted to stick in my pocket before.  It is compact and light weight.  I also love how the shutter protects the lens.  There are so many settings including video that are easy to use.  I have never used a camera I wanted to change setting and features before because it was so hard this camera is a breeze. Even I can figure it all out.  All my pictures come out great and making adjustments is easy.  The WIFI is one of my favorite features.  I can download one picture or a batch.  You can also send right to social media or other on line sources. Needless to say it is always with me.  Even at breakfast!<br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","I received a ZS-60 for review purposes,and I love it. I still am learning my way around the camera (it has some fairly complex features) so I was very glad that it still has an auto setting. The auto setting and the super zoom allowed me to get some great shots of my son's college graduation ceremony, even in dim light from my nose bleed seat in the balcony.","The compact size, photo quality and 30x optical zoom make this camera a perfect option to carry on a regular basis so as to not miss those important shots that my phone camera just wouldn't do justice. I take a ton of photos at kids' activities, soccer games, concerts, the beach, and while traveling and the ZS60 has done a great job of making sure I don't miss a moment. I have a previous version as well (ZS40) that has been my go-to camera but this one has a few features that make me love it even more. I love that it automatically switches between viewfinder and LCD screen without my having to do anything other than raise or lower the camera to my face. The touchscreen allows you to adjust the focus easily to make sure everything you want in focus is crisp and clear. The various scene modes allow for quick and easy shots but the more in depth controls (aperature and shutter priority modes, program mode, manual mode) allow you more control if you prefer. I haven't used the 4K modes yet but am looking forward to exploring everything else that this camera has to offer. So far, I think it's a terrific improvement of an already superb design.<br /><br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","This is the perfect camera to slip in your purse & take everywhere with you.  I don't want a camera that is overly complicated and hard to automatically take good shots as I don't take the time to make setting adjustments before taking pictures.  I like that I can keep the camera and it will read the conditions to adjust to make the great shot. The zoom is terrific, the auto focus is easy to use, it has a touch-interface on the screen to quickly get to the menu in the camera.  But my favorite feature is the wifi capabilities - within minutes I can upload photos to my iPhone to post them on social networks.  This camera takes much better pictures than my iPhone so it's nice to be able to upload them easily.","This camera made me into a fantastic photographer! I adore the wifi enabled sharing, it is easy and fast! The zoom is phenomal and produces crisp clear pictures even from some distance away! I can customize my pictures with filters automatically on my camera. I highly recommend this camera!<br /><br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","I'm a fan of Panasonic Lumix cameras. I had the previous model the ZS40 and absolutely loved it. I like this one too, I've just not found it as easy to use all the features straight out of the box. I have a Canon Rebel T3i that I normally travel with, but it gets heavy and I get tired of lugging it around, hence the need for a point and shoot. I've only had my camera for a few weeks so I've not had time to learn the ins and outs, but here are a few things that immediately come to mind.<br /><br />I love the that the ZS60 has an amazing zoom. It's crazy how far this camera can zoom and remain clear. I've attached photos to demonstrate what I'm talking about. That feature alone has prompted several of my friends to add the ZS60 to their wish lists.<br /><br />This camera is fast. With 4k photo taking and video capability, it takes great action shots and can capture those hard to shoot moments.<br /><br />The camera has built in wi-fi which means you can take a photo, use the Panasonic Image App to transfer photos to your phone, and upload them to your favorite social media channels quickly and easily.<br /><br />The camera is affordable. No need to spend thousands on the camera and extra lenses- this is a great camera for someone interested in photography, as the features will allow it to grow with you as you learn more. On the other hand, it's a great camera for those not interested in photography that just want to capture life moments with their family, at home or own the road.<br /><br />I already touched on what I don't like so far. The camera has so many features and settings that it's difficult to learn my way around. It will take a bit of time for me to fully explore and understand everything this camera is capable of.  Would I recommend this camera? Absolutely. If you're in the market for a point and shoot, this is a great camera.<br /><br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA.

I normally shoot with a dslr, but didn't want to carry that around on our recent family vacation to Disney. Love that this camera is compact, yet the zoom it packs is amazing. As a dslr user the manual actions are a bit hard to access, but the huge plus for this limit are the shortcut actions you can program for a back toggle button and the front lens. You can program them to adjust some basic manual settings like ISO or aperture. Plus I love the 4K video - making memories with my kids that will still look good when they're grown!

I like the easy settings which gives a variety of options for post imaging processing effects. The 4k video is great quality and easy to use. The image quality is so much better than what I'm used to with my iphone 6.

My favorite features are the 30X zoom, which is INSANE, and the 4K video to camera feature that takes 60 shots over 2 seconds. It’s great for live action like catching my daughter close up from the back row of the school gym for her violin concert. The shots are as clear as if I were 10 feet away.<br /><br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation.

The perfect camera for on the go high quality photography. The zoom on this is fantastic and I love the ability to download images to my phone or computer via wi-fi. The only complaint (and it's my fault) is that it almost has too many features. There's a 4K burst mode and video, but I am still trying to learn everything about these things. Baby steps. I'm sure I will love everything once I figure out how it all works because the action and still shots I have taken are crisp and beautiful.<br /><br />Although I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA and received product samples as part of my participation, all opinions are my own","I love having this as a go-to camera in my purse when I can't carry my big heavy Canon DSLR with me, and I love that when I travel, I give my neck a day off and use this great little camera.

All opinions are my own.","I love this camera. As someone who travels frequently and writes a travel column this is the perfect camera. It is small and has all of the features of a DSLR. The zoom is amazing and is clear as crystal up to 30x.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this camera as a member of TravelingMom Network. All opinions are my own","I love this camera it takes killer photos. The touch screen works well. Overall it's simple to use. It takes great action shots.","For the type of camera this is, I'd give it a 4.75 for convenience, size and features.  I take of .25 for the fact that they changed stuff from the last model and now I have to relearn how to use it.<br /><br />I have an expensive SLR and never used if after I got the ZS40 a few years ago. It does everything it needs to an fits conveniently into a pocket or small bag.  I can't tell you how many times me or my husband left our camera bag places when we travel.<br /><br />This one has more features, which can be good and bad because now there are some things I must learn.  There is a bit of a learning curve.  Although I use my iphone a lot for convenience, if I want to take a special photo, I use this camera.  There is so much control that you have over the image while you are taking the photo rather than in post-editing software.  For action shots and night photography, phone cameras do not hold a candle.  I use this camera when I travel especially because that is when I want the best photos.  I wish I'd had it during my honeymoon in Greece where a perfect shot was ruined by backlight from the sun.<br /><br />Improvements from the last model is the touch screen aspects, it makes getting around the camera much easier because we touch screen everything these days.<br /><br />What I love most about it though is the wifi feature.  I love posting photos immediately on Instagram and the wifi feature allows me to easily transfer photos to my phone so I don't have to hook my camera up to my laptop to transfer photos.<br /><br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","We love this point & shoot camera for both kids & adults!  It's so light-weight and fits in your perfect -- great for a traveling family like ours.  The Zoom is AWESOME!  Gets you so close to your subject which is perfect for nature and wildlife shots.  Plus it has a great grip and fits easily in the hands of a kid so we can change who's taking photos on our outings without having to monitor how the kids hold the camera.  And the super cool 4K Photo Function let's you pull an 8-megapixel photo from a video you record!  Our kids also quickly found the photo editing features that are built in and the interactive touch screen is nice and large and allows you to manage various functions without messing with dials and buttons.  Great camera!  I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","For years, I lugged around a Nikon DSLR with extra lens, breaking up with it completely when introduced to the Panasonic DMC-ZS40. I was stoked to try out the new and improved. It’s so easy that even Grandma can use it! Okay, perhaps I’m a little more camera techy than many grandparents, but the DMC-ZS60 was so similar to my ZS40 that the learning curve was small. I couldn’t help but compare it to my previous ZS40 model, and in this case, spending a couple of years shooting pictures with that camera brought me up to speed much more quickly on this newer version. I picked up the fully charged camera, turned it on and was able to quickly run through the possible built-in features on the camera.<br />As a grandparent (and parent), the most difficult photo to capture are those action shots of my grandchildren playing sports or doing what kids do — active things!  There are so many built-in scene settings, including the Clear Sports Shot, and they are easy to scroll through to select (either by touching the screen or selecting the menu button).  Can you tell how much I love this camera?<br />Although I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA and received product samples as part of my participation, all opinions are my own","I love this camera.  I am still learning how to use it and working my way thru the manually.  But the pictures I have taken so far have been beautiful.  I especially like it size and weight.","Described as a semi-professional photographer, I can shoot anything and I have over the years; portraits, products, concerts, landscapes and lots of candids with kids. The secret to a good photograph is knowing how to shoot a good photo, not the expensive equipment.<br /><br />I have a DSRL and I use my iPhone a lot too. So how did the LUMIX DMC-ZS60 compare.<br /><br />Hits of the Lumix DMC-ZS60<br /><br />The size. Fits in a pocket or small purse.<br />The functionality of a DSLR, like the manual adjustment of aperture, shutter-speed, zoom and focus.<br />A 30x Zoom with a manual ring that can be used with your shooting finger.<br />Built-in Optical Image Stabilizer to combat hand-held image blur.<br />Level shot function because crooked images are annoying. This is one of my favorite features.<br />Wi Fi feature for sharing across your social channels.<br />Touch screen supports several gestures, like touch, drag, pinch and spread.<br />4K Ultra HD video recording and on-camera cropping.<br />Post-focus to record bursts of photos.<br /><br />Misses of the Lumix DMC-ZS60<br /><br />Tiny buttons are hard to see.<br />The LCD screen is smaller than an iPhone.<br />The touch screen is great until you touch it by accident.<br />To use the advanced features, you need to understand photography and read the manual.<br />Lacks clear and intuitive icons.<br />A cluttered display screen.<br />The manual functions are hard to adjust in the middle of a shot.<br /><br />After a few weeks, how does the LUMIX DMC-ZS60 fit into my workflow? I use it when I need a good shot and I can't pack my bigger and heavier DSLR. I use it when the light is low or when I need to zoom in on my subject, replacing my smart phone.<br /><br />I love the size of the LUMIX DMC-ZS60 especially for all its functionality. It's a great addition to my camera family and I didn't know I needed it until I found myself using it more and more. I can even hand it off to my kids.<br /><br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","Bye bye SLR-you're going back in the clunky bag. In its place will be the Lumix ZS60. Haven't mastered the 4k yet. But I love the built in wifi so I can immediately move photos to my smartphone and then upload them to social media! And I'm digging the LCD screen on the back-just tap the screen to move back or see what you're shooting instead of limiting yourself through the viewfinder's teeny tiny space. The burst feature helps you catch those usually missed moments. All in all, a solid point and shoot that will make my photography much easier.","I didn't think I needed a point and shoot camera...until I got this one. When I compare the photos my cell phone takes to the ones this camera takes, it is amazing. On a recent family vacation I saw the big difference a \"real\" camera can make. I love that it is easy to use and light. It is professional-like (so I'm told) without being too fussy.<br /><br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","I've been using the camera for about a month and really like it. It's a great point and shoot and easy to throw in a purse or small bag. The Wi-Fi is great and I love how quick it is to send photos over. Also really like the zoom. I would definitely recommend getting a second battery if you plan on using the wi-fi or 4K a lot.

I think that's good.<br />e) It's a welcome supplement to my smartphone's camera, and my smartphone has a good camera.<br />f) It shoots excellent video (youtu.be/0hdDujLmLBU).<br /><br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","I love this camera for its ability to shoot clear, vibrant photos at night...I shoot lots of video, too, and this is as good as the much more expensive professional video cameras that I've used for my job in television.  My only complaint is the sound when recording video--but that's my own fault for not looking at whether I could connect a microphone to it (you can't as far as I can tell). In the case where I was shooting, there was a great deal of wind, so that played a role. Beyond that, though, this camera is incredible for taking quality photos that I otherwise would only get with my much heavier camera (which I don't want to lug around with me when I'm on the go...).","I love my new LUMIX ZS60 camera by Panasonic. My iphone is convenient but quality of the photos isn't as good as I'd like. My big DSLR is great for quality but who wants to lug that around while you're out having fun on vacation! The ZS60 is the perfect combination of both small size and great quality. Plus with the wifi connection, I can send them easily to my iphone for quick sharing on social media!

It's features are impressive and include a customizable ring to easily add light to your photos, built-in wifi for adding images to your smartphone, and fun filters to enhance photos before downloading to edit. It also has $K shooting capabilities which is impressive.<br /><br />A great camera for traveling and small enough to throw in your purse or pocket.<br /><br />I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.","It's been a lot of years since I bought another digital camera. So I was impressed with the reviews of the Panasonic ZS60 and bought one. It is everything I could have hoped for. It has so many features that I'm having a hard time learning them all. So far I'm shooting in the simple, automatic mode and the pictures are beautiful. The zoom is so powerful it's amazing.","I've had the ZS60 for a few weeks now.  It's now been on couple of trips.  I needed a pocket camera for stills to go where I didn't want to drag my much larger Panasonic Lumix GH-4 and my collection of MFT lenses.<br /><br />As others have mentioned this camera has a viewfinder.  This means that one can work in bright sunlight.  The viewfinder is flush with the camera, so if I use my left eye I end up with my nose squeezed against the camera, but it is tolerable.  The viewfinder is nice and bright and, if you find where to turn it on (it's one of the on-screen function buttons), it has a very useful artificial horizon (like the GH-4.)  As with other viewfinders you may need to turn the adjustment to match your eyes.<br /><br />The touch screen works OK - my main difficulty is that the touch spots are a bit small.<br /><br />I used to be a Canon fan - I've used film and digital Canon SLRs for decades.  And I've had several of the upper-tier Canon Powershots.  The ZS60 does what the much larger Powershots did, except that the zoom range isn't as large.  And the trade off is a much smaller camera with a viewfinder (Canon dropped the viewfinder from the Powershots a generation or two ago.)<br /><br />I've found the auto-focus to work well - although I tend to be a manual focus kind of person (so I have the \"peaking\" feature enabled.)  I like that it has a real ring around the lens that can be used for manual focus.<br /><br />I saw the comments about how the ZS60 has resolution issues at full zoom or in very dim light.  My answer to that is this: The ZS60 is a pocket camera!  It would be unreasonable to expect this little thing to perform as well as a full-size or micro-four-thirds sensor camera with a suite of fast lenses at 10x (or more) the price.<br /><br />I haven't used the flash much yet, but I do see how one can end up covering the flash with a finger.<br /><br />Some other observations about the ZS60 are these:<br /><br />  - I am impressed with the auto-macro focus abilities of the lens.<br /><br />  - Silent mode also turns off the flash.  I would prefer that the two settings be separate.<br /><br />  - In the automatic plus mode I wonder why they put white-balance in two positions on the selector ring and exposure bias in only one.  I tend to deal with exposure issues a lot more than I do with white balance issues.<br /><br />  - There are some mysterious beeps of exposure or auto-focus complaint sometimes on the first shot in living-room lighting conditions.  These clear up after a few seconds but they are annoying.  I suspect that this is a firmware issue - I have not yet gone through a firmware update.<br /><br /> - It would be nice if I could tune down the after-shot review to maybe 250ms - For my style of shooting, zero milliseconds is too short and one second is too long.<br /><br />  - When attached to USB to download to a computer I wish that the lens protector didn't retract and the lens extend.  (I'm kind of hyper protective about lenses.)<br /><br />  - It would be nice if there were a lens cap to protect the lens protector.  The lens protection blades look fragile and when the camera is in a shirt pocket I'd like to protect them from branches and other things without having to put the camera into a padded bag.<br /><br /> - I wish that the markings on the buttons were a tad larger so that I didn't so often need to put on my glasses to read 'em as I am getting to know the controls.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice pocket camera.  Under reasonable lighting conditions and distances it can cover a lot of the same ground as a larger mirrorless DSLR for both stills and video.  But being a pocket camera, Panasonic had to make a lot of compromises.  I think they did a pretty good job.","This is my fourth Lumix camera and love this point and shoot.  It focuses quickly and captures photo SO quickly without any special settings. It is great for the average person that wants to take amazing pics without spending a fortune.  My favorite feature is the 4K video because I get that perfect shot as a still capture from it each and every time.<br /><br />(I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.)","Getting close to the ideal compromise between a P&S and DSLR. Small enough to fit in my pocket, but has an electronic viewfinder which overcomes the biggest drawback of the P&S, the inability to see what I'm shooting when bright light washed out the display.<br /><br />The ZS60 works just as good as my Canon T2, in about 98% of situations. The exception being low light/long exposure. The autofocus is quick and exposure control works very well even on bright saturated subjects.","My friend has the DMC-ZS50 and everyone is envious of his beautiful pictures. I waited till the 60 came out before ordering. I don't see much difference between the two but like to rub it in that mine is the 'upgraded' camera (his pictures are still much better than mine as he has more experience). I have a big Nikon but wanted a small point and shoot that would take better pictures than my iPhone.  I LOVE this camera for what it is and I'm having fun trying all the fun features. It's also convenient downloading pics from the camera to the iPhone for easy sharing.","This would get a solid 5 stars if they would make it waterproof & rugged as well, but really one of the best cameras I have ever had and I go through cameras a lot because I enjoy it.","Great camera for travel and hiking! The first ultra-zoom camera I've found that<br />collapses into a true shirt-pocket size. Granted, the pics aren't up to interchangeable<br />SLR standards, but I'll take a slight degradation in quality for the convenience of<br />use. I can always carry the bigger camera for special events/places...Camera is<br />very easy to use, menus are straightforward, and the EVF is a wonderful feature<br />when you are taking pictures outdoors on bright days. And as several reviews have<br />noted, holding the viewfinder to your face gives an additional steadying effect when<br />using long zoom ranges.","It has been years since I owned a compact camera. (My last few have been DSLR or the similar \"bridge\" models). With the small layout, this camera doesn't feel very ergonomic. It took about 6 tries for me to correctly enter the date and time. But I think simply using it enough to get used to the size will help a lot.<br /><br />Picture quality is good. A little too much contrast and the JPEG could be a little clearer. \"Freeze Animal Motion\" and \"Clear Sports Shot\" didn't quite live up to my expectations either. But when I consider all the fun new features packed into this camera along with the price, I can't complain much.<br /><br />Setting things up to control the camera with my smart phone was easy. (Learning how to use the controls was a little harder, but still only took a few minutes.) Trying out the different scenes was fun :-) I am going to get some BEAUTIFUL shots of my garden this spring!<br /><br />I will have to invest in some brighter lights if I want to use this camera for indoor product photography. My previous Canon PowerShot SX50 HS did much better in less-than-optimal lighting conditions.","Very pleased so far. Very powerful built-in flash. Very sharp photos. Very small size.","So far after checking to make sure everything works as described.... this is an amazing point and shoot camera.<br />bought this to compliment my main camera canon 70D. I needed a smaller camera to fit in pocket or the bag I carry main camera in... this works perfect.... bought this also for the 4K capability and the post focus ability and it all works fine in this small compact camera... I have the lumix dmc-zs7 and it took good pictures and video... but the sharpness is way better on this new camera... I am still messing around on this, so I have not used this in a real scenario scene, only for testing in house and outside, and I am impressed with video and picture quality in such a small camera... zoom works great and better than all other point and shoot cameras I have used, but I would not zoom in on subjects to max, sharpness gets very dull and cloudy.... now with my camera, changing focus points in post focus was a little hard to figure out, but once you figure this, I love this feature, and you won't find this in any camera or phone that I know of. Now the flash mode on and off was a little difficult to figure out on my camera, because you can't use flash in 4Kburst or in post focus modes.<br /><br />There are many many functions on this camera I have not yet played with, like changing picture scenes, expressive, monochrome, high key etc, for giving your pictures even more style... I also love taking video in 4k and freezing frames in action and using that pic to print off.<br />I am getting a charger and a couple more batteries for this, because you do drain the battery quick when in 4K bursts and using post focusing modes... also it's good to have a strong good SD card, I use the sandisk extreme pro speed class 3, 10.<br />It's still early to see if this camera holds out long because it just came out, but I highly recommend this."]},{"name":"DxO One (2016)","amazon_reviews":["I've had the unit about a week now, the quality of the images are incredible for such a small camera plus easy to use and easy to carry.

It is easy to use and the quality of photos are exceptionally great.<br />I strongly recommend to have one beside your phone and enjoy the experience of using DxO ONE camera","Eventhough I had bad times with this camera, when it did not work properly or was stuck, I would never give it back. It is small, it has an excellent image quality. I used it often to take pictures for work (content management). This way I had not to take me heavy gear with me, just if the possiblities were not sufficiant. Which was rarely the case. Most of all I love that the DxO keeps innovating the camera. With each new version of the firmware owners gain new functions, such as the little viewfinder that lets you take pictures without the iPhone (perfect for street photography) or the wireless connection (also perfect for street photography and, in combination with the outdoorshell, nice and a relatively cheap option for underwater photography).<br /><br />Obwohl mich die Kamera auch schon geärgert hat, weil sie nicht richtig funktionierte oder abstürzte, würde ich sie nie zurück geben. Sie ist klein, immer dabei und macht Bilder von einer sehr hohen Qualität. Ich habe sie beruflich (Content Management) oft eingesetzt, da ich erst meine schwere Ausrüstung mitschleppen musste, wenn die Bildqualität nicht stimmte. Das war selten der Fall.<br />Am meisten schätze ich, dass DxO die Funktionalität der Kamera laufend weiterentwickelt. Mit jeder neuen Version der Firmware bekommt sie neue Funktionen. Ein Beispiel ist der kleine Sucher auf dem Bildschirm, der über ein Firmwareupdate hinzu kam (perfekt für Street Photography). Ein anderes Beispiel ist die Möglichkeit, neu eine WLan-Verbindung zwischen iPhone und DxO One Kamera aufzubauen (ebenfalls perfekt für Street Photography). In Kombination mit der Outdoor Shell hat man so ein relativ preiswertes Setting für Unterwasserfotografie.","Have had this for over a year now and must say it is one of my everyday carry items.  It has not gone one single day without being in my pocket (besides being out of my pocket for taking pictures - duh!).  This not only takes amazing, beautiful pictures, it is a great conversation starter as well.  Every single time I pull it out and attach it to my phone, I get numerous people asking me about it.  When I show them some of my photos I've taken with it in the pasts, they are completely blown away.<br /><br />This camera has several preconfigured modes, similar to a DSLR camera - it allows you to use in automatic mode or you can take full control and manually control shutter speed, ISO, aperture, etc.  The quality of the photos I have taken with this amazes me every day.  From the amazing bokeh effect with it's amazing focal length, to playing with shutter speeds up to 30 seconds (tripod highly recommended!).<br /><br />Only drawbacks it has is that it is a prime lens (digital focus only) and that it collects lint from being in my pocket Every. Single. Day!  This causes me to have to clean it pretty regularly.<br /><br />In all, it truly is one of my favorite things.","This has transformed much of my photography.  I can carry around with me a very high quality camera with many of the attributes of my big DSLR. The image quality is extremely good, the controls available (aperture, shutter speed etc...) and the RAW options mean that for my normal, everyday photography I've a powerful device which I'm delighted with.<br />On occasions, it would be helpful if the battery life were a little longer but since my everyday backpack has a powerpack in it for the phone (ipad etc..) that's never been a problem in practice.<br />When combined with DxO's impressive software, this camera has been a step change and my big DSLR usage has reduced.<br />I warmly recommend this.","The DxO One camera creates excellent, sharp photos in a small package that is allowed inside the White House tours by the United States Secret Service. Larger cameras are not allowed any longer.<br /><br />Having been one of the pre-sale customers, the free software really helped clean up raw images automatically. I am not a professional photographer and do not have a steady hand, but the DxO software really helped clean up my images. I even took a photo of an aircraft jet engine flaming in a pitch black night...really remarkable for a little pocket camera.<br /><br />The tiny sensor chip really does a remarkable job with the lens and makes taking great photos easier without the weight of a DSLR camera. I took this handy camera traveling to tour a manufacturing plant for building our new house and the pictures were great! I bought an external battery for the camera, but have not had to use it yet.","I purchased this camera as soon as it was released. The ease of use and picture quality make using the camera so much fun. The best part of the camera, is DXO support. Since I had this, they have added so many features and enhancements it's like I have purchased two or three. I highly recommend this to any photo hobbyist.","I bought the DxO one last summer because I wanted to improve my iPhone/iPad pictures. I had been watching all the available videos for months to really understand if the high price was justified by the quality of this camera and, once arrived and tested, and I must say Yes, it is! It's a beautiful camera offering high-standard features, it works both automatically and in manual mode, it allows a personal composition of the picture, it offers RAW and SUPERAW, storage both on the iPhone and on a micro SD card, as well as the possibility to instantly share your pictures. I am not a professional photographer, but my DxO one pictures are amazing, even if I shoot in automatic mode. The light captured is always perfect, the colours extremely realistic and the scene comes to life. iPhone and iPad already take beautiful shots but, believe me, the ones taken with the DxO one are far more beautiful. Not to talk about night pictures: these are a totally new world with the DxO one! iPhone and especially iPad night pictures are disappointing, full of noise and, at times, not true-to-life. This does not happen with the DxO, even if you use it with an iPad which has no flash, and this really makes the difference! My iPad night shots are incredibly bright, with vivid colours and a perfect definition. The only thing I wish were added is a wide range of accessories, like different lenses and the possibility of a zoom. So, I definitely suggest the purchase of this camera.","Won't be long about this : If you want a camera with DLSR quality that fits in your pocket , this is it !! Just great","Extraordinary little camera. I was dubious at first but it produces photos and videos with amazing quality and I confess that i pick this up more often than my DSLR camera these days! Hope to see an improved battery life on the next model and also a small finger strap. Have dropped this twice as can be a little fiddly to fix into the phone especially in cold conditions. Expensive to have to replace.<br />I LOVE IT, the best camera is the one you always carry with you.","Love it but having a bit of trouble shooting steady.  I have put it on sport and that has helped...is there anything else I can do?  This review was meant to be here not the addapter.","Phenomenal little piece of tech! Takes fantastic photos, has a super raw mode that allows noiseless images at 14000 ISO (160mb files though!). The 1\" Sensor and 20 megapixels allow for great noiseless images with great bokeh even in low light. The camera is lightweight and compact as well. If you're looking to advance your cellphone photography this is the best thing for it.","This camera is nothing short of amazing! A few years ago purchased a very nice Nikon camera, but rarely used it because all the settings confused me. This one is extremely user friendly, and takes very high quality pictures. I also love that for traveling, it's tiny. The times I did use my old camera it would be on vacation and I would always have it in my carry-on because I was scared of it getting stolen from my suitcase. The DxO fits right into my purse!","If you actually just think of your iPhone as a big view finder and use the DXO as the incredible camera that it is, it's quite amazing.. And a lot of fun to have such high quality packed into a pocket-sized camera! Even blowing up my quick snap shots of my daughter, I can't believe how good they look! A real sense and all the DSLR options.","I picked one up at The Grove yesterday, so my experience thus far is limited, though I've been shooting pictures pretty much since I bought it. So far, I'm very pleased with the camera; the manual control features are exceptional and the whole thing is very intuitive. I've seen a lot of battery life complaints, but I have seen acceptable battery life thus far.<br />To really sum up my thoughts without going on a tirade, it's a high quality piece of hardware that really, really needs to be used with an iOS device to be useful. Yes, you can take pictures standalone, but it's really shooting blind. You have a pretty basic viewfinder that does give you some information, but you never know for sure what you're going to get. Also, the only useful way to use this in a standalone configuration is in auto, but I find this, like most non-smartphone cameras, is really not getting the best results. I would say out of the 200+ photos I have taken, only a few came out acceptably in auto mode. It will save your settings from your phone, but that's useless, really. I've never found myself in a situation where I can use the same settings with more than one picture, and there's no way to change the manual settings in standalone mode. I think for this to be justifiable, this really needs to be fully usable (even with the 8-bit like viewfinder) without a smartphone. My main concern is what will happen when (not if) the lightning port is discontinued, or what will happen if DxO stops supporting the product. For the price, you can get a point and shoot with indefinite service life; the One has a potentially limited lifespan.","First and foremost, the DxO One does produce high quality photos; no question about that.  But if I'm being honest, this is just a very high quality \"point and shoot\" camera that's priced at the top end of the scale.  With that in mind, just know that all the technical features in the world are not going to give you a steady hand for every picture; so don't be reluctant to use a tripod of some kind.<br /><br />I'll leave all of the technical highlights to the serious digital photographers, and just point out my personal problems with the DxO.  Chief among those problems is that ANY protective case around your iPhone WILL PREVENT you from using it.  In order for the camera to engage with your iPhone, the case has to be off, otherwise the plug will not sit properly and it won't work with your phone... at all!<br /><br />As a result of this, I discovered another unpleasant quirk, customer support for this camera is not good.  Yes they are responsive, but no they are not \"problem solvers.\"  When the camera couldn't plug into the phone properly, it took over a week of email exchanges to discover the cause.  From the start, I provided them with a short video that demonstrated the fact that the phone and camera would not \"mate\".  It took an escalation to the Level 2 support before someone noticed that the phone had a protective case and this prevented the camera from successfully plugging in.  It takes Level 2 to discover that?  Couldn't they include something in the Quick Start instructions that would prevent that type of misunderstanding?<br /><br />One other complaint that I'll add is that the battery drain is terrible. 'Nuff said.","I'm using my camera everyday, it's soooo small and powerfull, in one pocket my iphone, in the other the dxo, so I never miss one shot. as a professional art director it's a tool that allow you to shoot pro, with a raw file, so when I'm scouting I sometimes come back with an image that I can actually use. love it. also love the design and weight of it. perfect christmas present for any image enthusiast, instagram or pro photographer.","I love this camera! I do photography but there is no way I will carry my main camera around all the time because it's simply not practical. With that said, I use my iPhone most of the time, and it's great, but I don't get images that I really want or see in the moment. So I play around with as many filters as I can to make the image better.<br /><br />Then I was introduced to this camera. I can't tell you how happy it makes me. I was looking at mirrorless cameras but still ran into the same problem of carrying around a, though smaller, big piece of equipment.  I clip this small, but powerful camera to a belt loop and off I go! I take it with me everywhere, zoo, family trips, or wherever. I've even had it on rides with me at the amusement park! I. Mean. Come on!<br /><br />You can \"shoot from the hip\", with the small screen on the back, but it really shines when I connect it to my iPhone. I use my phone's screen to change my shooting setting just like my big camera and I can really see what I'm shooting. There were a few times on a family outing I just popped it out shot with the small screen and with a little practice, I got pretty darn good at getting great quick picks. It's got 20.2 megapixels so if I was a little off it didn't really matter, I reframed it and got the picture I wanted.<br /><br />The low light is just INSANE! It has RAW, (uncompressed and flexible) and  SUPER RAW. You have to download the free software for the super raw, but it's so worth it. I've included a picture I took at the Observatory in LA and I used that super raw format and got, what I think is, an amazing photo.<br /><br />It's great to have the flexibility to take a picture and upload it to facebook or Instagram, as well as take it home and play with it on the computer.<br />It comes with a 8 gig micro sd card, but I have a 16gig card I put in it. I have an iPhone 5 and don't have a ton of room on my phone, so I save the majority of my photos to the camera and only save selected ones to my phone. You have the option of automatically saving to both phone and camera, but this works for me until I upgrade.<br /><br />I've added some random pictures I took with it. I have adjusted them, but not like I have had to in the past- small tweaks. That's just how I roll.<br /><br />It takes nice video in 1080p at 30fps, or 720p at 120fps.<br /><br />For me, it has become my goto camera. I feel like I'm becoming a better photographer because I am shooting way more that I did without it and what I am shooting is so much better than with my phone camera.<br /><br />Even though I do photography, it's easy to use.<br /><br />If you are asking if it is worth it? I say yes. Yes, ?it is.","Biggest benefit is it's small enough that I carry it in my jacket pocket a lot.  So I can use it for quality pictures that my iphone 6 might not capture.  And I stopped carrying around my DSLR at that's too bulky except for rare special occasions.  Also found that it allows me to catch people in more natural poses and situations as they sometimes don't notice I'm taking pictures as the camera is so small.  One great use is taking it with me when I'm hiking in the foothills.  I carefully select what I put into my backpack or fanny pack to minimize the total weight I'm hauling around.  So the light weight and compactness pays off in that situation.","I just bought this camera at The Grove and wanted to leave a review because I really love it, very impressive technology in such a small package.  I highly recommend it! Amazing pictures with no flash and I love that I can post my pics immediately on my social media. The price was a bit of a concern, but my pics for my real estate business stand out so much, it pays for itself. The Grove were super helpful explaining how to use it and take advantage of the features customized to my needs. I even went back and bought the waterproof casing for underwater pics to take on my next vacation.","DxO One is an incredible camera. Not only I can keep it in my purse or pocket but the quality of my pictures is amazing.<br /><br />I love the fact to be able to take quality picture and post it directly on my Instagram.<br /><br />This little thing is my favorite object so far.","When planning a recent vacation in Europe with my wife, I knew I wanted to be able to take great photos, but was reluctant to be saddled with my DSLR and a big bag of lenses. So I took a leap of faith and got a DxO ONE as my sole camera for the two week trip, along with my iPhone. Couldn't be happier with the results! It was always handy in my pocket, and a quick snap onto my iPhone made it ready to go. It was raining for much of our time there, so carrying my big camera would have been a drag. My favorite shots were late at night, where the DxO managed some amazing low-light shots. To the naked eye, the sky was black, and buildings were just shades of gray. I was blown away with the depth of light and color that the DxO managed to pull out of the darkness. I've attached a few examples below (downres'd).<br />I've turned a bunch of my friends onto the camera since we got back, and I've heard nothing but raves back from them.","I got a DxO ONE as a gift and what a gift it is! I haven't upgraded my iPhone in years, so the increase in quality provided by the DxO ONE is really dramatic. It's small enough to keep in my purse at all times, so it never leaves my side. I use it to mainly photograph my children and, because I'm no expert, I tend to keep it in portrait mode. The images it captures are gorgeous! The eyes are razor sharp and I get that nice soft focus background, which I love. And it's absolutely incredible in very low light.","I really love the concept and design of DxO One. My wife and I compared this camera with the Sony A7ii while visiting Yellow Stone National Park. Today, when looking at our pictures we are unable to determine which picture is taken with which camera without looking at the file references. The quality of the DxO camera is really amazing and particularly in low light settings. Also, I very much appreciated the software update that allows to \"see\" the picture on the little screen of the DxO without connecting to iPhone: Very useful for the quick shot when the phone is out of reach.","Extraordinary camera !<br />Fantastic optical performance, incredible convenience & all the benefits of RAW files for professional processing & results.<br />It's in my pocket every time I head out the door !","I am REALLY enjoying this little dynamo! It is exceptional in extremely low light conditions, with WAY MORE sensitivity than even my new iPhone 7 Plus. The f/1.8 lens is also the perfect focal length for portraits and for close ups of food (I am a die-hard foodie), providing that gorgeous soft focus background (bokeh) that makes for professional looking photos. The companion iOS app that controls the camera is probably the best-designed I've ever seen, with pretty much all the controls of my Canon DSLR. When I mount the camera on my tripod, using the stand accessory, I am able to capture stunning starry night photos by setting the controls to a 15 second exposure time. The Wi-Fi remote control lets me operate the camera with my iPhone without it being attached, and is what makes for perfectly stable, vibration-free long exposure images when mounted on a tripod. Not many people are aware that the DxO ONE comes with an app for Mac/Windows that you can download for free. The software automatically applies additional processing (noise reduction, etc.) to the RAW files the DxO ONE captures. With the additional processing, the images are incredible, virtually noise-free and dynamic. Yes, the battery is small, but so is the camera. I typically only take it out of my pocket when I want to capture a special subject or scene, and for my occasional use the battery performance is more than adequate. Besides, I keep a juice pack with me to keep my iPhone charged anyway, so it's easy to top it off whenever I'm on an extended trip. Definitely works as advertised.","I love owning the DXO One. It's simple to use, works well in low light and the results are amazing.<br /><br />I use it with my iPhone 6S+ and having that big beautiful screen for previews is fantastic.<br /><br />The camera is so handy and the files so clean, I keep it with me all the time. The quality rivals any thing I get from my DSLRs.","A great little addition to my iPhone. After installing it and getting the hang of a few basics i have been having a lot of fun and learning more. I need to be a little careful about battery but it does a very impressive job for its size.<br /><br />Build quality is exceptional<br /><br />It makes living without my iPhone even more difficult.","I am taking a lot of photos, but my biggest problem was always the choice of the quality of the iPhone pictures vs the user-friendliness of a classic DSLR.<br /><br />Now I don’t have to make this choice any longer.<br />I am a user of the DXO One for several months now. This is a tiny little box size of the lighter with a lens, a huge image sensor for its compact size and a Lightning connector.<br /><br />The new line of DxO accessories includes an outdoor shell, which makes the camera water- and weatherproof while you’re out riding your bike, or at up to 45 meters; a stand, which is equally portable but provides more stability and which works with a new software feature, an optical adapter, which lets you screw new 30.5mm diameter filters over the lens, so you can use things like polarizers or ND filters.<br /><br />And now with the new WIFI Remote function I can mount the camera on my bike and take amazing photos and videos.<br /><br />Great Product!","It is my preferred camera and the company is providing an excellent customer support","I have stopped using my reflex cameras since I bought my DXO One. Great camera, always in my pocket, great pix, especially after post-processing with DXO Connect.","I think my iPhone 6S Plus takes great pictures on its own, but this is a nice add on for when pictures matter, but not enough to pull out my Canon 5D III.  It does especially well with colors and glare in low light situations.  See image below - where I sat on my couch and snapped two quick shots of the lights on my window ... with the DxO and with my iPhone alone.  You can see that the iphone photo has more yellow to it, the colors aren't as saturated, and there's a lot more blur/glare around the individual lights. Hopefully the extent of the difference comes through.<br /><br />It's a great add-on if you want to be able to have something tossing around in your pocket or bag, without hassle.  It's compact and solid when you close it up.  Easy to set up with a quick app.  You can use a memory card, but also saves directly to your iphone if you choose.  Slightly tricky to fold the lightning connection back in.  You need to pull the lens cover all the way down.  As someone who skips over manuals, I missed that.","I chose to review this because I need a better camera than just my cell phone while on trips, but due to space limitations can't carry a bigger camera with accessories. This sounded like it would be perfect, and in theory it is. But in practical use, the battery life is too short for a day's worth of shots, and having to remove my iPhone's protective cover is a major drawback for me. (I've dropped my phone too many times to consider going without a cover.) At this price point ($400-$500), I'd recommend waiting until they can improve the battery life and make it compatible with the various protective covers available. 3.5 stars.","Amazing compact camera have a few issues with it but nothing major key mapping should be a thing so I can change my vol buttons to soon settings or effect the exposure settings. What I truly hope to see in the cam is burst mode / continual shutter mode this is somthing Iv already suggested for an update within the system","The camera was super easy to set up and fairly intuitive.  That was good because the instructions were somewhat unclear.  However, there are lots of instructions online.  From the included booklet I assumed that the lightening connector folds down but mine does not.  I contacted Customer service at DxO.com and waiting to hear.  A must is to watch some of the videos to get started.  For the price I expected more and I do not think I would be pleased with the product for $499.<br /><br />Good (so far)<br />Takes great pictures (as it should for just under $500)<br />Easy to carry in pocket or purse<br />Pictures can be sent immediately while connected to the iPhone<br />Comes with a small memory card included<br /><br />Not so good<br />I had to take my iPhone out of the case which I hate to do because I have dropped it before which cost me a lot. Now that the Apple warranty has expired, it will cost me a lot more<br />The viewfinder is difficult to see anything through<br />Short battery life (I would hate to be at a special occasion such as a wedding and lose battery half way through)<br /><br />Improvements wished for<br />Price reduction!<br />A better connector so the case does not have to be taken off<br />A nice case than the little bag it comes in<br /><br />Technical Specifications:<br />• 20.2 megapixels<br />• 1080p at 30 fps, 720p at 120 fps<br />• Focal length 11.9 mm (equivalent to 32 mm in full-frame)<br />• Video modes: Full HD, slow motion (x4)<br />• ISO range 100 to 51200<br />• Shutter speed 1/20000 to 30 s<br /><br />Disclaimer<br />Vine voices receive products free for review but they are actually not quite free.  Because this is a high ticket item, it may cost me quite a bit.  The value of the item is counted as income on the tax return and taxed as such.  This is an investment, albeit not retail price and I take the review of the item seriously.","I have been carrying it in my pocket for 6+ months and I realize I simply don't use my DSLR anymore. Image quality is just perfect in 99% of the situations.<br />But IMHO, the real game changer is the embedded Apple connector: my pictures directly appear in the iPhone's camera roll, so they can be viewed and shared immediately.<br />Seriously.. .why to buy a new iPhone with average image quality (bad low light performances, fake bokeh etc) when you can have a real DSLR image quality in your pocket for half the price?","Before I ordered this I made sure to read everything on the product page. I ordered it because it said it works as a stand-alone camera. When I read that, I assumed that I could use it even if I didn't have an iPhone or other Apple product. I was disappointed to discover that I can't even begin use this unless I have either an iPhone or iPad to connect to in order to update the firmware. Well, I have an Android phone and my iPad is broken so this camera is pretty much useless to me at the moment. I do intend on replacing my iPad, but until then I can't make a proper review of this product.<br /><br />I would encourage the seller to include the information and make it clear to potential customers to make it clear that this cannot be used without an ios device and that it's not a true stand-alone product.","The concept of this camera is great but it is a little clumsy to use and the battery life is just not good enough.<br />Overall quality is really a step up compared to the built in camera of the iPhone but it is a little inconvenient to use. I have to remove my protective case (which is really thin) and attaching/detaching the camera is just too much for me.<br />In addition the battery life is really not good enough and last less than an hour","Compact, sleek and elegant, this miniature camera is notable for its utter ease of operation in all modes, and for the wonderfully detailed, high-resolution, professional-level photos it enables one to take.","Overall, I'm pretty impressed with this little camera. This is a great alternative for someone who wants to do better quality photos and have more creative options than their iPhone alone, but doesn't want to spend thousands of dollars on a higher end camera.<br /><br />The DxO One is easy to use. Download the photo app to your phone, plug the DxO in, and off you go. I was amazed by the quality of the photos this little camera captures. This is easily on par with my Sony a6000. Much better low light photos than the iPhone alone. I'm attaching a photo that demonstrates the differences between photos taken with the DxO One, my iPhone 7 and my Sony a6000 with the kit lens (currently $698 on Amazon). You can see that the DxO and the Sony are pretty close in picture quality. The DxO has a bit of a warmer tone than the Sony. The iPhone 7 at first looks sharper, but when looking more closely, you see that the iPhone photos are way more contrasty, and some of the details get lost when you lose some of the smooth gradients that the DxO or Sony can give. Unlike the iPhone, the DxO can give you a shallow depth of field and has pretty decent bokeh for a camera its size. As with a higher-end camera, the DxO has the ability to choose film speed and ISO for even more control over the overall look of your photos.<br /><br />Wi-Fi connectivity works great...IF you have both your iPhone and the DxO on the same Wi-Fi connection. The DxO also has the ability to connect directly to the camera, but it apparently isn't compatible with iOS 10, so, I was unable to test this.<br /><br />One major problem with the DxO is battery life. Because of the size restraints, the battery is tiny and therefore battery life is pitifully short. Yes, you can plug this into a power source and charge it just like your phone, but whereas I can get an entire day of use out of my iPhone on one charge, I would be hard pressed to get more than one hour of battery life out of the DxO, which means you're not going to use this for an all-day shoot without having to plug it in and re-charge multiple times, which is a pain. Battery life definitely needs to be improved.<br /><br />There is a digital zoom on this camera, but I found that I lost sharpness when I used it. Also, the auto focus is a bit slow, so I wouldn't rely on this camera for sporting events or some other situation where you need fast focus.<br /><br />Also...and this is really more of a minor annoyance...I can't plug the DxO in if I have a protective case on my iPhone. My protective case is pretty thin, and I still can't plug the DxO in without taking the case off.<br /><br />Other than those few things, this is a great little camera! There's room for improvement, but again, for someone who wants the quality and options that a higher-end camera can give, but don't want to pay $700 or more, this is a good alternative.","I am by no means a professional photographer, my photography skills are based mostly in taking shots with my I-Phone (I currently use the I-Phone 7).  This miniature camera is a great addition for the person who likes to shoot photos or videos wherever they go.  I found myself taking even more photos and videos after I got this product so that I could use my new toy.<br /><br />Some of the advantages of the product are:<br />It is very easy to use (no complex instructions needed for this small camera).<br />It is very portable.<br />It takes clear, nice pictures (for me I think it takes better photos than the average phone).<br />You can use the camera attached to your phone or as a stand alone camera as well.<br />It is very easy to capture HD video anytime anywhere<br /><br />Some of the disadvantages of the camera are:<br />It really uses a lot of power, and the battery life is less than I would like.  Especially if you planning on taking pictures or videos throughout the day you will need to recharge the camera in between shots.<br />I didn't like the lack of a zoom on the camera.<br /><br />Overall I really did like the camera, and can see myself using it often to capture events on film.  It is small and portable enough that I don't feel like I am packing an extra camera, and it was simple and fun to use as well.  Completely compatible with my I-Phone and fun to use.  If you are a serious camera person I think you will really like this little product as a nice alternative to a phone camera.","[[VIDEOID:4d31cd38762cb79a7a8a1525b0f984be]] With the popularity of iPhone photography and seeing them posted on Instagram and Flickr, it's not surprising that special hardware to take advantage of smart phone technology would be created.<br /><br />Enter the DXO ONE, a pro quality camera from respected image processing company, DXO, who miniaturized a camera to interact with an iPhone or iPad that uses a lightning adapter or to work as a standalone product, light at 3.8 oz. and only 2.65\" tall, this camera packs a punch despite its size.<br /><br />The DXO ONE features:<br /><br />- 1-inch 20.2MP BSI Sensor<br />- f1.8-f/11 variable aperture (6 blades)<br />- 1/20 0000 s to 30 s shutter speed<br />- ISO 100 to 12800, Hi1 (25600), Hi2 (51200)<br />- 1080p (30 fps), 720p (120 fps) HD Video<br />- Captures RAW, JPEG, MOV (H.264)<br />-  Offers still modes: Auto, Sports, Portrait, Landcape, Night, Program, Aperture/Speed Priority, Full Manual Mode<br />- Video Mode: Auto, Slow Motion, Manual<br />- Comes with built-in Lithium-ion Battery<br /><br />Once you open the package, you realize how simple this device is to use.  Holding the cover down makes the lightning adapter pop out (and also can put it back in to the camera).  Pushing it down also turns the device on.<br /><br />The first thing one would need to do is download the DXO ONE app from the Apple App Store (for iPhone and iPad).  Once connected, the device must go through a firmware update which is quick but it's important for people to know.<br /><br />If there is one caveat I found, when testing the device on an iPhone and an iPad, if you are reliant on having a protective cover/case around your phone, which most people do, the DXO ONE requires you to take it off.  This is probably one of the three biggest caveat for most users, as we want protection for our devices and it would have worked better to have the lightning adapter on the device to be longer, so the device doesn't interfere with your iPhone or iPad case.<br /><br />I'll get to the second and third caveats, a little later in my review.<br /><br />But let's get to the sensor.  The DXO ONE utilizes the BSI-CMOS sensor, the same sensor found in the Sony Cyber-shot RX100 III, this leads to the device being able to shoot in low light.  So, if you have anything before an iPhone 7 that uses a lightning adapter, this camera gives you 1.8 lens for better low light performance.<br /><br />I tested the camera in low light conditions and of course, as expected, you are going to see noise at a higher ISO.  But it was actually very good, for example a little Gunpla model I shot, low light, but it still was able to focus on details of the little robot very well.  Also, you can use the iPhone flash but still, it's great to see this device work in low light situations.  And I think it's very cool that DXO offers six blades (aspherical lenses) for aperture.<br /><br />Took it outside, without my phone or tablet and see how it would be as a standalone unit.  I wanted to test out photo and video with Gus the Pug in his Batman outfit and my son with his mask.  It was little overcast, but still wanted to see how it performed. And surprisingly video was very good, captured the audio and wind quite well.  The camera outputs to DNG Raw and I was able to open up via Adobe Photoshop and do some post.<br /><br />One of the surprising additions is the use of \"SuperRAW\" and that is capturing four RAW images in rapid succession.  How awesome is that!  While the files are in .DXO format, each SuperRAW file is 80MB, so I would recommend purchasing a high capacity SD memory card.<br /><br />But there were a few things that I did notice, the viewfinder is hard to see.  It's really black and white and almost like wearing night googles but with only solid black and white visuals, you're going to have to guesstimate a lot.  Especially for video.  I pretty much hoped that by aiming the device at the person/animal, it got what I wanted, but I did end up capturing more space on top or the sides, but that's OK, it can be adjust in post.<br /><br />This leads to the second caveat...battery power.  The device comes with its own built-in lithium-ion battery but I feel it last only a half hour long.<br /><br />The patience of having that short of battery life although not as bad as some of the battery life of inexpensive drones I have tested and reviewed.  But still, because it uses its own built-in Lithium-ion battery, the camera life and the lightning adapter will hopefully be addressed in the next version of the DXO ONE.  So, definitely have a portable battery recharger handy, as shooting in high ISO levels will no doubt drain battery power.<br /><br />It's important to emphasize that this device is only for iPhone and iPad's that utilize lightning adapter connection, and DXO ONE at this time does not make the device that are Android or Microsoft-based.  So, no Android Tablets or Microsoft Surface Pro's with this device.<br /><br />And now the third caveat, its price.  It's under $500.  Some friends remarked about how it would be cheaper just to get a GoPro or Garmin Virb, another said they could get a Canon GX7 (first version) for cheaper.  Well, for one, if you want to record video, then the GoPro and Garmin Virb are excellent and they last longer and you can purchase batteries.  Canon GX7 is also fantastic for video and good for photography.  But the primary use for the DXO ONE is for those who want a small device and can pull it out and connect it to their iPhone and iPad. And there is a huge market for that.<br /><br />Overall, for those who are looking for a camera to enhance their iPhone and iPad photography, will love the DXO ONE miniature camera.  But it's not perfect.  It's inability to work with iPhone and iPad's with their case is a drag, its battery power is also another major drag and for some, its price may cause some people to stay away.<br /><br />But it's all subjective to a person's needs.  I see it as an excellent backup, especially if you want to use it as a standalone product to whip out immediately and shoot or get video and and its battery power is more than enough.<br /><br />Not perfect but the DXO ONE still offers awesome photos and video and more options than one can expect from this miniature camera.  Recommended!","I was skeptical.  I've used my iPhone 6 camera with amazing results.  The DxO did not offer optical zoom, which is the one thing that keeps the iPhone 6 camera from being a fully functional dedicated camera replacement.  But, the proof is in the pudding.  The photos taken by this camera are far superior to those taken by the iPhone 6.  Period.  Much greater detail, a richer (yet true) color palette, and the ability to take photographs in RAW format make for a superior user experience.  Some gripes, though.  The DxO recharges fairly quickly, but is a power hog.  And there can be quite a bit of lag between photographs. (By the way, the DxO batter will die long before your iPhone 6, even if you carefully husband power usage by turning it off between locations. Bring a spare charger batter and micro-USB cord with you.)  The app is easy to install and use.  A nice feature is a slot for micro-SD memory card.","If you like on the go, professional shots, the DxO camera is for you. As an artist, I am always taking photos, and they need to look good. Lugging a big old camera around is not my thing, with DxO I have the equipment with me at all times. I love the bokeh effect and have found the auto mode excellent. I also think it captures the light wonderfully and has allowed me to define the shadows around my 3D creations so that the photography doesn't flatten the object.<br />Outside of my art interest, every time I show this camera to my friends, they end up wanting it because we take shots in dimly lit restaurants and every shot looks great.<br />I strongly recommend this camera. It is my favorite new tool.<br /><br />I have attached 2 photos I took without any special lighting of my sculptures. You can see the bokeh effect really well on the first one with the fuzzy black piano and mirror behind the sculpture. On the other one notice how all the shadows, carving and sheen was captured.","The DxO one camera is a great extension to your IPhone! It gives you Dslr quality images that are extremely sharp and is small enough to be carried anywhere with you. I was impressed with the sharpness of images as well as how you have so much power out of a small camera. I have used the camera during the day and at night and am continuously impressed with the clarity and sharpness of the images! You will not be dissapointed!","This is a nice camera.  The first two photos I've included are for comparison, they were from the same distance of the same subject matter, a puppy.  The one on the left is the DXO picture, the one on the right is just with the iphone 6 plus camera.  The DXO takes very nice quality photos and videos, I've also included a photo from the pumpkin patch that I took with the DXO, the weather was better that day.<br /><br />I found the DXO to be user friendly for the most part, although it took me a bit to realize that the plug for the camera to attach to the phone will pop up and unlock only if the camera lens cover is fully slid open.  It was easy to download the DXO app, and it gave a brief tutorial.  I had a very easy time taking pictures and video, and then sharing photos and videos from the DXO app.<br /><br />The down side is that you must remove the protective cover off your iphone in order to plug the camera to the phone.  If I didn't have to do this, I would have given it five stars.","I really like this camera.<br />Over all it's definitely a A+<br />I added some pictures for reference of quality.<br />Canon 70D<br />iPhone 6s<br />And the DxO one<br /><br />Pros.<br />Very small and portable.<br />Great quality images for size.<br />The option to share right away if attached to my phone,<br />Easy to use.<br />Photo and video option<br />Can fog in my pocket easily.<br /><br />Cons.<br />Not a true view finder,<br />I wish it was easier to attach to the phone, I have to take my case off which is a big no no in my work.<br />Small travel bag it comes with is nearly impossible to put it in,"]},{"name":"Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II","amazon_reviews":["I've waited a while before writing this review because I wanted time to use the camera.

I especially love the SCN setting with the background blur. And the flip up \"selfie\" screen is what sold me on the camera for my photoshoots and party pictures. I previously used the dual lens picture within picture self Canon camera, which this camera unfortunately does not feature. Would be great to have that feature also incorporated. I do use the wi-fi feature as well and that has greatly improved since the previous model.","I love this camera!","This is the best camera I have ever used. I bought it for vlogging but then again this is the nicest camera I've ever used.","Great camera!","It is a perfect camera. Really compact and powerful.","Note on not being a \"Verified Purchase\": Initially ordered from Amazon, but was backordered so I purchased from another vendor.<br /><br />I bought this camera as an alternative to my DSLR gear and to get some good video of my daughters.  This camera does not disappoint.  The photos are excellent, it is easy to use, and is really small and light.<br /><br />The pros:<br />- The size! It is a little bigger than pocket size, but fits great in a purse and definitely in cargo short pockets<br />- Focus is quick and accurate (unless your subject is a 4yo that moves faster than a running back)<br />- Picture quality is excellent for the sensor size (or for any camera really)<br />- Battery life is reasonable (and they don't take forever to charge)<br />- The image stabilization saved my bacon a time or two.  Not the 4 stops you see on a $2k lens, but still pretty good<br />- having a dial for exposure compensation at thumb level is great<br />- Having full manual mode as well as the semi-auto modes (Av, Tv) is great for those of us that want that level of control<br />- The Wi-Fi works well and the mobile app (on Android at least) works great<br />- Raw files!<br />- Video is great (even if not 4K)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It might be small, but the metal body makes it a little on the heavy side<br />- There is only one fully auto mode - no \"Sports\", \"Landscape\", or \"Portrait\" modes<br />- High speed continuous mode in Raw+JPEG fills the buffer in a hurry (I know, a bit nitpicky)<br />- If you put the strap on the right side (from the rear) you will probably hit the Wi-Fi button when putting the camera in your pocket or a snug case.  That drains the battery in a hurry.<br />- Audio quality is, well, not very good.  The microphone is in a spot easily covered or blocked by a hand holding the camera.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with the purchase.  My wife also appreciates that we own a camera that doesn't weigh a few pounds or require a degree in rocket surgery to use.  Given the popularity of it's predecessor, The G7X MKII is likely to become the compact vlogging of choice for those that have the budget.<br /><br />If this review was helpful to you, please click the \"yes\" button below - it helps Amazon (and those of us who write reviews) know if the information provided is of value to others.","Fantastic camera.. Video stabilization is awesome.","Good quality pictures in a portable device. Be sure to check your pictures right away after you take them. Zoom in and check the focus. You might take ten pictures quickly, and the focus will be slightly off in every picture. Check the focus before the moment is gone, in case you need to retake the shot. If you have to focus on a moving object in a hurry, forget it. The autofocus will be wrong every time. Once you understand the camera's limitations, you can take some really great pictures.","Love it!  Takes great photos even in low light.  The selfy feature is lots of fun.  Used it  quite a bit since I got in December.","Best camera for vlogging","I love the camera but Amazon is selling it for $100 more than everyone else. Adorama, B&H, and Bestbuy are selling it for $670-$700. What is more frustrating, the used cameras offered on Amazon are the price of the new ones at the other stores. Otherwise, the camera has the upgraded processor, grip, menu layout had a slight visual change, the screen tilts down as well and the control ring has the click and smooth option. People complained about the over saturated look but that can be changed. You can flatten the colors and change white balance. The camera shouldn't be judged by what it does on auto, it should be judged on what it is capable of.","Very good camera.","This camera is nothing short of AMAZING.  The one inch sensor and large aperture let you shoot just about any low light condition without the flash.  There are a ton of manual controls that are all very intuitive and easy to learn how to handle.  I own this camera along with the original 7D SLR and a Rebel T1i and the G7 is my go to for my daily snapshots of family and friends.  It is worth every penny if you want amazing quality in a camera.<br />The 1 inch sensor in this camera gets us so much closer to DSLR quality in a pocket camera.  I can't wait to see where the technology goes in the next couple of years.<br /><br />Video is SUPERB for this type of camera. I finally feel like I have an easy way to capture all of the sweet moments of watching a toddler grow up.<br /><br />If your worried about the price, DONT BE.  You will not be disappointed.  Just dive in and enjoy this camera.<br /><br />Well done on this Canon, well done.","I'm in love with the G7x Mark II. While primarily a sports photographer, I began to branch out into street photography. There was no way that i wanted to lug around my zoom lenses and my Canon DSLR.<br /><br />I wanted something light, easy to handle and carry, and something where I can be more \"discreet\" with my subjects.<br /><br />I read through a ton of different opinions but I settled on the G7X because of my comfort level with Canon and the understanding of their menu.<br /><br />The first day of shooting, I simply put the camera on auto and started shooting around town. I couldn't believe the simplicity, ease of use, and clarity of the images. Very impressed.<br /><br />Having a full 1 inch sensor makes an enormous difference and on that first day I ended up using it in a darkened restaurant, a jazz club, a bright and sunny downtown main street, but I never took it off \"auto\".<br /><br />When I loaded the images on my laptop, I couldn't believe how sharp they looked. I made some very minor adjustments to the images using photoshop and they were ready to go.<br /><br />This thing is a gem. It has a surprising amount of zoom capability for such a small size and I love not having to use the view finder or hold the camera up to my eye to compose the image.<br /><br />This guy would be great for a travel camera, street photography, or any amateur looking for an above average camera that is easy to use but doesn't want to spend a fortune on a full DSLR.","super dope","Love it.","I had this camera twice and returned it for the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX10K. Boy was I Dumb! I had a earlier G series camera back in 2006 n loved it. I did not give this G7 mark II a chance, although it was nice at first, but a tad slow, low light awesome! I will not disclaim the Lumix 10K. It was not for me...So I have purchased the G7 MarkII again. This Camera has a solid build, pictures are awesome, doesn't have all the bells n whistles as some cameras. But it's a winner by all means, gotta stay a way from the hype of something new is better, The G7 Mark II is a winner for me. 3 times is a charm,...Simply a super camera, it will not disappoint.","LLOVEEEEE IT!!!!!","I love this camera and for any Youtuber out there, this is a great camera for traveling! Highly recommend this user friendly camera!","This is my purchase of the year! It is a perfect camera for vlogging, very practical to bring everywhere with you, easy to operate, and lots of setting options. I film 95% of my vlogs indoors and it performs very well in low-light conditions and you can adjust the aperture setting to the point where a pitch black room can look like you are in a room with lots of natural light - it is insane! Auto-focus is quite fast and I love that you can adjust the background to get the blurry effect so it looks cinematic. I heard 50/50 reviews about sound quality and honestly...I think this camera has great quality. I tested it in a room where there is a lot of echoing while I was talking filming a segment and had my iPhone 6s and a voice recorder operating all at the same time. When I got home to compare the audio from all the devices, this camera picked up my voice the best. If you are that precise with your sound quality though, I would suggest you buying a separate cardioid microphone and just syncing your audio and video when editing. I have not had to do this yet as I really have not encountered audio issues. Please note that there is no external microphone jack - I know a lot of people ask about this. :-)<br /><br />I purchased this product in October - it arrived a week and a half earlier than the expected delivery date which was a huge bonus, however when I received the package there was a minor issue that I contacted the seller. They gave me some options on what I would like to do, which was quite accommodating. Customer service was great.<br /><br />I have not used the camera to its full potential yet, but I am excited to test it out more since I really only got to play with it for about a week.<br /><br />I hope you will find this review helpful!","I recently recently received a refurbished G7X as a SmartGuard extended protection plan replacement for my son's broken S120.  I had the chance to compare the G7X to my own G15 and I was so impressed with the greater image detail, especially in low light, that I just purchased a new GX7 Mark II for my wife to give me as a holiday present.  The GX7 Mark II is smaller than the G15 and weighs a little less, although it is larger and heavier than the S120.  The G15 zooms to a 35mm equivalent of 140mm, but 100mm images from the G7X Mark II still show more detail than the G15 when they are cropped and enlarged to the same size.  The G7X Mark II also has a flip-up display that is revised from the G7X, so you can hold the G7X Mark II up over your head in a crowd and still see the display.","I have a GoPro 4Silver and wanted another option for documenting my journey (Vlog) and went with this camera and am loving every minute of using it.<br /><br />My Nikon D750 is a beast and heavy - and I did not want to bring it out for casual shoots and video.<br /><br />So I went and got the G7X Mark II. The touch screen is a dream to use and intuitive to work with. I actually spend time watching YouTube videos and am a manual kinda guy and looked it over for tips on using for best results.<br /><br />This is an expensive option for what it is and yet I have tried out less expensive options and this camera kept calling me to purchase because of the ease of use and the quality of photo's and (especially) video. I really wanted it mainly for video and I am not disappointed. I could care less for 4K at this point - so many downers for me on using that at this time....so I can wait and by the time 4K is seamless with other downloads, storage, editing, etc then I will consider it - but at this early stage it is not of value for me (or the hassles from what I hear and read about for some users).<br /><br />When I tell a story I want great options in equipment for telling that story and this camera is one tool that I highly recommend.","I never have owned an expensive DSLR or point and shoot camera, solely because I would rely on my smartphone all of these years. While the smartphone camera gets the job done for my picture taking needs, I wanted to start making YouTube videos and the quality of my iPhone's camera just wasn't good enough.<br /><br />This camera exceeded my expectations! It's extremely portable, has great battery life (lasted an entire day while filming/taking pics on vacation), and takes fantastic pictures and videos. The autofocus and amount of light this lense takes in makes for a great vlogging camera, especially since the screen rotates.<br /><br />No regrets purchasing this camera, and I'm positive anyone looking for a high quality point and shoot won't be disappoint!","This camera is great.  I'm posting two photos that give some idea of the image quality (within the limitations of what Amazon allows resolution-wise).  One of these I've already printed at 20x30 inches and the detail is fantastic.  The color rendition and dynamic range are phenomenal. This is a fantastic camera for its size.<br /><br />I originally rated this three stars because it lacked native software for MacOS Sierra and because the software it does provide for Windows (Camera Window) doesn't allow images to be imported directly to network drives and/or attached drives like portable SSD's.  However, given the image quality, ease of use and compact size, I realized that I was wrong and the camera deserves a higher rating.  I'm using ACDSee Ultimate 10 to import directly from the camera to an attached SSD and DxO Optics Pro now handles RAW images from the camera in the Mac OS Sierra.  Canon now has software that works natively on MacOS Sierra and this camera rates five stars.","This is my 11th-15th digital camera. Its somewhere around that number. I've always upgraded and I never keep this old cameras around me what so ever. Currently posses the Nikon D5500, GoPro 4 Silver, and this camera. My last pocket camera was the Sony RX100 M2. I was originally waiting for the Sony RX100 M5 to come out but it never did until last month. I decided to buy this G7X M2 camera since its $700. Part of the big reason is the LCD screen able to flip 180 degrees. Great for vlogging and seeing what you are filming. This camera came out in this summer and it was still cheaper than the Sony RX100 M4 even till this day, which came out in mid 2015. The Sony RX100 M5 came out and its $1000. That's a $300 difference. How much different between the photos and videos? Not much. 4K, Slow Mo, Super Slow Mo, Super Duper Slow Mo, okay but do you use it all the time? For me, I wont spend that kind of money for a pocket camera. This $700 is more than viable for the things I do. Do purchase a screen protector. Lexmor been my favorite but they have not made one for them yet. The screen protector I have is very flimsy but its doable for now. Do get extra batteries. On 60FPS for video it shoots 16 minutes and 24 seconds max. It can record over 1 hours with a canon battery. I always have extra batteries. I know its a bit pricey $50 for canon battery but hey do you want your camera exploding in your face? I did have great experience with Wasabi batteries not sure they made a generic one for this model yet. Overall I like this camera and it gets the job done. I didn't want the lens to protrude while off. I've attached a screen shot of the pic I took with this camera. It was a minor touch up with VSCO filter. I've already ordered this in max size of 18\"X12\" print to see how it looks with 300dpi. The camera to phone connection does suck. I need to be on a real wifi signal to connect. On the Sony I can connect my phone through bluetooth. If I am underground, on a plane the Sony was no problem. The Canon wont work. Also the Canon app isn't great compared to the Sony. It lags a lot. That's not gonna ruin my experience what so ever. It's not a big deal. I made a few videos from my trip with this camera because I did not want to carry any DSLR with me. All my friends thought I had some kind of professional camera. Nope. I had a camera that fits inside my pocket. Do check it out. youtube dot com /hellowu I'll def keep this camera through the entire 2017. Hopefully I can use and abuse the heck out of this camera to get my money's worth!","I recently got this camera last week and wow this thing is awesome my wife has dslr rebel and this thing is better than hers I think . So I got it for the video part of the camera and I have several canon cameras and this is my new go to camera if your thinking about this one just go ahead and get it I promise you won't send it back !","I have a DLSR.  - A canon t5i... but I hardly use it or take it with me on trips simply because 1) I like to pack light.. 2) I don't like carrying a larger dslr around with me everywhere.<br /><br />So I started researching smaller cameras.<br />I ALMOST went with a cheaper camera that had a smaller sensor..... actually... I placed the order for it (forget the model) and then cancelled it... And went with my gut and bought this one.<br /><br />If a camera can't shoot anything at night... why waste your money? So I went and grabbed this one instead. Has a 1\" sensor.. (largest you can get in these pocket cams).. with a f/1.8 aperture.  (Basically, it'll get more light in and allow you to actually take pictures at night).<br /><br />These pictures are shots I took today while touring DC while on a business trip... unedited (I actually just transferred them to my phone through the wireless function and saved them to my phone - now posting them up here for the review)..  - great to be able to transfer images easily and quickly from the camera to your phone, as well.<br /><br />Some of the shots were long exposure shots, using a tripod... But you get the idea. It can shoot relatively well at night.<br /><br />Touch screen is awesome. Intuitive.  A huge plus.<br /><br />And yes, it IS pocketable... (some reviewers say it isn't - which is why I wasn't going to buy this one originally.... but I'm glad I did)...<br /><br />Need a great travel camera... don't want to carry around something large / a dslr... then this camera is for you.","As a Nikon full-frame DSLR user I was eagerly awaiting the Nikon DL Compacts but due to ongoing delays and an upcoming trip, I took a leap of faith  at the \"Canon\" G7x Mark II as I really did not want to lug a full-frame camera with lenses on this trip (mostly city sights, friends, food, etc.) After weeks of use, I can honestly say that my initial fears of missing full-frame picture quality are gone.....this camera takes great stills that are sharp with great color rendition. You can look up countless reviews, specs, and accolades but from a travel camera point-of-view, I'm very pleased. The menus and handling are fine once you get use to them (different from Nikon) and the grip and ergonomics are also great (once you get used to the smaller body and lighter weight). I wasn't intending on taking a lot of video but I can't wait to actually use it for video as the focus is consistent and the videos are clear and actually better than the DSLR (no lens focus noises and faster focusing). I do notice that focus and ISO noise are slightly lower performing in low-light compared to full-frame but that's to be expected with the smaller sensor. Overall I'm very pleased and glad to have a smaller camera that's perfect for travel or around town use that hasn't made me regret not bringing the DSLR instead (so far!). I'm not a vlogger but I can totally understand why this is the go-to camera for many you-tubers and vloggers!","I've been looking for a camera to keep in my bag, especially while traveling, that's not as bulky as a DSLR but is more capable than a phone camera.  The G7 Mark II is exactly what I was looking for.  I especially like the \"night\" mode, which has let me take handheld shots of the night sky (the Milky Way, night pictures out of airplane windows, etc.).","After much consideration, I decided to pick this up over the Sony RX100 Mark IV.  The only reason I chose it was because of the video capabilities and how well it performed in low light situations.  4K video is not a big selling point for me right now and I didn't like the asking price for the RX100.  I saved quite a bit for going with Canon so no serious complaints here.  Photos are decent for a camera with a 1-inch sensor.  ISO performance isn't all that great past ISO 1600, but I couldn't imagine a point and shoot to be better than a full size DSLR.  The ergonomics is pretty good.  I like the rubber grip.  I don't really like the Exposure Comp. dial too much.  Other than that, it's a solid little camera.  I really enjoy using it.","What a great little camera.  Fits anywhere and takes great pictures and video.","I would have like a strap that I could hang the camera on, otherwise its good","I LOVE THIS!!! the quality is amazing. The auto focus is kind of slow but besides that 5/5.<br />I use this vlog on YouTube.","There are several decent choices in this class, but after a long wait on Amazon.com in July this year, I purchased this camera on Amazon.es while being on a family vacation in Spain. From the 38 Gb of photo and video material filmed on various cameras including 3 yr. old DSLR, I found that photos that have been made by G7X M2 are a real jewel of my collection. This 'Made in Japan' camera would make you forget about that photo enthusiasts' anxiety of buying a new camera after 2 yrs of use of a previous one.","Awesome Camera!  Makes me feel like a pro.  I am using it to film YouTube Videos at our YouTube Channel \"Catalina Toys\"","The camera is a great and love how the quality of the pictures. I did notice when I attempted to take selfie pictures the camera lens isn't as wide as the front facing camera on my Note 7. I did have to stretch my arm farther out when taking selfie pictures with the camera but I don't see it as a problem. I will just use my phone for selfie pictures. I have no issues with the camera and feels very durable. One thing I did not like was the price of the camera, I feel it should have been about $100 to $150 cheaper (opinion).","amazing camera but I just wish it comes with protection on it.","So far I love this camera. VERY good build quality and is easy to hold. I am still fairly new to photography but I use this mostly for vlogs on my Youtube channel (Black City). The picture quality is so good it's unreal. Although it does pick up on wind noise, I can still be heard quite clearly. This camera is not as advanced as a DSLR but is still more advanced than any normal point n shoot camera.<br /><br />I like the screen on the back that can flip in multiple ways but this camera's real use is in vlogging. It's perfect for that.<br /><br />I do wish it came with a USB cable but that's not a big deal. The battery is one gripe that I don't like. Usually I can get about 2 1/2 hours out of it. 3 maybe. I do have extra batteries but they are not OEM. This camera will give you a warning if you use aftermarket batteries. So far I haven't had any issues with them. I will keep this post updated.<br /><br />There are no major accessories that you can use with this as far as I know. If you are looking to attach a mic or better lenses you may want to look at a different camera. This one is set up to work out of the box and for that I love it.","Very good all around. Particulaly like how easy it is to use in the manual mode. The focusing is spot on in auto mode but a little les accurate in manual, not sure why.","Amazing quality!! The video is awesome!","This camera is phenominal.  It is a combination of all the good things in the previous G series.","I bought this camera before going on a cross country road trip, and I never regretted it even once. I was considering getting one of the rebel series canon DSLRs, but realized that all I really wanted was the more advanced features they offer like bulb mode, but in a package that I could still easily keep on my person while on the go. Until I found this I didn't think something like that was available, but canon has more than impressed me. For its size it's full of advanced features, along with the newest digic image processor. Additionally, the wifi transfer mode offers a very convenient way to upload photos on the go when paired with the canon connect phone app. Overall, if you're looking for advanced features in a small point and shoot form factor, then I would highly recommend this camera.","Love everything about this camera, especially the zoom and low light capability.","So much power packed into a small package. I absolutely love it. Since I want to photograph stars a little bit more I have decided to change my beloved (but now a bit old) G9. I couldn't be happier with this camera.","I bought this for a festival/concert/travel camera, but I have to say this is not really a compact camera that you can put in your pocket. It is really big for fitting in your pocket. It would be useful as a portable camera if you carry a purse or a backpack, but fitting it in your pocket is really hard. Nevertheless, I am keeping it because the pictures are very high quality.","I had the original G7X and was pretty underwhelmed, overall.  Yeah, it was better than a cheap point and shoot and better than the Sony but it was still nothing like an SLR.  The Mark II, now. . .wow.  Far sharper, much better low-light capability.  I tried a little comparison photo session and though I found it's not nearly as easy as the pro instructors make it look, my shot clearly show a difference in sharpness and color.  In fact, I had to shoot the G7X shots again to make sure I hadn't done something wrong.  (I've since read the Mark I had a problem with soft lenses on some copies, and now I'm wondering if I have one.)  What else. . .a bounce flash, sort of!  I think this camera will be great in full daylight, and is amazingly good in the night shots and low-light stuff I like.  Highly recommended as the proverbial \"pocketable camera for pro photographers\" that we've all been waiting for.  (I see Amazon has reduced the size of my photos to where they are just about useless.  Well, you'll have to take my word for it--or buy a Mark II and see for yourself!)","Arrived on time and it is a easy to use point and shoot camera that takes great quality photos.","[[VIDEOID:173db9c33d82251734e8c698753b187b]] As a hobbyist landscape, astro & travel photographer, the infinity mark when shooting in manual mode is crucial. I own a Canon 6D with 17-40 L and Samyang 14mm f/2.8 (manual focus lens) and some \"advanced point-and-shoot\" cameras as my main go-to setup. When comparing this camera to my advanced point and shoots, it is the worst in terms of Manual Focusing. Aside from that, it also cannot dial precisely at the infinity mark when manual focusing (see video). This means it is hard or perhaps impossible to achieve corner-to-corner sharpness when shooting at lower f/stops.","Great camera.  Great features.  Great shots.","Great camera! Upgraded from a Canon S95. Photos are terrific. G7 X II is superior in terms of exposure and focus. Takes consistently better photos. Image stabilization is great with video. Happier with this camera after a days shooting.","Awesome camera. Huge step up from the first g7x. I'm a photographer/videographer so I like the capability of this camera. It's almost as great as a DSLR, but in compact form. Also, great for vlogging.","Amazing camera. I'm a professional photographer and I am extremely impressed with the picture quality. I also love all the manual controls and the ease-of-use. I shoot weddings on a Canon 5D Mark III and a Canon 6D. In a pinch I could easily use this camera if I needed to.<br />The picture I have attached is a 15 second exposure with my kids running around with solar lights. This shot is un-edited and was shot in raw.  The only thing I did with the picture was transfer it via Wi-Fi to my cell phone using the Canon picture app.","Excellent camera that can be purchased directly from Canon for $699.","I love this camera, it has all the function that I need. I was planning to get the G7X two weeks before this camera came out, but finally heard this one is releasing, so I decided to wait for the upgrade. It is a very easy to use camera for beginning. The only thing bothers me is the battery cover, it doesn't close when u push it back to close, you have to use both hands to close the battery cover. other than that, I love this camera and I will use it for more videos for my vlogs. [...]","This camera is probably the best point and shoot you can get, with its versatile settings, ergonomics, and software you should be able to shoot masterpieces in no time.  IF YOU ARE NOT TECH SAVY.....do not expect to take breath taking videos and photos!! Though this cameras auto features get the job done amazing, there still is a level of skill required to take those instagram famous pictures you see all over the internet.  Sound quality has pretty high gain so you can keep your inside voice every where and the camera will pick up your voice and the surroundings fine.  The clicking noise caught in the video soundtrack issue that occurred on the g7x is almost completely eliminated.<br /><br />Auto focus was greatly inproced, though sill a bit of a hassle when on the go shooting.  Alot of those issues can be fixed by using the custom setting and tailoring it to your needs.<br /><br />It shoots in almost all recognized FPS settings to include 24 fps and 60 fps and allows for a wide variety of adjustments to shutter speed and ISO speed.<br /><br />The ISO ranges from 125 to 12800<br /><br />The ring that cops around the lens can he set to adjust zoom focus and practically any other setting in the menu <br /><br />Even in full zoom this camera takes some pretty detailed shots .<br /><br />This camera also has a simple wifi pic transfer that works with almost all handheld devices that have an app store.<br /><br />Built in flash makes for stunning and unbelievably detailed shots<br /><br />The exposure dial comes in clutch to make your pictures and videos just right.  This camera features a ton of adjustments for basic color and exposure correction (comparable to instagram editing capabilities) also this camera has a built in picture and video editor !! Very useful on the go.<br /><br />The hybrid auto mode has a cool story feature that you might want to look into  as well as a time lapse mode that shoots in image bursts to save your camera space.<br /><br />The camera starts up very fast for spontaneous shooting.<br /><br />The body is beautiful and gives the camera a modern twist in vintage compact cameras.<br /><br />The camera is about a third thicker then it's predecessor the g7x and is noticeably dense and heavier (which I like alot)<br /><br />If you vlog it's the best you can get. If your a seasoned photographer it gives you room to set the camera to your taste.  If you never owned a camera and wan to learn (which will take time) and if you don't mind breaking the bank it's not my first pick for a beginners camera but it's up there.<br /> I give this camera a 4.5 out of 5. And a 5 point and shoot camera in my opinion is around 2000 $. So I do recommend purchasing this.<br /><br />Let me know if I got any of the details wrong.<br /><br />","This camera is incredible. Not even just the best point and shoot camera I've ever had the privilege of owning, but one of the best cameras I've owned, period. Colors are true. Photos are crisp. Low light photos are impressive. Image stabilization is excellent. Focusing is incredibly fast. Very easy to use. Great battery life. Overall, an absolute gem of a camera!!","Terrific little camera.  Fully automatic modes work quite well, plus you can fully control the camera in manual mode.  Excellent lens for low light conditions.  Don't pay $799 for this camera - that's $100 more than the list price. Sad to see vendors exploiting the back order problem.  Shame on them.  You always have the option to order directly from Canon.","So far, this camera has been wonderful. I took it to film cosplayers this weekend at Denver Comic Con, and it was right there when I needed it. Full auto settings ended up very nice, although sometimes I would have to adjust a bit as I was over or under exposed. Throughout a strenuous weekend of turning the machine on and off, point, shoot, stop, point shoot again - it handled things like a champ. I've reviewed some of the footage, and so far it seems very stable overall (I do have practice at this so my hand is pretty steady at this point, but the digital stabilization made it that much smoother). This camera replaced my hefty xf-100 plus glide cam setup i've been using for years, and I have to say I did not miss it. This camera is responsive, takes great looking video (I did 1080 @ 60 fps), and is small enough to fit in my pocket. This is a must buy for YouTube creators and vloggers. Only gripe was I had one time where the auto focus was having trouble grabbing the right point of focus. But only one time, out of probably hundreds of times I pointed the camera at something over the weekend. For reference, I bought I high end SD card capable of 90 MB/s write speed. You'll want high write speed for video on this for sure.","The G7X Mark II, though not without flaws, is an excellent enthusiast compact. There have been some notable improvements over its predecessor.<br /><br />IMAGE QUALITY: Overall, very impressed with the exception of the Automatic White Balance. It seems to create a blue cast which is exacerbated by the flatter and less constrasty picture profiles. If you can live with manually setting the white balance, this camera creates excellent, sharp, colorful photos. Default JPEG noise reduction is a bit heavy-handed as well, but if you just set it to low you'll get much better results. You'll especially get excellent results from this camera is you utilize the in-camera raw processing tool, which is great. ISO performance is about the same as its predecessor. Even though the lens is the same as before, it seems as if Canon quietly made some improvements to it overall as its more consistently sharp throughout its range. It doesn't quite rise to the level of the lens on the RX100 series cameras but it's still plenty sharp and plus with the G7X Mark II you get the extra 30mm on the telephoto end, which is useful.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE: Autofocus performance has improved over its predecessor although it isn't what I would call lightning fast. Even though the camera touts improved burst performance, especially in RAW, this is not a camera I would rely on for action shooting. Shot to shot times are good and the camera starts up fast. One thing that has to be mentioned is the significant improvement in battery life. While it doesn't even come close to most DSLR, that fact that Canon could take the same small battery and give it noticeably better battery life is commendable.<br /><br />BODY/ERGONOMICS/BUTTONS/CONTROLS:  Overall I like most of the changes to the camera's overall design. The more pronounced grip up front is nice. I like that the LCD is more flexible than before which makes composing shots easier in bright, sunny conditions. I also like that you can switch the lens ring in the front to silent, that is a nice touch. The only thing I find irritating is that the ridged part on top of the LCD tends to collect dust and other particles very easily. And speaking of that, this lens, like other 1\" compacts, is very susceptible to getting dust/particles inside the lens. High recommend that you buy and extra lens cap in order to limit that from happening. I wish Canon would consider sealing the lens a little better on future models to counteract this issue.<br /><br />MENUS/WI-FI: The camera has a more EOS style menu system but overall the layout is pretty typical Canon. One thing that I like is the expanded picture style menu to include the new Fine Detail mode borrowed from the 80D. That does make a difference in JPEGs. As mentioned before, the in camera raw processing tool is great. You have all the parameters to adjust that you need and full access to the picture style menu. WIFI connectivity is very easy. The Canon camera connect app picked up the camera right away and transfer was quick.<br /><br />MOVIE MODE: Excellent video quality. Autofocus is not bad but did hunt just a little during a test video I shot with it.<br /><br />The $679.99 may seem like a pretty steep price to pay, you are getting a lot of camera for your money here. As long as you're ok with a maximum lens reach of 100mm, this makes a great alternative for a hobbyist who is considering a Canon Rebel but does not want the size/bulk and really won't venture much beyond the kit lens. It has a few flaws but overall, it's a great camera.","So far so good. Had an issue with the digital zoom being disabled. Found out through trial-n-error that if you are shooting in RAW the digital zoom is disabled. That would be nice to mention in the manual.","Pre ordered this in May and was very excited to get it when it came out. The camera has not let me down as it takes incredible pictures. The auto focus is incredibly fast and precise. It does an incredible job in low light and overall the functionality is incredible for a point and shoot camera. Very happy with this purchase! It would be nice if Canon were to provide a little wind screen for the microphone. You can shoot in RAW or JPEG or both. It can't do 4k, but the video is very smooth at 60fps. If you're looking for a point and shoot, this is it.","I can't be bothered reading all the documentation so I needed a camera which took great pictures by itself. Years ago I was into all the manual settings stuff but I haven't  the time or patients. Camera is great full auto.. also the Case Logic DCB-302 Compact Case for Camera - Black fits perfect if not just a bit snug","I love, love, love this little camera.  My Canon 7D has been gathering dust for a while just because I replaced it with the C100 for video then moved to the GH4 which has been my favorite camera for the past year.  Bought the Sony A7S - great for low light but don't use it much.  I love the size of this thing and it has been taking great photos and videos.  The image stabilization is fantastic.  I was surprised at how quickly it comes on ready to shoot.  Great for Vlogging camera.  The only thing I don't like is that there is no external input to add my Rhode mic so you can't direct sound.  If you have the camera close to you like you do when Vlogging, it's fine.  Thus far the focusing has been quick and accurate.  I was also surprised at how well it does in low light.  I have literally been carrying this thing everywhere.  It definitely isn't on the same plane as my C100 or GH4 won't replace these cameras for professional interviews etc but will be great for a second camera or B-roll.  Actually, if it had an external mic input I could do a lot with this thing.  I like that it doesn't draw attention like my other rigs do.  I can get some great shots and video without people even realizing that I'm rolling.  My two favorite things are the fast power up time and the image stabilization.","Very cool camera. Good images.","I am a hobby shooter, but prefer quality and do a lot of YouTube videos. For background, I've had a variety of different camcorders, point-and-shoots, and DSLRs: Sony RX100 III, Nikon D5300, D3200, Canon Vixia lower end series, Go Pro Silver 4, three-axis gimbals, etc etc. After having tried out all of these cameras over the last 4-5 years, the Canon G7X Mark II is the closest thing I've seen to the total package. It's lightweight and ultra-portable -- small enough to fit in your jeans pocket -- but packs a tremendous punch, and is loaded with features.<br /><br />The f1.8 aperture is very sharp at 24MM, though I find that the camera likes to default to f/2, and when shooting manual I need to make a slight adjustment if I want the 1.8. Autofocus is fantastic; virtually seamless in most settings. In low light it takes a second. I also found when trying to manually focus two objects about 2 feet apart on a table (a cup and a candle) that it struggled to focus on the foreground item (hunting) until I corrected by hand.<br /><br />As far as the image quality goes on this guy, it's tremendous, and if you spend some time learning how to use it, it will replicate a Nikon 5xxx or Canon t series very well, without the bother of a bunch of different lenses. Night shooting is great, and it's very easy to do timelapses and get quality images of the night sky.<br /><br />The 24-100mm (35mm equivalent) zoom range is fantastic, and you really don't notice the camera stopping down from 1.8 to 2.8 across the zoom. The digital zoom (beyond the 4.2 optical) is also fairly usable for at least the first little bit, though at full digital zoom it is very grainy.<br /><br />Noise comes in around 1600 ISO, but you can adjust some other settings to deal with that; really you're probably good for most everything until around 2000 ISO.<br /><br />Other Pros:<br /><br />- Fantastic touch screen that's very responsive. I haven't owned many past cameras that use a touch screen for so many settings, but this guy is able to deal with most everything right on the screen.<br />- The swivel screen is nice, and I've found myself using the downward tilt for high shots more than I expected.<br />- Very simple wifi connection to your phone or computer makes getting shots on instagram (or wherever) a breeze.<br />- Though others have complained about hearing the autofocus sound during video recording, I have not heard it yet. Unless you're in dead silence and need the sound off the camera, I don't think it'd ever be a problem.<br />- An incredible amount of presets for multiple shooting situations make it so the novice will not need to fiddle with manual settings much (if ever).<br />- The low light performance on this camera is absurdly good. I'm frankly not sure how they do it. I was sitting in a chair in my living room in what was nearly pitch black, and the camera was able to light the shot to the point that it looked like the room was fully lit. No noise. It's bizarre (and awesome!) how good this thing shoots in low light.<br />- The weight. So much power in a package you can bring with you just about anywhere.<br />- Unlike the first edition, with the Mark II you can shoot in the \"film quality\" 24p, which I tend to enjoy.<br /><br />Other Cons:<br />- The bokeh is good on this camera for the most part, getting very high quality bokeh/background blur if your foreground and background images are 6 or more feet apart. If you're trying to distinguish between two items closer together, it still works well until about 2 feet apart, but the bokeh is not as creamy or DSLR quality. Within 2 feet, it's hit-or-miss.<br />- The battery is simply not capable of supporting what this camera can do. They probably needed a battery twice its size, so buy at least one extra battery.<br />- I might be doing something wrong, but have so far only been able to set the lens ring to adjust aperture or shutter speed. It will not adjust zoom or manual focus as I thought I'd be able to do.<br />- The touchscreen manual focus is nice, but trying to adjust it without touch focusing is very cumbersome.<br />- No 4K, but I don't find that to be a huge negative honestly.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Overall, this thing is a beast, and with just a few more tweaks could probably become a full DSLR replacement for just about everyone except full-time professional photographers. If you're doing anything up to and including serious, routine videography, this thing has horsepower and built-in capabilities to do the job. I'll be selling my NIkon D5300 and accompanying lenses and using this as a full-time shooter for a while. I've yet to find any deal-breaking limitation.<br /><br />Finally, I bought this off Amazon, because it seems to be backordered everywhere. If you have an eBay account, I got mine from \"Red Tag Camera\", who shipped and delivered to me in two days. They still had six in stock as of Tuesday, so you might want to check there if you want one soon.","I'm really liking this camera so far.  It's super fast and takes great pictures.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn't seem to be able to take still pictures while recording video.  A lot of much cheaper point and shoot cameras can do this, and I believe the original G7X even had this functionality.  I sure hope that Canon can add this in a firmware update.","This review has nothing technical about the camera. I am  great grandmother who loves to take pictures. This camera meets or exceeds my expectations of what a good picture is, the colors are vibrant, clarity is excellent, image stabilization is very good.<br /> I was even able to connect my camera with my iPad, the Canon site, and Facebook without any help from my tech savvy children, or grandchildren (although it did take me a couple of hours). This was not expected with such a new release.<br /> If you are looking for a camera that takes great pictures that you can share effortlessly, this very well may be your next new camera.","Background, I bought this camera from other vendor, I shoot for fun, no one buys my photos, this is my 2nd P&S camera, the first being a very old Canon IXUS (international version) I got almost 15 years ago, I also have a 5D and use iPhone. I mainly shoot in M or Av mode and use app for detailed control on iPhone. I tried multiple other P&S, mirrorless, DSLR at store but never own any.<br /><br />This review is personal preference, not discussion about specs which has already been reviewed everywhere.<br /><br />What I like about this camera<br /><br />1) G7X MKII is very very well made, sturdy and light. Give me a feeling that it could even survive a drop!<br />2) Screen is gorgeous, I see people worried about exclusion of view-finder. I was out shooting today after lunch, cloudless and sunshine, I didn't have any problem with the screen, nice contrast and color, honestly, I didn't see any need for a view finder.<br />3) Touch function is useful in moving focus frame, since there seems to be no better way to do this. However, when the screen is extended out, I find  it sometimes hard to be precise in touch, due to hand shake. (no magnifying for focus, unlike EOS M)<br />4) Tilt screen, extremely useful when you need it, very well made mechanism for steady movement.<br />5) Nice lens range for my need, 24-100mm, this lens is very sharp from outdoor to modest indoor situation! Focus is generally super quick, in very low light situation, it could take 1-2 second hunting, but get the job done in the end. (manual focus is bit hard to use I found, focus peaking is available to help)<br />6) Front control ring, it is very well placed and there's no awkwardness in reaching the ring. It can be assigned to different function for different needs, record and ring func button are also programmable for different shooting mode. I myself assign metering and ISO using these two buttons while shooting in M mode, very happy with the button location, easy to reach.<br />7) IS, very satisfied with the results in video, hand held and very smooth.<br />8) Fun stuff, SCN mode, I like panning, it's easy to use and fun, but only for jpeg.<br />9) Raw continuous shooting, about at where Canon claims, decent FPS for my use.<br />10) WIFI button is well-placed, no worry about accidental activation.<br />11) Decent time-lapse.<br /><br />What I don't like about this camera<br /><br />1) Battery is atrocious, I got about 130 in first charge and 140 in second charge shooting RAW?! Seriously?<br />2) Fun stuff in SCN, honestly, other than panning, I don't like any other mode in SCN. First of all they are in jpeg. For example, star mode, Canon may be over confident in their algorithm to deal with these delicate situations, and the final result is just not there yet. Since it's jpeg, post-processing is almost impossible.....Then, I compare shooting in M mode and in SCN mode and I see very little impact in these \"shortcut mode\", like night scene or portrait. Third, how hard it is to do miniature in post-processing or iPhone? SCN mode overall is just not very inspiring.<br /><br />Other<br />1) Background blur, i guess you cannot ask too much when the sensor is only 1\", so equivalent aperture needs calculation just like equivalent focal length, at telephoto range, there's some decent background blur, but at wide-angle range, forget about it (unless you're super close)<br />2) Dynamic range, don't push too hard, it gives decent results (I don't like HDR mode in G7X MKII)<br /><br />Overall, I feel that this is a very decent P&S camera and I like lots of features. However, I'm not very inspired by it at the moment, it's like being sandwiched between iPhone and DSLR/Prosumer mirrorless, trying to go both direction but not quite reaching either end. I feel I can not relax as much as I want to from DSLR and yet can not quite get the lightness when using iPhone.<br /><br />I attached some photos, RAW file zeroed and converted to JPEG, no post-processing except the panning which is jpeg natively. I never tried any Sony or Panasonic's direct competitor so I can not offer any comparison.","FYI: I got this yesterday morning so it's about 24 hours in, I have about 125 pictures on it so far...I will update as time goes on.<br /><br />My intended use for this camera is a \"bridge camera\".  I have a new iPhone and the requisite (meh) Olloclips for it, some Canon DSLR's and a Canon S120 for everything in between.<br />The G7X II is going to replace the Canon S120 in my collection as the unit that rides in the center console of my car in a case, or in my pocket at events I don't want to carry a DSLR at but still want some ok zoom and better than phone pictures.<br /><br />I am writing this early review because, I've been a Canon guy over the years. Had Canon P&S units starting with the digital ELPH through the S120 , and then more recently got into their DSLRs.  So yeah I like Canon, but for years I kept bought the Sony RX100's.  I really wanted to like the Sony but never quite \"got\" it.<br /><br />The G7X II, to me - while a little bigger handling than the RX100's, is finally the Canon P&S that does what I really hoped they would do.  It provides some incredible pictures that are actually better than the (current gen) RX100 finally.  The photos aren't as oversaturated as the Sony which I like, the IS works very consistently, and bokeh is of course great at the larger apertures. Higher iso (800 area) is still usable for smaller prints which is remarkable for a P&S of any sort. It shoots RAW fast and its shot-to-shot and burst modes are amazing.<br /><br />Regarding the RX100’s, their picture quality was amazing, their size was a bit larger than I cared for but, their controls, menus, options, and design (like paying extra for a 12$ grip!) annoyed me, then the whole buying a separate external charger thing to charge my spare battery, really?  I know its 30$ or whatever but it just got annoying ..they got returned. Really it was their menus and weird software that just irked me and I couldn't overlook it. The G7X bests that all.<br /><br />On the G7X II , controls are great and similar to any of the other \"red-ring' Powershot G series (or DSLR's, P&S, etc.).<br />Being able to adjust exposure comp and other settings with the hard controls while you can still use it one handed is great. I also love the fact they included a detent/non-detent switch for using the ring dial. That is BRILLIANT as heck since I can now get the stops I want when shooting manual stills, but the flexibility for seamless and silent zoom when in video.  Of course it also includes the silly wall charger Sony wouldn't, and out of box has a nice set of grips on it.  Did I mention the menuing, controls, and software are all Canon finally too? I mean...finally, stunning P&S photos without the Sony software layer ahhhhh.<br /><br />Comparing this to my Canon S120, its obviously faster, larger, but menus are very similar. The wireless on this thing is better and faster, and smarter. The touchscreen seems more accurate in sensitivity and color, the fact it articulates for selfie and variable angle modes is awesome, didn't think I would care much but that is really handy.<br />I have no idea on battery life yet but the fact you can charge this via microUSB is AWESOME for me.  Of course the fact I can charge a second battery in the (included) wall charger is very nice, thanks for not being weird about that Canon.<br />Oh the pictures? yeah...they are night and day over the S120 just using auto and scene modes.  Since this is a P&S unit, I love that I can shoot RAW with AUTO settings now.  Going into manual mode it becomes evident the G7x II has a bit more capable sensor than the S120, which is why I'm here anyways.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great pictures.<br />- Touch screen that works great and the touch to focus is awesome and quick.<br />- Great control set, GREAT grips, engineering, design, thinking.<br />- Nice flippable flash, easy to bounce in smaller spaces.<br />- Menu's are classic Canon, love it or hate it.<br />- MicroUSB charging (could be faster, but its in there!)<br />- Time lapse mode (have not explored yet, but looking forward to it)<br />- Would not call it a pocket camera but it can still be fit in a pocket (its big, it will bulge some in shorts, better for a coat or vest etc. but it fits), but all controls and functions are at least easy to use as a result of this.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No 4k video. Amazing video quality, but lack of 4k just seems like an oversight here. Not enough to push me away, but I'd have dropped another 100$-200$ for this.<br />- Size goes on both lists...yes is a bit large, but all those controls and electronics need somewhere to go. It's just not something I am going to hand to my wife without a case and expect her to carry when she takes our daughter to the zoo.  It needs a case, with some padding.<br />- Zoom (I am reaching here...just to keep the list somewhat balanced) I wouldn't have minded an 120mm equivalent here.  The 100 will still cause me to keep it because I hate the digital zoom on my phones.<br />- Wish it had GPS or at least a compass built in.<br /><br />Overall, I bought this thinking I would be disappointed and return it.  Instead I was pleasantly surprised and as of this moment I am planning on listing my S120 on eBay next weekend. If you are looking for a “simple” camera that has the ability to go where other P&S’s don’t quality wise, don’t mind a bit larger camera, or just want the P&S camera that makes you look like you know what you’re doing…I think the G7X II ticks those boxes.<br /><br />As I type this, my girl is at a family bridal shower with the G7X II.  She’s used my S120 for awhile now and just before she left I handed her the G7X II and said don’t worry - try this one (with no further instructions).  I asked how the new camera was working for her “things look better on this camera than they do in real life” , I was really expecting a “how do I” so…I guess it’s behaving well :)<br /><br />I will update this in the next week or so, if there is anything you’d like to see that could help improve this review let me know.<br />Thanks for your time, and for reading my review today.<br />-Chris","Just received the camera today, so these are really just first impressions:<br /><br />1.  The photos are beautiful, bright, crisp and sharp; 5-stars for photo quality.<br />2.  Windows 10 cannot display the RAW files (it can't do the 7D2 RAW files, either).<br />3.  Adobe RAW 9.5 cannot convert the G7X2 RAW files (it can do the 7D2 files).  The Canon software I have can't do it either.  How long before an Adobe update?<br />4.  There is no setting that I can find to shoot RAW + JPEG.<br />UPDATE:  You can set RAW + JPEG, but it's not intuitive.<br />5.  On its own, the camera doesn't play well with Windows 10.  Download the Camera Window software from Canon.  This will give you complete control for transferring images to the computer.  UPDATED 6/12/2016<br />6.  The manual implies that the Camera Window software is for WiFi transfer of images to a computer.  That's true, but it is also used for downloading via direct USB connection which is lightning fast, and in my opinion, preferable.  Once the download is complete, the USB battery charging function will commence.  UPDATED 6/12/2016<br />7.  As usual, the User's Manual is sketchy and not very useful.  It's difficult to find something specific in it.  There is a more complete .pdf version that can be downloaded from the Canon website.  UPDATED 6/12/2016<br /><br />Again, these are just first impressions.  I'll update this review was I get more experience with it.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/10/2016:<br /><br />After a morning on the internet, I have solved the RAW file problem.  In order to use PS or LR, Adobe Camera RAW v. 9.6 is required.  Earlier versions won't work with the G7X2.  You can download the zip file and install it from the Adobe website.  Then, depending on which editing software you are using, CC, PSE or LR, it may not install in the correct folder.  You'll have to move it.  In the Adobe community forum, search on G7X Mark II and you will find a post with instructions on how to do that.  I would have posted the links here, but I think Amazon strips them out.<br /><br />Now, I can actually use the images from the camera in my normal workflow.  That's huge, and for that I am adding two more stars.<br /><br />I am pleased with the photos it takes.  I have posted two images I took last night at sunset.  I wanted to see how it performed in low light.  I did no color editing at all.  I only adjusted exposure and lighting, added a little bit of sharpening and resized them.  There is some noise in the shots, but the finished images are not bad.  There is also some lens distortion, apparent when there are straight verticals near the edges.  It's correctable in editing, but since that crops the image, you will want to add a little extra in the framing.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/12/2016:<br /><br />Now that I have the camera/computer environment functioning, I took it downtown with me this morning on a real shakedown cruise.  I have added several photos from the Cap Sante Marina in Anacortes, Washington.  I usually shoot aperture priority, but all of these were taken on \"Auto\" to see how it would do.  I am tickled to death with the photos the camera is producing.  There is one thing I am noticing.  My 7D2 (I think it uses dual Digic 6 processors) tends to over-saturate reds and magentas.  This camera is not doing that.  On Auto, it is also balancing the highlights and shadows very nicely without blowing out the skies.  Again I got some lens distortion, but it was easily corrected in editing.  Someone here asked about focus speed.  I have no complaints in that regard.  One thing that is a little slow is the recovery time after shooting compared to the 7D2.  With that camera, I can take several shots in rapid succession.  Shooting Raw + JPEG with the G7X2, there is a noticeable lag before it can fire again which is sometimes annoying.  For a pocket camera, however, that's really not a big deal.  Overall, I am delighted with this camera.  I debated between getting the Sony or waiting for this one.  I chose this one primarily for the longer tele range and because I am already in the Canon ecosystem.  Now that I have actually used it, and seen the photos it produces, I am glad I did.","Update: The swell came up and and we went camping. This allowed me to take more photos in addition to my previous side by side comparison. I did not edit any of these even though some could use it. Hope this helps!<br /><br />Review: Well, I just received this camera and it fills a long needed niche in my collection: a quality point and shoot. As background, I have a Canon 7d with multiple lenses and a few underwater point-and-shoot cameras (including Nikon Coolpix and an Olympus). Also, for simple convenience and impromptu photos I still use with my Nexus smartphone. What I have been missing is something to take with me that takes quality photos but fits in my pocket. It has to be better than my smart phone and my waterproof-proof point and shoots. So should I have bothered? Absolutely.<br /><br />The auto-focus is fast and crisp and the photos don’t suffer from the same blurry or noise-ridden colors that my waterproof cameras often do. The Aperture/Shutter/Manual modes allow me to have the basic controls that a full size DSLR allows.In terms of image quality: all of my cameras take good sunny photos of still objects. At night, most of them suffer. This little Canon does well. It can quickly focus at night and the images turn out much clearer and brighter. Only the 7d does better for obvious reasons. It’s nice having a small camera that takes quality photos. Really nice! I like that the camera turns on quickly too. Some of my older point and shoots took a few seconds and by that time the moment was often over. I can’t compare this to other similar cameras like the Sony Cybershot but I figured I’d get this one since camera companies seem to keep leapfrogging each other with each new release. If I ever get the Sony (probably the next release) I’ll try to do a photo comparison of the two.<br /><br />Things I like about this camera:<br />+ Aperture/Shutter/Manual control of DSLR camera in a pocket size<br />+ Quick Start<br />+ Quick focus<br />+ Crisp, low noise images, even at night<br />+ Focus using the touchscreen<br />+ Ability to shoot in RAW format<br /><br />Things I wish were different:<br />- Charging adapter for charging directly in the camera is not included. Can’t tell if I can use a regular USB power charger. (External charger is included).<br />- Trouble opening the RAW files in Photoshop. Fixed with an update!<br /><br />Update: I uploaded some sample photos that I took in the evening to show how it performs. The comparison pair of photos should be interpreted with some understanding: The Nikon is a cheaper underwater camera so it has to sacrifice performance somewhere. I have been able to get clear photos from the Nikon but it takes a lot more work. The main conclusion of my review is basic:if you have a regular point and shoot and want clearer photos (especially in more challenging conditions like action or night) then this camera will do it. Perhaps this is just as important as comparing tiny differences between similar models. I hope this helps!"]},{"name":"Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II","amazon_reviews":["Yeah, well, this is the item!

Each person has their own wants and needs for what they want to do with a camera and how they want to do it.  So first up about me...  I can shoot what I want when I want, and although I sell my work it hardly pays for itself.  I usually don't know what I want to shoot so I like to  use a walkaround lens that can cover most of what I might want to shoot.  I don't like lens changing so I often walk around with two cameras, either different type (maybe IR) or different lense types (e.g., long zoom and walkaround).  I hate tripods.  I don't do sports photography.  I will not buy old-style DSLR cameras -- I love electronic viewfinders and hate flipping mirrors.<br /><br />My cameras before I bought this one were Olympus OMD EM-5, Sony A77, Panasonic G1 converted to infrared.  I didn't \"need\" a camera but was looking.  I don't want full frame (lens size, weight, and cost).  Sony has recently spent most of their efforts on full frame and so far I don't like their crop sensor cameras plus I'd have to buy all new lenses for any new Sony camera.  I was more and more using the Olympus day to day. It is lighter than the Sony and did what I wanted to do.<br /><br />In an idea world, what would I want?  low noise and image stabilization.  Partly because I hate tripods but also because there are lots of places you either can't take tripods or they would not be convenient or welcome.  I talk about monopods and have one but I don't use that either very much...<br /><br />I also like features and customization.  Also weather sealing and sturdiness are nice because  I don't baby my cameras...<br /><br />This is not a formal review but comments about this camera from my own perspective and needs. There are lots of formal reviews available now and you can read the specs yourself.<br /><br />I love this camera primarily because of its marvelous image stabilization.  I can hold at least 2 seconds with this camera.  I've taken photos that I absoutely could not take without a tripod with my other cameras (Sony A77 and Olympus OMD EM-5).  Also the noise levels are lower than the other cameras and the noise is easier to handle in noise reduction programs.  This will allow me to shoot at higher ISO than I have previously felt comfortable with using.<br /><br />I like the feel of it.  It has a better grip than the EM-5.  Yes it is larger and heavier, but well, you can't have everything in one camera.  I like customization and this camera is excellent for that.  Many buttons can be set to whatever you want.  All you have to do is remember what you did...  It also has three custom modes which you can set and put on the mode dial.  (That is one less than the EM-1 Mark I.)<br /><br />There are a couple of things I am disappointed in.  One is the loss of scene mode.  Apparently Olympus claims this is a \"professional\" camera and no professional would use scene modes.  However, professionals will use ART modes?  They have them already programmed because they are in the EM-1 Mark I and my EM5 and they could be an option for the ART mode dial position since they are out of dial space.  Why do I care? Primarily for the multi-shot functions such as panorama and night shots.  I do use both of those on my Sony.<br /><br />It does have autoHDR but it is limited to ISO 200 (you can set the ISO for Sony's autoHDR).  Admittedly you can get away with a lot with this camera because of its marvelous IS.  I was experimenting with various things in a church and selected autoHDR and pressed the button.  As soon as I did I realized I was in trouble because of the slowness of the clicking.  So I was very pleasantly surprised when I got home that it came out fine despite the long shutter speeds.  And I wasn't even particularly trying to stabilize myself at the time because I had  no idea that setting would not choose a suitable ISO.<br /><br />If you want to take multiple shots for HDR in post, options are very easy to get to with the standard button assignments.<br /><br />I love to watch and photograph birds but have not been serious about it because of the required equipment (weight, price, size, required tripod).  I may now try harder with birds with this camera.  Especially using the new \"pro capture\" mode.  In this mode the camera starts buffering images when you half-press the shutter.  When you press the shutter fully it saves the last ones it stored plus starts taking more if you keep pressing the shutter.  Much better chance to get just what you want, rather than what happened after...<br /><br />I've not yet tried focus bracketing but I can see that could be very useful to me in landscape photograhy.  It also supports focus stacking ( combined in the camera) but I don't currently have a lens supported for this feature.  I have not tried the high res mode except to see if it worked...<br /><br />The price?  You have to decide for yourself.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.","I am a professional photographer and very demanding of equipment. I use Nikon's for most of my work but was looking for something more compact than a D5 (or at the time D4) for travelling and for situations where a large noisy camera was unsuitable. I bought the original EM5 and although it was a good travel and vacation camera, its low light performance and speed of use (or lack of speed)  made it unsuitable for any serious work. The OMD EM1 was a vast improvement but was still unimpressive in focusing on any sort of high speed action in anything other than perfect lighting. I did however love the camera and in particular the pro series of lenses, sharp, lightweight and superb build quality. ( I sold a Fuji X Pro 1 after a few months because of the awful autofocus and the tinny lenses) Now Olympus have done it, fast, dual card slots (the single slot in the EM1 made it unsuitable for Pro work without a backup camera) autofocus seems superb, I have yet to try it in Theatre conditions where I do most of my work, but test shots in low light show a vast improvement. Build quality is on a par with the previous camera and everything is where it should be. Still don't like the menu's, should have just copied Nikon or Canon. Although the level of customisation is vast it would be much better if most of the obscurities were tucked away, out of sight unless needed. In fairness once you understand how the thing works there are plenty options for storing presets, but it's still a faff. I am some way away from abandoning my D5 or D500 but if I were shooting a wedding I could easily see this as the first camera and look forward to testing it in the heat of serious battle. Although I have the 12-40 and 40-150 I am seriously tempted by the 12-100 because of its additional built in stabilisation, the 300mm is as stunning as the camera and benefits from the same stabilisation.","Had a lot of nice cameras in 40 years of photography, but this is my favorite. Not too big, not too small, just right in so many ways. When I had the original E-M1, I loved to travel with the Lumix 20mm f/1.7 mounted and it could 'disappear' when I wanted it to. Mount the Zuiko Digital 150mm f/2, and it has some new tricks up its sleeve.<br />  This camera is not the best choice for those who are occupied by the lore of the 'Full Frame' (sic) sensor, its for photogs with a sense of relativity. This camera is not a fetish, styled to attract dilettantes, its intended for shooters who value practicality. Its best not to hammer this camera, like some might (legitimately) need to hammer their C/N flagship. Yes, its for Pros, but not that particular kind. While it is very well built and well protected, this technological marvel must give away some design durability, in order to provide both portability AND (yes) affordability.<br />  This is a very flexible camera, but diving deep into its menu is for the brave, because with unparralleled configurability, comes complexity. But once you figure it out, set it up, and emerge from that 'heart of darkness', it can be your extension. Improving on the original E-M1 so dramatically, in every way, many wondered why it was merely designated a 'Mk II'...Olympus is quirky. Its High Resolution Mode is capable of capturing breathtaking detail, IF the sharpest lenses and the best settings and techniques are employed.<br />  This camera is the digital extension of a photographic philosophy, conceived at Olympus, by the great Yoshihisa Maitani, the designer of the renown and transformative Pen and OM systems. I believe he would be proud of the E-M1. I am proud, and very fortunate to own it.<br /><br />Photo sample is an early long exposure test of the high res mode, which also greatly reduces noise. Straight out of camera, but down sampled.","Best M4/3 camera available, a must have Olympus camera.","I thought about this upgrade for a long time due to the price (for the price, should I just move on to a new platform?)  But in the end, because of all the lenses I have already invested into M43, I decided to still upgrade to this system (my first one was a Panasonic GF1, second one is a OMD EM5, this will be my third).  The reason I choose this over the latest Panasonic system is for the speed.  I figure since my goal as an amateur photographer is to capture as many good photos as I can, I might as well get one which has the speed to increase my chances of doing so.<br />So far I am extremely pleased with the build quality of the camera, it feels super solid.  I am also very pleased with the speed of the camera which I think as enabled me to capture some great expressions and also moving birds I have tested in my two days of testing.  I will try to post an update after a month of so of use and upload photos at a later time.  I have to say though, I am not sure this is best bang for the buck as I haven't tried or use any of the other latest M43 flagships so please take my review with some caveat.","Excellent camera, but manual has 194 pages. A little complicated camera control. Who wants to read it if no experience with Olympus cameras ?","I stepped into the realm of Micro 4/3 from Dslr's solely to take advantage of the portability, sacrificing the highest possible image quality for the ability & ease of having my camera with me ALL the time. My thought was that many great pictures far outweighed a few awesome pictures(which I could still get with my Dslr.) The progression from OMD-EM5 might naturally have been to OMD-EM1 eventually leading to this mark ll.  But, I have come to the conclusion that this camera is not the portable M4/3 camera that the first EM5 was.  While Full Frame and APS-C sensor cameras have been getting smaller and lighter, the Olympus M4/3's have been getting larger especially if you couple them with any of the new pro series lenses. I returned this camera because when it was sitting on my desk next to my Pentax K3 it was about the same size.  Yes its a great camera, the most capable M4/3 yet. Its very versatile and fast focusing with somewhat better resolution than the previous 16mp version. But, it is no longer extremely portable, definitely not light and pocket-able like my original EM5. I don't really shoot video(the files are just too big to store) and I am not one to lug around a lot of heavy pro lenses - mostly just fast primes.  On some occasions I do take landscape photos but a full frame camera is better at capturing the detail, depth of field and subtle qualities of light and color.  So the EM1 ll has now developed into a camera that doesn't fit my needs anymore. In turn, I purchased a Pen F for half the amount. It doesn't have a weather sealed body and the new TruePic™ VIII Dual Quad Core Processor, and obviously doesn't shoot as fast - BUT it has the same 20mp sensor AND it's light and portable like my original EM5.  I believe that the M4/3 sensor has reached its image quality limit, and my partner camera to my Pen-F will have a full frame sensor because there are many quality small versions to choose from.  If Olympus weather seals the Pen F ll along with adding the Dual Quad Core Processor and resolves a few manual dial design issues(I know if, if, if.) But, my point is that I am sure I won't be the only one to head back to the smaller camera for the sake of portability.  For now, I am happy that there was another option since I am invested in the M 4/3 lenses.  To me, the strongest reason to choose the mark ll is to take advantage of the 2x crop factor. So, if you primarily shoot with long reach lenses; 150-300mm in micro 4/3 = 300-600mm in full frame, that is where this camera shines.","This is a great camera.  Love how fast it is and accurate.<br />I have had some disappointments however.  When using the FL-900R or FL-600R flash, I've noticed that the camera does not respond correctly and will exhibit unwanted freezes in the viewfinder (times vary from 5 to 15 seconds) when there is a large contrast between where you first pointed the camera to a different location.  When trying to focus on a low-light area, camera will quickly focus on a random area, and even flash.  When I try to focus, pushing the shutter button half-way, it will be non responsive in that low-light area for focusing.  I also have a PEN-F camera, and previously a OM-D E-M1 and these cameras work great with the above flashes.  When contacting Olympus, they told me some settings to set. I had to have the \"AF Focus Adj.\"  to -18 and the flashes worked most of the time.  But why would a person have to do that?  Note however, the bundled flash that comes with the camera will work fine.  It's just that the FL-900R or FL-600R flashes have their own focusing light, that appears to not work correctly in these high contrast areas when the flashes are mounted on the camera.<br /><br />Also, please note that if you have adapters that allow you to use Canon lenses, like the metabones SpeedBooster Ultra 0.71x, that this camera will not work.  According to metabones, \"The optical element of our SpeedBoosters and the sensor of this camera is too close.\"  That was a disappointment since my Pen F and old OM-D E-M1 worked fine with the Speedbooster.<br /><br />But for the most part, I really like the camera.  I only hope Olympus fixes the issue with there higher end FL-900R or FL-600R flashes.","So why -- given I'm already deeply committed to my full-frame Sony a7rII -- am I messing around with a Micro 4/3 camera from Olympus? Because this is the ne plus ultra wildlife camera in ANY mirrorless format, full-frame, APS-C or whatever. The new Sony OMD-E M1 Mark II shoots raw frames way faster than my Sony and way beyond when any other camera groans enough. And the image quality blew me away from the very first time I trained it on a Carolina Wren. Look! This was taken in December, near the solstice. I shot the eagle in early January. And the best part is that the M43 format lens I used for both shots is small and light enough to carry anywhere.","Great camera. Love it so far.","I read all the reviews and was expecting a super camera. I found that this camera is amazing and I've hardly use it so far, it fits in my hand like a talor made glove. It's quiet and fast I grabbed shots out of the box with no effort at all. I can see though thet it's going to take some time to learn all of it's features. I look forward to it, it's been fun from the start. You can believe most of the reviews this is a great camera.","Fantastic. Had the previous model and this is light years better.","plain awesome.","I have been a photographer for 40+ years.  Digital photography for 20 of those years.  I bought one of the first digital camera available in Florida (Miami, special order, Kodak).  In my entire career, I have never been as impressed with a camera body as I am with the EM-1 MK 2.  I retired (sold) my Nikon D3 and all my G glass and switched to the micro 4/3'rds format.  Bought the EM-1 and was very impressed at first but soon found the limitations in speed and auto-focus tracking that had me re-thinking my move.  ALL of my short comings were solved with this new body.  The IQ has always been sufficient but has markedly improved.  The camera is just about as perfect as it could get.  I think in all fairness to Olympus, this camera body really should have not been a mere upgrade but, perhaps, an entirely new body.  I say this because it truly is. A magnificent new body that quite frankly solved all of my complaints and has me pondering all of it's potential.  If your sitting \"on-the-fence\" jump off and go grab your wallet.  This machine ROCKS, and that's just simply a fact!  Solidly impressed, way pleased beyond expectations.  This camera is a bargain.  It should have been more money and sooner or later, when the word got around, those that can really use something like this, would have dug deeper in the pocket and found a way!  Do it, you will be glad you did!","First impressions, light, fast and so many buttons. Feature rich and all around fast performance. Paired with the 12-40 pro lens tested it out with my pup playing with toddler niece and nephew. Low light fast movement, this camera keeps up.<br />Low noise on high 3200 ISO. Yes it is not a full frame, but the compact size trade-off debate is a dead horse.<br />It is full of advanced shooting modes, but I have yet to test them all. The Android sharing app works, haven't tested tethering mode.<br />Yes it is expensive but a compact, ie jacket pocket, And very impressive camera.<br />I will update with test shots.","I'm an Oly E-M10 Mk I shooter, so this is a huge upgrade. These are only preliminary impressions, which I'll edit as time goes by with longer term tests. Currently testing some of the more vaunted features with my 12-40 F/2.8 Pro lens while waiting on the 12-100 to be in stock somewhere. I'm writing from a perspective of a somewhat experienced photographer. Not a master by any means, but I shoot in manual, raw, and do a lot of OCF work, mostly portraits. It may also amuse you to read my older camera reviews and see my, er, growth (?) as a photographer over the years. :) Onto the review!<br /><br />The exterior is very solid. The grip is much, much improved. There's no gap between my fingers and the grip like there was with the M10, and I know with the M1-I. Everything feels more solid too. I know it's weather sealed, and have seen many reviews and videos of early, promo shooters in Iceland, dropping their body & lens in freezing water with no ill effects. The M10 always felt a bit flimsy to me, and in fact have had some parts come off/fall apart (eye piece, hot shoe plate).  All the flaps for the battery, SD Cards (2! Thank you, Olympus!), USB 3 (and type C), mic & headphone (again, thank you , Olympus!) jacks have a good feel to them, as is the fully articulated (3rd thanks!) LCD screen. Only potential downside is if you have the mic and/or headphones plugged in, you won't be able to flip the screen over for selfie-mode on the fly.<br /><br />Fair IQ tests will have to wait, since I don't have a raw converter yet (still on LR 5.7, LR CC has early support, no lens correction as of this writing). DxO Mark had some tests done, and it looks like a tiny increase in high ISO quality over the M1-I, nothing huge, but going from 16 MP to 20 MP will net you a bit more resolution. Maybe a bit more noise if you pixel peep, but if you compare, say, an 8x10 to 8x10, you'll find a better overall image. But I'm not too worried about high ISO shoots, because...<br /><br />The stability is a giant leap over my M10, since it only had 3-axis IBIS. I can't say for sure how much better the M1-II is over the M1-I, but I did some 1 sec hand held exposures at 12mm no problem. (Edit: I've now pulled off an 8 sec (!!!) hand-held shot with my 25mm 1.8, while leaning against a doorframe). I've seen on YouTube a 10sec(!) and a 20sec(!!) hand held exposures with just the body braced against a wall. That latter was paired with the 12-100mm F/4, which gives you an extra stop of stability, but even with a \"mere\" 5.5 stops of stability, you should be able to get a 12mm, 1 sec exposure for still scenes just by following the reciprocal rule. That is frankly mind blowing. So maybe if you're shooting action in low light, you'll miss having a FF camera, but for still scenes or even portraits, I don't think you'll have issues with image quality.<br /><br />The menu system is, well, it's Olympus. If you're used to previous Oly models, you'll be able to figure things out. The controls are fairly instinctive (again, for Oly shooters) and very customizable--far more than the M10. Some people complain about the mode dial lock, but I absolutely love it, since I rarely take it out of M, but sometimes I'll brush the dial by accident and then wonder why I can't set my shutter or aperture properly. I do have to get used to the power switch being in a new location. New battery is huge. Should last most people a day easily.I got a spare anyway.<br /><br />I'll next update this review when I get a fully supported raw converter, and also when I can pair it with the 12-100mm for the added stability, especially for video shooting, but I'm expecting very good things. There's also a ton of action photography features I need to test, including the ludicrous 60 FPS shooting and the Pro Capture mode where it starts buffering when you press the shutter 1/2 way down. I'm planning on an ice skating shoot in late January (2017), so stay tuned. For now, my initial findings are:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Solid, weather sealed exterior<br />Ridiculous stability, makes up for the need for high ISO shooting for many situations<br />Dual SD slots<br />Video-friendliness: 4K, mic & headphone jacks, fully articulating LCD<br />Tons of excellent Olympus glass with which to pair, and now some combined lens stability too, Really looking forward to testing the 12-100mm F/4 and the 25mm F/1.2 (no lens stability though).<br />18 FPS with C-AF, 60(!) w/S-AF, all in raw.<br />Bigger, better battery. Faster charging too.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price. Only you can determine if this camera is \"worth it\". To me, yes, absolutely. but $2K USD is a lot of money.<br />For this price, you may honestly expect better high ISO performance.<br />Base ISO is 200. There's extended, but I really wanted a 100 or even 64 base ISO.<br />Only 1 SD slot is UHS-II.<br />Kinda bad placement for the mic/headphone jacks for the articulating LCD.<br />Can't reuse old battery.<br /><br />Other:<br />This is probably THE flagship micro 4/3 camera body, with maybe an edge for video to the Panasonic GH series, but for stills, or even combining stills & video, the M1-II is the new king. Whether M4/3 works for you is a different story, and way too long to write about here.","Has replaced my Panasonic GH4 for shooting 4K video.  Footage is brighter and more accurately colorful than the GH4, plus a tad sharper, especially in Cinema4K mode, and best of all - no need for a tripod!  Despite the added complexity of this Olympus model, the menu is more intuitive so I don't have much trouble finding the settings I want. There's a precision, quality feel to all the levers and dials.  Negatives -  I can only think of a couple minor ones - the viewfinder has some green tint to it and the continuous auto focus when shooting video is a tad sluggish as times (may be related to the lens I have been using).","If you don't mind the money, get it.<br />I've tried panasonic fz2500,g85,sony rx10iii, olympus em5ii, nikon d5500, nikon d500.  My absolute favorite for my upcoming trip to Africa was the d500, HOWEVER this camera is my ultimate favorite. ISO 6400 pictures look great (at least for my comparisons of tons of pictures from all these cameras.)  I know its expensive.  I can't argue that, but if you have the money and want a light camera system that takes phenomal pictures, this is tough to beat.  i have the panasonic 12-35/2.8 35-100/2.8 and 100-400 lenses.  The weight of the entire system is the same as one low aperture nikon zoom lens.<br /><br />Update... I want to be fair. High iso is verrrry close to em5ii. In fact unless you care about ergonomics or high speed shooting you're fine with em5ii. I will probably use the em 5 II as my backup body for Africa."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 V","amazon_reviews":["I had this camera for a week - purchased from Dell, who sent it to me from a 3rd party. There were things I absolutely loved about it, making me want to ditch the DSLR entirely. Wicked fast focus, super fast shots, and that aperture range! The first problem I encountered was in my daughters room, putting her to bed, it couldn't figure out the right color balance (super orange cast), at $1000 my anxiety started being piqued slightly. Then at my daughters ballet performance, it was taking over 1 full second to process each picture. The final straw was that it started taking shots, but when I went to view what I'd previously taken, it said \"image not available\" or something to that affect. And sure enough, there was NO image, not even my computer could see/download any of the pics I knew I'd just taken.  The build quality is also strange - it seems if this camera even takes 1 fall, you could break the screen off, or the pop up view finder, or the flash. They're as fragile as paper origami. And yet a part of me wants to buy another one and see if that one iteration was just a bad fluke, the pictures (when you get to keep them) are SO great!  And the video straight out of the camera feel like Hollywood ready shots - that fast lens mixed with lightening speed focus is just unbelievable. But then when you are backlit, as so often you are, it seriously struggles. I wonder if you can set the focal points for spot metering in video mode. That should solve the problem. I sent it back too early to find out.","An almost perfect camera.

But, in the end, I opted for the bulkier, similarly priced Sony A6300 for one reason only: the RX100 V lacks a hotshoe or 3.5 mm microphone jack; the A6300 has both.<br /><br />The key reason to spend this amount of money on a compact camera has to be 4K video - there are other similarly compact but much cheaper options if high quality photos plus HD video are all you want (in particular, Sony's RX100 III) - and, if you're intending to shoot 4K video, you need the option to attach an external microphone to bypass the camera's tiny on-board mic. Sure, in point & shoot situations you may not want the time or bother involved in sticking a mic on the camera but then for this type of more \"casual\" video 4K is probably an unnecessary luxury. But, to me, the only reason to buy a 4K capable camera is because you want the best video available and, if you do, choosing a camera that doesn't allow you any option to elevate its audio to similarly high quality levels doesn't make sense - hence my decision to forego the RX100's form factor benefits for the A6300's audio inputs.<br /><br />Shame, because with a hotshoe & mic jack the RX100 V would be an unbeatable offering. Question is, will Sony find a way of fitting these two audio inputs into a similarly sized RX100 VI?","The RX100 line is revolutionary. This is the 5th gen.

It should rock solid with NO play.<br />- improve the design of the screen tilt so it can be opened and facing down all the way at 90 degrees instead of the current 45 (but it does currently flip up at 180 degrees for group shots etc.)","I am just a point and shoot kinda photographer and decided to buy a camera for vacation as I did not want to rely on my smartphone to capture every moment. I have only just begun to use this camera and I am amazed. I may not be a professional photographer but I do know a quality image when I see one. With no effort I was able to take all kinds of pictures with no flaws. The features are also mind blowing for such a little camera. So far I am in love with this cameras ability to take close up shots and the sweeping panaramic option which allows for a perfect panaramic picture in a mere couple seconds. I cannot believe the technology that went into this. Also love that the screen flips up for selfie shots....Just make sure screen is all the way up and against camera and the image automatically reverses so you can see the shot right side up while shooting ;-)<br /><br />I will update as I use camera more....<br /><br />Perfect camera for someone who wants the best of everything crammed into a small device that would fit in almost anyone's pocket and doesn't mind investing the money.","I bought this camera to take on a trip to Australia over Christmas. All I can say is that I am super impressed with this camera. It packs a whole lot into such a tiny case. I am a serious amateur photographer and have invested in a good set of Nikon FX lenses over time. I can say that this camera produced some outstanding shots that are comparable to the shots I get on my Nikon DSLR gear. The video capabilities of this camera are also outstanding. I used it to take a super slo-mo video sequence of  my niece doing a backflip and it was outstanding. This thing fits in your shirt or pant pocket without too much effort and is a perfect companion for travel. The only downside is the battery can drain a little quick so having a spare battery (or two) will overcome any problems there. The batteries are so small as well so they do not take up much space.","I bought the camera and returned it. Here is why.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Small footprint for all the features it delivers. Fantastic picture for a compact camera. Incredible burst modes. High resolution.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />$Expensive. Not water resistant. No GPS for geotagging. Worthless viewfinder where the gps should be incorperated. 4K video works for 2-3 min before it overheats and you LOOSE the video you have already taken and you have to reboot the camera by taking the battery out.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />If you have a extra $1000 to spend on a camera, then get it. Just don't get caught in the rain with it in your pocket and forget the 4K feature.  In my opinion, its just not worth the price point.","This camera can take clear pictures in very weak light, transfer pictures easily to the phone!","Good small camera.","Amazing camera with a ton of options.  Also very heavy for a compact camera which helps taking steadier pictures.","My husband and I took this little beast on one photoshoot so far, and we loved it! The vivid color setting reallly highlights the beautiful colors seen by the naked eye which usually get muted by most cameras. Pictures look sooo natural and beautiful, which make editing a breeze, and quite fun actually! The biggest reason why we traded this camera in for our DSLR is because every time we asked somebody to take pictures of the both of us with the DSLR, We would end up looking blurry. Now with this camera, we are comfortable asking strangers to take our picture knowing that we are now, much more likeLy to be in focus! The compactibility, durability and photo quality make this camera worth every single penny !","After reading about the camera for a week I decided to go ahead and purchase it.<br />  After 12 hours of trying to navigate the complex menu system of this camera I gave up and send it back to beach camera . I am now awaiting a refund and will update the dealing with  Beach camera on the return.","Dispute the warnings of overheating from previews, i went ahead and bought the camera. So far, i used it for holidays and few other events. the result of pictures and 1080 movie is amazing.  the support for high capacity storage is a super plus.  if you want one device for taking pictures and making movies. this is it.  it is a bit heavier than the typical cyber-shot cameras but it is worth it !!<br />i occasionally i use 4k which is good too..<br />WIFI transfer to phone is good, but wifi transfer interface is not good.","very good","So I've been looking for a carry around camera for some time. I have a D810 and it's not fun to carry it around. This camera will not replace it but I'm definitely liking this little camera. Quality is fantastic and I'm impressed by the autofocus. My only con is the little guy is small and a bit hard to hold. I haven't dropped it yet but I fear I will. I'm not normally the wristband type but I definitely wear it with this guy to protect my investment.","I have owned previous versions of this camera and every generation just gets better and better. This is the perfect pocketable camera that produces high quality images. The 24-70 lens range is perfect and the fast lens makes it easy to use indoors or wherever you happen to be. I am a professional photographer and when I travel I have my \"work\" cameras packed in a case and this is the camera that I carry with my in transit in case there is something I want a picture of, this little camera is ready to go. This is my every day carry camera.<br /><br />It is quiet, discreet and really fun to shoot with.<br /><br />I would recommend the small stick-on grip for it to make it a bit easier to hold... I have smaller hands but still like having just a little more area to hold on to.","Superb Quality Compact<br />I have used this product for about one month. This camera is the best point and shoot I have ever owned. I usually shoot with a DSLR camera. I came from shooting on a full frame camera. I must say that the imaging on this camera is very good. I can't really compare it to my Canon 5D Mark III head to head. However the lens and compact camera body are very high quality for a compact. Being able to shoot at apertures from 1.8 to f11 is pretty good for a camera of this size. Having a focal range of 24-70 is limiting, but the image quality is very good. ISO range is from 100-12,800. I have not tried shooting very slow shutter speed or quick shutter speeds. I do know you are able to shoot at shutter speeds of 32,000. This camera can also shoot a very fast burst rate of 24 fps up to 150 images then starts to slow down. There is now 315 points of focus using phase detection. The autofocus is very quick at 0.5 seconds. I primarily used this camera for photography. The view finder is small, but very usable. It is able to show 2.35 million dots of resolution. I did try using the video features and I was very happy with the video quality. I used 1080p at 60 frames. I used the xavcs format utilizing the 50 MB/second data speed. I refrained from using 4K because of the 5 minute cut off. Also I do not shoot to much in 4K. The HD 1080p was more than satisfactory for me. I give this camera 5 stars because I think it is one of the best cameras of 2016 in a compact body.","I've purchased every RX100 since the first came out. I've clocked a few thousand hours of video on each new model. What I've noticed is as the camera gets better, it also gets worse. Each year I hope Sony resolves certain major issues only to see them get fundamentally worse.<br /><br />1) Overheating is a major hindrance<br />As each new model comes out, overheating is exacerbated. It's gotten to the point where I have to hot glue a small fan to the camera powered by a portable battery pack to allow for continuous shooting. This is for 1080/60p. I love shooting in 120fps but it's not usable when it overheats so frequently. In addition, auto-shut off disables Wi-Fi. So, if you're using PlayMemories Mobile and the camera overheats, you have to turn the camera back on, go back into the Application List, select Smart Remote Embed, get that connected, turn the camera off, wait for it to cool down, then when you turn it back on your Wi-Fi is ready to go. It would at least be nice if auto-shut off did not disable wi-fi. Or, an option to auto-start the wi-fi any time you turn on the cam (or even better, control power/wifi through the app).<br /><br />2) Focus issues<br />There should be a \"Foreground Focus\" option. I can't count how many times I'll be focusing on an object or person in the foreground, taking up 90% of the frame, only to have the camera focus on the sliver of background. I've tried every setting combination you can think of and nothing resolves it. The flaw seems to be in how the camera decides to focus. If I'm filming an object that is entirely within the frame, it has no problem focusing on it. If I aim or move the camera (same distance) so that part of the object extends outside of the frame, it will focus on the background. The result? I have to fight the camera to focus on the right thing. Using the PlayMemories App you don't have the option to manually focus so that \"solution\" is redundant.<br /><br />Feature request:<br />1) 4k 60p. I realize this will exacerbate the overheating issue but at this point I'm willing to glue as many fans to the camera as needed.<br />2) Wider field of view. GoPro's have multiple Field of View (FOV) options. It would be nice to have a \"medium\" field of view option to capture more. The RX's FOV is really narrow.","Pretty much what the reviews said. Lens sharp as a tack, but wish it went to 90mm equivalent. Viewfinder is adequate for when I really need one, which is mostly when I'm in a darkened room and I don't want my face lit up like I'm holding a candle. The controls are daunting and the vocabulary and some common functions are odd for digital cameras. For example, you have to erase images by days. To erase them all you have to format the card (at least as far as I've found.) Instructions are sometimes vague and incomplete.<br />Seems to be more at home with Mac computers than PCs. The camera was also released before major software titles were ready. Lightroom caught up 6 weeks after I got the camera. Sony needs to collaborate better with mainstream software. The stuff they \"ship\" with it is a crazy idea ... like I'm going to use different software for this pocket camera than I am for my Canon images (NOT!).<br />It is, by the way, NOT a shirt or pants pocket camera. It's too thick and heavy for that. But it's a perfect coat pocket or fanny pack camera.<br />Oh yeah. One other irritation. It comes with a couple of string adapters to which you can attach a neck strap, which the instructions say is \"sold separately.\" Good luck finding where it is sold separately. I had to settle for a brown polka dot thing I found on Amazon. Why did they include the string adapters and no strap -- especially when no branded matching strap is available.<br />Irritating details, but a great little camera that takes very sharp images.","Amzing! Best camera I have ever had!! So small to bring anywhere.","Superior camera in many ways, Sony never fails to please. Great menu, easy video, beautiful results. This camera almost equals my dslrs.","The single best hand held on the market. Does 80% of what my Canon 5D Mark IV will do.Qazing images time and again. Sample image was a lazy snapshot straight out of the camera. No editing.","Its amazing... SUPER fast continuous shooting. Great for those \"close in\" grab shots.","Great, amazing, fantastic camera.  It takes some amazing pictures in low light, without using the flash. The WiFi feature is also great.<br />I purchased this rx100v because of the underwater case they made for it, so when we go snorkeling this will be the camera to use.<br />This is a very fast camera, and also there are many manual options u can use.<br />I wish it had Bluetooth features,  or that Sony would have made a selfie stick/monopod to use with this camera. Also, a wireless remote would have come handy as well.<br />Battery life... could be better,  but then, in my humble experience,  a battery will never last long enough amd a memory card will never be large enough either :)<br />Latley, I had a Sony hx400v and a Sony nex5tl. Both great cameras, but I decided to keep the hx400v  (for the zoom) and replace the nex5tl with the rx100v for the features. Evan though the nex5tl had a larger sensor the quality of the pictures on the rx100v does not disappoint; meanwhile I gained a built in flash and a built in view finder.<br />To summarize,  this is an amazing pocket camera, and I can only hope it will last me for a long time.","Amazing!","Wonderful camera, so many features that I haven't gone through them all yet, I have all the previous models except #3.","It is a amazing camera. It is fastest on the market.","Let me start out by saying that I LOVE this compact Sony camera! The picture quality is unbelievable for a compact camera, very crisp and sharp!<br />Very clean skin tones, beautiful macro images as well as landscapes! I bought this camera because it's best in it's class for picture quality and I am not disappointed! I've been using this on a recent vacation to Australia where I didn't want to carry my big DSLR...and I am amazed at the quality of the images. Only downside is the life of the battery, but with a couple of spares in my bag it never turned into an issue. If you're looking for that perfect small lightweight camera with DSLR picture quality, look no further!","great !!!","This is a super camera!  I've had a little over a month and use it all the time when I want a point and shoot situation and not the bulk of my Sony a6000 (which is a great camera!).  I do not use the movie feature, so I can't review that aspect.  But the pictures are clean & sharp whatever the distance from the subject.","Overall this is the best point and shoot camera. I gave it a 3 stars due to bad user interface, and most of all shooting 4K video only last for 5 minutes before it overheats. Unacceptable for the Sony brand, $950.00 and as a 5th upgrade generation.","Very nice camera although too many functions almost as if I'm using the DSLR but like it. Only con is that 4K video, about 5 min shooting is best I can manage and have to wait few min for the camera to cool down to shoot again. I have few videos on my site; [...]","Great camera.  Upgraded from version 1 after many years.","I will first say that I did purchase this from Bestbuy as I had a gift card, and it was available the day it came out.<br />The sony rx100 V... I struggled deciding between iv and v, but ultimately as you already know I purchased the Mark V. The reason why is that it has the upgraded 315 phase detection autofocus points which I agree after using it, tremendously helps!<br /><br />I bought this mainly for video purposes so here are the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Extremely fast autofocus, isnt too shabby in low light conditions<br />- with the f/1.8 aperture lens it works better than many cameras I have used in low light<br />- Compact and fits in your pocket<br />- Very good image/video quality (supports 4k)<br />- On board microphone is better than most<br />- Slow motion video (up to 1000fps but low quality)<br /><br />Cons<br />- Short battery life (30 min recording at 1080p 30fps)<br />- Overheating (25 minutes of recording at 1080p)<br />- Slippery to hold (I bought the sony AGR2 for $14 to fix this)<br />- Is it really worth $1000 meh. Depends on why you need it<br /><br />Photo quality is good, just the zoom definitely limits the camera. Obviously with only a 1 inch sensor it is going to have its sacrifices in some areas, but if you need portability but professional looking pictures. Highly Recommend.<br /><br />All in all if you learn to adapt to its shortcomings it is a good camera. Just be sure to have extra batteries, and be cognizant of temperature. If you have the sony rx100 iv, I do not think you need the upgrade unless you specifically need it for the phase detection auto focus points, and it is a must. Purchase the AGR2 grip and screen protector to help with scratches and slip.","I'm a professional photographer in NYC and have used the RX100, RX1003, 4 and now the 5.  I love these little cameras.  Yes, they have sorta annoying menus but after a week or so you know where everything is and it's fine. Yes, the battery life isn't great but hello, look at the size of the battery. It's tiny. Small battery = less time.  I bring a couple extras with me and I can shoot all day.<br /><br />Let's talk about the good parts. The autofocus is amazing (except I guess for the comic book lover with no lampshade who wrote a review too...) It has a great pop up EVF that no other tiny camera has (that I know of). I just took it to Ireland for a week and it performed perfectly.  The RAW update from Adobe isn't out yet (not Sony's fault... yell at Adobe) so I used Sony's RAW processor. It's not great but it works until Adobe and PhaseOne gets its act together.<br /><br />This is a pro camera in a tiny body that really performs.  Take a minute, learn the menu, set up your own custom buttons and make some killer photos and videos.  Or, I guess you could try to photograph your wall in your undecorated bedroom...)","I've been using the DSC-RX100 III and loved it. Up date to the DSC-RX100 V and it has been refined significantly. Simply a pleasure for this amateur to use.","I don't buy this RX-100 V from Amazon, but I'd like to put some comments based on my experience using it.  By the way I have owned the first generation of RX-100 as well (model of 2012), but I have to replace it since it dropped very hard on the concrete a few months ago.  Before I decide on this RX-100 V, I have also looked into and RX-100 IV - with only $100 different, I decide on this latest version instead.  As always, RX-100 is very portable, it can fit in my pocket anywhere I go and it provide excellent 20MP pictures.  That is a big selling point since I cannot find any other brand this this.  There are cameras that can give us a little better picture quality with bigger MP, but they tend to be 3 times bigger and cost at least double or triple like Nikon D750, Nikon D500 or Nikon D5. Aside from excellent stills quality that I can easily blow then into clear/sharp  20x30 pictures (and maybe 24x36 as well), I like this new RX-100 V over my older model due to 4K videos, slow motion videos, and faster Continuous shooting (based on spec RX-100 V gives a maximum of 24fps, while RX-100 IV give only 16fps for Continuous).  Just based on picture quality (stills and videos) and on portability, I would give this camera a 5-star.  But I will give only a 4-star instead for this review.  I hate that Sony have not improved on the interface such as touchscreen and better menu.  The camera is not ergonomic, and I'm afraid I will drop it again in the future.  To prevent dropping, I may need to spend and extra $30-$50 to add a shoulder strap.  I hope after the new strap, it will still fit nicely in my pocket.  Finally, this is my rating: a 4-star in general, and a 5-star for me since I care mostly on picture quality and portability.","Pros:__________<br />-  Taking a picture, it understands the depth of where your main point (or person) is, which makes taking a picture quicker than most of its competitors.<br />-  24 fps with AF and AE makes taking any picture enough to be a short 5.k resolution movie clip.<br />-  Videos come out as Ultra HD ( 5028 X 2929 pixel)<br />-  Phase detection is a great asset as its autofocus makes sure that the target on screen doesn’t get missed out when taking 4k videos.<br />-  The screen becomes very effective with its 180-degree flip and its 45-degree downward tilt option.<br />-  Almost identical to its last two or three versions in size and built.<br />-  Noise reduction and sharpening are still best in the market.<br />-  I was able to immediately playback 24 fps round without waiting for time to load (kickass processor). There will be no waiting time when you want to view your photos.<br />-  Can run off USB power if your battery is low (good for those who want to use this as a time-lapse).<br />-  There are so many options regarding different forms of autofocus as the sensors are programmed to automatically target those about to be shot. The whole point of this camera is for it to do all the work and for you to just snap the photo.<br />-  Flash and Popup viewfinder are always a benefit to have.<br />-  You will be able to fit this in your pocket.<br />-  One of the smallest devices out there regarding shooting in 4k.<br />-  There is no loading phase when turning it on or off.  The moment you turn it on its ready to go.<br />-  Its mobile app allows you to use your phone as a remote control as well as transfer your photos and videos freely to your smartphone (The time of transfer depends on a number of images and how long your videos are, especially in 4k).<br />-  The Face Detection option is able to adjust focus, distinguish between children and adults, and overall one of many options this camera has regarding auto focusing.<br />-  HDMI Outlet<br />-  Overall great advance options for professionals.<br /><br />Cons and Oks:__________<br />-  No Touchscreen<br />-  Lock on auto focus is not 100% accurate.<br />-  Lack of touchscreen makes autofocus such a pain in the ass because you need to start pressing more buttons to find the autofocus program you want, causing your camera to shake.<br />-  Lack of customization of the buttons and dials, what you buy, basically, you can’t change.<br />-  Compare to its competitors (Canon and Panasonic) the battery life is poor for those who want to use this in your professional work. I took 1600 raw / jpegs and a couple of 4k 60 sec videos and I needed to replace it.<br />-  Want to save battery life, you need to physically remove the battery from the camera, (it will drain even when it’s off).<br />-  No grip, very smooth and slippery like the iPhone 7. You always feel like you’re about to drop it.<br />-  The LCD panel is the same as the first RX100 version.<br />-  No control ring as, like many others, there is a click and unclick when switching lenses.<br />-  Lack of customization you most likely always have to dig into the menu to find what you need.<br />-  When the buffer is clearing on your card you can’t go back and review your picture.<br />-  Still, the RX100 doesn’t have an in-camera raw processing before you want to transfer them over.<br />-  Five minutes on 4k will lead to the camera to overheat or gets close to it.<br />-  Lens reach is not that great, enough to put it up on this list.<br />-  Comes with a cable and wall adapter but no external charger. Just makes it more difficult in finding a place to charge the camera.<br />-  Some, not all, autofocus programs are almost identical to one another.<br />-  Getting a case for this will not fit in my pocket, sucks knowing you have to put a $1000 in your pocket without protection.<br />-  Only shoot videos you’ll probably get around 20 minutes of battery life (maybe 30 if their short videos).<br />-  4k is limited to 5 minutes.<br />-  No microphone jack.<br />-  No interchangeable lens, you stick what you get.<br /><br />Bottom Line:__________<br />This is not going to be your everyday camera.  It’s going to be a birthday, wedding, family moment camera.  The RX100 is one of the smallest cameras to produce 4k video and that’s something even its competitors can’t do.  It’s obvious, with the price, you're getting top of the line quality but the price also needs to take into account the experience of using it.<br /><br />The design is relatively the same size in dimension from its predecessors and the big red marks on this is the low battery life and no touchscreen.  You will need to buy extra batteries if you want film clips and take pictures in 4k as the battery will die quickly.  A touchscreen, from my experience, makes autofocuing so much easier as all you need to do is touch where you want it to be. The Autofocusing programs on this device have a setting for everyone, it will indeed take some time to get used to the button layout.<br /><br />Overall, from my testing, I’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars. You’re getting one of the best in image quality and 4k filming that you can fit in your pocket but this is definitely not for everyone.  For me cameras like the Canon’s G7 X Mark 2 (And some Panasonic cameras) have touchscreens and have great battery life.  The lens is not great for those in sports or looking for longer distant shots. Yes, nothing on the market right now can shoot 24fps nor 4k but you got to take the good and the bad.  Verdict: special events will work perfectly but other than that, bring extra batteries.<br /><br />Hopefully, I was helpful to you all<br />Love,<br />Honest Reviewer.","Although I am not a photography expert I can say this camera exceeds expectations, it is incredibly compact, built like  a tank and the photo quality is excellent.<br /><br />The Sony menus are not as bad as others portray it, yes is not as intuitive as an iPhone but easy to navigate considering the many options you have, I also did not find the lack of touchscreen to be a dissapoitnment, the menu structure really flows through once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />Highly reccomended.","The best compact camera out there. A little pricey but for what you get, can't complain. And the results are spectacular!.<br /><br />Fast autofocus, fast snapshots. Small, lightweight design. 4K support but with a time minute limitation to prevent overheating. Doesn't have a touchscreen, but the LCD flips up to 180 degrees - great for vloggers. So many options to make your head spin. A gadget lover will appreciate this camera.","Absolutely gorgeous camera. I rented previous version rx100 iv during my trip to Florida this summer and I was blown away with this pocket camera. I decided to wait for newer version to be released. I am glade I did. I just got my camera yesterday and still going through all the features how ever two thing I tested and both works just as described.<br /><br />1. Focus - very fast and accurate<br />2. 24fps still shoot - awesome you just can't miss the moment anymore.<br /><br />More practical review and images yet to come once raw editor available in LR for this camera.<br /><br />I am a professional photographer thanks Sony for creating camera like this for us professional photographers. More sample images you could find on [...]<br /><br />Thanks","The RX100 V is most definitely one of the best pocket size camera I've ever owned. The whole thing feels very sold and collects fingerprints. The LCD is very adjustable. One of the best features is the very fast AF. In comparison, other cameras feel horrible with a slower auto focus. The 24fps continuous shooting with the AF is perfect for getting the right shot and for people that are not as knowledgeable with cameras. The view finder is also a great feature since my A5000 doesn't have one. If you prefer, you can also shoot in 4k at 30fp. But the best feature I really like is the High Frame Rate feature. You can do some excellent slow motion shots with this camera.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fast AF<br />24fps continuous shooting<br />HFR (shoot at 240, 480, or 960fps at NTSC)<br />HFR end trigger recording (You can record the seconds before an action)<br />4K Video<br />Compact + Versatile<br />Great advanced photography features<br />Clean HDMI output<br />1080p HD video can shoot at 60fps to 120fps<br />Low light photos are great, but I'd still recommend a tripod or flash<br />Auto features for quick easy shooting<br /><br />Important Limitations to consider!<br />Battery life could last less than 20 or 30 minutes with heavy use such as video. I think it greatly depends on how long the LCD is on.<br />Continues shooting can max out at about 150 shots<br />Currently (11/2/2016) raw images are not supported by photoshop yet (I'm sure support will come soon)<br />4K and HFR require Class 10 or higher SDHC/SDXC memory card (prefers UHS-I U3 for 100Mbps)<br />4K is limited to 5 minutes at 30fps<br />HFR takes a drastic hit in quality at 960fps. (near 1080p at 240fps)<br />HFR takes a long time to process!<br />24fps continuous shooting takes a long time to process when the buffer is full<br />Gets noticeably warm on intense video/image processing<br />Noisy in low light video.<br />No interchangeable lens (obviously, but always a plus if you can)<br />No microphone jack<br /><br />The most irritating thing about this camera is the battery life. I highly recommend getting more batteries and an external charger. If you can live with all the negatives about the RX100 V, I do recommend it. It's an excellent addition with some very powerful features, but those powerful features do come with a limitations.","2.5 Stars.  I'm a novice photographer that likes to buy nice shiny things.  I got very excited the other night to buy this camera and took the next morning (and then seemingly the afternoon) off of work to purchase and play.  What I wanted out of this purchase was a pocket sized camera where I could casually tote around locally and abroad to take excellent pictures that's comparable to my 4/3rds.  The specs for this camera pretty much was everything that I was looking for.  Quick auto-focus and tracking for street photos, high quality photos, 4K, slow mode, viewfinder, manual options ... to play with.<br /><br />The cost of the camera is expensive enough ($1,000) while at the store decided to buy a leather case (I want to keep my 1K camera pristine!).  But carrying around the case doesn't make this pocket-able.  But like anything else I own, it's only takes a matter of months before I start tossing it around (at the cost of a $75 dollar case).  The view finder is ok.  But opted to not use it for much of my trial experience.  Usually I prefer the viewfinder vs. the LCD screen.<br /><br />The battery life is the reason I'm going to return this after playing with it for a few more days.  The lack of battery life drove me to purchase a couple more pseudos' and a charger ($20) off of Amazon that night (along with a grip and screen protector - $27).  The first go-around lasted me roughly 2-3 hours playing around with the continuous shooting feature, 4K, slow mode feature, but primarily toggling between menu options.  The continuous feature (24fps) is a cool option that kills your battery and isn't really that practical for my applications.  The 4K option killed my trial video after 4 minutes and camera got pretty hot.  After 13 minutes of HD shooting my fully charged batteries died.  I feel as though I would be reluctant to take videos in the field because it will kill my batteries.  And I definitely would think this way for the continuous shooting option as well.  I feel as though if I keep this camera, I’m going to be scared to use it to its potential because of the battery issue.  Not to mention that I’ve been reading about general battery drain of the RX100 series.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk about the beautiful pictures this camera takes b/c you can read that anywhere online better than what I can describe.  But the battery issue is enough for me to write a review.  It doesn’t leave me with any confidence that I can use this camera at will.  Regardless of price (total $1,102+) in my opinion, for a pocket-able camera, if you have to carry around spare batteries and battery storage to use the product, it’s not practical.  Especially for 1 grand.  I want to love this camera Sony!  I want to keep it.  But I’ve lived without a pocket camera for many years and this can wait until you give this product the juice it really needs.  Thanks Amazon for the fantastic return policy!","It's very good for a compact point and shoot. In all honesty, given the capabilities and image quality, it is quite impressive that this camera is this small. Sony's processing in the camera makes for quality images, even in a small camera handicapped by its sensor size. That being said, I am still skeptical that it was worth the price. Don't expect DSLR quality and feel. It feels like a compact camera and the images look like something between compact and DSLR. I am very satisfied with this camera as my backup or \"packing light\" camera. Focusing is as fast as advertised. Really quite amazing.<br /><br />The camera seems a bit half-baked. The software seems ancient (really, T9 keyboard) while also offering some modern features like NFC and wifi sync. Oh but wifi sync can't find computers connected to a Wifi 5Ghz network because it's only standard 2.4GHz itself. The menus are awful. My Sony from around 2010 or so has the same menu system. Update that Sony, it's inexcusable on a $1,000 brand new camera. All of the features and processing of a higher end camera means better quality images--but it's frustrating trying to discover where all the features are buried under the myriad of confusing menus and nomenclature.<br /><br />As of 10/29/2016, Sony's own product page is not nearly complete. Half of the manual/help links lead to \"file missing\" pages, and I cannot register the product because the model field on the registration page doesn't include the Mark V camera! On their own site! Sony seems to have impressive hardware that is hampered by their lackluster and outdated software.<br /><br />PROS<br />-fast autofocus (like Jimmy John's fast)<br />-better than compact camera image quality<br />-impressive 4k<br />-quick from on to snapping a picture<br /><br />CONS<br />-5 minutes of 4k recording, maybe even less if the device hasn't cooled off completely<br />-Poor menu setup, no touchscreen makes for difficult to navigate options<br />-the PlayMemory Camera Apps are awful. Just build the functionality into the camera. There shouldn't be pay-for DLC for a camera.<br />-Expensive. May or may not be worth it, depending on your needs. If you need a small camera without sacrificing image quality or good 4k video, this may be the camera for you. If you don't care about having a larger camera, get a cheap DSLR and a good lens. It will be about the same price and give you better quality.<br /><br />I would have attached sample photos, but the RAW files are not supported by Adobe yet. Frustrating.","The 4K video is amazingly detailed and sharp. I just wish it had more image stabilization. The high speed picture taking is great for capturing the perfect smile on an infant. HFR is great for watching my daughter dancing. The fast focus is much faster and more accurate than rx100 iii"]},{"name":"Pentax K-1","amazon_reviews":["Build like a tank, lots of features and GREAT image quality.. long story short thats how the K1 is.. bought my first body July 2016 and the second Dic 2016...  both are performing as spected..","Awesome came","Fantastik Camera worth way more than it is selling for!!","The Pentax K-1 is a triumph of Japanese engineering, and a pleasure to own.

Just being full-frame, it brought back the film days to me. I can again see the depth of field like I used to. The only thing they did not put in is a USB 3.0 port. Don't know why. Wish they did.This camera lets a Pentax user be a professional photographer in the real sense, with low light capabilities like other photographers carry in their bags.","I love this camera. The price has gone up since I purchased, but it's still worth the cost. There are not many full-frame options in a price range most people are willing to spend on a camera, and these specs are monstrous compared to anything in the same range. It has the K-mount lens so I've been able to use my old film-era lenses, which has been awesome. There is no pop-up flash built in to the body but the sharpness at high ISO almost makes it unnecessary, plus it has a hot shoe mount for when you do want a flash. The body is big and heavy, but if you're going for a FF you're probably okay with that. The auto-focus is great but if you primarily shoot sports you'll find the speed lacking.<br /><br />Overall I love using this camera. Images are sharp, color is vivid, software and interface is intuitive. It feels great in your hand and it's construction is solid.","This camera utterly blows the socks off my Canon 6D. It has some faults and weak spots but overall I am thoroughly impressed and loving it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Incredible dynamic range.  You can shoot raw at -2 ev and bring up levels in post with no issue at all.<br />Astrophoto friendly - especially with firmware 1.4<br />Articulated display is the best on a pro DSLR.<br />Massive compatibility with legacy lenses.<br />Best in class weather sealing.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Tethering app is awful.<br />Buffering/display at max rates not as graceful as canon system.<br />Fewer modern pro lenses available at present.","There are not enough words or space to write about how totally awesome the K1 is, by far the best still and landscape camera I have ever owned and I have owned some nice Canon and Nikon DSLR cameras.","This review would have certainly gotten 5 stars without a doubt if it was better supported with associated software. The android tethering software was just AWEFULL, it totally insults the senses and is basically useless. It's so bad it renders the WiFi of the camera useless. Now I've got an awesome camera with WiFi that serves no purpose, great... Don't get me wrong, the camera itself is completely awesome and I'd certainly recommend it without reservation but to include useless features that were almost totally awesome is troubling. Even with that said I'm probably still going to buy another pentax camera. Just don't expect a whole lot out of the software support side of things with the K1.","Very good...","I take pictures for fun, and am not a professional.  The review is purely from the user experience perspective, not much from the technical point of view.<br /><br />This is my first full frame DSLR, and I love it.  I was debating between the Canon 5D Mark IV and the Sony A7R II, and decided to go with the Pentax K-1 because of its attractive price and the rave reviews on the internet.  I bought the K-1 body with the new Pentax 24-70mm f2.8 lens for the same price of body only for either the 5D mk iv or the A7R II.  In numerous online comparisons of FF DSLR, K-1 is typically ranked No. 2 overall including mirrorless, right after A7R II, and No. 1 without mirrorless.<br /><br />Since I did not own a FF before, I cannot compare image quality with another FF.  But comparing pictures taken from my crop sensor cameras, including a Canon 7D Mark II (paired with a 100-400 mm f4.5-5.6L IS II), and a Sony A6000 (with kit lenses 18-55mm and 55-200mm), the pictures from the K-1 are much better in terms of sharpness, color richness, and color authenticity.  I don't do RAW, so I cannot comment on the impact of post-shooting manipulations.  The other thing I like the K-1 is the simplicity of all the controls, either by menu or the dials/buttons - to get what I want and change settings is way easier than the Canon and the Sony.<br /><br />One thing lacking on the K-1 is the video capability.  Many users have complained about this, so I won't repeat.  However, I bought the K-1 mainly for still images, so I don't care about it that much.  The other minor drawback is the frame and the focus points in the viewfinder are not lightened up enough and sometimes it is a bit hard to see, especially in bright day light.  On the contrary, those on the Canon are easy to see.  Last but not least, like many other DSLRs (excluding mirrorless), it takes muscles to handle the weight of the camera body and the lens.<br /><br />I have owned the K-1 with the 28-70mm f2.8 lens for about a month and shot about 1,000 pictures.  Overall, very happy with the results.  It will be my go-to camera moving forward.","I have owned this camera for a few months now and I have to let everyone know how amazing this camera is! I'm also a Nikon user and have been for the last 25 years. I've been a committed Nikon fan over the years and have used a few of their cameras in my professional career, notably the D810/800, Df, D700,D70, F4, N90s/N90, N8008, and an OG FM. So quite a few Nikons. But my career started off with a Pentax and I have always loved the glass.<br />The new K-1 is a fantastic camera. I have shot with both the D810/D800 and the shots from that camera is so lovely. The sensor on the Nikon is amazing. But the images from the K-1 paired up with the Pentax FA limited lenses are simply magical. There is a magical essence to the images when I use the Pentax K-1.<br />The only lenses I own are the FA limiteds and a single DA limited and I have been very happy with the results. I know there is a ton of talk about the lacking of glass from Pentax but really how much glass do you need? They offer the full range of trinity zooms( which is what most people own ), they offer the FA limiteds( which is what I own ), and they offer a gang of legacy glass. The complaints are that there isn't enough glass at different price points and different focal lengths.<br />Let's go over it:<br />15-30mm zoom for your wides( landscape, news, etc )<br />24-70mm  zoom for your normal range ( everyday, environmental, portraits, standards, etc etc etc )<br />70-200mm zoom for your telephoto range ( for your portraits, for sports, etc etc etc )<br />If you get those 3 lenses... done, settled. You can have a professional life with those 3 lenses.<br />Or you can do what I do. Grab the FA limiteds. As a portrait/fashion/lifestyle photographer, I only need those 3 lenses. I'll admit, I also want the DA 15mm limited, the DA* 55mm 1.4, and the DFA 100mm limited macro. I'm not sure if I need the zooms( but wouldn't mind having them ).<br />What else is there? Yes, I love the new super tilty screen. Yes, I love the 3rd wheel( so handy ). And yes, I love the pixel shift( I never use it ). What I really think is really useful and handy for me is the latitude in the shake reduction. It is incredibly useful to me. I shoot at 1/60th all the time at 1.8. And as the light dwindles, I'll go down to 1/30. And even 1/15. It is really useful to me as a photographer to have shake reduction built into the body not lens. Another thing is the WR. I shoot in pools during swimsuit fashion season and it is handy to have WR as a feature in a camera. I love that I can jump in a pool and not worry about getting the body wet. Another handy feature is the little led lights on various parts of the body. Really hand as well.<br />If you are on the fence about buying this camera, I think it would be an excellent camera for you if you are either a portrait or fashion photographer. I have zero issues with it and feel it works extremely well with my flow. I feel the specs make it an excellent landscape camera but I don't do much of that sort of photography so can't speak about those benefits. But if you love taking pictures of people and fashion, I can personally speak of its abilities and believe it is a wonderful camera.","Former Nikonian blown away by the quality and features of this camera. Ricoh knocked it out of the park. Check the recent DxO reviews and comparisons. The extra dials and new button placements take awhile to get used to but are more efficient once learned. The LED's save my time and hands out at night. I love astrophotography and this camera delivers. Haven't had it long enough to get any milky way pics but I will soon. The pixel shift mode produces detail I can't describe. Wonderful camera at a great price.","I've been shooting Pentax since my ME Super that I got in high school from my grandpa. When the K5 IIS came out - I finally had a camera that could tempt me away from my Nikon digital cameras that I had been shooting for years. It wasn't the full-frame that I really wanted, but, it was competing with Nikon's FX sensor cameras at the time, so I jumped. When they finally announced the full-frame camera - I eagerly read reviews and finally ordered one for myself.<br /><br />So happy I pulled the trigger. Build quality is fantastic. Yes it's got its Pentax quirks - but it's a fantastic camera for still and landscape photography. I've used this thing in the rain, and it didn't skip a beat. I can pack one kit when traveling - including my 35mm film camera - and swap lenses between them all day long with no problems. My old manual focus SMC lenses work perfectly on the K1, as well as my Leitax converted lenses - and every single one benefits from the in-body Shake Reduction. I haven't used the pixel-shift feature much, but from my limited testing it is definitely promising.","Yes the Pentax K1 is awesome.  Over the top camera manufactured by Pentax, a quality product with everything you need for razor sharp full frame images.  The pixel shift mood is outstanding.","the best versatile camera I ever had","An amazing camera at an equally amazing price.  Love the rich, deep detail that the full frame sensor provides.  A \"must have\" for landscape photographers.","This is my 5th Pentax. I still have my 35mm Me super program. I was waiting on this full frame digital. The camera is versatile lots more features than my Canon 7D. Too many features to mention here. I highly recommend this one","I absolutely love the new camera!  I upgraded from a K-7 and the low level lighting shots with my k-1 are amazing.  It burns me that I have reinvest in a battergrip, but the camera folks have to make some money on accessories.","I waited and waited for Pentax to come out with a full frame digital, and wow, did they deliver!! I just love this sensor for its Dynamic Range and lack of noise at low ISO's.<br /><br />The camera has all the manual controls to make photography a joy again, for someone who came from all manual Pentax Cameras. I hate it when the Camera makes the picture alone and you just point and shoot. It does have all the modern automatic features of a modern camera, but I only use them when I'm not inspired to shoot.<br /><br />They claim that the auto focus is not up to par with its modern competition, but for someone used to all manual lenses, I can use the auto-focus as an aid and get much better shots than before. For Landscape and Still photography, auto focus is very accurate, if you set it up right and use it correctly. If you point and shoot and expect the camera to read your mind, then you may be somewhat disappointed. I did get the 28-105 modern lens and its much better than the competitors \"kit lenses\", in build, color rendition and edge to edge sharpness.<br /><br />Now all my manual lenses can be used on this camera and get image stabilization, since its built into the camera body instead of the lens.<br /><br />There are new features that are just not available in the competition that reviews ignore, but to me are just brilliant.<br /><br />1. Mechanical dial for most common changes to settings, instead of fumbling in menus.<br />2. Pixel shift to increase color accuracy and reduce noise<br />3. Astro-tracer for night sky photography with longer exposures<br />4. Automatic horizon leveling using sensor rotation for small corrections<br />5. Backward compatibility with K mount lenses from the 1970's. That is almost 50 years worth!<br />6. Tilting back screen for most macro, landscape and studio type photography. No selfies!<br />7. A Rugged rain resistant body, leave your plastic bag at home and shoot with confidence. This is major problem for landscape where a rain shower and ruin your day and force you to keep your camera in a plastic zip-lock or rain cover if you venture outside. With competitive cameras, you take a risk as to what damage you could do in rain. With Pentax, the manufacturer designed for this eventuality. Nice!<br /><br />There are other features too but I listed the ones that I consider unique. I have shot over a 1000 pictures, a lot of landscape and some people, pets and flowers, and this 36 MP sensor blows 15-20+ MP sensors away in sharpness and color, leave alone printing big. You just can't compare the two unless you print small and/or look at it on a computer screen only (without 1:1 views).<br /><br />At $1K less than any equivalent competition, its a real steal for me. Although Pentax Lenses and accessories cost as much as the competition now.","Great Camera....the best ever!!!!. Highly recommended. I bought it with the Pentax @ 24-70mm F/2.8, and the images that im getting are so far better and sharper than my previous camera, Canon 7D.","We Pentaxians have been waiting a long time for this camera to arrive and it was well worth the wait. There is a bit of a learning curve required in order to master the K1's Miriam of capabilities but, I have loved every minute of the process. No camera will make you a better photographer but as you grow into the art of taking photos this is the tool to have at your fingertips. Priced $1,000s less than other comparable big name full frame cameras.","I've been shooting Olympus (and some Panasonic) since 2007, both dslr's and mirrorless. I love my EM1 but this camera is just a joy to use, especially with a prime lens. It's performance does vary greatly by lens, of course. Right now I'm using three old FA primes, with the 50 macro my favorite. Focus is fast and accurate with that lens, surprisingly. I also rented the new 28-105 but indoor focus proved inconsistent so I put it on my \"don't buy yet\" list. Handling is just right for my medium-large hands, and the weight is fine with smaller primes. I would not want to use it with a big zoom, but that's me. I'm saving for the \"limited\" series of primes.<br /><br />I hope Pentax can add electronic shutter via a firmware update. It can be useful for ultimate sharpness at certain shutter speeds. Right now you can sort of do it by using pixel shift and then saving the first frame as a tiff, but that's a cludge.","good","Hi, I've writing this review as someone who has been shooting with the K-1 for a few weeks.  I also own a Pentax K3 ii, and K5 iis.  Finally, I bring to the table experience with shooting most of the latest \"semi pro\" offerings, including Nikon's D610, D750, D800 and Canon's 6D and 5D mk-iii and Sony's A7R.<br /><br />For a summary of my thoughts, feel free to skip to the last section.<br /><br />---<br /><br />General Impressions:<br /><br />The camera is extremely well built with a perceived build quality that comfortably rivals anything else even close in price.  Nearly everything is metal and tolerances are tight.<br /><br />Ergonomics are like a K3 (generally excellent) but with a bit more bulk and a better grip; now my pinky can grip the camera without a battery module installed :)<br /><br />Buttons are the same as the K-3 but the live view and playback buttons are swapped; this required a temporary adjustment period.<br /><br />Pentax/Ricoh also added additional buttons and dials.  One is a \"lamp\" button that can turn on little LEDs around the camera for nighttime use.  It seems like a great feature to me.  Another added control is a \"third top dial\" with a selector that decides what that dial does.  It's very innovative but comes with a trade-off: a smaller top LCD that displays less data.  Speaking of the back monitor, Pentax now makes it convenient to change the brightness.<br /><br />Pentax K3/K5/K7 accessories, like the battery, IR remote, etc, all \"just work\" so those who already shooting Pentax might literally be able to just buy the camera and be good to go.<br /><br />The camera also has good support for \"DA\" APS-C lenses.  Versus an APS-C camera like the K3, you lose some resolution (15.3 MP vs 24), body compactness and that nice low price.  You gain better autofocus coverage and the ability to see outside the frame.  Also, many DA lenses can actually support full frame - the camera will let you try.<br /><br />I did some tests with in body shake reduction (which is now reportedly improved from 3 to 5 axis) and I'm VERY impressed.  Shooting at speeds like 0.5 seconds is giving me usable shots.  This tech has really evolved into something special.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Autofocus<br /><br />My original K-5 had issues with auto focus consistency.  Ever since the K5-iis however, single shot auto focus with Pentax has been excellent for me.  I'll note that I've done many \"head to heads\" with cameras like the E-M1 and D750 and, for still subjects the Pentax is just as good and sometimes better (at least in dim light vs the E-M1).  The K-1 feels like a slight improvement to the K-3.<br /><br />Moving subjects.  My experience with Nikon cameras, particularity the D750, show that Nikon is still ahead in moving subject tracking.  I'll note that mastering a camera's auto focus tracking system is not trivial and I'm no expert.  I'm sure that I could improve with practice and settings experimentation.  That said, the default setup with the D750 gives me an extremely high hit rate of kids and pets running through the frame.  I'll also note that I've seen impressive K-1 results online from other photographers so there's definitely potential there when not focusing on comparison aspects.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Usecase: Macro<br /><br />For Macro, the camera is \"as good as it gets\", arguably the best.<br /><br />For starters, the macro lens selection is superb with many options.  This includes the 100mm f/2.8 WR which is insanely good for the price (and, like the camera, it's weather sealed).  I currently have 4 macro lenses and each seems to have it's use.<br /><br />The camera offers (optional) focus peaking and convenient 100% magnification in live view.  Live view is smooth and responsive.  There is also a near-instant 100% magnification playback review which is more uncommon in high end cameras than it should be. That tilting monitor comes to great utility when the camera is near the ground or in another awkward position.  Sometimes I wish it was even more tillable but appreciated nonetheless.<br /><br />When it can be used (which can be often in macro), \"pixel shift\" mode brings out  a level of detail that no other camera can match..<br /><br />UPDATE (2016/10/12): Starting with firmware 1.3, Ricoh added a fully electronic shutter option.  Complimenting pixel-shift, this allows another way to get completely vibration-free images.  Using the mechanical shutter is fine in many cases, but one always has to think about motion blur when using a mechanical shutter regardless of camera brand - this is especially true with long lenses at macro distances where even the slightest movements can register in the image.  Electronic shutter is only available in live view.<br /><br />All that said, the K3-ii is also an excellent choice for marco with a comparable feature set.  The K-3 (and K3-ii) happen to have a tighter pixel pitch - meaning you can get a bit more \"practical magnification\" with the same lenses.  It's also significantly cheaper making it a stronger value proposition.  If macro work is the main usecase, the K3-ii might even be the better overall choice - with trade-offs of course.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Usecase: Landscape<br /><br />For landscape the K1 is an incredible body, strongly arguable \"as good as it gets\".<br /><br />It has weather sealing.<br /><br />It has a tiltable LCD for high and low tripod setups.  There are LED lights for night work.  There's built in GPS for location astrotrace for clear star images.  It has image stabilization for a better hit rate on \"opportunity\" shots that are off the tripod.<br /><br />Lens selection is behind Canon and Nikon but honestly good enough for non-specialists (e.g. someone who needs tilt-and-shift options).  The most modern choices are the 15-30mm, 24-70mm and 28-105mm.  I personally prefer the smaller size of primes which currently means older designs for me.  In primes, I'm finding the 31mm f/1.8 to be an excellent choice; pixel-sharp even though it was designed for film.  I also have the 20mm FA 2.8 which requires more attentiveness for good corners.  I also happily found the 10-17mm fisheye works well at 15mm and above (where it looks like 10mm on a K3).  There are many more options as well, too many to list them all.  Also, If you are willing to explore the used market for legacy Pentax lenses (M and A series), the choices becomes even greater.  Most of these older lenses work best stopped-down but landscape images are generally shot this way anyway.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Usecase: Portrait<br /><br />Portrait is solid with good focus and excellent IQ.  There are some hold backs though.  One is the auto focus point coverage; it's not bad but a bit more spread would be ideal.  A second thing is that a dedicated focus point joystick would help make point selection more fluid.<br /><br />I'd also love to see modern 85mm, 105mm, and/or 135mm portrait-focused prime lens.  In the mean time, one can do well with the 77mm limited, 100mm macro, 70-200mm and many legacy options.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Usecase: Sports & Wildlife<br /><br />The Pentax K-1 is not designed to be a sports camera and it shows in multiple aspects.  The frame rate of 4.4 FPS (full frame) is OK but not competitive with a sports camera  Lenses cover the basics (with a 150-450 and a 560 plus many legacy options) but lack the comprehensive telephoto lineup of Canon and Nikon.  Auto focus is fine for still subjects but sports camera's (such as Nikon D5, D500, D750.  Canon 1 DX II, 7DII, 5DIII)  are better-equipped for tracking moving subjects.<br /><br />One can definitely get nice sports and wildlife shots with the K1 and many have demonstrated this by posting excellent images.  Still, with the large amount of $$$ needed for top sports lenses, I hesitate to recommend a camera that is not custom built to support those lenses - it just comes down to individual priorities.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Usecase: Video<br /><br />Video capability is incrementally improving with audio monitoring and improved ergonomics.  That said, recording specs are dated for 2016 (1080 60i) and clearly not where engineers placed their efforts.  Similar to sports, if you occasionally need video, it will accomplish the task but there are better options for those who are serious about video.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Wrapping Up<br /><br />As this review covers many aspects I think it's important to wrap up with my general feelings.  This is an excellent all-around camera that is a very strong contender in most applications.  The weak point is currently sports and wildlife, where I would call it a \"good\" camera but not a clear choice dedicated sports shooters.  This appears to be exactly inline with the goals Ricoh had when designing this camera, so well-done Ricoh!","Pentax disadvantages:  Adequate but fewer choices in new lenses and gear, fewer service locations, AF-C tracking decent but not as good as the best models from Canikon, average video mode.  K-1 advantages:  Price, focus peaking + tilt screen makes macro shooting a joy, terrific in-body stabilization applies to EVERY lens including gazillions of classic film-era lenses, 5 user-defined shooting modes, Astrotracer functionality and LED illumination for night shooting, great weather-proofing, GPS, all-metal construction, compact body, availability of lightweight Limited prime lenses so good Canon shooters adapt them for their bodies, terrific 36MP sensor, Pixel-shift for high-rez high-DR images, focus-trap mode, TAV mode.  For me, the many pluses far outweigh the few minuses.  The camera is an absolute delight.","Pentax crushed it with his camera. For landscape and portriture this lens is a monster featuring Unbelivable dynamic range and shadow recovery. Buy it, make your Nikon friends jealous and your canon friends green with image envy.  The new D FA lenses do not disappoint either and this camera has brought a 40  year old \"M\" lens out of retirement with phenomenal results ...<br /><br />Then ergonomics of this camera are great and the controls are very well designed. Anyone changing over from another brand will adapt quickly. After leaving Canon I thought Pentax was a bit quirky, now I think Nikon and Canon are archaic. Pentax continues to get all the little things right and Ricoh has only improved on this tradition..","I have ordered the camera on May 24 and it got delivered on June 1.  So dont let the out of stock discourage from ordering it.  After using it for a week, I totally love it! The focus is fast and reliable. Pictures have very fine details. Design is ergonomic, very comfortable in hand. Control is intuitive, stepping up from Kodak SLR/n I had no issue getting used to control. Battery life is very good, I went to an event and took 800 pictures in the course of a whole day, the battery indicator still showing \"full\". I am still learning to play with all the functions. I am happy with the purchase.","Takes great pictures.","It s the best ff camera ever...","Made the decision in late April to upgrade my imaging possibilities by purchasing the Pentax K-1. Coming from a Canon 5D with a 24-105 f/4 L lens this wasn't a decision made lightly. After much research decided to roll the dice and take the plunge. After receiving the camera May 5th, 2016, I've put it through he paces (using mainly the new Pentax D FA 28-105mm F3.5-5.6ED DC WR HD Lens) over the past 3 weeks. Mainly shooting around New York City, especially during the middle of the night working on my NYC Nights ebook project. And, after spending this past week in Arizona and Utah shooting in a variety of sites far from civilization during the harshness of Southwestern daylight.<br /><br />Conclusion? I'm still smiling about my decision. Pentax, what a home run of a machine you've created!<br /><br />The possibilities available with this camera - inventiveness of design, ease of layout, imaging options, customization, robust RAW file generation, ISO capabilities, user friendliness, dynamic range, solidness (can kinda go on and on in no particular order). What a pleasure it is roaming around any shoot scenario knowing you have a camera that can handle whatever is thrown at it.<br /><br />Battery life is ridiculous. I have 3 new batteries, pretty much used only 1 on my Southwest Trip shooting close to 2,000 RAW images on a single charge, around 1,000 on 1 of the other batteries. Dual memory card slots worked perfectly (using 2 SanDisk Extreme PRO SDSDXPA-064G-X46 SDXC Flash Memory Card with a SanDisk Extreme PRO SDSDXPA-128G-X46 SDXC Flash Memory Card as my backup). I've attached a sample image from the trip from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon - 5 exposure image merged in Photomatix, post in Adobe Camera Raw, slight contrast and warmth in Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.<br /><br />Can't recommend this camera any more highly - you will be smiling all the time while using it :-) . . .","Delivered only a fortnight ago from my usual London, England, Pentax specialist, the K-1 is already impressing me. Content to focus manually ( I work professionally using a combination of Pentax 645D with Pentax 6x7 lenses ) I've already been delighted with the results obtained using a Pentax SMC-A 50mm/f1.7, a Rokinon 85mm/f1.4 ( bought a while back when I placed my K-1 order) and a Zeiss 85mm/f1.4 ZKT that I snapped up when I saw it for sale, secondhand, a few weeks ago in Cologne, Germany. All three lens have been brilliant placed in front of the K-1's full-frame sensor. Already I've felt confident enough to shoot a couple of client portrait sessions with it and have delighted both myself and my clients with the resulting images. I suspect the combination of K-1 and Zeiss 85/1.4 may quickly supplant, or at least compliment, my favoured 645D/6x7 105/2.4 outfit for many boudoir sessions. Controls , while different from the layout of the K-3, K-5 and 645D with which I'm highly familiar, held no real terrors. Accurate spot and multi-zone metering, plus excellent white balance, make ambient light shooting a doddle. For studio flash I shoot on manual, relying on incidence readings from my trusty Minolta Autometer, firing my studio flash heads via a hotshoe-mount Bowens Pulsar Tx system. I haven't yet come to terms with the cross-tilt viewing screen, being a diehard optical viewfinder man, but I'm occasionally trying it. Build wise, as with all Pentax cameras, the K-1 is reassuringly weighty.<br /><br />Update - September 2016. I have now been using this camera for four months, since May. In combination with the amazing Zeiss ZKT 85mm/f1.4 lens probably accounts for 20-25% of my output. Still not using the cross-tilt screen !!! Now searching for a Zeiss ZKT 50mm/f1.4<br />to cement my relationship with this camera.","Excellent. This is the DSLR I have been waiting fifteen years for; it integrates with my existing Pentax-A lenses. All my SLRs, going back to 1985, are Pentax.","Just a magnificent camera! Coming from a K-3, the autofocus is incredibly fast and accurate. Continuous autofocus, in particular, just doesn't let me down. I love the feel and ergonomics. The high ISO is amazing, and files are just breathtaking in color rendition and sharpness. I have found exposures when using automatic modes to be more accurate in difficult lighting situations, and auto white balance is incredibly spot on.<br /><br />A few features that I especially love:<br />-screen brightening, when shooting outdoors in bright sunlight<br />-tilting screen, combined with awesome live view (You can hold the camera way up and shoot directly down on things and are actually able to see what you're shooting.)<br />-the third dial. I know others don't like it, but it is really handy to set it for ISO and not have to press a button and a dial.<br /><br />This camera feels intuitive. Whenever I pick up a Canon or Nikon, they don't feel right in my hands and there are things that are buried in the menus that I can easily get to with a push of a button or dial on my Pentax cameras. Coming from a k-3, I was able to figure everything out without going to the owner's manual.<br /><br />This camera can compete against cameras that cost twice as much in terms of autofocus speed and accuracy and image quality. Well done, Ricoh!","A feature packed camera with a gorgeous image quality.  However, like other reviewer pointed out, I could do without the function dial and the wheel on top, it is redundant and useless.<br /><br />This is my first full-frame DSLR, since I have always been a pentaxian.  I really was expecting some degree of similarity to the glorious K5 IIs, which has been my camera for the last two years.  To my surprise, there is little, if any, in common with previous Pentax models as far as the interface and menu systems.  The manual, unfortunately, was printed with very small letters so I had to download it and print it larger so I could read it.  You will really have to read the manual, even if you are a loyal Pentax shooter, no way around it.  Metering and focusing are totally different to what I was used to..<br /><br />As usual in Pentax bodies, the build is solid, like a little tank, yet the camera feels comfortable and firm in my hands.  Excellent ergonomics.<br /><br />And now to the point.<br /><br />I tested the camera with the Pentax smc 24mm FA*, a lens from the film era, since Pentax does not really offer many choices for this camera as of yet, and I am not willing to pay a small fortune for the D FA 24-70mm that many folks have uncovered as a Tamron re-brand.  So please keep in mind that I tested it with a film-era lens.<br /><br />At f/2 the image was as soft as a petal, but that is due to the lens, of course.  At f/5.6 it began to really shine, reaching the \"sweet spot\" at f/8, like most lenses do.  The image was gorgeous.  My test shots included tree barks and tree branches, house roofs and a metal fence.  At f/8 the image was impeccable, with those lovely Pentax colors and a very decent contrast, even untouched in post.  I shoot RAW, by the way.<br /><br />One thing that certainly made me very happy was the Dynamic Range of this camera.  If you are a landscape photographer, you will surely appreciate this.  Highlight recovery and shadow recovery in post is a breeze, and simply amazing.<br /><br />Then later that evening, I took a few shots of my professional model, Nikki, my cat.  I used an off camera flash, and...boy, the photos came out so good that I might send them to \"Cat Fancy\" magazine, just kidding.  At that moment, I knew I had made a great purchase and even my \"nikonian\" friend said they were simply impressive.  Those shots were taken with the legendary Tamron DG 70-300 mm, my favorite portrait lens.<br /><br />In image quality, I dare to say this camera competes with bodies from other brands that cost 2 or 3 times as much.  I really can't be more pleased with the results.  Yes, the K5 IIs renders spectacular photos, but the K1 definitely takes the cake, by far.<br /><br />I would just like there were more digital lenses available for this body, but in the meantime, I will get by with film era primes.  I also wish Pentax would have included an USB cord in the box.  Oh well, a minor little sin.  Lastly, the detachable LCD screen is a joke.<br /><br />If you are on the market for a full frame camera, please consider this weather-sealed body.  It won't let you down.","I have not fully tested this camera, but after a couple of days I am already very happy. I sold my Pentax k3 and bought the k1 and there is a great difference. Compared to the k3 it does have more weight and is larger, however it is smaller when compared side by side a Nikon d750. It feels very solid and well built. The video is an amazing upgrade from the k3, you don't need 60p for great video. Another thing I noticed right away was the live view, compared to the k3 it is night and day, now I can actually tell what I'm focusing on during video. The shutter is not loud, there is no \"clack\" sound like other full frame cameras. The dials on top, I personally enjoy, I use it for the ISO, now I can change the ISO with the dial instead of having to push the ISO button. The picture quality is excellent , especially with an old smc pentax m 50mm 1.4, I love the colors and contrast captured in every photo. So far these are the only things I've had a chance to play with, I'm sure I'll update this review once I use this camera more. Other than that I love this camera and I would recommend it , I know there isn't a large selection of lenses , but just go grab some old takumars!","People get caught up in the sensor resolution race and being brand loyalists so much that they stop paying attention to the benefits of full frame.<br />The only thing I don't care for on the K1 is the new function dial and function wheel on the top right side of the body. Waste of space so far.<br />*This review has math in it*<br />My main reason for going full frame from my pentax k-3 is for low light performance. Most people know to multiply their focal length by the crop factor of their camera's sensor to get a \"35mm\" equivalent. Fewer people know that they should do the same to their aperture. Fewer still are aware that they can figure the equivalent ISO by squaring the crop factor and using that as a multiplier. Eg: pentax k3 has a 1.5x crop factor. 1.5^2 is 2.25. So the multiplier for equivalent ISO is 2.25. That means if I get low noise images at 800 ISO on the k3 I can get the same level of noise at a higher ISO on the k1. 800 x 2.25=1800. So if I could dial in 1800 ISO on the k1 it would be the same level of noise. What all of this means is you can shoot in low light situations at faster shutter speeds to freeze motion at acceptable noise levels.<br />When I put my tamron \"28-75mm f/2.8\" on my k3 I am really shooting a 42-112mm f/4.2. All of this math adds up to multiple stops of light gained by shooting full frame.<br /><br />Tony Northrup has a video explaining everything I just wrote with sample images from three different crop factors. At the link below:<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm going to keep the K3 as a back up body or for time-lapse at shoots.","It was no more than half a year ago, that I picked up my first dslr.  A Pentax K-S2.  That was not without weeks and weeks of research.  It was my first one after all and like for many, we tend to want that to be something special.  What started of as a hunt for a bridge camera, the Nikon P-900 to be exact, ended up becoming a journey of learning and an unrelenting welcome obsession.  After almost three months of studying dslr's, delving into the world of photography, finding out that the best instrument of expression I could utilize wasn't my phone or some glorified point and shoot--not even a bridge one--, I pulled the trigger and had my first transaction with B&H. A week later the K-S2 was in my hands.  It's been a long journey since.  I learned a lot with it.  Shot tons with it.  Been asked to shoot with it and got paid for it.  I've grown with my Pentax camera at an alarming rate, but it just goes to show the capability and dependability of these well designed tools.  I've got events lined up for the rest of spring and all through this coming summer.  It goes without saying that I needed a second body.  I suppose I joined the Pentax fold and ranks in just the right time; meaning I didn't have to wait long for the release of their first full-frame dslr.  It came at just the right time too.<br />If you're looking for a full-frame dslr or are in the market for one, chances are you're on the hunt and you've been canvasing all the available brands.  You're doing your research, reading the reviews, if you're near a store, you might even get to demo a few.  You may or may not factor in the cost.  But in truth, with regards to the K-1, there's no loss there.  This camera is jam-packed with features.  Made just as so to compete with other full-frame dslr's within its range.  The thing about Pentax that got me from the get-go, eventhough I was leaning towards the mainstream brands like Nikon or Canon, is their customizability--they provide you with such an intuitive set of controls and fine crafted cameras.  These are tools designed with the photographer in mind.  These are tools you can grow with.  These are tools that will help you better your art and realize your vision.  I'm not telling you to go and get a Pentax if you're in the market for a dslr.  I'm telling you that if you do, you won't regret it and you'll be the better for it.<br />  Out of the box, I resumed to pair the K-1 with an FA 77mm F1.8 Limited.  Conducted a test that started in my kitchen and living room and eventually out into the nighttime streets of Glenwood Springs, then finally in a nightclub/bar where everyone is enveloped in darkness.  I had done well and at times amazing with the K-S2.  The K-1 clearly has taken me to another level... something beyond the dictates of a simple upgrade to a full frame.  It is inspiring, driving confidence, a wicked penchant for allowing you to attain the images that you imagine and desire, it carries the same fuel that lit a fire in your heart that endeared you to photography and photography to you.  I understand this isn't a conventional review, but I'm not conventional.  In a way, neither is Pentax.  So cheers to you fellow photographer and cheers to Pentax on the release of the K-1.  In the end, whatever choice you make, be it this camera or that camera, it would still be a very good choice.  After all, you will still be creating.  And that is beautiful."]},{"name":"Canon EOS M5","amazon_reviews":["This camera is great! Lightweight!","I personally use this camera with the 11-22mm EF-M lens for landscapes and it has been awesome.

Added this to my Canon camera collection for travel photography use. Small, light with excellent controls!","I have a lot of DSLR Gear, mostly Canon with a lot of lenses. I had two issues with these, one, they were getting too heavy to haul around all day and 2, setting the focus point, even with the toggles wasn't quick enough at times.<br /><br />This camera solves both those issues for me. Whether you use the Electronic Viewfinder (which is very good, but I still prefer the optical ones in the DSLR's) or the back screen, focus quick and very accurate on the MF. The Dual Pixel technology that Canon has is really a game changer. All lenses focus accurately where you want them to, which is I think is critical (and difficult to nail quickly), as the exposure is a lot easier to handle using the P-A-S-M modes in creating a keeper.<br /><br />You can move the focus point in two ways:<br /><br />1. If looking thru the eye-finder, by moving your thumb across the back screen and then pressing the shutter.<br />2. Like a phone camera using the back-screen alone where you can touch the screen (and have it optionally click the shutter also) , which I find very convenient, for snapshots.<br /><br />Its features and sensor are mostly based on the Canon 80D DSLR, that was praised for its much improved dynamic range and customizability. The Auto ISO and AF parameter customising is a little less than the 80D, but is livable and could be incorporated in a later firmware upgrade, though unlikely based on Canon's past history of firmware upgrades.<br /><br />I noticed that the EF-M lenses, especially the 22mm, 28mm macro and 11-22 zoom are really good in all respects, and the other zooms, 15-45, 18-150 (both kit zooms) and the 55-200 are also pretty sharp and contrasty. The combination of size, weight, 24MP and these lenses with dual pixel focus is unbeatable today.<br /><br />Being able to use all your other EF and EF-S lenses with a canon branded adapter, without losing any functionality, picture quality, focusing speed is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />Would I replace a DSLR (especially with long lens) with this combo, NO. Its not an action camera per se, (ergonomically), but does quite well for casual action.<br />Would I use this for movies,  (I don't shoot/need 4K video) with all the features of silent focus, in-lens stabilization combined with in-camera digital stabilization): YES<br /><br />I could stuff the camera, kit zoom, low light 22mm f/2.0 (35 mm Full Frame equivalent) prime, the 11-22 wide angle zoom and 55-200 telephoto zoom with spare batteries, polarizers etc, and be ready for any airline based vacation with about 1/3rd the weight of my DSLR equivalent, being able to cover 18 mm ultrawide to 320 mm telephoto full frame equivalent coverage.I wouldn't be giving up much with the quality of pictures, although I would take the DSLR's if I were driving my car.<br /><br />This camera fills a unique niche (more so as a system), than other competitors camera systems. The EF-M lenses cost less than $500 for the most expensive 18-150 zoom and others are $250 to 400 currently. The competitions lenses are more expensive when you match picture quality. The latest Digic 7 processor in this camera improves speed and in-camera processing significantly over its predecessors such as the M3, and it beats using a phone for taking pictures hands down.<br /><br />And then there is Canons reliability and service, which are second to none.","I am a professional photographer and have used Medium format digital cameras (Hasselblad and Phase Backs) as well as 35mm SLRs mainly Canon. This camera is a great travel camera with top quality image and all the controls you need. Use the Canon lens adapter and then you can use all canon lenses.","I'm still getting used to the camera. I currently also have Canon 7D (first gen), so there's some adjustment there. Picture and video quality excellent - and of course it's much easier to hold and carry around.<br /><br />I'm waiting to see some mass market user guides written for the M5.","Camera is great but there are better packages out there for the same money so shop around.","I picked up a body only M5 at Best Buy. I was so excited for this camera! I use my Canon eos M2 w/ 22mm daily, it is always in my purse or bag. My hope for the M5 was to get the shots that I sometimes miss with my M2, mainly my young son. I read reviews (limited at the time) and watched the promo videos. The face tracking and improved AF is really what caught my attention and a little better ISO performance couldn't hurt.<br /><br />Immediately out of the box I didn't like the overly rubbery feel of the grip. I also have a 6D but this grip felt different. I popped the battery into it, got a sd card, and went out to play with it. Menus are intuitive if you are already a canon user so I set things up the way I like them and started shooting. Coloring was a little cool, but I shoot raw so that is easily adjusted in post or with minor corrections in the camera settings. One thing I started irritating me was my thumb kept bumping the record button and it would start recording video even if I was in Av mode. That button could be mapped to something else, but my thumb would still hit it. I don't have big hands, I can't palm a basketball so who knows maybe my thumb isn't long enough :)<br /><br />I thought the record button might be a learning curve thing so I dismissed it and started taking pictures of my 2.5 y/o playing. I set to shutter priority, face tracking, continuous AF, shutter at 1/100. The face tracking tracked an emblem on his shirt as much as it did his face and the shutter was slow to respond when I pressed it all the way down. But the main problem is that a lot of the time it couldn't find focus and would lock up for a second with a orangish box. It was so frustrating because with how Canon and other reviewers built up the AF as comparable to an 80D and its the same chip as the new 5D mk IV, I expected it to blow my M2 out of the water. My M2 performed better, it may have missed a couple shots but it fired the shot. The M2 would fire and capture an out of focus shot and then recover for another in less time that the M5 would recover after locking out because it couldn't find focus. Some people say \"why would you want out of focus shots\" 1. recovered faster 2. sometimes there is something usable, I would rather have an out of focus than nothing at all so I can decide if its trash.<br /><br />The EVF has a sensor to detect when you bring the camera to eye level and will auto switch from the back screen. Great idea but only one will work at a time so if it picked up my hand while I was going through the menus the screen would black out. I switched it to manual and shut off the EVF. I could have mapped that to a function button, but at this point the M5 was feeling like a burden... and a $1000 burden.<br /><br />For me photography is just as much the machine in my hand as capturing the image. It has to be enjoyable and freeing. Unfortunately the M5 felt like a burden in a way no other camera ever has. And I was shocked, there aren't really any critical reviews of the M5 except for a few youtubers that won't like anything Canon does. For others my issues might not be a big deal and they will love the camera. I will stick with my M2 that I picked up for under $400 w/ 22mm.<br /><br />If you want to check out the AF problems I had search for MadnessMobile on youtube and he has a video.  Amazon would not let me post a link.","This seems to be a very polarizing camera.  However, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  The camera is compact, high performance, and works well with Canon DSLR lenses if you by the adapter.","This is my first purchase of an expensive camera. On first impression, the camera performs well. I like the snappy auto focus this camera has but do find the shortcoming of it when zoomed to the larger focal lengths like 100 to 150mm. The auto focus seems to hunt a lot at those ranges, especially in low light. Image quality is nice. Wouldn't recommend cropping the images because I notice some digital noise when zoomed in. I don't know if that is the camera or user error for being a beginner as well. WiFi capability is soooo useful and works great with the app. Size is small but nice for travel. EVF is great with little to no lag at all. The only disappointing this is that Canon doesn't have fast lenses for this M mount. My next purchase will be the adaptor and a fast EF lens. Overall good camera","I have this for one week. In this one week, I tested the following<br /><br />1. M5 with 15-45 lens - works great. Happy with it. I was able to open the M5 raw files in Lightroom and yes there is a profile correction for 15-45mm lens. Perhaps I have seen sharper lens. Yet I will use this lens as I have frequently wished for wider than 28mm in many situations. It does take well to sharpening and images do perk up quite a bit<br /><br />2. M5 with EF/EF-S lenses.<br />You will need to buy the EFM-EF/S adaptor. Mine came bundled as it was the first few sets during initial release. In general all lenses worked great. No indecisive hunting or back and forth as far as AF is concerned. Focus was quick, accurate, and spot on. I am very happy. Surprisingly, the AF was good with the Sigma and Tamron lens. The tamron lens I have is screwdriver type tech I think. So it makes buzzing sound when it focuses. However the AF was fast and accurate. Just that I have to be careful to not hold the focus ring accidentally. The AF speed and accuracy of 100-400mm both with and without 1.4X TC was icing on the cake for me. Also the balance of the lens, and usability at least in house looks ok to me. I am excited and can't wait for the snow to melt down here in Vancouver. We do have a challenge as most sidewalks are still covered in snow in the suburbs where I stay. I eagerly wait to test it in the field for subject tracking.<br />Lenses tested<br />EF 50mm STM lens, EF-S 24mm STM EF-S 10-18mm STM, EF 100-400mm II with and without 1.4X TC III, EF-S 18-135mm STM USM Nano, Sigma 8-16mm, Tamron 17-0 f2.8 (non-IS)<br /><br />3. FD / FL glass with EFM adaptor<br />With the focus peak in colour as well as magnify option, I found it fairly straightforward to focus manually. Lenses tried - Canon FD 50mm f1.4, Canon FD24mm f2.8, Canon FL 58mm f1.2<br /><br />4. M42 glass with M42 to EF adaptor + EFM-EF/S adaptor stacked together<br />Sears 28mm f2.8, Russian lenses 37mm, 55mm, 85mm, 135mm<br /><br />5. Battery - I have set the camera battery settings to Eco. Changed the menu display to conserve battery (night mode - whatever it is called - basically black background with orange red menu). Power save to 1 minute. With this setting, so far I am on my second battery and meter still shows full. File count is 1300 images. So realistically in the field, I can safely expect 500 to 600 pictures per battery.<br /><br />6. Image quality (IQ) - I have set auto-ISO to max at 6400. So far looking at the test images, the IQ is very good at various ISO settings including 6400. I can foresee capturing some memories with this lovely camera.<br /><br />7. Handling - The camera feels good. I have average size hands. Most buttons are where they should be. Getting used to changing setting by touch and feel. The grip is just nice. EVF looks good to me. Didn't see any lag. I didn't go looking for lag in EVF and I didn't notice anything. I did bump the video recording unintentionally. So I will dig into settings and change the button. Overall it handles great. Can see myself loving it.<br /><br />8. Speedlights - I have 580 EX II, 320 EX, 270 EX. I could not trigger wireless with built in flash. Mounted the 580 EX II on body and the magic of Canon lighting multiple flashes was available and worked well. I ordered 90EX flash as it can function as a master. That way I can utilize the 580EX II closer to subject for creativity. In a nutshell, it works and works quite well<br /><br />From the tests carried out thus far, I am very happy, impressed, and feel this is a great camera.<br /><br />Will update review periodically. All in all - highly recommended","I have been a long time Canon customer dating back to the film days (fTb, A1) and purchased their first rebel.  I have owned or utilized almost every camera in the Rebel line as well as the 60D and a few full sized bodies.  I truly believe the adage that the best camera is the one you have and often would yearn for a smaller Canon body than even the Rebels. I thought the SL1 or other M series cameras would be the answer, but there were a few limitations that made me switch to the Olympus OMD M5.  I hated the fact I had to have 2 sets of glass.  Well, Canon has (finally) come through.  The M5 is everything I could ask for.  I love this body.  The kit lens isn't bad either and while I may buy some other M-Series lenses, the adapter allows the use of my other Canon lenses without any loss of quality.  The camera itself has a great sensor, awesome performance and totally adequate functionality as a travel camera or backup body.  Canon, you have won my heart once again!!!","Wonderful Quality.  Takes getting used to due to size, but so far very good camera","Pros:<br /><br />1. Much improved AF speed over M3. Pretty much instantaneous. In dimmer light and lower contrast situation, the AF struggles a little bit with slow zoom lenses. However there is now manual focus peaking which is quite helpful. I tried using the 35 f2 IS through an adaptor. It's incredibly fast even in low light.<br /><br />2. Touch and drag AF. While looking through the viewfinder, you can drag the focus point using the touch screen. This can be useful in some situations. But I find it faster to compose with with the LCD screen, tap on what I want to focus on, and then look through the viewfinder. Or if I am taking picture of a person, I just use face detect.<br /><br />3. The ergonomics is getting even more similar to other Canon DSLR. I am able to adjust settings much quicker than when using M3. The grip is still very small and not comfortable to hold for extended period of time. But that's really the trade-off we have to live with.<br /><br />4. Built-in viewfinder is nice and bright. Unlike an optical viewfinder, there is a lag that is noticeable espeically if I do a panning motion. This is something to get used to. I believe Fuji xt2 has shorter lag but that's a different league of mirrorless camera. The EVF in the M5 is good enough for my purpose. Definitely beats the detachable EVF of the M3.<br /><br />5. Customizable buttons. Most buttons can be customized to my own liking. For instance, I assign the delete button as touch shutter, the flash button as display on/off, the front button as AF->servo, etc. Even the red dot record button can be assigned to something else.<br /><br />6. Flip screen. I have had 80D briefly. I personally prefer a simple flip up/down screen as opposed to a fully articulating screen. With an articulating screen I need to flip the screen out to the side before I can flip up and down. To me that's not very efficient. Flipping up and down is so much faster. It can flip all the way facing front for selfies.<br /><br />7. Image quality. Nothing to complain about. Even M3 was pretty good. Now with improved dynamic range, I'm even happier with how much I can edit the RAW files.<br /><br />8. Continuous shooting. With the M3 if I hold down the shutter it will take something like 5 pictures and then the camera slows down. I'm not a techie but I guess the buffer fills up too quickly. Now it can last way longer. Nothing scientific. But at least I no longer feel like I'm missing critical moments as the M3 would .<br /><br />9. Small. To take advantage of compactness you absolutely must use M lenses. Canon finally came out with a 18-150mm which I purchased also. M5 + 11-22 + 18-150 +28 macro pretty much fulfills most of my needs. I still carry 5dmk3 with me sometimes but its main purpose now is for fast prime lenses like 135L. I use slow zooms on M5 and fast primes on full frame. To me it makes the most sense. I only got the 18-150 for one day. So far I'm happy with my purchase. It seems as good as the 18-55 kit.<br /><br />10. Customizable timer. Now with M5, I can set up the camera to, for instance, take 10 pictures consecutively with 5 seconds delay. What it means is that I can set up the camera on a tripod, walk back to my family, and get 10 pictures taken while we try to convince our 3 year-old to look at the camera. I don't think it was available on m3.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Expensive. Listing price is not substantially cheaper than 80D. The 80D is a better camera in an absolute sense. But M5 is compact and offers similar image quality. 80D is weather sealed. M5 is not. A refurbished or used M3 is around $300 right now. I personally feel that $800 would have been a fair launch price. If you don't need it right now, you should wait for a price drop.<br /><br />2. No weather sealing. Granted, the M lenses are not weather sealed so it's pointless to weather seal the camera body. But the thought of paying $1000 for a non-weather resistant camera just doesn't much sense especially knowing that the 80D does offer weather resistance. It's not a deal breaker but I would have been a happier customer.<br /><br />3. Battery life. It's nothing compared to the 80D which can shoot hundred of shots without recharging. Just buy a few spares. I don't under why Canon charges so much for the EP 17. Almost the same price as 5D, 80D batteries.<br /><br />4. Where is tap and focus?? I have to tap on the subject I want to shoot and then half press shutter to focus. This happens when I disable continuous focus. If I let the camera keep acquiring focus it'll drain the battery, so I always turn continuous focus off. This is different from the 80D where I can tap on the screen and it will focus on exactly where I tap. I get very annoyed by this. Maybe Canon is trying to help us save battery but they should give users the option to turn it on/off. Well, at least I can use tap and shoot, which is another handy feature. Tap to focus is available in movie mode. That's a big deal. Because if it's not even available in movie mode, I'm returning the camera.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br />Overall, I'm ambivalent about the M5. It's finally looking less like a point and shoot and more like a dslr. I like M5 to some extent but it doesn't quite match the 80D. It's certainly better than M3 in many ways. But it depends on how desperately you need faster AF and a viewfinder. In terms of image quality, there just isn't substantial change. M3 was great. I'm not a patient person and I can't stand the M3 being slow.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is price. If as I said the launch price were $800 and I had purchased it at a nice discount price of $650 I'd be a happy camper. I'm trying to say that the value proposition isn't high at this point. The reason I bought it at launch price is because I can no longer carry heavy gear like I used to, and the only mirrorless option from canon that can do what I need it to do is M3 or M5, and between them M5 is highly preferable.<br /><br />Another thing many complain about is the lack of lens selection. I felt that way before. But now that the 18-150 and 28 macro are released, I think I'm happy as far as lens choices. I don't want big lenses on a small body. Slow zoom is fine if that's what it takes to preserve compactness.","Very nice.  The kit lens is as good as a kit lens gets. Got the Canon pancake 22mm 2F STM fixed lens and results are much better than the kit zoom lens.  The combination with the 22mm fixed lens is a very small pacakge with very fast and accurate AF and fair bokeh (see the attached picture.)  This is my go to lens for now.  Just got the Sigma Art 18mm-35mm 1.8F lens with 9 blade aperture and much improved bokeh and will try it out.  Be aware that 3rd party EOS M adapters have circular instead of oval opening found on Canon adapters.  So you will get a light haze when used on an APS-C sensor if you do not use a hood with 3rd party adapters...  Google it and you will see what I mean...<br /><br />For the size, I really like this camera.  I wish there is micro AF adjustment, but frankly I would not know where Canon can put it as it is already so compact.","Finally received the EOS M5-M with the 15-45 STM kit lens. The camera feels great in my hands and I'm really enjoying having a touch screen for the first time on a camera. The build quality of the camera is fine and the back screen and viewfinder are super sharp and bright.<br /><br />The kit lens seems fine but I need to really do more testing. It's very small but feels good in the hand and fits the body nicely. I picked up the Fotodiox Pro Lens Adapter with Auto-Exposure/Auto-Focus & Auto-Aperture (EF to EOSm - Auto), so I will be using this with some L glass. (Had a weird experience with that adapter. At first it would not autofocus. After a minute it kicked in, I'm not sure if this delay is normal or not. If this continues, I might need to return it for the more expensive Canon Version - Canon EOS M Mount Adapter )<br /><br />Since it showed up after dark, I've only done a few test shots. Did a few with available light and was amazed at how good the image stabilization worked at super slow shutter speeds. Decided to see how the menus worked with 600EX-RT Speedlite, controlled by the ST-E3-RT. Menus where just like what I have on my 5D MIII, only of course with the touch screen.<br /><br />Very happy but honestly, I haven't done very much with the camera yet. As I use and test it, I'll update this review."]},{"name":"Fujifilm X-Pro2","amazon_reviews":["I love it.","awesome camera","Love the camera, I've used the Canon 5 series cameras with the L glass for professional gigs and as an enthusiast, moved to the Fuji system several years ago.

If you don't like it sell it plain and simple","Light and compact!","So, here's the good- great economics. I love having this camera in my hands. I could shoot on it all day. I'm coming from using mostly older, manual film cameras. I love the sizes of the \"Fujicron\" lenses and hope they come out with more.<br /><br />The bad- the optical viewfinder is worthless. Seriously, it won't focus on anything. I've tried messing with the settings a hundred different ways and it's always bad. The evf in it is also super unreliable- but not for focusing. It's dim as all get out, and will not give you a reliable prediction of what your picture will look like.<br /><br />I was excited for the film simulations, but in my experience they don't actually simulate the chosen film at all. Or if they do, it's in a very generic way. It's like they went, \"Velvia has saturated colors. Let's saturate the colors and call it Velvia,\" forgetting that various Velvia (50 or 100) act very different from each other, and are prone to favouring certain color wave lengths. Either way, Velvia film looks nothing like the Velvia simulation and the same goes for all of them. That being said, I still think the film simulation is a cool feature, even if it doesn't simulate any actual films.<br /><br />The OVF is the biggest let down for me as that's why I got this in the first place over the XT2 and the like. Well that and the whole \"rangefinders don't block out your face so people feel more at ease when you're photographing them\" thing, which I think holds true with this camera. It's very unassuming and I think people feel more at ease in front of it, especially with the \"Fujicron\" lenses. I also have the 16mm f1.4, but I don't think it's all that. Actually plan on returning it and getting the 14mm instead, which I feel is smaller and less intrusive.<br /><br />The images from this lens are ok, but I feel like they look a bit flat. Maybe I'm a hipster, but that's the way I feel about most digital pictures. There's no real breath to them.  They're very matter of fact, nothing magical or dream like about them.<br /><br />I'm on the fence about whether to return this or not. It's grown on me, and like I said, I love the feel of it in hands, but also continually disappointed me.<br /><br />I guess I have to make a big decision.","Seriously.","Battery life is the only complaint.","Fantastic camera, as usual for Fujifilm. Image quality is stunning. AF is fantastic. Two card slots, great.<br />Does everything I could want or need. 8 fps plenty for many situations. Surprise, really good video too, with the film simulations!  If you like the rangefinder 'style' with amazing color, (monochrome too!...acros--wow), this camera is fantastic. Great form factor, excellent build quality. Can't say enough about it, or about Fujifilm's sensibility as well. It makes photography fun and engaging. It feels like a camera instead of a computer. Tactile, ergonomics, everything is right there.  Your engaging purely in the experience of photography, instead of some extra 'ability, along with calls, mails, tweets, etc., etc. To me, there IS a real difference, multitasking aside. Kudos to Fujifilm for heightening and focusing on that experience, with such excellence and commitment. Bravo.","Arguably the best candid street portraiture camera ever made.  Combines the classic feel of a rangefinder with a multitude of modern technological conveniences.  The optical viewfinder (OVF) is superb.  Allows full view beyond the area of capture so you can see subjects before they enter the frame.  The integrated \"picture-in-picture\" dual display that overlays the electronic viewfinder inside the optical finder is amazing.  It really is the best of both worlds.  The speed and performances of the X-Pro2 is way beyond the now venerable original X-Pro1.  It surpasses my X-T1 in all aspects.","I am a serious enthusiast and honestly, this camera has nailed a lot of things other camera manufacturers have not. Although the camera is not perfect, it truly deliver professional results.","This camera is even better than I had expected. Focus is fast, low light performance is really good, and I love manual focusing with this lens and all the options that I have for it. I'm still getting used to the camera, and there are a lot of things to get used to, but it is a delight to use.","I thought about buying an xt2 when they came out, but this camera is still an amazing performer.  I have previously owned and used the xe1, xe2, xt1, and this is my favorite by far.  I skipped the xpro1 because I felt like the technology and looked more like an slr than the xpro1 (the xpro2 is almost identical in appearance, which is why I mention it).  However, I think I was missing out on something by dismissing the rangefinder style.  People react to it differently.  In a street setting, a party or even a portrait session people feel more comfortable and engaged.  It is a conversational piece, and helps people get excited about the potential \"vintage\" feel they will get.  With Fuji colors you cannot go wrong.  They raw processed images hold up better than Canon in my opinion and just as well as my Nikon D750 in dynamic range.<br /><br />The xpro 2 is a definite keeper for a few years.  I don't need 4k video, and I don't need a flippy screen so I don't think that purchasing the xt2 is for me.  I love that I can adapt my leica M lenses to it, and the manual focus peaking mode works phenomenally well.  I can manual focus just as quickly and accurately as I can autofocus with some lenses.","Just a great camera for street photography.","My new favorite camera.  It's very fast and I love how I can access most buttons and functions with one hand.  Image quality is amazeballs and I sometimes surprise myself with what I can get in very low light.","One of the reasons I bought this camera was because of the lousy exposure dial on the X Pro One. It gets knocked out of position all of the time ruining many pictures. Rather then fix this defect in design, they made it worse. The dial is bigger and has even less resistance to accidental movement. They should fire the engineer who redesigned this feature !!!!!!! Still I like this camera.","I rekindled my love with photography with an X-T10 a few months ago. Clearly these are not apples to apples but I think its worth sharing the differences... It was a great compact camera but lacked the pep I've come to expect from modern electronics. I was able to play with an X-Pro2 with a Fuji rep a local store (where I bought it from) an was really impressed with its autofocus performance and of course the additional 8Mp over the X-T10. The EVF far exceeds the X-T10 in my experience too. Lag and freezing upon taking a photo have been improved to the point where I don't notice it. I also enjoy the lack of the feature dial I never used and as this camera places an emphasis on the crowd that misses their 35mm. The expose compensation dial is huge and absolutely useless for me. If I did use it, I would be bummed that its never at 0 even though I do not intentionally change it. You will bump it and it will move, so just watch out for that. The addition of grain simulation and Acros give it a leg up too. While you can do this all in post, seeing it at the moment you snap a photo is fantastic because you can start to train your mind how things will look. Additionally those new to this feature will be happy to know that when shot in RAW, those settings are not hard coded. This means you can shoot in B&W but decide later it would look better in color. If you have an Instax printer or want to share to your phone, these in camera simulations are great to have.<br /><br />I like that its weather resistant even though not all my lenses are, a little piece of mind for an investment like this. Battery life isn't an issue for me, very similar to my X-T10, however it is rated at fewer shots. Dual SD gives me piece of mind by mirroring images. You could also set up a Wifi SD card with RAW+JPG to hack together tethering (which is not supported at this time.) The sensor performance is out of this world and is extraordinarily forgiving. You can easily push/pull 2 or more stops for those times where you got the moment, but missed the exposure. ISO performance is also improved over X-T10 where you can shoot in high/low ISO RAW as well as a faster flash sync. All your exposure settings are configurable while the camera is off. When you are conserving power or being sneaky to get those candid shots, this is truly a life saver. Given the dials are overly tactile I no longer have to look to see where I am at. One great example is the ISO dial which I controlled via a software defined wheel on the X-T10 but a physical wheel on the X-Pro2. Many people have complained that it feels \"fiddley\" or cheap, but I think its just fine. The LCD does not angle out, but I don't mind as I shoot 99% of the time with my face on the eye piece. The EVF doesn't play very well with sunglasses compared to the X-T10. Normal glasses are ok, but I do find it difficult to see the entire EVF compared to other camera I've used. Not a huge issue as I just work around it by angling your head just right. Using the range finder would also fix.<br /><br />Before getting this camera, I was never a range finder fan and I still don't find myself using it much. This bothered me as I wouldn't be using the main feature of this camera. However the EVF is just as first class as the range finder and you can lock the setting down as to avoid accidentally switching. The eye piece is off to the far left so no more nose smudges on my screen! I also considered waiting for the X-T2 but it appears Fuji is giving similar attention, features, and specs to both of these cameras to the point where I truly wouldn't care. Only time will tell I suppose but I expect this camera to last me years. It feels like a nice quality tool thats just the right size, weight, and specs.","TL;DR<br />-New sensor is better than the past two (I dare say way better)<br />-Resolution is amazing<br />-Joystick is a great idea<br />-ISO dial is annoying<br /><br />If you own one (or more) of the previous cameras with the older sensors (x-trans I and x-trans II) and are thinking about getting this camera then do it. Do it now. Right away you will notice the difference in IQ that I suspect comes from the new sensor+processor combo. The jpegs have gotten even better (yup) and the raw files are friendlier when it comes to pushing/pulling highlights/shadows.<br />The 8 extra megapixels are a Godsend which is something you'll notice as soon as you crop your first picture. The joystick is a great addition and the ability to backup your photos with 2 SD cards has trully made this a \"Pro\" camera.<br /><br />I gave this camera a 4 star review because 1) I don't like that I can't switch the ISO with the front or back dials (you con only use the top one) and 2) on a very sunny day I got the \"turn camera off and then on again\" message. The new firmware is supossed to have fixed that but it's still a concern for me until we get more reports that it has actually been fixed.","Excellent mirrorless camera, got rid of my Nikon 3Ds and no regret.","I crossed over from a Nikon D800 and never looked back…the images quality from this sensor is truely AMAZING!!!  I paired the xpro2 with the 23mm f/1.4 and now I carry my setup everywhere.. I really enjoy the evf","Awesome.  The X-Pro2 (along with my older X-E2) and the amazing Fuji lenses take amazing pictures.","I would like to type a long review spelling out how great this camera is and all its attributes but since I am not a fast typest I will just give it 5 star and thumbs up to Fuji for making one great camera with all the bugs and personality disorders from past fuji versions eliminated.<br />I use a Fuji 35mm F2 lens and a Samyang 12mm F2 lens thats it.","This is the first Fuji-X camera that I've felt totally confident using for professional work. The image quality has been there since the X-Pro1 (it's far better with the X-Pro2), but FujiFilm have finally built a camera with the speed and handling ergonomics up to par with my needs. I know it's going to work and I know it's going to focus quickly and accurately, and I know I can change all important settings without taking my eye from the viewfinder. In fact, it's one of only two cameras I own that I can configure while it is powered off. And while a number of users have complained about the ISO dial configuration but I find it no weirder than any camera, and more useful than most to be honest. This is a really nice camera to use. It doesn't ave any of the drawbacks that keep me from using the X-T1 more frequently (focus hesitation, EVF refresh lag in low light).","Awesome camera, feels very creative with it in hand and will reignite your love of photography.","Amazing camera.","I love this camera.  Hands down, love it.<br /><br />It took this camera for me to stop obsessing about getting the latest and greatest gear, about pouring over dxo lens scores and being unsatisfied because another lens got a higher score.  You can make highly artistic shots with an iPhone, so seriously stop.  At some point, the gear will be more than adequate to produce very high quality images that can be printed at large sizes.<br /><br />So why do I love this camera?  First and foremost, its fun to use.  Seriously, its a joy, and not to repeat the many others, but I feel like I connect with the art of photography though this camera more than I have with any other camera.  There's just that special something that makes it feel special.  I will contrast this with my Sony A7RII.  Yeah, the images are insane detail, but there's something completely soul-less about that camera.  Its almost like Fuji cameras are designed for real photographers, where the Sony ones are designed for spec hunters first, users second.  Not necessarily knocking Sony (again, the images are intensely good), but Fuji just feels like a camera should feel (and operate).<br /><br />Second, the image quality is fantastic.  No, its not my A7RII, but the only difference between the two is detail, and that detail will only be apparent at very high prints.  I fully expect to print 24X36\" with the XPRO2 and be stunned with the results.  Bigger, I probably need the A7RII.  But the sharpness, color, etc., are all fantastic.  Note I use Capture One 9 (upgrade just released for Fuji RAW support).<br /><br />Third, the ergonomics are great.  Love the aperture ring on the lens. I like the iso knob; maybe it'll get wonky after years of use, but Fuji appears to be so responsive to its users that I'd be surprised to not see a software update that lets you adjust iso by one of the other buttons.  The joystick for moving the focus point is awesome (and something sorely lacking from the A7RII).  I will say that the buttons aren't convenient for back button focus; that's a bummer.  The rear buttons are just not located in the right place to do it, although they're close enough that you could if you really want.<br /><br />Battery life is fine.  I can get several hours of shooting with one battery.  Yes, its not DLSR quality, but so it goes.<br /><br />AF performance is fantastic.  AF-C can hunt a little here and there (less responsive than a traditional DSLR), but it still works well enough, and AF-S/C are both incredible in low light.  the AF performance on this DESTROYS my A7RII.<br /><br />the cropped sensor vs full frame debate is a non-issue here.  whatever they've done with the sensor, its largely indistinguishable from any of the full frames I've owned in the past.  Slightly less detail b/c of the 24 MP (compared with my 42 MP A7RII), but ISO performance is at least as good as the full frames.  I'm very happy.  Honestly, I think we're close to the point where practically everything can produce more than adequate image quality in the pro/prosumer category.  You'll need the awe inspiring Phase One/Hassy to get significant improvements - but note that those improvements are really only necessary for huge image enlargements (ignoring for the moment dynamic range issues).<br /><br />its also a very fast processor.  You can fire 20+ images in a row instantly, and then immediately go to image playback to look at them.  or immediately keep shooting.  this is impossible on the A7RII.  I know the file sizes are vastly different, but if i burst 3 images on my A7RII, it takes a good 20-30 seconds before I can do anything again (shoot, review images, etc.).<br /><br />More than anything, though, I think I like the form factor/size the most.  I've had full out full frame Canon systems (5d mark 3), Nikon (D810) and now A7RII, all with the necessary component of tank-like lenses.  After a while, it just sucks to carry all that gear with you.  Even my previous D810 + 24-70 was close to a foot long; that's nuts.  Who wants to walk around with that?  How can you be spontaneous with your family with an extra appendage hanging from you?  DO you want to be \"that guy\" doing travel shots, annoying your family and reminding everyone you're a tourist?  An Xpro2 with any prime is so small and light that I do not hesitate for a second to put it over my shoulder and just go.  That changes everything.  Photography becomes fun again, not a sweat-inducing exercise in transporting gear.  I especially like the 23mm 1.4 lens as a walk around system.<br /><br />I strongly predict that my A7RII will collect dust.  I may use it for the occasional paid portrait shoot, but I suspect that 95%+ of my images will come from this body.  My only regret is it took me so long to discover Fuji.<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 2016 - I'm beginning to get frustrated with the camera's responsiveness.  It has generally zero ability to track moving subjects; I've experimented with every setting combination and the result is the same - its awful at it.  So AF-S mode is a non-starter.  In my old DSLR days, I'd never be out of AF-S mode, and would be ready for whatever (especially in portraits of children).  So with this camera, I miss those in-between shots, often where the magic happens.  It also is slow to lock focus.  To be fair - its very very fast, just not as fast as a DSLR.  If you're used to DSLR AF speeds, you'll notice a difference.  I still love the system's portability, however, and its image quality is very good.  Just feeling like I might want a DSLR in my bag again.","I sleep with it...what else can I say","This camera is truly magnificent!  There are many camera's out there which can take great photos when used correctly and the proper work is done digitally but what really separates this camera is the ease of use and the amazing photos that come directly out of it.  Prior to this camera, I have done most of my work with Nikon equipment.  I would guess that less than 5% of what I shot, did not require some work digitally afterwards.  With this camera, I can get fantastic shots directly out of it, requiring no work at all, at least 50% of the time.  Fuji also set this up to make it so easy to use, it makes photography so much more enjoyable.  The buttons were planned out such that you rarely need to remove the camera from your eye.  There are so many things about this camera that I love that I could go one forever but instead I will make a list of the pro's and con's to be concise.<br />Pros<br />- Can shoot at high ISO's.  I say up to 1600 with almost no change but very usable all the way up to 6400 and still usable (just not great) up to 12,800.<br />- The joystick is awesome!  It is so easy and quick to put the point of focus where you want it.  I believe every camera will want to follow this example!<br />- The OVF-EVF could not be set up better.  When doing the OVF, having the focus point show up at the bottom is very useful.  This allows you to plan out a shot with the OVF by what is coming up while still making sure the target is in focus.<br />- Very well made, the weather proofing allows use in very difficult weather situations<br />- Autofocus speed is very good and performs great in low light situations<br />- A large selection of great lenses to choose from<br />- Lightweight relative to DSLRs<br />- The film-type settings you can shoot with.  This is partly what enable such great shots to come out of the camera directly.  The grain option is another nice touch if you want to get a real film look to the shot.  The new \"Acros\" option is a great addition.  The BW shots just look great with the contrast.<br />- I have heard some complaints but I really like how they placed the ISO dial.  I find it very easy to use and it is nice to be able to get to both it and the shutter speed so quickly.  I think that is a big plus!<br />-Being able to choose what is contained in the Q button shortcut<br /><br />Cons<br />- Autofocus speed is in as fast when using the OVF<br />- Not all commands are available to put on the My Menu options - For example, I have a tilt-shift lens that I use on it which is made by a third party and I can't put the options directly on My Menu that I need to turn on to use this lens.  I am guessing that they will get that resolved on a software update.<br />- Battery life - This is my only real disappointment.  Third party batteries are cheep but you could need a good number of them if shooting conditions are optimal<br />- The screen on the back is not adjustable.  I don't do this very often at all but occasionally when trying to get either a high or low angle perspective, it would be nice","best camera I've ever owned","Well, where do I start?<br />1-AF- to me it is excellent, it is so snappy, and works so well, different drives for different work e.g. single point for stationary objects like studio work, wide for BIF or animals, zone for youngsters or bikers or sports. (TURN ON PERFORMANCE MODE)<br />2-Color, just amazing, the grain effect is beautiful, the color profiles are gorgeous, I would whole heartedly say no one does this as good as Fuji does this.<br />3-IQ the image quality out of this camera does not leave me wanting, its so nice, its a good file size, and I was already getting great results with the previous 16mp now I have 24mp (I turn my sharpness up +1, this makes post process easier and the photos a tiny bit crisper<br />4-Ergonomics- just perfect, I love shooting with this thing, great weight, feel, buttons, joystick, dual card slots, large buffer, I really like the ISO/shutter dial, the OVF is beautiful. Make sure to turn on CORRECTED AF FRAME, this make for easier use when shooting telephoto.<br /><br />Conclusion, this is by far the best camera that Ive owned, I prefer it over the Sony A series, and all Micro 4/3, battery life, I get 500 shots on my fuji batteries, using the Fuji 100-400, and switching between OVF/EVF, and settings all the time. I turned off picture preview, I don't really find the need to chimp much.<br /><br />FIRMWARE UPDATE<br /><br />Update:<br />This update is fantastic, the focus is now in wonderful DSLR league, the whole camera is now full circle a professional machine. I usually leave the camera in OVF mode and have center heavy zone focus. It works so well, I love this camera even though I have also purchased the XT2. If you shoot RAW, remember that Lightroom treats the files in an odd way, there are lots of persons who show how to change the defaults. Honestly I shoot jpeg 90% of the time.","Amazing camera, a must buy! Destroys my old A7II","Inspires creativity.","Very very nice camera! I love it!","There is a reason why I can pick up my Canon 7d or 5D3 and both bodies feel almost like clones.  Canon designed both to work similarly so when you are on a job, each tools feels and reacts like the other.<br /><br />It's intentional.<br /><br />The recent line of Fuji bodies does not follow this design mantra and it's a bit frustrating.  I have owned or used most of the recent Fuji bodies over the last few years, shooting professionally, and with each new model it seems the designers could never put the buttons to be where my fingers wanted them to be :)  Sure, some of that is to be expected because of design limitations, but you'd think the designers would instill some semblance of button layout across the body platforms.  Maybe I'm crazy, but other \"Fuji-holics\" have expressed the same sentiment.<br /><br />The obvious retort is to \"just buy two of the same bodies\".  Perhaps.  The 7D and it's FPS and the 5D3's full frame performance is enough to justify just the opposite argument.  But pick up either body and, voila, you're in ergonomic bliss.<br /><br />As more and more advanced shooters and full time pro's turn to Fuji as legitimate tools of the trade, the designers in Japan need to stick to a proven recipe.  In my opinion, the XPro2 is **** near the secret sauce.  On day one of purchase, I asked myself, \"Self, how fast can you get muscle memory to work when you need to get the shot?\".<br /><br />I used the XPro2 on day two for a paid job.<br /><br />Zero stress on the shoot.  Now it shouldn't be that big a deal that you could shoot for dough on day two, but I do not like to fiddle with my gear when I am with a client.  They are paying me to be creative and proficient, not technical and clumsy.<br /><br />So here is my breakdown:<br /><br />Best design features:<br />- the Play, Trash, and Display buttons are logically placed together.<br />- I always know where the Q menu is because it is just on the other side of the thumb rest.<br />- the focus selector.  THE FOCUS SELECTOR!  Oh my God!.....That is brilliant.  (pays homage to Canon's design here)  It is the single BEST feature of this camera.  Brilliant.<br /><br />Worst design features:<br />- kinda puzzled why Fuji put the AE lock up top and the AF lock above the Q menu.  AF lock, or 'back button focus' is probably used by most people, and more often.  Thankfully you can swap the function of each the AE and AF.  Still, a bit weird and just a minor quibble for a not so used function anyway.<br />- you have to be quite intentional when adjusting ISO with the lift up wheel on top.  It works, but takes some time to get used to.  I would hope that through firmware ISO could be assigned to either of the two additional adjustment knobs (it works really well on the XT-10).  Conversely, the three flavors of Auto-ISO setting are great for those who shoot primes and like to quickly adjust minimum shutter speeds.<br /><br />Bottom line, I hope that Fuji will carry forward the same ergonomics into future bodies.  This might be possible if they start to more clearly delineate which bodies they aim at the professional crowd and create repetition in the designs.<br /><br />They have a winner here.","I've dumped my everyday carry four pound Nikon set-up (D810/24-70)  for a Fuji system that, at THE MOST, will top out at two pounds.  If you're reading the is, then you probably already know and could quote the sweetest aspects of the XP-2's technical side.  Emotional satisfaction will certainly vary from user to user.  My take is this.....<br /><br /> Style.....I simply prefer the sleekness of the sexy little black box and more readily hand it over to someone for a quick snap without them being  intimidated.<br /><br /> I can be discreet and not draw attention to myself or have the camera freak people out because a big \"ash\" lens is pointed at them.<br /><br /> My right wrist is no longer overwhelmed with the insane pain caused by holding the camera for extended periods of time and yes, I've tried everything to alleviate the problem.<br /><br /> I'm not a guy nor do I have guy hands yet, I can shoot one handed!!!  Need I say more:)<br /><br />The joystick is in the category of \"IT's ABOUT TIME\"!!!!  ......sooooo intuitive and precise.<br /><br /> JPEGs straight out of the camera are sooooooo nice that I only have to post process if I really want to tweak my vision.  I am an enthusiast and don't depend on photography for a paycheck.<br /><br /> The WIFI rocks!!!  Unlike my 10% or less success rate with Nikon's WIFI, FUJI flat out RULES!!!  I can literally capture a moment, fire up the app on my phone, activate the WIFI on the camera and transfer an image in under a minute.<br /><br /> ACROS, ACROS, and ACROS.  This film simulation for JPEGs is dominating my images left and right.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the ACROS and can fine tune settings even more in camera.<br /><br /> My camera bag, fully loaded, is now no larger than the messenger bag I use for work papers:)  I can easily tote MORE than I need and not have to get a shoulder massage after a day of fun.  I swapped out my Think Tank Retrospective 20 with body, 24-70 and 80-200 for a ONA Prince St. and if I wanted to, could carry the following, all at once, safely without distress:  XP-2 body, 90mm, f/2, 56mm f/1.2, 35mm f/2, 14mm f2.8, and a Yongnue IV flash.<br /><br />Finally, I don't think about whether or not I should take my \"nice\" camera out anymore or if I should leave it at home and simply use something \"less\".  With my Fuji, I just grab it and go, no questions asked.  To me, this is the greatest gift I could have received.","I purchased the camera two days ago, and I am already selling my Sony A7RM2.  I am truly amazed at the images.  I bought it with the new F/2.0 35mm and I can't believe how sharp the lens is.  Seriously, it's a $400 lens outperforming a Zeiss, albeit a wide zoom, and a Sony prime.<br /><br />Every time I purchase a new camera/lens I do a tripod bookshelf test, which is my way of testing sharpness.  If you can believe it (I couldn't), it easily outperformed my Sony A7RM2 with the Zeiss 16-35mm and Sony 28mm F/2.0.  I even tested against my Sony RX1R ii.  It held up well but the RX1R ii won out, which it should, considering the Zeiss 35 was made exclusively for the Sony body and it is arguably the best fixed lens full-frame digital camera ever made - IMO.<br /><br />The X-Pro2 handling is a dream.  The fingers and thumb grip are just right. You can do all kinds of customization, and I love the viewfinder on the left - my preference.<br /><br />I wont go into more details regarding the camera, other reviews have already done a good job doing that.  I just wanted to give my overall impression after two days of heavy use - which is - I'm amazed!","I love this camera. I fell in love with the X100 and use it much more than my Canon 6D. Mainly due to size. I thought about upgrading the X100 for years but never felt compelled. The images are fantastic and I love the manual dials and aperture ring. I was debating getting the Xpro1 so I could change lenses. When Fuji came out with more lenses and the reviews were pretty unanimously positive, I waited a little longer for the Xpro2.<br />It is everything I expected. Focus is faster than X100, the lenses I added are all very sharp 23/35f2/56. The screen and OVF have great resolution that is noticeably better. I love the little joystick for photo review navigation and focus point movement. I rarely changed focus points because it was just easier to center focus and recompose. I also love the dual SD card slots. However, I had to return the camera as the menu kept freezing when trying to connect to wifi. It wouldn't even let me turn it off and I would have to remove the battery to shut off. This happens 100% of the time even after updating the firmware to 1.01. I'm hoping the replacement doesn't have this issue.<br /><br />Plenty of pro's from the other reviews. I'll just add a few of the cons I experienced:<br />- When trying to scan for wifi networks or manually entering SSID, camera freezes.<br />- Some settings kept reverting back to factory settings (not all settings), sound, AF Illuminator, # of focus points, face/eye detect.<br />- Dual card slot is great but when you save raw in #1 and Jpeg in #2, you have to delete the matching images separately. If I use sequential and save Raw+jpeg on card #1, it works as expected (delete image deletes both raw and jpeg). I was hoping to shoot raw and save jpegs as backup on slot 2. This still works but if I edit raw's, the jpegs still stick around. Not a huge deal but in the end, it was annoying enough for me to change my settings to \"backup\" raw+jpeg on both cards. This in essence cuts my storage space in half.<br />- the camera gets pretty warm especially on the bottom. This is just with fairly short usage of 20-30 minutes.<br />- battery drains very quick (using standard setting). I got about 120 shots on a fully charged battery. But I was messing with lots of menu settings. But still seems pretty weak. My X100 had a 1800mAh battery. The Xpro2 which is bigger with larger screen is 1260mAh.<br />- The lowest autofocus audio setting is still quite loud. I turned mine off. I wish there was a quieter setting that didn't annoy others as I do find the sound helpful.<br /><br />Other than the freezing up on wifi, the other issues are pretty minor. I am keeping the camera since Fuji has proven themselves with regular firmware updates for my X100. I suspect these issues will all get addressed in the coming months. I also hear rumors that added functionality like 4k video may get added :)","My first time with a fuji -- I am a long time Canon aficionado and was trying to switch to mirrorless for the last year to save weight at least for some situations.  Realized that full frame size glass is full frame size glass and if you want great images, you need to lug the rocks along.  Anyways, have been trying to love the Sony system, trying out first the A7II and then the A7RII this past year.  Except for the 55, don't love the color and pop or even the intangibles from sony without a ton of post processing.  Plus I am always struggling to find a setting in some menu or the other.  HDR on my 5DSR  gives me just as much in the final image as Sony, and Sony has zilch in terms of great wide lenses though I am waiting to try the zeiss 21.  Metabones with it is a awful too -- I have no luck with 2 diff adapter versions and end up with freezing or not recognizing a lot of the time.  Overall sony was just not doing it for me.  But this one is blowing me away.  I love that I can set up pretty much anything while shooting!  The hybrid OVF viewfinder is just amazingly sharp( it has diopter so I don't need to fumble with glasses).  The BW film simulation is out of the world, and I am getting fabulous images at home with the 56 mm lens, no fiddling with post processing.  The EVF is great, and I have not more than glanced at the manual to be able to get awesome results.  I will be figuring out my favorites so that I can program the five customizable buttons.  The metal build is solid and easy to hold.  The weatherproofing worked out awesome for me while trying it out in the dusty southwest this past wknd.  Am ready to trade in much of my sony gear, though I may keep the 55 and the 21 which I have on order with the a7rII.","I've had a X100T for about a year - love that lil' camera. Just bought the new X-Pro2 body and also picked up new 35mm f1.4 lens from Amazon. Beautiful system - really feels nice in the hands - feels like a pro camera. Only issue was that I woke up this morning and all my settings had reverted back to default. Reading around the net and seeing lots of people having this issue. Some say perhaps internal battery is not charged enough to maintain custom settings but others are not so sure. eMailed Fuji to find out if I need to return to Amazon or if they can suggest a fix. They are aware of the issue but so far have not offered any advice on a solution.","If you are reading this review, you should buy this camera.  I have been shooting with since it came in the mail in early March'16.  I spent a day with it and the 100-400mm paired together and I got some absolutely awesome shots.  I have been an X shooter for about two years.  X-Pro1, X-T1, X-E2s and now the X-Pro2.  Finally a 24MP camera in the X lineup.  You can read all of the reviews you want.  I won't go into all of the good.  I would like to mention that the ISO/SS dial is prone to lifting as I search for a shutter speed thereby changing my ISO inadvertently.  The exposure compensation dial is no better.  It seems to have a mind of its own.  It constantly changes in and out of my camera bag and from time to time while I am shooting.  I know there will be some that say, I am bumping it, but I still wish it were a bit stiffer in terms of resistance.  I do not have this problem on my X-T1.<br /><br />Are there better cameras out there?  Perhaps.  It's hard to explain, but this camera just feels right.  I bought it because I invested in the X system.  If I were starting all over again, I would take a good look at the Sony offerings, but I truly believe that the lens selection alone makes it worth investing in X cameras and lenses.  Again, I won't go into image quality and pixel peeping, but if you look at the myriad of reviews you will find that this camera holds its own among apc units as well as full frame.  I just wish it was perfect.  :-)<br /><br />You will have fun with this camera.<br /><br />[...] is the link to my photostream if you'd like to see some sample images.","this is the future of the old style rangefinder. it has everything you need externally. all easy access. check my images at instagram @scoobysnapstories","This camera is everything I expected and more.  Image quality is superb.  Build quality is superb, and feels great in your hand.  I bought the optional grip and find that feels better in my hand.  The controls are all on the right and so easy to access and intuitive.  I don't care for the new ISO dial but otherwise the controls are quick and easy.<br /><br />Focus is fast and accurate.  I used the camera with the slowest lens I own, the 60mm f2.4, at a rodeo.  I shot in continuous focus with focus tracking on and my hit rate was easily 90% or better at 8fps!  I was shocked.<br /><br />Bottom line, I may buy a second body and sell my X-E2 and X-T1.  That's how much I love this camera.","Reading the handful of negative reviews, I wonder if we purchased the same camera.  Did they just get bad copies?  Or did they understand what they were purchasing?  Detailed reviews are available all over the web so I will spare the comprehensive take but as we should all know, this is not meant to be an entry level camera.  Far from it.<br />I have shot Nikon SLRs for 15 years and still own a D800 along with a full complement of lenses.<br />I once owned a Fuji X100 which began my love of shooting with the XSeries. Eventually, upgraded to the X100s and waited for years for the update to the XPRO line as the X-T1 while widely lauded, was not the shooting style I loved with Fuji. (I feel you are an SLR style shooter or prefer the Range-Finder style)<br />The Ranger-Finder like form factor is perfect for my intended use: Street portraits and Travel Photography.<br />I have had this camera for almost two weeks and aside from the initial settings reset that plagued many within the first day of owning (happens once and the Firmware to fix is on its way this week), I have had ZERO issues with this beauty.  I am about 500 images in and the IQ on this thing is ridiculous.  The camera emotes and so do the photos it takes.  Now if you are going to zoom in at 100% and 'measurebate' every individual pixel then perhaps this is not the camera for you.  If you are looking to shoot a ton of video then there may be other options out there.  This is truly a photographer's camera.<br />And as for numbers and speed, all I can say is that shooting side by side with my D800, the only big difference observed is the size and weight differential.  Any AF Speed differential is hardly discernible, even in low light.  The images are beautiful with incredible dynamic range and while I will keep my D800 for other shooting needs, it now feels like a brick.","I've had my X-Pro2 for almost two weeks now, and absolutely love it.  I've been plagued by on-call for work, and now I appear to have a bad cold, so I haven't been able to put it through all of the paces I wanted to, but what I've seen so far, I really like.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fits my hands very well<br />- With the XF35mm f/2 lens, is a fairly compact and light weight kit<br />- Hybrid EVF/OVF is nothing short of outstanding<br />- Appears to be built like a tank<br />- Is very responsive<br />- Top-mounted controls are easy to learn and use, without taking your eye away from the view finder<br />- Image quality is outstanding<br />- Acros film simulation.  What can I say except \"Wow!\"<br />- Focus point joystick is brilliant, and is extremely easy to use<br />- Auto focus is fast and sure<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Battery life could be a bit better<br /><br />I bought into the X-Pro2 knowing full well it didn't have 4K capabilities, and I'm more than good with that.  I also figured this camera might not be a sports photographer's dream camera.  I do know it is a fantastic street and portrait photographer's camera, and probably a wedding photographer's camera as well.  I also feel it will be a good landscape camera, but won't know for sure until I can get outside.<br /><br />Anybody who is going to drop this much money on a camera body should do their research ahead of time, and make sure it fits your particular style of photography.  It fits mine very well, and I see my Canon kit slowly getting sold off in the near future.<br /><br />In addition to their fine camera bodies and lenses, I also admire Fujifilm's commitment to it's users, by providing firmware updates to fix issues, and also to extend the capabilities of their cameras.","I bought mine from the local camera shop on the day it was launched, trading in my beloved Hasselblad and 5dii which I had always hated for its bulk and hiding of functions in menus. I was determined to buy a camera I was happy with, so deliberately compared the xpro2 for a full hour with a Leica m242: I chose the Fuji because I preferred it, and came away with the 35mm f1.4, 16mm f1.4 and 50-140 f2.8 and a flash. Since then, I couldn't be happier- lovely sharp, punchy images, and few missed shots of kids. I find the high ISO performance particularly impressive, and wouldn't have believed shots at 12800 could have looked so good. One point which I think Fuji could improve upon would be to distill down the menu system which I still find complex to navigate. Leica has done a good job of this on the Q, and others could learn from its simplicity. In summary great- with a little room for improvement","Have owned an X100, X100S and X-E2. While I loved those cameras, there was always one or more issues that detracted from the experience. No more! This big bad boy has fast focus, a great combo optical viewfinder, dual card slots and a great, well balanced body. Couldn't be happier with it.","Yo!","After owning around 25 cameras in 15 years, I can safely say that the Xpro 2 is the best one I ever used. Not only does it deliver great files (Lots of detail and great high ISO capability), it is also a joy to use. Nowadays most cameras are becoming like computers that take pictures, Fuji managed to make a camera that is simple to use, with direct controls to everything a photographer needs. They also upped their build quality, coming from a Fuji Xt1 and Xe2, I can say that the Xpro 2 has a much better improved build than the rest of the pack.<br /><br />I had the camera reset itself to factory settings after few hours of use (I think many people had the same problem), however I haven't experienced any other problems since.<br /><br />I know this camera is more expensive than most APSC cameras, however if you are really into a hybrid VF, range style camera, it is the best one out there short of a 5 times more expansive Leica.<br /><br />HIGHLY Recommended!!!","Falls short on initial release.  Firmware bugs plague this camera on it's release (well I hope they are firmware bugs).  When you pay a premium for something as anticipated as this camera, your settings should not reset randomly. A big pain if you are expecting your images to be RAW and you end up with JPEGs.  Yes, the Fujifilm JPEGs are special, but that RAW data is important.  The inclusion of WiFi in this camera is a work in progress; meaning it does not work now, but may in a firmware update.  The camera locks up when trying to connect to my Instax SP-1, iOS, or Android devices.  A power off does not even allow the camera to power down.  You must remove the battery.  Having issues with the OVF and some lenses as well with autofocus (with corrected AF frame on).  The camera confirms focus, but the image is out of focus.  I have tested this with the 18-55 and 35 F1.4.  Battery life is the worst I have seen for a Fujifilm camera as well.  I am running it in high performance mode.<br /><br />That said, it is not all doom and gloom.  I have a love/hate relationship with this camera at the moment.  ACROS film simulation is amazing.  The EVF is amazing and hits focus fast (much faster than the X-T1).  The button layout and use is wonderful.  The image quality is great.  Feel of the camera is great (though I have 2XL hands and added the optional grip; most will not need it).<br /><br />I am on the fence at the moment.  Do I return the camera or hope for a firmware update soon?  I have a little time to decide.  I will be calling Fujifilm support on Monday.  I've had this camera a week and the bugs I have encountered, I cannot justify the price paid.  The camera, on paper, is what I wanted the X-Pro 2 to be, but it does not fully deliver... yet.  I think it will once Fujifilm gets a few firmware updates out.  If you are a patient hobbyist, go for it, else I would wait for the firmware to develop.  Fujifilm X series cameras, in general, have a pretty good track record.  I suspect, in time, I will adjust this review.  Right now, I am being a little kind with a 3 star review.  -- March 13, 2016<br /><br />April 13, 2016 - Well, I gave the camera another go.  Ordered it from another Fujifilm authorized reseller, it worked great for two weeks just shooting.  Sadly, I started having the black frames again, the error message to turn the camera off/on, and still WiFi issues trying to print to the Instax SP1.  I had no choice but to send the camera back again for a refund.  I should lower the rating, but the images I did get from the camera are amazing; I just cannot justify the cost for the problems I encountered and imagine shooting an event and needing that one shot... you get a black frame or an error to turn the camera off/on.<br /><br />I suspect there is a hardware problem with the new shutter mechanism; nothing to base that on other than talking to Fujifilm NJ and hearing the support tech talk out loud.  The WiFi issues are hit/miss for folks on forums.  I had two cameras with the issue.  Fujifilm NJ suggested I reset the Instax SP1 and do a full reset and shooting menu reset on the X-Pro2, and indicated that worked for some, but did not work for my two cameras.<br /><br />May 11, 2015 - 3 strikes your out.  Ordered from a different seller and the results were the same (or worse).  A couple shots in, got the off/on error.  Gave up on it.  I had learned the X-Pro1, X-T1, and original X100 had issues at launch.  I will likely skip this and wait for the X-Pro2S.  You cannot enjoy it or trust it if these errors occur and it is not worth the headaches at this price.","I wish Fuji would have come out with this camera originally and I would have replaced my Canon 5D Mark III 2 years ago.  This camera is fast, responsive and the added features of dual card slots, focus point joystick and center weighted metering are the features that were needed for Fuji to compete with other professional cameras. They dynamic range is so much better than my Canon and finally the fast autofocus I can capture action as a bonus.  So looking forward to using this camera at my next wedding!  Fuji, come out with a wireless TTL flash system - only thing that is missing.  For now I'll use my RadioPoppers with my Canon flashes.","I am a hobbyist photographer focused mainly on capturing everyday imagery: family, travel, architecture, and the like. I've used mirrorless cameras since their inception, snapping up a Panasonic Lumix DMC-G1 when it was released. When Fujifilm announced its entry into the space, I was attracted to the larger APS-C sensor, the JPEG quality (I can't be bothered to post-process), and the promise of a more analog feel (my Micro Four Thirds cameras felt a little too automated to keep me interested in the creative process). I jumped on the X-E1 and later upgraded to the X-T1. I own a handful of Fujinon lenses, including the 18-55mm, 23mm, 35mm f/1.4 and f/2, and 56mm (non-APD version).<br /><br />I prefer rangefinder-style bodies for aesthetic reasons, but the X-Pro2's body feels a little large in my small-ish hands; I think I prefer the size of the X-T1. That said, I can still easily hold it with one hand, and I appreciate its solid feel. I also miss the X-T1's EVF. As a glasses-wearer, the smaller hybrid viewfinder is a little tougher to see. Nevertheless, the camera feels very refined: the build is solid, the controls fall nicely under my fingers, and the haptics are spot on (the exposure compensation dial, in particular, has the perfect amount of resistance).<br /><br />I moved from the X-T1 to the X-Pro2 for three primary reasons: the 24 megapixel X-Trans III sensor, the ACROS film simulation, and the 1/8000 shutter speed. To my eyes, image quality is very similar to the X-T1 with the added benefit of additional cropping latitude--exactly what I was hoping for. I'm also really enjoying the Acros film simulation. It seems a little more contrasty than the standard monochrome simulation, and the film grain effect adds a new dimension to printed photos. Finally having a 1/8000 shutter speed has already proven useful for outdoor shooting with fast lenses (I'd rather not have to carry ND filters). Overall, for a JPEG shooter like myself, the X-Pro2's image quality and tweak-ability is a dream come true.<br /><br />Unfortunately, autofocus speed does not seem significantly improved to me, even with the new Fujinon XF35mm F2 R WR. Fujifilm did a nice job explaining the X-Pro2's autofocus and associated limitations on its web site (in brief: a handful of lenses, like the new 35mm, use a newer chip that enables quicker autofocus), but I was still hoping to see some additional speed. When shooting young kids, I can't help but feel that my Olympus OM-D E-M1 is subjectively quicker in single-shot autofocus mode. The speed is certainly not a deal-breaker, and for most use cases it's more than sufficient, but it's an area where Fujifilm can continue to improve.<br /><br />[Update] After spending a little more time with the camera, I'd like to point out two additional features that I've enjoyed. First, the grain effect for JPEGs. I initially thought this might be a gimmick--and, indeed, it might be--but I've found that dialing in some weak grain provides a nice microcontrast-like effect, especially when used in conjunction with the classic chrome film simulation. Second, the dual SD card slot. I have the camera set to record RAWs to one card and JPEGs to the other. That way I can tweak images in-camera using the built-in RAW converter, but easily transfer only the JPEGs to my computer. It also gives me a backup in case one of the cards should fail (something that's only happened to me once).<br /><br />In sum, the Fujifilm X-Pro2 provides a very refined experience: a solid and evolved physical package that produces beautiful image quality. I'm most happy with the X-Pro2, and I look forward to continuing to get to know it.","Great camera great system. I shot a baseball and basketball game no problem with AF tracking. Above all else just a joy to shoot.","I own/use an X-T1 and an X-T10. I love both of those cameras.  I purchased  the X-Pro2 because of new sensor, file size and new film simulation, ACROS. This camera does not disappoint! The surprise feature that I really like is the joy stick. This camera, all around, is another hit from Fujifilm!","This is my first Fuji—and so far so good. I like shooting smaller mirrorless cameras—mostly micro four thirds (M43) for travel and street photography. When I have time, I also like to shoot serious landscape photography. For most purposes M43 works for me, but occasionally I’d like to have the advantage of a larger sensor. Olympus and Panasonic-Leica are producing a number excellent prime lenses, including Olympus newer f2.8 pro zooms. However, as the apertures have gotten larger, the size and weight is increasing, which tends to defeat some of the purpose of the M43 smaller sensor.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Fuji, Sony, and others have been making some attractive new choices with both APS-C and full frame mirrorless bodies. Sony is leading the way with sensor technology, but the range of lens choices still lags (although you can use adapters for some other lenses) and the E mount full frame lenses are large and very expensive. So after reading many reviews, I decided to try the new Fuji X Pro 2 with its improved sensor and features, and--thanks to a big Fujinon lens sale—I added the 14 mm f2.8 prime and 10-24 mm f4-5.6 for landscape shooting.<br /><br />First impressions: After several days with the new camera and lenses, as well as some head-to-head comparison shooting with my smaller equipment, I’m very pleased with the X Pro 2 and the quality of results from the new lenses.<br /><br />Pros: The X Pro 2 has a solid, well-designed weather sealed body; it allows choice between optical and electronic viewfinder; it has a new larger sensor and image processor, with option to choose between 77 and 273 AF focal points; the X Pro 2 has excellent professional dials for exposure, shutter speed, and ISO with a front lever to switch between the optical and EVF; the useful joystick is useful for moving focal points (but a touch screen would be better); its menus are logical with options for customization; dual SD card slots; and you can add a well-designed optional handgrip. The X Pro 2’s video is good (but not state of the art—but you probably won’t be buying this camera for video anyway).<br /><br />Cons: The X Pro 2 has no in-body image stabilization and no touch screen, and it has a slight flicker of display in low light (at least on my copy).<br /><br />Bottom line: The X Pro 2 has the feel of a sophisticated pro tool, it is a pleasure to use and it produces great results. It is a good choice and complement for my M43 line up.","I have a couple of X-Pro 1 cameras.  I love the hybrid viewfinder, and something about the design of the X-Pro has resulted in the camera taking some of the best photos I've ever made.  But the EVF on the X-Pro 1 is very dated - the X-T1 and X-E2 are tremendously better.<br /><br />The X-Pro 2 is phenomenal.  The EVF is outstanding.  As seamless as the X-T1 in just not feeling like you are looking at a projection of an image.  The diopter adjustment makes a big difference to me.  And I can finally sell my Canon 5D MkIII.  And recover the cost of this camera.  Because 24 MP sensor.","Excellent image quality, brilliant hybrid viewfinder, ergonomically a huge improvement over all of fuji's past cameras.  The only significant downsides I see are the lag of an articulating screen and 4K video.<br /><br />Side tangent: I hope a small 23mm quick auto focusing lens is released some point soon, the 35f2 is a perfect companion lens for the X-Pro2 but for those who want to go wider without distorting your subjects or making for unflattering portraits, the only real option right now is the 23 f1.4 which isn't nearly as fast at focusing as the new 35 and its significantly larger than any Fuji prime I've used."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX10 (Lumix DMC-LX15)","amazon_reviews":["The best point and shoot camera I've ever owned.

I am very happy with the purchase.","Great camera, I love it. The best  compact  camera you can buy.","Initial impression is excellent.  My context is that this is the first camera I've purchased for personal use since the Panasonic GM1, which is a m4/3 interchangeable lens camera with a very compact body, so that is my main point of comparison.  I also had a original Sony RX100, but it was lost at a conference, so needed a small every day carry camera.  I do more indoor natural light shots than out, and pretty much never use a flash, so that frames my needs a bit.  Based on early results, the LX10 is a great replacement for the RX100 and beats the GM1 as a travel/EDC camera.  Key findings so far:<br /><br />*The lens on the LX10 beats the larger m4/3 sensor + stock lens on the GM1 for everyday indoor photography.  To compare, I did a quick set of shots on P(rogram) setting on both cameras in a unevenly lit room at night, just to see what the P algorithms produced when left to their own devices.  The GM1 was equipped with the very nice compact zoom kit lens, 12-32mm f3.5-5.6 max aperture.  P sets shutter speed, aperture, and ISO automatically. Both cameras took the shot at 1/60th s with their lenses wide open, but the ISO on the LX10 was 640 while the ISO on the GM1 was 3200.  Totally to be expected given the much slower f3.5 vs. f1.4, but cameras are systems, not individual components, and the 3200 ISO on the GM1 really increased the noise, lowered the detail and hurt the color fidelity much more than in the shot from the LX10.  Now, of course, I could have put a fast lens on the GM1, I certainly own plenty of m4/3 lenses including fast primes, BUT, that's the point, really, that the very fast lens on the LX10 opens up a much wider operating window compared to the kit GM1, and to match it, I'd have to give up the zoom and use a fast prime, again lowering the versatility and speed of operation for my kind of indoor/low light shooting, so that is worth something to me.<br /><br />Other quick points:<br /><br />Size - the retractable lens on the LX10 makes it much easier to pocket and carry the LX10 vs. the GM1, even though the body of the GM1 is a bit smaller, due to the added depth from the 12-32mm lens.<br />Speed of operation - the 12-32mm lens on the GM1 must be manually extended before taking the first shot, making it much tougher to capture fleeting scenes.<br />4K video - Not an option on the GM1.  Not that I need it much just yet, but looking forward to that move in the not too distant future.  I did test the 4K video on the highest data rate setting, and was able to capture and playback just fine from my very recent PNY UHS1/U3 card PNY Elite Performance 128 GB High Speed SDXC Class 10 UHS-I, U3 up to 95 MB/Sec Flash Card (P-SDX128U395-GE).  I panned an indoor scene and watched the focus adjust, and, after one big focus hunt right at the beginning, the LX10 did a very nice job, pulling from 10ft focus to less than a foot at the end of the pan, and stopping right on focus of the close object without hunting.  Pretty impressive.<br /><br />Other points of comparison:<br />*LX100.  I briefly owned and returned the LX100 before buying the LX10 as it was just too big for the every day carry role.  Further, the effective resolution due to sensor crop on the LX100 was a disappointment in the few test images I took, and the default JPEG settings left me flat, which surprised me given my preference for Pany standard JPEGs.<br />*LS100.  Own this camera for work, and the 10x zoom is really handy, but the slower lens shows indoors, even wide open.<br /><br />There are many more features to test and that will be fun, but, net, for me, the LX10 is the better choice, given priority for indoor or low light outdoor shots.  I'll continue to use my GM1 and Olympus EM5 m4/3 cameras with appropriate lenses for the more challenging shots (e.g., the 2015 All Star Game, where 300mm zoom was essential paired with the EM5), or the LS100 where I need quick access to more zoom range outdoors, but the LX10 is now my EDC camera, especially when I know I'll want a mix of indoor + outdoor, or just indoor.  Highly recommended if your priorities are similar.","I love this camera for taking decent pictures on the go. Only problem is I have a few pictures that went out of focus, and I didn't have the time to adjust settings to compensate for low light in Program mode. I haven't learned how to make it a default, so it has been taking lower exposed pictures. In IA mode it compensates, but some pictures come out too overexposed. I haven't had a chance to read all the details concerning this yet. Good thing it has a built in after-exposure editor, but 3rd party products are more flexible. The digital zoom really helps when 3x zoom isn't close enough. I don't notice a degradation in sharpness. It's like having 10x. The movie offers flexibility, but can run down the battery faster.","Pocket sized but huge in features and performance with super bright Leica f/1.4 wide angle, big 1\" sensor for great lowlight, casual, street or indoor use in dim lighting  Great 4K stabilized ultra high def video, and tons of cool features to stack, bracket, HDR, remote control, etc. Extraordinary focus speed and burst / 4K photo modes to catch elusive action.Priced well below Sony rival.","This is one awesome camera. It was a really good product back in 2012, when it was launched, but even today, in 2016, this products still rocks. This camera has excellent optics, a pretty large range of f stops and a 1/1.7\" CMOS sensor, still larger than many compact cameras have today. It has manual and semi manual modes, a nice LCD screen, an apperture ring around the lens and is compatible with some Panasonic and Olympus viewfinders. It also does not stuff lots of Megapixels in a tiny sensor like many other cameras do, so the picture quality is pretty good, especially if you shoot RAW. JPEGs are OK, but raw is awesome, it gives you many many options to tweak and process your pictures to make them look the way you want or the way you saw it. The included raw processing software that came with this cam was pretty good (Silkypix), but if you plan on taking lots and lots of photos with this cam, I suggest you try some other software with better catalogging features, like Adobe Lightroom. Video is also very good on this camera, with the option to shoot slow motion videos at 720p. The camera has been replaced by the LX 100, but if all you want is to take some pictures with a pretty decent quality and don't want to spend a lot, look for one of these used, they are still pretty much better than most compact cameras available today.","Very nice small camera with lots of possibilities.  I like being able to shoot RAW & have manual settings. Haven't had time to try everything yet.","Really nice camera.  Good quality.  Takes fantastic photos.  Many super features.","Leica lens delivers excellent image quality.  Super fast summilux lens opens to 1.4 allowing for dramatic bokeh.  Macro capabilities are excellent and you can get incredible detail.  Just overall a superb camera for an excellent price.  One of my best purchases ever.","perfect for me","Very nice pocket size camera.","This and the LX5 are the best full featured advanced compact cameras out there, even today (5-2016)","We love this camera.  It arrived in great shape.  A quality camera for the price and takes amazing pictures even in low light.","I have had this camera since new in 2012 and I still love it to this day.  being a retired pro I care very much about image quality and the LX 7 still impresses me today.  Frankly I bought this as a backup to my larger, heavier interchangeable lens system but I found myself using the LX7 often.  It's always the camera I bring out at wherever I want to be more \"low key\".  It's been with me all over the world and I can honestly say that some of the best travel pictures I have are with the LX7.<br /><br />My wife likes the \"auto\" setting.  I like the many manual controls.  I've considered upgrading but feel no need at this time.  Pick one up of you can, they are a bargain at today's prices.","Awesome little camera, but if you're buying in 2016, there are better options.","This is a fine point and shoot but beware of getting too caught up in the F1.4 lens hype. It does shoot in low light but the noise is intense. In fact anything over 400 ISO looks terrible. It works best outdoors at ISO 80.<br /><br />The macro is excellent and you can get nice blurred backgrounds (bokeh). Auto focus is quick.<br /><br />No wi-fi or touch screen is a negative.","Great product!","I used this camera for back up. I'm really like 1.4mm wide angle lens, it's clear photo in low light condition, but a battery life was short than LX5.","Great camera!","Very compact and versatile for hiking trips and nighttime photography. The camera takes decent lowlight picture with minimal blurring, ghosting.","I really like the quality of the pictures this camera takes.  I took it to Europe last summer, and it did very well in high light and low light (museums and cathedrals) situations.  I am certainly not an expert, but for running  around as a tourist, it worked out great.","This is my second Panasonic LUMIX camera that I have owned. The first one's view screen unexpectedly died last year after five years of faithful service. To be fair, the original camera was subject to all kinds of abuse during multiple bicycle touring trips and just kept on ticking, until it just couldn't perform anymore.  The photos are clear, the camera is easy to operate, and I appreciated that it has a Leica lens.  For the money, you can't really go wrong.","This is my first \"nice\" camera that's a step up above basic point and clicks.  I can't really comment how this works compared to other cameras outside of the most basic, just how it works for a complete newbie.<br /><br />First off, the pictures this camera takes, even in less than optimal conditions and with little fiddling, look better than the best pictures I'd get from a basic point and shoot (and miles away from a phone camera).  The megapixels might not be super high, meaning you can't zoom in as much before you can see the individual pixels, but you can still make out all the details like grass blades or small leaves where other cameras I've used would leave big blobs of color.<br /><br />It has all the settings of an expensive DSLR, which feeds my need to fiddle with things.  It lets me practice with what all the settings and modes do in a relatively inexpensive device.<br /><br />I'm happy with how low the shutter lag is and how well it manages with the poor/uneven lighting at my house.<br /><br />There's a few things I'm feel could be better:<br />-The lens sticks out from the body quite a bit.  It prevents me from fitting the camera in my relatively generous jeans pockets.  It fits in my jacket pocket, but there's an obvious bulge.  It's compact, but definitely not pocketable.<br />-Related, the lens cap isn't as secure as I'd wish it to be.  I keep the camera in my messenger bag and will sometimes find that the cap has come off, leaving the glass exposed.<br />-Adjusting shutter speed is slow and frustrating.  The dial doesn't \"spin\" through all the speeds fast enough.  It allows for fine adjustments, but takes forever to get from one extreme to the other.  I tend to stay out of Shutter Priority mode.<br />-Manual focus is also a little fiddly and I haven't gotten used to it.  There's just basically a switch that moves the focus in and out where a dial of some sort would be much easier to use.","I have spent a year with this camera and love it.  Used to have the LX-5 but killed it in a sand storm.  The LX7 is an amazing travel camera and goes everywhere with me.","Great little camera. Beautiful images, great low light performance, and small enough to carry around in a jacket pocket.","Ok","Awesome!","I like to take pictures of wildlife footprints. I do not know much about photography but this camera exceeds my expectations, especially in low light conditions. I also like the video capability for photographing insects making tracks. Telephoto is minimal.","Rarely do I write reviews but this little gem is worth talking about.<br /><br />Over the past couple of years I have taken thousands of photos with the LX7. It excels in landscape photography. Video is good. Macro is decent too. But what I have been most impressed with is the low light performance. Having full manual control over focus, white balance, aperture (f1.4!) and long shutter speeds has allowed me to get some phenomenal photos of the polar aurora. It rivals and is sometimes better than some of my DSLR friends photos whom are jealous I have such a light, compact, and capable camera.<br /><br />In fact, the only reason I want a larger sensor camera is for aurora but this thing just keeps impressing me to the point of not upgrading yet.<br /><br />Paid ~$295 for it new a couple years ago. Interesting how it has gone up $100 in value. I would still consider it for the current price.<br /><br />I highly recommend the LX7 for photo enthusiast that want more than a standard P&S but do not want to lug around pounds of DSLR gear in a backpack all the time.<br /><br />I also recommend the auto lens cap and a leather case. It gives the camera a little more heft but protects it well in a pack and gives you more grip area. I find it balances out the camera nicely and feels better in the hands too.<br /><br />Likes:<br />1. Full manual control like a DSLR, including white balance and bracketing<br />2. Awesome f1.4 lens for low light<br />3. Manual focus switch on lens<br />4. Aspect Ratio switch on lens<br />5. Custom Setting Profiles (total of 4) so you can have all your special settings for particular applications<br />6. HDR and Panoramic Stitching functions<br /><br />Dislikes (and I am being picky)<br />1. No external power input.<br />2. No way to connect an external intervalometer for time lapse (the built in one is worthless)<br />3. Personally I would prefer a manual focus ring vs. a switch on the back of the camera.<br />4. The aperture ring is nice but I would prefer that ring to be configurable for what you want.<br />5. HDR function has limited adjustment controls, would like full manual to adjust aperture and shutter speed.","This is an amazing purchase. I bought this as my first camera. It is capable of so much. If you travel lightly and don't like dragging around gears and bags for DSLRs, it's amazing. It can shoot in very low light, and do long exposure better than a lot of DSLRs. A lot of people don't believe that some of my pictures are shot with a small point and shoot.  The 1/1.7\" sensor isn't too big compared to the 1\", Micro 4/3rds, or APS-C sensors, but it is plenty for most. If you need extreme zoom and fast shooting, then no, it may not be for you. This thing has been to 6 countries with me. I usually have it in my back pocket or side bag(recommended) on my belt. Some complain that the lens cap doesn't automatically open, but for my rough usage, its actually way better. The other lens cap that opens as you need it will break if you put it into your pocket. You can learn how to one handedly remove the cap before you shoot, just practice with your middle finger. The zoom isn't great but the look, feel, built and quality is awesome. The price actually went up $100 since I bought it in 2012 and it is now the end of 2015. I recommend getting a fast SD card, like 90 mb/s. You may think you don't need it but I had issues with my video and some buffering freezing. I had to remove the battery to restart. I got a nice SanDisk 32 gb, 90mb/s SD card and it's been flawless after 3 years. And it shut off once because i got it too wet in a bat cave :) It turned back on an hour later and worked perfectly til today. Mine was made in Japan, not sure about all the LX7s. But the LX100 are now made in China. LX100 is nice but its quite bigger than this one. Built in flash helps for emergencies. For many, the RX100 by Sony may be a better fit. It is more mainstream and it does have a 1\" sensor. The price tag may not be as good and the quality may not be as good. Tough decisions!  9.5/10 from me. I'm being greedy by wanting it in APS-C, remaining this size, and includes a built in flash for emergencies :)","my biggest critique is the long shot photos..  This camera is made for close ups","I shoot primarily with a DSLR (the Nikon D7100 is my weapon of choice), but for some time now I have felt the need to have a compact camera capable of taking high quality pictures that I can carry conveniently, particularly on my business travels.<br /><br />In my hunt for a compact camera that I could use during my business travels, I had the following criteria:<br /><br />1.  Compact - ideally a camera that I could carry in my pocket - the LX7 fits comfortably into a larger pocket of a cargo trouser or a jacket pocket, but is not compact enough to fit into a formal trouser or even a pair of jeans. The camera is light, and carrying it around in one hand is very convenient.<br /><br />2.  Picture quality - I wanted a camera that is capable of producing good quality, publishable results. When on business travels, I like taking pictures in my free time as I walk around town, and getting pictures that capture the feel of a place without sacrificing quality is an important consideration. The LX7 scores very high in this respect. In good light conditions, at ISO 80, the image quality is really good.<br /><br />3.  Controls - I wanted a camera where I have complete control over the image making process in a way that is as easy as a DSLR. This means the ability to change aperture, ISO, White Balance, Focus Mode etc. easily. The LX7 exceeded my expectations in this regard - the controls to change image parameters are available via buttons (rather than being buried deep inside a menu hierarchy), which makes changing image parameters fairly quick and easy. The one exception to this is that changing the autofocus spot is a little tedious.<br /><br />The other main strengths of the LX7 are:<br /><br />1.  Fast lens - a maximum aperture of 1.4 allows one to use the lower ISO's consistently, which result in higher quality images.<br />2.  Quick focusing (once you select the autofocus spot - although selecting the spot is a little tedious).<br />3.  Changing from autofocus to manual focus is as easy as flicking a switch.<br />4.  Good battery life.<br />5.  Has a level indicator to keep the horizon level - this is a very useful feature for shooting landscapes.<br /><br />I thought that the main drawbacks of the LX7, after using the camera for a few weeks now, are:<br /><br />1.  Changing the autofocus spot is tedious - in situations where one if looking for a quick candid shot, this is a definite drawback.<br />2.  Noise creeps in at higher ISO's, but this is to be expected.<br />3.  No built-in viewfinder - I prefer looking into a viewfinder when composing, and the fact that I have a look at the screen gets in the way.<br />4.  Screen is not bright enough on a bright day - when shooting in bright daylight, it is challenging to compose a picture by looking at the screen.<br />5.  Temperature range - I was in New Hampshire recently (Oct 2015), and in the shade the temperature was probably 2-4C, and after a little bit the camera would not allow me to zoom and autofocus. After sitting in a warm car for a few minutes, the camera came back to life. When I checked the manual, it said the operating temperature range for this camera is 0C - 40C. This means that one cannot rely on this camera in even moderate weather (0C is not that cold, and 40C is hot, but common in the tropics during summer).<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with the LX7. It filled a niche that I had, as I left my DSLR behind during business trips, and my iPhone 5 camera was a poor substitute. For someone looking for a compact, high quality camera that they can carry with them most of the time, the LX7 fits the bill really well.<br /><br />I have included a bunch of pictures with this review (all taken with the LX7).<br /><br />Happy shooting!","Fabulous camera - very sharp, detailed pictures in a compact camera size.","Very nice camera","I bought this camera refurbished. I got lucky and found a white one.  It was just like new! I sell prints on eBay and I like to take my pictures without a flash. This is the best camera I've used yet. Everything they say about it taking great indoor pictures is true. It also takes great outdoor pictures because of the wide angle.","Best camera yet as a substitute for my DSLR when size and weight matter. The Leica optics are great. Writes to the card almost as fast as an SLR. Great rich images. This is my second one. Bought it as a spare before it gets discontinued.","I was looking for a smaller camera to replace my older DSLR and this fit the bill. Nice size for hiking or day trips that can fit in a small bag or pouch. So far picture quality is outstanding. We will be taking a trip to Yellowstone next week and this will get a full test for sure. Very happy with the purchase.","Excellent photos in low light and great videos. A winner","Great camera to carry around. Photos are great quality. Good pictures in low light.  The quality suffers a bit at full zoom. The battery life is a bit on the low side- especially if you are taking flash.","By far the best point and shoot I have ever owned. I find myself leaving my full frame Nikon DSLRs at home a lot since purchasing this little beauty. Super sharp photos and awesome low light performance. Look no further just buy it.","The virtues of the LX series is well discussed, but it's worth noting that it may be the one camera model that holds its value the best.  Since 2007, I have owned the LX2, 5, and 7. The LX7 came out in 2012 at an MSRP of $499. A year later Panasonic abandoned the series for whatever reasons. I got one on clearance sale. When the stock was gone, a lot of people were still looking to buy or hoping for an LX9 to appear. Amazingly, after 2 years, it's back in Panasonic's own online shop at $399. Used ones are selling pretty close to the clearance price 2 years ago. I don't know of another camera, or any digital device that stands up the test of time like that. 3 years is a very long time in the digital world. Most devices lose half their values in 1 to 2 years.<br /><br />The return of LX7 may seem odd, but  it's not hard to understand if you compare it to a new 2015 model such as Fuji X30 which is targeted at similar buyers and has an MSRP of $599. Th Fuji sensor wins marginally in size (1/1.5\" vs 1/1.7\") and pixel count (12 mp vs 10 mp). However, the LX7 is more compact in size and weight (269g vs 423 g); the lens is both wider (24mm vs 28mm) and faster (F1.4-2.3 vs 2.0-2.8). DPReview scores them about equal overall (76% vs 75%), the LX7 wins in image quality and low light performance, just missing some convenience features such as WiFi connectivity. It also leave out the EVF as an expensive option. However, going beyond the camera itself, the LX7 can add a 3rd party auto lens cap and filter adapter for minimal cost. Considering that the X30 is 3 years newer, one has to admire how the LX7 hits all the right spots in 2012 that are not easy to improve upon.<br /><br />The LX7 was often compared to the Sony RX100 in 2012, with the latter winning the battle of specs...being smaller with a larger sensor, etc., but less direct control. The Sony's MSRP was 30% higher when new, not much discount. The LX7 was discounted widely. 3 years later, new or used ones of the two models are actually selling for similar prices.  When I traded up through LX2 and LX5 in the past years, I got very good resale values as well. There is never such a thing as a \"good investment\" in digital electronics, but the LX series is pretty close to being one. That the LX7 came back from the grave is really a testament that people want a camera they enjoy using, not necessarily one that has the bigger sensor with twice the pixel count. I have an RX100-M3 as well, but still keeping the LX7. I've found its MACRO mode works much better, especially when the lens is zoomed. I also don't need 20 MP for most of my pictures.<br /><br />UPDATE April/2016: The LX7 is again off the market, no longer offered on Panasonic's online store. Price of residual stock selling on have remained the same if not risen back towards 2012 level. So it has not lost value after 4 years!","I am consistently impressed with what this camera can do. I have had a Nikon D5200 with some nice glass for a while now but have taken considerably more photos since getting the LX-7. Why? Because it's in my 'pocket' or in my bag when I see an opportunity, not in my camera sack at home waiting for a planned photography outing.<br /><br />It can't zoom nearly as far as the 300mm on the D5200, but it takes great macro shots, which is perfect for insects and mushrooms. I find it hard to justify lugging the DSLR around unless I'm expecting to photograph birds in trees or something. It's a little big for a pocket and looks ridiculous with the lens enclosure sticking out, but I throw it in the pocket of my shorts anyway. I really do not think it would fit in jeans pockets or in any women's clothing pockets. Thankfully I always have a messenger bag and it fits nicely in there.","Great second camera.  Better than my last point and shoot.","Best camera for the money. Period.","Fantastic camera. The fast 1.4 lens made it impossible for my Canon T3i to compete in low light. Beautiful pictures without a tripod. And of course, my wifes most important feature, it fits in a purse.","A great and point and shoot digital camera.  The Leica lens is really fast.","While attending a lecture by John Fielder Colorado nature photographer extraordinaire, I asked him what he shot with and he said Canon 5D2 and a Panasonic LX-7 point and shoot. He went on to say that he has taken many photos that have been used on national magazine covers with the LX-7. I was so surprised, so guess what  I did the following day, yep purchases the LX-7. It is a great camera for wide angle and low light work, in other words landscape photography. I love this little camera.","Awesome camera. Had for several years now and use more than our SLR with more convenience and similar quality pics.","We had to send back a camera that we purchased before this one.  It seemed to have trouble focusing without having nearly motionless subjects.  The Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX7K was different, and quite frankly, what we've come to expect from the Lumix line.  These cameras are great, and great priced as well.  The focus is fast and sharp.  The range of light conditions where the camera preforms well is vast.  We're very happy with our purchase and will probably stick with the Lumix line from now on (sorry Powershot!)","Delivered promply. No problems.","I more than love this camera. It takes great photos, especially from closeup. It's also CUTE. :) I love the metal body, the sharp low-light lens, and how it works.","I have had medium format cameras and regular 35mm cameras (film and digital), from Nikon, Hasselblads, Rolleiflex, rollei, canon and leica's. This camera has to be my all time favorite camera. Tops them all. Very lite, easy to use and amazing macro.","good","Okay but not impressive!","Excellent advanced camera, with bright f/1.4 Leica lens. Highly recommended.","This LX7 takes such beautiful pictures that it's hard to believe it's a small point and shoot camera. And forget about using the flash at night or indoors, just set the ISO to 200, open up the aperture and shoot away!","So far, appears to be excellent. Works very well in automatic mode, when changes are needed menus are workable. Photo quality and auto settings make it very easy to use.","The best all around point and shoot ever made .. hands down. I use mine every day as an appraiser and I've taken it all over the country on vacations. Great in low light .. don't need to use the flash much at all. I have even dropped mine off a Harley at 40 MPH  .. first time .. and again at about 10 MPH. *The result of setting the camera on my camping gear tied to the back fender and taking off down the road. When I hit the brakes the camera passed me by on the way to the ground. Both times it hit pavement. At 40MPH it tumbled. At 10MPH it landed flat and broke the latch. The camera is dinged up a bit and the access door latch on the bottom is broken (see repair pics)  .. but the camera continues to work every day since, and that has been 3 years past. I just bought this one to replace it whenever it does die. I hope they continue to manufacture this model .. but I know someday soon they may stop production .. so I've got my spare .. and at a great price.<br />PS  I bought the LX100 as I thought it was the replacement for this model .. it's not . the LX100 is a completely different animal .. it takes better pictures .. but it lacks a built in flash and the zoom is pitiful .. great camera .. just different. I carry them both with me where ever I go .. and I end up using the LX7 more.","Short: love everything about it.","The high frame rate / burst photo modes are incredible for capturing fast happening events. I use it my slow motion booth called 7booth that also uses a Sony FS700 for slow motion video. Comparatively - the 120 720p video on this is CRUSHED in terms of quality. It's not sharp, very blah low quality","Great Camera, Everything was sealed and in perfect condition. Recommended by various websites and friends over other costly SLR camers's","I have barely scratched the surface with advanced features, but so far I am quite pleased with this camera. Great low light pictures and fast performance. Very sharp videos.","It goes with me everywhere and while its not up to par with my 7D in terms of quality and control, I'm never angry that its the only camera I had for a picture.","Good optical quality due to f 1.4 lens and reduced megapixels. Instruction manual covers everything, but not much details. Difficult to stop digital zoom even whe turned off on menu. Fast focusing. Love that it fits in my pocket. Unable to take pictures in bright light. Thinking about getting viewfinder, but it is expensive. Overall it is easy & quick to take family pictures compared to my Canon t1i DSLR.  I like the intelligent mode has a well thought out algorithm for settings.  For the money this was a great deal.  Update after several months of use.  I've changed the rating from 3 to 4 stars as the more I use the LX7, the more I like it.  I went and bought the viewfinder which was expensive, but made it easy to take outdoor pictures.  I took one star off because the manual while 200+ pages was not very informative, which means I have had to learn by trial and error and the expensive viewfinder.  If photography is your hobby as it is mine, this camera is a very good buy.","very nice camera","In love with this camera! The pictures always come out perfect!","Great photo quality!  Very pleased with this this product.  Only wish it had another strap other than the neck strap.  I was able to put a wrist strap on the camera that I took off of another camera and like that a lot better.","I'm a retired pro photographer from the Nikon F2, Leica M4 and Hasselblad era. After dozens of cameras I now have Panasonic's GH4 and LX7. I use the LX7 mostly for home and travel videos. In my bag the predecessor of the LX7 was Canon's  S95.<br /><br />Recently my son decided to sell his Sony RX100M3 camera. I have used it a month side by side with the Panasonic LX7. After that the decision was quite easy. I'm going to keep the LX7.<br /><br />The Sony RX100 produces sharper still pictures. But if you don't crop much or make large prints, you don't see the difference. In movie making the RX100M3 has several problems. You can't lock the focus (or after auto focusing you have to switch to manual focusing, shoot and again switch back to auto focusing, which is too complicated). For that you need one programmable button. Same thing with the exposure locking.  A second programmable button is needed for that. The Panasonic LX7 has a dedicated AF/AE locking button.<br /><br />The auto exposure of the LX7 is better. Most video clips are just perfect. You can really trust the LX7, which is very valuable in practical home and travel movie making. You don't have to always check the takes. On the other hand, with the RX100M3 you'd better to make these exposure checks as often as possible.<br /><br />The LX7 has a better AWB indoors. The LX7 sits better in hand. In addition to the red video button, with the LX7 you can use the main shutter button to start and stop the take.<br /><br />The colors of the Sony and Panasonic are nearly identical. I really like them. They resemble the Ektachrome colors of the old times. The Canon S95 is more like a Kodachrome camera.<br /><br />I use the LX7 with a wrist strap (sold separately). After several tries I now have Zeikos ZE-CA15B soft case (3.99 at Amazon), where the LX7 fits perfectly.","Most amazing P&S ever!!! Seriously though, this camera is a functional juggernaut and can take crisp and snappy pictures with ease, and it's also pleasing to the eyes. Dont pass it up.","Takes fantastic pictures, has an exceptional lens with wide aperture, is small enough to carry in pocket. Best compact I have ever owned.","Pros: Works really nicely, has the equivalent of a 24 mm (24x36) that is so useful, and that feature for creating panoramic photos by shuttering photos in fast sequence helps a lot in certain instances and provides with nice results the most of the time (not always, it has limits).<br /><br />Cons: HDR mode gives photos way too high key (cannot use it whereas I would love to). Cannot replace my TTL camera (really hard as every time to see the display in plain sky light).","very pleased.  left canon after many malfunctions on new models like the S100.  i've had this 1 year now.  really quality.","Portable, easy to use, great photos. An excellent bring-almost-anywhere camera. It is a little bigger than the small pocket cameras mostly because it has a larger lens with larger apertures, which helps avoid the diffraction problems that plague the smaller cameras. The higher quality photos are worth it, unless you must have a camera that fits in a shirt pocket.","Good","great  camevwith allnacc, quality is superb","This camera is SO much better than I am.  The heart of the camera, the optical lens, is superb.  The manual and programmable modes are many and impressive.  It is compact but not quite pocketable, unless you are partial to really large cargo pockets. A great camera.","nice","Great little camera. nice compromise between an slr platform and point and shoot cams.","I bought this camera after having owned an RX100 because in the end I felt the most important thing to me was to be able to throw the background out of focus, and this camera had the ability to open up the aperture, even while zooming, more than any other point and shoot that I could find at that time (March 2014). I still found myself relying on my iPhone as I don't like carrying stuff, but on camping trips I found doing a lot of photos and video with my iPhone really could use up my phone battery life, so I started carrying this camera. I do enjoy using it.. it has a good feel. I would love to use the more expensive cameras from this line.. I have a friend who has one that is somewhere around 20mp and also has the wide aperture even while zooming. But it is way bigger and heavier than this camera, and the reality is, in the end, I won't carry anything that big. This camera seemed like the perfect compromise. And BTW, I don't think the kit lens on my Canon Rebel open up as far as this one. You have to buy expensive lenses for your SLR to get the fast lens. Basically, images can get busy if the whole background is in focus. To me the fast len's ability to blur the background is the primary calling card of this camera.","I'm loving the pics so far, but I have a lot to learn.  I'm mostly a point and shooter. Get the companion manual by Alexander White - essential explanation of vast capabilities. This is not really a point and shoot camera (if you use it this way you're missing out on 99% of the feature).","I bought this second-hand item cheaper than expected, thinking that it was because the new model was just out in the market, but I was wrong. It was cheaper cause the zoom lever is really sticky, and some times it's a real pain in the ass to focus something while taking pictures. I've read in the internet about this issue, which seems to be common in these cameras, and I've tried to clean it with some fabric string, with compressed air, but it never changes. I thought it could be dirt, but I've experienced that the 'stickiness' changes with the temperature. the colder the camera is (It's winter now, so when I'm out taking pics and it's like -2ºC (30ºF) it's not that sticky. If anyone can give me a hint on how to solve this, please message me!!!","I did a lot of research before buying a compact camera. I needed something I could use to take great close-up pictures of the jewelry I make and sell. Pictures are very important if you want to make an online sale. This camera does everything I need it to do. The pictures are amazing. I have owned it for just over a year and have had no issues with my Lumix.","Still learning how use it. Love size of it, Pictures come out amazing","GREAT camera.","I love this camera and am so glad I ordered it.","I bought this camera to replace an LX5, which was lost. I still had the optional electronic viewfinder from that camera, the DMW-LVF1. Called Panasonic and asked them if the viewfinder would work in the LX7 and was told that it would. On this basis, I bought the LX7.  It's a fine camera, but the DMW-LVF1 viewfinder will not work with the new unit. I called Panasonic and explained the situation and they were unwilling to provide any support other than to suggest I return the camera to Amazon.<br /><br />Don't expect me to be buying any more Panasonic products after this.","I love this camera.  I have the LX3 and the LX5.  This one did not disappoint.  Small and compact.  Not pants pocket small but jacket pocket small, or cargo pants.  Fast lens and great low light performance.  This is not going to replace a DSLR or a premium 4/3 system.  But for the size you can't go wrong.  There are a lot of new cameras coming out from the DSLR, Mirrorless, 4/3 camp that are getting smaller but you are paying well over $1000 for those.  For the price this is a winner.  You can spend over double and get a Sony, but the Sony is not a run away winner.  There are situations this camera will beat the Sony.  Read the professional reviews.  But for the cost of the Sony, the Sony should be hands down the better of the 2 cameras.  But it is not.","I am still getting used to this camera but so far so good. The picture quality is excellent and the features are comparable to a more expensive DSLR.","Amazing close up images. I use this in a dental office for intraoral picture taking and it is very effective. Sure beats spending 2-3k on a professional setup. Manual focus is really cool and allows for dimensional photography. Battery seems to last forever. Wish it had wireless transfer ability but the sd card is easy to remove. Long distance zoom is not what this camera is intended for so don't even bother. Get it for portrait shooting and macro close ups!","A wonderful point and shoot camera with nice manual settings and very good low-light performance.  Would highly recommend, makes a great travel piece.","How do you know a camera is great? Not only does it hold it's value well over a year later, it's actually gone up in value. Not only that but it's still being talked about and still runs with the current cream of the crop.<br /><br />I shoot FF(recently switched from Nikon d600 to Canon 6D) as a hobbyist. I picked up this P&S just over a year ago to fill a couple of gaps. First being we needed a P&S for my wife that worked well on auto. Second we needed a decent quick and go video recorded. Both gaps were filled brilliantly. More so with the video. This camera takes exceptional pictures but what it even does better is takes HD video. It's just gorgeous to watch. Also the iAuto works wonders. The jpegs are super which is nice because this is how my wife is going to shoot.<br /><br />The other pluses of the P&S is the manual abilities. It's nice for myself because when I don't want to be loaded down with the heft of a DSLR I have an alternative that is going to give me options. The raws are nothing short of fantastic. Lots to work with being sharp, contrasty, and nice saturation.<br /><br />I can certainly recommend this camera even at it's current(higher :) ) price!<br /><br />I uploaded a couple of samples to view.","I bought this camera so that I wouldn't need to take my DSLR on deployments, patrols, and trips when was limited on my packing. It has performed awesome.<br /><br />Pictures: Stunning. The colors are well balanced and sharp. The edges are precise. When I shot at the max shutter speed after hiking down to the beach, I was able to get waves at maximum crest with drops of water spraying off.<br /><br />Manual controls: Being able to change the aperture and shutter speed easily was very useful almost every time I've used this camera. I like to shoot on aperture control, and having that as a manual dial on the lens edge made life very easy.<br /><br />Lens: The lens is crisp and clear. It comes with a lens cap and a strap to keep it watched tot he camera when shooting.<br /><br />Size: It's a bit bigger than a standard point and shoot, and a lot bigger than a cell phone. But it is worth it. The ability to speed the shots up, or do long exposures, or open the aperture up make the slightly larger size tolerable.<br /><br />Case: I didn't think to buy a case until I was already traveling. This was a mistake. I've used a case that barely fits the camera, but does keep it safe. I should've just ponied up right away for a case that fits the actual camera appropriately. Because the lens sticks out as far as it does, it makes sense to get a properly paired case.<br /><br />Battery life: I used it on a single charge for several weeks in a very austere country. I have also used it on a family vacation for over a week without a recharge. On that trip I used it on hikes to remote beaches, boat trips, and day to day activities.","LOVE this camera!  The image quality for this type of camera is exceptional.  I would rate it five stars with a longer zoom.","Best camera I have every had, awesome video also.","Really love our new camera...we've had it for over a year and it takes great shots.  I wanted something smaller that I could carry in my purse, but still would take good pictures of my family/kids, even in low light.  I love the HDR shot.","I really haven't used it much;  but I am annoyed that the detachable lens cap does not have a leash attached..  For a supposedly good quality camera,  one would think that it would include this very handy,  and very inexpensive item","I came to the LX7 after years of joyful experience with the now venerablePanasonic DMC-LX3 10.1MP Digital Camera with 24mm Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black).  (I skipped the intermediate Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD - Black, which has many of the features missing from the LX3 and found in the LX7.)  What these cameras have in common is superior engineering and ergonomics, a beautiful design informed by classic cameras of the past, Leica optics (part of that heritage), and settings from the fully automatic to completely manual.  Just holding these cameras communicates their essence as finely crafted instruments -- solid, carefully machined metal in lieu of plastic, and an excellent feel in-hand.<br /><br />Of course, time marches on and the Lumix LX100 Panasonic LUMIX LX100 16.8 MP Point and Shoot Camera with Integrated Leica DC Lens (Black), the successor in the line, is coming on November 1, 2014.  And, yes, it has some amazing specifications that push the envelope of available technology, including 4K video and bigger sensor.  It's also about twice as expensive and bigger.  But, in the end, it's about the photographs.  And when you leap to the price point for LX100, there are plenty of options with interchangeable lenses.  All of that needs to be factored into the equation.<br /><br />But, in the end, it's about the photographs.  And that's where the LX7 shines.  The entire package brings out the artist in me, and it seems to do the same for the many other passionate fans of this camera.  It substantially betters the LX3 in the one area that needed improvement -- a more powerful zoom.<br /><br />This is a great camera.  A great tool for artists who care about the images and the experience of using it, not the latest specs.  It will be a tool of choice for me, and many others, for a long, long time to come.","Easy to use. Lots of features.  Leica lens.","Great camera. Fast and sharp! Extremely and both.<br /><br />Three shortcomings: short tele, which I knew going in; complicated flash mode (never mastered a good fill-flash technique); and, after it got wet in the rain, the command dial would only decrease the shutter speed. I got used to the command dial quirk, working around it with the menu button.<br /><br />I used it heavily for 16 months at a daily paper (where it got rained on), and the fill-flash issue was seldom a problem with the 1.4 aperture, but still.... Luckily, I kept a DSLR with Speedlight handy.<br /><br />I'd buy this handsome camera again in a minute.","Not a point-and-shoot but quite simple to operate if you take time to view the You Tube tutorials.  This is the best camera both still and video I have ever owned.","This is the best little camera I have ever bought. It has an art setting where you can creatively retouch your photos.It has toy effects, sepia, black and white, star effects and many other. it has  a great macro setting and you can do square pictures, wide shots or many in between shots. It's light weight and the battery lasts a long time. I always buy two extras batteries and keep them with me but hardly ever need to use them. I'm not a professional but the art button sure makes me feel like one. All in all a fun camera.","Panasonic keeps building excellant products","This is truly a fantastic camera. When our last point and shoot bit the dust, I wanted a camera that was going to take as amazing pictures as possible while still being portable and relatively inexpensive. This is that camera. The pictures are worlds apart from our last point and shoot (a Canon powershot). I haven't even messed around with the manual settings but looking forward to being able to do that. Great camera!","My favorite pocket camera, for when you want something better then your iPhone, but don't want to lug around a DSLR.","Bought the LX7 to replace an older Lumix. Exceeds my expectations. Superb image quality. Love the ability to control depth-of-field such as in mountain flower photography. The iA mode works well. I found it difficult to discern image quality or treatment of light differences when shot in iA versus the other modes. The ability to manually control the aspect ratio, aperture and focussing programs via the outboard ring is a fab feature.<br />This camera is ideal for travel. But do get a backup battery. I have not verified whether the battery can deliver the claimed 330 JPGs per charge. That claim is likely inflated.<br />I don't like the way the outer lens is so exposed and easily directly contacted [dirty fingers for one as well as possible contact with damaging surfaces]. I got an adapter ring from Goja, a high quality UV filter [37 mm UV-Haze F-Pro B + W filter], and a JJC Auo Open/Close lens cap. Much better protection for the lens. Now I am comfortable in taking it on the road.","Great camaera with lots of setting possibilites, some of the settings can be a little hard to operate. The real advantage is the brightness of the optics F1.4-2.3 which makes flash unnecessary in most cases.","Thanks.","I bought this camera to take on a trip to Europe last March, and I was delighted with the results! It is light and compact, and yet gave me tremendous shooting flexibility.  I got beautiful, crisp pictures inside churches and cathedrals.  I captured some lovely night shots from a vaporetto on the Grand Canal in Venice.  (Okay, the night shots were a little noisy, but at 11 p.m. on a foggy night in a moving boat with almost no light, I was  amazed that I got anything at all.)  The macro ability came in handy for closeups.<br /><br />This is a versatile camera that gives me incredible control (manual controls, aperture ring, etc.)  in a small and affordable package. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />By the way, it's worth it to get a filter adapter and a polarizing filter to go with the camera.","Love this camera, it takes very good pictures.  I am very pleased with my purchase","High quality compact camera.<br />Photos are taken very fast with great quality.","Great option for point and shoot digital cameras. Leica lens make a big difference.","Timely and efficient and exactly what was ordered.","Perfect","A fine camera with a fast lens. Good for shooting in low light. Needs the aftermarket lens cap that allows for the lens to extend without having to remove a lens cap by hand. Would be better if it had a viewfinder. That's also available aftermarket.<br />This camera has many nice options including the ability to adjust manually.","I love this camera","Best point and shoot @ this price range - period.","Great little camera. I bought it with an automatic lens cover, two spare Progo batteries and a spare charger. I advise getting an electronic viewfinder, as the LCD display is difficult to read in bright conditions. This is a good camera to buy for an enthusiast who wants to build their photography skills before upgrading to a high-end Nikon or Canon, as it has a plethora of adjustable settings under the hood.","I have had this camera for more than a year and I have grown to appreciate it quite a bit. The big selling points are:<br />1) Great low light lens. F1.4 (Where is that on any point and shoot?)<br />2) The ability to shoot in RAW.<br />3) Small size and weight<br />4) Ability to shoot slow motion video<br />You can get some really great shots with this camera and it is very unobtrusive and portable. It is easy to hold in your hand and carry around without drawing a lot of attention. In that way, it is perfect for street photography.<br /><br />My only complaint is that you really do need the accessory viewfinder and that adds about $150-200 to the cost of the camera. On bright days, it is virtually impossible to see what you are shooting. There is simply too much glare on the back of the LCD. And it doesn't swivel or adjust, so you can't really get high or low angle pictures unless you want to get on the ground or up on a ladder. With the purchase of the additional electronic view finder, these problems and issues are largely solved, but for that, you are now close to $500 for the camera.","Still my go to P&S standby and love it better than my new Sony (see review). There is nothing faulty about how this camera works, although the menu can be a challenge to Noobs. I will say that the GPS uses a lot of battery power, so when not in use, I remove the batt. You will not lose any location data. One thing though, when the burst mode is on, the shutter lag time is pathetic.","I've purchase tons of cameras in the past and I have to say this is by far my favorite camera ever!! You just don't need flash for this camera at all! The pictures are sharp looks like I took from a DSLR camera. I'm so so happy I have finally found a small perfect camera :)","Terrific camera, the only drawback I can see is the 10.1 MP.  If this had 14 MP it would be amazing.","Fantastic camera.  A lot of camera for the $$","We've been extremely happy with this camera.  It takes great photos and is very durable.","This Lumix Version is without a doubt the Very Best Lumix ! I have used it extensively in Wide angle Photography ,and in all kinds of Lighting situations and it simply excels ! A 24mm Lens setting is usually where I leave it ,and for Landscapes it is just wonderful from a wide and sweeping effect result ! The Viewfinder is a delight to use , and the Horizon Level is most helpful ! I purchased a Tube Attachment for Filter Usage , and it in turn greatly protects the Protuding Lens assembly much greater that normal no protection extension ! I have other High end Digital Cameras , but this Little Jewel is in a Class of its Own !","Great little camera.  I am an artist and love photography but sometimes find it difficult to bring my SLR places when traveling.  I purchased the Lumix as a back up camera.  It has exceeded my expectations.  The quality of the pictures are wonderful.  It also works very well in low lighting.  It is easy to use and makes adjustments automatically depending on light etc.  It's light weight made it very pleasant for sight seeing making it easy to slip into my purse.  While I love my SLR I honestly felt that the Lumix quality was to par with the SLR.  Print quality came out great as well.  I highly recommend.","An amazing camera and has so many options for such an amazing price!<br /><br />Definitely recommended by many professional photographers as being a great smaller camera to use that gives the BIG camera quality pics.","Perfect for me and my Intension to make good photos. Is a pice of exzellent Equipment to get beside the bigger Camera snapshots.","We recently took two of these cameras on a trip to Ireland/Scotland.  We still love our Nikon DSLR but since we were planning on lost of hiking wanted to decrease our carrying weight.  This camera is so lite you forget you have it so it was perfect to take on our hikes.  We got some fabulous photos.  Would our NIkon have taken better photos?  Yes, but for the price and convenience this small point and shoot is a gem!","great camera.  unbelievable photo quality.  videos are great.  i purchased the auto-lens cap and using this camera became much more fun.  i have nothing negative to say about this camera.  i have had it now for approx. 4 months with no complaints.  the IQ is better than my 2004 canon rebel dlsr. however, i the dslr does deliver better pics for sporting events and the bokeh effect on my dlsr is a bit better when i use my 50mm fixed lens.  however, the lx7 is my go to camera.","Great camera but too small for my big hands.","great camera","NOT ENOUGH MEGAPIXELS FOR SERIOUS PHOTOGRAPHERS WHO WANT TO PRINT UP TO 13 X 19 INCH PHOTOS FOR CAMERA CLUB COMPETITIONS; OKAY FOR FAMILY SNAPSHOTS; NEEDS AN EXTERNAL VIEWFINDER (WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR EXTRA COST.) USING THE LCD AS VIEWFINDER IS IMPOSSIBLE IN BRIGHT LIGHT…SERIOUS REFLECTIONS KEEP YOU FROM SEEING WHAT YOU'RE HOPING TO PHOTO..","this camera is an upgraded version of the point and shoots.","very  good!","I am by far NOT a professional photographer. I was just looking for a camera that was better than my point and shoot, but was able to be put in my purse on my vacation. This camera produced some amazing photos. I loved that I was able to alter photos on the camera after taking them. I didn't have a laptop on my vacation, but wanted to lighten some, and cross process others. I'm sure if I were to sit down and learn everything this camera could do I would be able to capture some fantastic photos.","There are enough reviews of the camera itself. Here is an answer for those who cannot find a carrying case for the LX7 with optional  DMW-LVF2 viewfinder.<br /><br />As with previous Panasonic p&s cameras I have owned I prefer a carry case that can be worn securely on the belt which requires taking the belt off, threading it through, and putting the belt back on. I carry the LX7 with the optional DMW-LVF2 viewfinder and JJC auto lens cap attached all the time.<br /><br />My preferred case is the Manfrotto Nano VII Camera Pouch. The dimensions of this carry case are perfect for the LX7 carried in my configuration. It consists of water-repellent nylon, Velcro fastener, belt loop, with interior dimensions 2.56 x 3.94 x 4.72\" (6.5 x 10.0 x 12.0cm). I also use the Joby JB01271-PWW DSLR Wrist Strap which tucks right into the case along with the camera – plenty of room. The belt loop is strong and large enough for any size belt allowing it to ride very securely on your hip. I can also leave the strap hanging out the side of the case flap to become the wrist carry strap for both camera and case when not secured to my belt. No shoulder strap is included as your camera’s own shoulder strap would serve that purpose.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with this case is that while the storage pocket is large and ample enough to hold a couple spare batteries, etc., it doesn’t hold them very securely because it’s wide open on the top and the contents can easily slide out while taking the bag off your belt for example, thus I have previously only used it to hold a micro fiber lens cloth. A Velcro tab, snap, or better yet a zipper to secure the contents would have made it perfect for spare battery(s), memory card, etc.<br /><br />My solution was to stop by the local Tandy Leather Factory store where for $9 I purchased a pack of #1263-03 Line 24 Snaps/Black Plate, #8056-00 DOT/RIVET Anvil, and #8058-00 Line 24 Durable Dot Setter and attached two snaps with the help of my leather punch near the top seam of the pocket opening about 1.75” apart. Now the pocket remains securely closed and I am totally pleased with this case.","I previously had the Panasonic dmc fz7 for over 10 years & i thought for sure that was the best camera ever made until the LX7 came along. I was blown away by photos i took the other day when compared with the FZ7. No comparison what so ever! I look for fine details in my pictures mostly in macro modes. The detail level is astonishing. Then i switched to video recording & played it back only to find that it was comparable to my Canon HF M300!! Pretty dang good for a point & shoot! I'm sure i'll learn more as time goes by. I've only had it a few days so far. Get this camera!!<br /><br />Update 7/1/14:  I almost forgot to mention that i had bought the highly praised Sony RX100 before buying the LX7 & i was highly disappointed! I tried some macro shots with & it would miss the subject i was trying to capture. It would only capture part of the image & leave the rest of it a blur (like the background was supposed to be). Also the video on the RX 100 was a joke it was so slow to focus that the subject would be gone by the time it got into focus!! But back to the LX7 this baby is a beast! I think i will only buy Panasonic cameras from here on out. No thanks Sony.","Great results in full light and low light as well. Goes through the battery rather quickly but I am sold on the results.  Definitely a step above a point and shoot.","I would like to give my opinion about the Lumix LX7 camera (referred wrongly by many as a point and shoot camera). I am an experienced amateur photographer, have owned many different cameras like Leicas, Hasselblad and Nikons from the film age. Presently I own a Pentax K30 with a wide assortment of lenses which I think is a fantastic camera, so I guess I know what I am talking about.<br />When you talk about digital cameras, there is a school of thought that puts a lot of emphasis on the pixel count, noise at the pixel level and comparisons based on many technical aspects with very little consideration about the actual results and their intended use. Let me clarify. I shoot my pictures for my pleasure and like to view and show them in a screen, with the occasional print of the ones a Ilke best of up to 20 inches in the largest dimension. And I guess that I am among a very large group of photographers in this respect. So, the intended use is of primary importance in my analysis.<br />My daughter is a professional photographer, so she uses full frame Nikons and Canons and her pictures have a different intended use, large prints among them. So, her analysis would be different from mine.<br />So, what do I look in a camera, given my needs? Let me make a list of requirements.<br />1. High quality<br />2. Good ergonomics<br />3. Wide angle<br />4. Low weight for casual photography and travel<br />5. Fast lens<br />6. Good zoom range<br />7. Sharp results<br />8. RAW capability<br />9. Use of optic filters, like an UV, Neutral or CPL<br />10. Good battery life<br />11. Reasonable price<br />12. Moderate to low noise at high ISO settings<br />13. Eye level viewfinder<br />14. Fast focusing<br />15. Good screen for composing and viewing<br />16. Good movie capabilities<br /><br />Obviously, most of these requirements are met by a DSRL, like my Pentax K30, except perhaps and arguably by the movie capability which in this case is just adequate and the requirement of low weight. Any DSRL, including the Pentax are heavy and more so after a  day of carrying it, along with an assortment of lenses. But I needed a camera that, while satisfying all my requirements was both reasonable in size and weight and that not a pain in the neck (literally) to carry around and allowed me to be fairly inconspicuous while shooting.<br />After reviewing the available options, and I considered all the obvious ones, like the Sony RX100, the Canon S models and the high end Nikon compacts, it was obvious to me that the best alternative by far was the Panasonic LX7 for several reasons, in spite of being a model introduced 2 years ago.<br />Let me start with the end result and then I will cover the details and the reasons I opted for this camera. It is a fantastic camera of high quality build that gives excellent results and it’s a joy to use.<br />Now let me get into specifics. I will tackle my list of requirement individually, but my review will necessarily be limited to what I consider the relevant points.<br /><br />1. High quality<br /><br />The construction of this camera is flawless with a metal body. You can fell the quality as you hold it in your hands. Almost every review I have read about this camera has a negative opinion of the battery/SD card open latch, calling it flimsy and detracting from the general high quality construction. In my opinion this is a moot point as my experience with several point & shoot Panasonic cameras I have owned is that it works perfectly, and I believe that the reason Panasonic continues to use it is that it works and it is durable. This camera is built to last and at the same time is a thing of beauty that you are proud to own.<br /><br />2. Good ergonomics<br /><br />The camera feels just right in your hands, has an excellent grip to your right side that gives a good one handed hold on it. All the controls are in the right places, at least in my opinion, are easy to operate and secure in holding their position. You will not move a control inadvertently, that’s for sure. One of the criticisms that are offered is that the lens cap has to be removed each time you turn on the camera. I personally, coming from the film era cameras find this totally natural and it doesn’t bother me at all. Anyhow, I have purchased an accessory lens cap, three leafed that opens automatically when you turn on the camera and that works beautifully. I alternate between these two lens covers, depending where I carry the camera. This one is an inexpensive gadget that can be bought at Amazon or eBay and it’s very easy to install or remove.<br />One word of caution: remember always to attach the small cord provided to secure the original lens cap to the camera body so to not loose it inadvertently.<br />I particularly liked the aperture control ring and the aspect ratio selection switch, both operating directly through the lens mount. Very convenient.<br /><br />3. Wide angle<br /><br />The lens has fantastic wide angle capabilities. The equivalent 35mm maximum is 24mm, but a would like to give a word of caution. These measures are used always in reference to an aspect ratio that is all right if you just crop the picture to give the aspect ratio you want. No so in the case of the LX7. The sensor has more pixels than the ones you get in the actual picture, and so, if you use the 3:2 ratio you get the 24mm coverage. But if you go to the 16:9 ratio, the LX7 takes away a portion of the upper and lower parts of the picture but adds to the left and right sides, so that what you get in this case is a coverage of almost 21mm. The same happens, in the opposite direction with the other aspect ratios available, 4:3 and 1:1. To my knowledge this is not provided by any other camera I know of.<br /><br />4. Low weight for casual photography and travel<br /><br />This camera is not tiny by any means, but neither it is unreasonable large and its weight is adequate to carry it all day long with no undue strain. I normally carry it in a case that is attached to my belt (I use the leather model that provides sturdy protection and it’s nice to look at) and always have it with me. Occasionally I can carry the camera on the pocket of my jacket. In this case I use the alternate lens cover that I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />5. Fast lens<br /><br />In this respect, the LX7 shines. It has the most luminous lens in the compact camera market, as far as I know. It has a maximum aperture of 1.4 at maximum aperture and 2.3 at its longest telephoto setting. All other cameras considered may have a good maximum aperture (though none comes near the 1.4) but the telephoto end is way over the 2.3 that the LX7 achieves. Just look at the specs of the LX7 competitors and you get the idea.<br /><br />6. Good zoom range<br /><br />The zoom range of the LX7 covers most of my shooting needs. I tend to use the wide angle settings more often than the telephoto, and there are some occasions where I need more than an 90mm equivalent range. For these cases (not very numerous for me) I am considering buying a long telephoto compact camera to carry around as a supplement, instead of my DSRL with a telephoto lens. The Panasonic range has some very good possibilities, with very sharp Leica lenses that will fit my bill. Consider this as having a very long zoom lens for your DSRL, and compare the size and weight. You get my point. If you consider cost and weight this is a no brainer.I believe this will be the way to go for me. You can carry the LX7 for most of your shooting and use the other compact camera for long range shooting at an acceptable level of quality when you need it.<br /><br />7. Sharp results<br /><br />The lens and sensor combination of the LX7 gives amazing results, even when shooting at full aperture. In all honesty, I can’t tell the difference between pictures taken with the LX7 and the Pentax. Probably I would see a difference in large prints but I don’t have the need for these. I believe this Leica Summilux zoom lens is among the sharpest lenses I have ever used.<br /><br />8. RAW capability<br /><br />The LX7 can shoot in both RAW and JPEG formats or both simultaneously. I shoot all my pictures in RAW and am able to extract full detail. Incidentally, the LX7 produces RAW files with a color depth of 16 bits, while my Pentax gives me RAW files with a color depth of 12 bits only. I cannot the tell the difference in my monitor or in the prints I have made. Probably this has importance for large professional work and in this particular respect the LX7 may have an advantage. I can extract good details from the light and dark areas, especially from the lights.<br /><br />9. Use of optic filters, like an UV, Neutral or CPL<br /><br />A good capability that the LX7 has is that you can use threaded 37mm filters. The only thing you need is an unexpensive adapter ring that is very easy to install. This is a very distinctive advantage that the LX7 has that I have not seen pointed out in most of the reviews I have read. The other big advantage it has is the incorporated neutral density filter that is built in the camera and can be used by the push of a dedicated button. Again, to my knowledge no other camera in this category has this capability.<br /><br />10. Reasonable price<br /><br />The LX7 also has a nice price advantage over most of its rivals, especially the Sony RX100 line. You can get it now in Amazon for around 340 dollares, although the price fluctuates and is a good idea to check it regularly. I bought mine in Amazon, used, like new, including a spare battery and case for around 220 dollars. It was in perfect condition and you can’t beat that price.<br /><br />11. Moderate to low noise at high ISO settings<br /><br />I have found that noise is not a problem up to 800 ISO. The settings of 1600 and 3200 produced and amount of noise that could be managed nicely in post processing and for computer use and small prints ISO 6400 is adequate. In BW pictures, noise can be used to your advantage, giving that special grain look that you achieved using Kodak Tri X film.<br /><br />12. Eye level viewfinder<br /><br />Another of the critics I have found in the review is that the LX7  does not have an eye level viewfinder. In some cases it is not mentioned the existence of an electronic viewfinder, the LVF2, that is attached to the flash accessory shoe. I adds bulk to the camera (you can still pocket it in your jacket) and you can not use the case with it. But although is an expensive item, it is of very good quality, giving a very clear and detailed image that can be used in any circumstance, especially bright outdoors. It has the added advantage that it can be tilted up to 90 degrees, giving the possibility of waist level shooting. For me is a must have accessory.<br /><br />13. Fast focusing<br /><br />I have found that the focusing speed of the LX7 is nothing short of fantastic, even in low light, making this camera an excellent low light one in combination to its very fast lens. In this respect, it cannot be beaten, given the very sharp results you can get using its maximum aperture.<br /><br />14. Good screen for composing and viewing<br /><br />The screen is very good, with resolution over 900 K pixels, with good contrast and magnification when using it for viewing your pictures. The only thing I would have liked is a capability for tilting it. But I can live without it and the possibility of tilting the electronic viewfinder is a good substitute for it.<br /><br />I don’t have a need for filming in most instances, but in those moments I used the LX7 for filming I was surprised by the very high quality of the clips I obtained. But my thing is photography, so I cannot fully evaluate the capabilities of this camera in this respect to this.<br />I always thought that the camera is a tool for taking photographs, the more important component of a good photo being the photographer. But the better the tool you have the more you can take advantage of it to achieve better results. In this respects, the LX7 is a formidable tool, that gives the photographer most of the capabilities he or she might ever need. I am far from exhausting the possibilities that this gem of a camera provides and suspect that there are many that I will probably never use. I would give this camera a punctuation of 9.9 out of a possible 10 and highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed.","This is an excellent alternative to my DSLR when I don't want to carry heavy gear with me. f/1.4 is pretty much unheard of on anything but a single-focal length lens that would cost more than this whole camera. Having access to all of the settings is awesome, most non-DSLR cameras force you to shoot in auto. Having a built-in ND filter is useful as well. Image quality is comparable to the Sony RX100 ii, which costs more than twice as much, and was my previous favorite compact camera. The only thing the Sony improves is having a viewfinder in addition to an LCD.","great camera!!! it works so good, the quality of the photo picture can compared to some professional camera's work. easy to use.","Fast shooting, fast lens.<br />For low light, most cameras add a bigger CMOS chip and increase the ISO, but all that does is give you grainy photos. Most cameras have a 3.5, 2.8 lens. If you want to shoot in low light you need 1.8 or lower. These are impossible to find, except for this LX7 which has a 1.4 lens. Thats very fast. Indoor low light photos are now possible.<br />Also, this camera is 10MP, that is all you will ever need for prints up to 16\"x20\". Many cameras keep adding MP which eats up your SD card space and will not give you better low light. (Always look at the front of the lens for the size, the LX7 will have 1: 1.4 - 2.3  They rarely put that info in the specs )<br />iAuto is good, so is Programmed settings. Low light capability is very good.<br />But the price is up $120 since last year. On Amazon, prices fluctuate. If you are not in a hurry to purchase you could hit at the right time and save. Price is up again for 2016. What is going on with this camera.?","This is a fantastic little camera that fits in a larger pocket, solidly made, with excellent bright lens and plenty of external controls.  The lens is extremely bright or fast if you will, you rarely need a flash which btw is very nice, totally under your control ( does not pop out unless you decide to release it).  Pictures are great without or with the flash.  You can change image size ration right on lens, there is a built in neutral density filter if you need to use slower shutter speeds but conditions are too bright.  It has very nice effect filters and scene modes or you can go with advanced modes or fully manual.  Either way it is hard not to take good pictures and I find myself using it a lot instead of my dSLR, especially when traveling.  Oh, and video quality is brilliant.  This camera is priced below the competitors and occasionally discounted on Amazon up to 98 $, which makes it basically a steal.  There is an external electronic viewfinder available that can be used in full sun conditions or just as a preference( Panasonic DMW-LVF2 External Live View Finder for DMC-GX1, DMC-LX7 Cameras).  Highly recommended","Best small camera for video!","Very Nice Quality of pictures and videos Big size sensor 1.7 inch is very good.Quality leika lenses Best compact camera ever.","Maybe not the best compact, if size doesn't matter, but if it does, then this camera should be on your short-list.<br />I've an LX1, LX2, LX3, LX5 and now an LX7 and they are getting better all the time.<br />But to be honest, the LX3 is (much) better than the LX1 or LX2. And the difference between the LX3 and the LX5 is not that big. The LX7 is easier to adjust to your needs than all previous models. I love it!","I was quite happy with the lx3, mainly because of its lens.<br />There was not enough difference with the lx5 to justify its purchase.<br />With the LX7's lens and other improvements,  the upgrade was definitely worth it.<br />The LX7 in white is very sexy.","The camera arrived timely and well-packaged. Although the packaging had been opened (previous purchase as noted in description) everything was in the original packing and is working fine. I am very pleased with my purchase.","I am a complete noob regarding photography but i wanted to step up a little from my old Lumix-FP8 without getting inro DSLR.<br /><br />This camera has tons of features, takes superb pictures and if you put some time on it you can achieve incredible shots.<br /><br />I am really in love with the aperture control ring that makes really easy to get your blurred background images or sharp panorama shots.<br /><br />There is too much to say about this camera and i dont think i can cover everything in this review. This is a great camera from Panasonic. If you are getting this camera consider buying the photographers guide to the Panasonic LX7 sold here on amazon><br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Photographers-Guide-Panasonic-Lumix-LX7-ebook/dp/B00BCRL9T6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400424888&sr=8-1&keywords=lx7+guide<br /><br />This guide is excellent and it will make you get the most out of the camera.","My wife has an LX-5 and it is a better camera. I bought this as a step up from my Panasonic point and shoot. but my older camera takes better photos.","wonderful camera! my film cameras were getting to heavy for canoe tripping so after reading many reviews i got the LX7.<br /> the Leica lens was the best selling point as i have several Leica's and know the high quality of their work.<br /> the only draw back for me was working thru all the many-many things the camera could do.using Nikon for years it was just a speed and lens setting but the LX7 is one of those \"sings and dances\" modern cameras that leave old school guys like me behind the learning curve.the detail in the shots is mind blowing and once i had the easy set ups done i left it like that and just shot away.<br />  when i have time i'll work on more detail settings. you need to keep this camera clean!.the tele tab got a bit sticky so next trip i'll take a small brush.","Definitely need to read the instructions. Takes great pictures. I love the wide angle needed to take pictures of rooms.","I absolutely love the camera. It was recommended by my daughter-in-law who takes photos of her fast moving children.  I am a basic point and shoot kind of photographer, but I love great photos mostly to document trips and family.<br /><br />What I like the most:  I love the fast shutter speed.  I rarely use the flash and hardly ever have fuzzy photos from moving targets.  It is light weight and easy to carry. There is a rechargeable Li battery and charger included.  I think that the camera is a great value.<br /><br />Things that could be better:<br />1) I wish that there was an automatic lens cap.  Based on a review, I ordered the Goya auto lens cap for < $10 but couldn't figure where the lens ring was to remove to put on the auto lens cap.  Panasonic's service was significantly less than optimal. I spent > 1 hour on the Panasonic website trying to figure out where the lens ring was.  Then I spent more time with the on-line chat only to have him/her tell me that it didn't exist (it does).  I e mailed Goya and got a fairly prompt response with a link to a YouTube video ([...]) that showed how to remove the lens ring.  (I'm not quite sure why this information wasn't included with the auto lens cap.)  The lens cap then installed easily.  It is SO much easier to have this auto lens cap that to take the Panasonic lens cap off, leave it hanging on its string, and replacing it when I'm done.<br />2) There is no view finder.  This hasn't been a problem so far, but on my last Canon camera, when I was in the rain forest in Costa Rica looking at white faced Capuchin monkeys, I could see them on the LED in the dappled light but they were visible with the view finder.<br />3) There is no wi-fi connection that many other cameras now have.  However, plugging the camera into my Mac's USB port after downloading Silkypix onto the computer was very simple.<br /><br />I have a friend that has a <1 year old Panasonic point and shoot that cost her over $100 more than mine and she now has camera envy.  I chose wisely.","I am thoroughly impressed with every aspect of this camera, and I was lucky enough to have purchased it on a VERY bizarre and VERY temporary 2 day $100 price drop from $398 to $298... Watch the new and used prices on this camera. It yoyo's UP and DOWN significantly. As I write this, the price went back UP to $347 from $298... and $398 - all in the same week! lucky me. The one additional odd thing I noticed was a blue 'fog' when shooting into direct sunlight. Probably the lens coating. Something to watch out for when zoomed out. This 'purple haze' spot can be reduced by angling the camera slightly up, down, or sideways. This camera has more functions and features than my Canon 5D Mark iii, costing thousands more. Optics are excellent. READ THE MANUAL. There is a LOT going on inside this baby!","Semi pro and out on travels in foreign lands this camera will cover so many photo opts incl HQ video now.<br />Compact and with a great lens. Each upgrade in the LX series has only improved an already great camera.","I have tried out several different compact cameras, including the Sony RX100, and settled on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX7 for several reasons. First, here's what I was looking for in a compact camera:<br /><br />- Fast aperture (f2.8 or better)<br />- Low time to first photo and fast recycle time (even if not \"burst\" mode)<br />- Custom aperture and shutter controls<br />- 1080 video<br /><br />Both the Sony RX100 and the LX7 meet those requirements, but the LX7 is $150 cheaper. I actually picked mine up for $369 and saved almost $200 off the price of the RX100.<br /><br />I had the Panasonic LX5 a few years ago and really loved it, so I was already comfortable with the controls and menu. It's just a great little camera and I take it EVERYWHERE with me. Anywhere I don't lug my big Nikon DSLR, I have my LX7.<br /><br />Couldn't be happier with the size, image quality, or performance so far. And it's really durable... I just throw it in my bag or pocket and go. So far, the aluminum body has resisted scratches and dings well.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good compact camera with advanced features and a fast aperture, the LX7 is a great choice.","The LX-7 has been out a while now (it came out late 2012 and the price has fallen significantly as expected)<br />Fast forward to 2014 and there is a newer model out (but with a much larger sensor and a heavy ish price) However this still stacks up very well and worthy of some attention.<br /><br />I've used the LX-7 for a few weeks (borrowed from a friend) and I feel it's a very decent (though by no means perfect) good quality compact. You just don't normally get this kind of camera at a price like this, so with that in mind I will do a quick summary of my good and bad points<br /><br />Bottom line, grab yourself a bargain!<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Nice fast 24-90mm (equivalent) f1.4-2.3 lens (this is much faster than many compacts)<br />+ Good build overall feels solid and well made<br />+ Excellent clear, high resolution 920k 3\" LCD<br />+ Aperture ring on the lens<br />+ Good image quality for a 1/1.7\" sensor<br />+ Shoots raw<br />+ Extensive number of burst shooting modes up to 11fps and a decent buffer too (about 11-12 shots raw) There are a lot of burst shooting modes (you will see some market with AF - Autofocus - some without though)<br />+ You can store custom settings on the main exposure dial (C1 and C2 very handy)<br />+ Aspect ratio switch (no need to menu dive)<br />+ Fast and responsive with good AF performance<br />+ Option to add viewfinder (EVF)<br />+ Lots of features, full manual controls, bracketing, tons of scene modes, electronic level pretty much \"fully loaded)<br />+ Time lapse and multi exposure modes (I don't use these much but they are nice to have)<br />+ HD video 1080@60p very good well defined video with stereo sound. You can use the zoom and AF as well.<br />+ OIS works well around 3.5-4 stops<br />+ Built in ND filter allows faster apertures in bright light<br />+ Sensible and logical menus and controls (the quick menu is ok but can't be customised)<br />+ Has a hot shoe<br />+ Excellent macro mode (captures an area about an inch square, that pretty close)<br />+ Pretty good battery life I got around 320 shots per charge (I'd get a spare though)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited zoom range 3.8x (just 90mm at the telephoto end)<br />- No built in viewfinder (I like them some don't care)<br />- Dynamic range improved v the LX-5 but can still clip highlights<br />- Slow buffer clearing times - even with a fast Sandisk 45MB/s card<br />- Jpeg noise reduction can be turned down (to -2) but I would prefer less smoothing on jpegs<br />- Quick menu could be better<br />- Intelligent zoom compromises image quality (I'd simply crop images myself)<br />- Lens zooming a tad slow speed wise<br />- AWB (auto white balance) a bit cool for daylight shots (adjust in camera or post)<br />- No wifi or GPS (GPS would be handy) not a huge loss though<br />- Panoramic mode could be better results wise (I would stitch them at home on the pc)<br /><br />When the LX-7 came out there was mixed reaction as the company had decided to go with a slightly smaller sensor over the LX-5 (1/1.7\" v 1/1.63\") But there are some important improvements and even for LX-5 users it might be worth a look.<br /><br />** v the LX-5**<br />The lens is much faster F1.4 - F2.3 (v F2.0 - F3.3)<br />You get a built in ND filter, and the new on lens aperture ring (shame it can't be customised though)<br />920k v 430k LCD screen<br />Electronic level, HDR mode, time lapse, much faster burst modes<br />A new MOS sensor v the older CCD one (seems to be better with dynamic range)<br />Full HD stereo video the older 720p mono on the LX-5<br /><br />The only real area where the LX-5 is better is battery life (but I found it fine on the LX-7)<br />It's quite a strong update over the previous model in my view<br /><br />In terms of low light performance, the key here is the lens speed which is very fast (and faster than rivals)<br />This means you will be able to keep the ISO levels down even in lower light. It's a trade off you have a smaller sensor but a faster lens. So for dim shooting the camera does well, you're unlikely to need to raise the ISO to ISO 1600.<br /><br />In good light I think the larger 2/3\" sensors do have somewhat better definition at lower ISO levels. The Fuji's I've used seem to do better here (the LX-7 still does well though) and they edge the Panasonic out for dynamic range too (but it's much improved v the LX-5 in my view)<br /><br />At the original asking price there are a few nitpicks, maybe you might ponder if this is for you and look around at the Canon G's or S models or the Fuji X ones.<br /><br />But with this new bargain price right now, well to be honest new model or not on the horizon this is well worth considering. It's a steal really...this is a very nice well featured camera that has a good lens and does well even in low light. It's a serious compact for users who want to get their teeth into photography more.<br /><br />Recommended, 4 star camera at a 5 star price so I'll give it 5 overall","This is a camera that doesn't skimp on features. Picture quality is great, and I love that in on a budget I have the control and portability that I desire.","I am sure this camera is not available today.  Like all cameras in this digital age, it has been replaced by the current Panasonic Lumix DMC model. Based on my success with this one, I would recommend your consideration of the current model.","I'm not a pro by any means. I was looking for something better than my loyal HX9V that served me well for 2,5 years (and still does) and that was able to take nice pictures without flash. Basically, I was looking for a good travel camera that should be compact, with wide angle lens and the possibility to not use flash (I confess, I don't know how to use flash properly). I've read all comparisons between the RX100 and LX7, and I ended up buying this because of the price (USD 320 in Sept2013....half of the price of the RX100). I have to say, this camera is absolutely amazing. I've read many good things about the fact it has a bright an excellent f1.4 lens, but I didn't know how this would be in real shooting. The way this stuff handles low light is awesome. Pictures are sharp with low noise and beautiful color rendition. I shoot in JPG and RAW, but the JPGs are beautiful straight out of the camera. To get the same results in low light with a CSC, you would need to spend extra money with a prime lens. This is exactly what I'm doing right now with my new NEX 3N. Movies are excellent and pictures in daylight are incredible.<br />It focus really fast...you won't miss a shot with the way this thing focus even in low light. It has manual controls for WB, ISO, focal lenght, EV and an extra Fn button. The only thing that might be a problem for some is the effective resolution of this camera that might compromise big printings. Don't bother with the lens cap and buy those auto lens cap (http://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Protector-MagicFiber-Microfiber-Cleaning/dp/B009OOBSH2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1396639259&sr=8-1&keywords=lx7+lens+cap). I don't know how this thing compares to the NEX3n. I will do an update here as soon as I test the NEX.","I purchased a Canon S95 a few years back, to use it for work and home photography, and loved the portability of the small camera body, plus the manual controls, but was needing a camera with better low light capabilities than my Canon's F2.0 max aperture, and after much online reading, purchased the Panasonic DMC-LX7.<br /><br />The low light capabilities of the LX7 are amazing, with the F1.4 max aperture of the lens, I can take a side by side picture of an almost dark room with no flash, and the Canon's picture is dim and grainy, but the LX7's picture almost looks like there is a 25 watt bulb on in the room, and the ISO noise is relatively low.<br /><br />The LX7 is obviously a larger and heavier camera than the Canon offerings, but that is a logical tradeoff for a camera with these capabilities, when you consider the closest competition from Canon or Sony are hundreds of $ more expensive.<br /><br />The macro capabilities of the LX7 are also excellent, as I photograph engine parts up close at work, and can get as close as 1cm, and still have crystal clear focus, I cannot ask for more from a point and shoot.<br /><br />I have plenty to learn about the many functions and features this camera has, but at this time, and right out of the box, I believe I made a great choice, even though it is close to being discontinued, with rumors of an LX8 in the horizon.","You can move much further along the photography scale with this camera. It has all the right modes (AV, TV and M), awesome  lens, intelligently designed controls, a hot-shoe for off-camera flashes (with a wireless remote), an incredible EVF, composition grid lines, easy-to-buy accessories like a filter tube (to fit a polarizer), etc. etc.<br /><br />Panasonic made the right decision, IMHO, to keep the pixel count small (larger pixels) and provide world class optics with the Leica designed lens.  The capabilities reward a photographer with patience and willingness to learn.<br /><br />The camera just feels right.","This is a great little camera. The lens is fast and very compact. It's a joy to shoot again. With my older camera, I would miss the moment because of the lagging shutter. Not with this machine!. Since a real Leica was out of my budget, I could afford German glass and Japanese innovation with this camera.","I only briefly had this camera but I think I can fairly say a few things.  It is a quality camera that can produce very nice images.  I have simply gotten spoiled with the larger frame sensor of my Fuji X100S.  I wasn't too thrilled with the menu system Panny is using here compared to other manufacturers.  However, in all fairness this camera may well work for a lot of people and it's a solid camera.","Yep ! I really love this lx7 ,outstanding little camera . Panasonic hit a home run with this little baby .","It has so many features, there is no limit to what you can do with this.  Outdoor shots at night in almost total darkness come out super, and that's handheld, no tripod!  Multiple exposure allows for some unique portraits!  I can't believe how well the camera makes handheld shots at even 1/4 second come out so sharp.  The lenes is it's major selling point, takes me back to the days of my 35mm SLR cameras and those huge lenses with the razor sharp F 1:4!!!  The lens keeps it from fitting into your shirt pocket, but overall the camera is still very compact and easy to carry.  If you do a lot of shots outside get the add-on electronic viewfinder because as with all other rear display viewfinders, it gets hard to see in direct sunlight.  I've had it a good while now, and am as excited about it as when I got it, if not more.  I keep learning about yet another unique feature this camera has just about every time I use it.  It's a discontinued model, better buy one while they are still available!","I bought this camera for a point and shoot, and to supplement my better Nikon camera and accessories.  Wow. The quality of photos are great. Photos without flash especially in low light was one of the reasons I purchased the camera but the outdoor scenery photos are of such good quality as well. I am VERY happy with my purchase. And, the Nikon May sit in the bag because this camera is terrific.","I've always liked this camera when it first came out but thought the price was too high.  I'm so glad that I waited because even though the price dropped, the quality from Panasonic is still there.  I already knew this was 'the choice' for low light situations.  This is the perfect camera for those who hate that 'wash out' look.  It's nice to have a flash option but it's even better to do without and just get that natural color look in dim settings.  The White Balance options are great!  Camera has a dedicated button for that labeled as \"WB.\"  Can't beat the price of $299.00 either!  I'm already getting my co-workers to look at this deal from Amazon!","After reading the excellent independent reviews of the LX7 I purchased one and have not been disappointed.  It is an excellent camera with a superb f-1.4 lens and a great feature set.  Low light performance is great.  What more can I say...","Most of the ergonomics are the same as the LX-5, though I'm not a big fan of the aperture control dial on the lens.  Makes it a bit bulkier than the LX-5.  Still great for a walk-around camera and very pleased with the photo quality - very little noise and performs well in low light.","This is such a wonderful camera. Lots of wonderful features and takes great pictures. I wish it had WiFi capabilities but it is worth the sacrifice of not having wifi.","I am very satisfied with the camera and for the price it is a deal.  I would recommend the book \"The Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX7\" to go along with your purchase to fully understand all the bells and whistles the camera has to offer.","I love this camera. It is easy to use and small. I did a bunch of research and for the price it was the best choice. It has the lowest light capabilities. The metering is pretty true also.","This camera is awesome. A wonderful travel companion. 1.4 lens makes indoor shooting a pleasure. At museums no flash is necessary. Coupled with the 24 wide lens for vistas and you have a near perfect travel companion. I carry a pocket clamp/tripod which allows taking slow shutter or self pics. With these two together a no bulk photo solution.","Bought this for my wife for a present.  She is very satisfied , finds it easy to use and it takes great quality pictures without a lot of effort or skill.","I've used a predecessor to this camera, the LX-3 for a few years as my pocket camera, something with very good image quality and higher-end functionality in a compact form that I tend to take with me when I'm out and about rather than having to make the decision to pack a bigger camera like a bridge or an SLR.<br /><br /> An important feature and the major reason I decided to upgrade was the LX-7's excellent low-light capability based around its best-in-class f1.4 lens. I've used the LX-3 indoors without distracting and face-flattening flash to good effect but the LX-7's lens has another aperture stop i.e. twice the light grasp so I expect it to do even better.<br /><br /> The LX-7 generally has more features than the older LX-3 but I've not investigated them too deeply yet. I've left the LX-3 on Auto setting most of the time and I don't expect to push the envelope technically speaking with the LX-7 but it's nice to have those extra functions (HDR etc.) if I do need them.","The review heading pretty much says it all.  The camera speed and low light performance are fantastic!  If you are planning on making large prints with your photos (8x10 or larger) then you may want to get something with a little higher resolution, but your going to have to pay a lot more for something that performs this well.","I just came back from a walk in Miami's art district and all I can say is the combination of small size and the f1.4 aperture are nothing but the bomb. If you don't  have the cash or the desire for dslr. This is something you may want to consider. You may want to hurry the camera is on sale for $299. I heard the Lx8 is around the corner. Still a good camera even if it is a little dated.","So far this is a fantastic little camera. It will do a lot more if I want to get into it, which I hope to do. Small enough to take on a trip but good enough to keep all of your memories.","I bought it to replace a Canon point and shoot I really loved which got lost.  I've grown to really like this camera, too.  It takes great shots.  Easy to use.  You can get as complicated as you want: it has every feature you could think of.  It has settings for everything.  Or you can put it into automatic mode and it just takes great shots.  It looks appealingly retro.  Compact and light.<br />My only complaint is that it's almost impossible to run it without batteries.  If you want to plug it into a wall socket, you have to buy a separate piece of equipment - from a different manufacturer!  Also the manual is lacking.","maybe its too small for me, but still very good on performance. Compared with my old nikon d90, lx7k is smaller, cheaper.","Could only be better if it had a viewfinder.  But this camera is up there with the Leica point and shoot which is nearly three times the cost.  High quality, fast lens (f1.4 to f2.3 on a 3x zoom).  Very high quality images.","We had a minor issue about 2 weeks after purchase (the screen appeared \"foggy\"), but sent it in for repair and haven't had a problem since.<br />It's a great camera with some nice extra options to play around with.  The auto features are good, and we've taken some nice low-light shots without having to adjust anything.  Very handy if you're a \"cameras for dummies\" kind of person.  Also has good manual features if you want to show-off.<br />It's a solid, sturdy little camera.  And, come on, a Leica lens?  Not too shabby.","Best point&shoot camera and also great back-up option for your DSLR. 1.4f is a big advantage. Perfect for daily shooting if you are not a burner.","Very sharp image quality with high accutance.  Exposure is accurate and uniform, and images enlarge to any size that's practical without difficulty.  Controls are numerous, but learnable.  Battery life is acceptable, and focus speed is fast enough to keep up with a moving grandchild.","I always do a lot of research before buying electronics items to try to be sure they will have the features I need/want. I have purchased a lot of camera's over the last 20 years, both photo and video, for work and for myself. Panasonic's have become my go to first brand, usually due to the feature set and the ease of use, but mostly because they are built well and last a long time. Sony's are my second choice for the same reason, the one's I have purchased have lasted a long time, in fact I don't think I ever had to retire one due to it not working but only because I wished to upgrade.<br /><br />So that said, it looked like this camera met my criteria. I was looking for smaller alternative to my full size DSLR, that would give me excellent photos with full manual exposure capabilities, for those times when I did not want to carry the big kit bag. Success. And it takes nice video as well.","Great photos, great glass. Super fast quality lens makes this camera what it is! Spectacular quality lowlight photos from a point and shoot.","Alter a lot of research, decided on the LX7 and I'm very pleased. If you want a pocket camera with low light shooting and razor sharp images, at this price point, it aims to please!","What I would add to the already complete reviews is that in making my buying decision (LX7 vs. RX100) I looked at a lot of images, shared here on Amazon, on DPReview and on Panansonic's own website. There are 2 things I look for in a camera: 1) sharpness and 2) ability to make beautiful pictures. Everything about a camera (maximum aperture, image processing, lens) contribute to both qualities.<br /><br />1) Sharpness. Images from the LX7 are sharp but noticeably less sharp than those of the RX100. I think a number of factors each contribute slightly to this. The 10mp is the first. The next is the lens seems to have slightly less resolution and contrast. The sensor size is very small, much smaller than that of the RX100. I think this adds a small amount of noise to the images. These are the LX7's disadvantages when compared to the RX100, or I should say the RX100's advantages over the LX7.<br /><br />2) Beauty. It is in the eye of the beholder. When I compare the images of the LX7 and the RX100 the ones from the RX100 just look better to me. Not only are they crisper the colors are more lifelike. Perhaps \"lifelike\" is the best way to describe it. It's the complex interplay of all factors which results in images that look great. The larger sensor size of the RX 100 also makes it capable of shorter depth of field, allowing its F1.8 to knock the background out of focus better than the LX7's F1.4.<br /><br />The RX100 has clear advantages over the LX7, however it costs a lot more. Ultimately, I bought the LX7.<br /><br />I needed something small and light that I can carry around and also something convenient for indoor use at home. For travel I often need something capable of low light photography and something a bit wider, and the LX7 serves that purpose. For home use I often need something I can just whip out to photograph a fleeting moment, whereas my NEX-7 usually has some lens on it that I have to swap out.","I bought this camera for the features and the Leica lens. Maybe a little small for my hands but has all the features (maybe more) than the almost identical Leica model costing hundreds more. With the savings buy the electronic view finder that attaches to the hot shoe. (Also hundreds less than the Leica model)  Buy an aftermarket instruction book if you want to be able to use all the many, many, features.","Love the camera, picture are vivid, clear and awesome. Video better than professional Sony video camera.(Camera was 3-4 years old). Setting are easy to use, understand and all you have to do is point and shoot. One of the top rated cameras of last year and the battery hold for a long time i got a day's worth shooting sometimes even 100 photos plus video with no problems. i got a second battery and use them back to back and the camera never failed.","Took on trip to London recently. Great points were:picture quality,lens width, built  in nd filter and f stop of 1.4 which produced great night pics. Wanted pic quality without having the weight and theft worries of carrying my dslr and lenses around.Not dslr quality of pics but did not regret buying camera or leaving dslr home. Only thing i miss is the optional view finder.","I had the Canon G12, G15, Canon S110. Value proposition over other cameras is its f/1.4 at wide angle 24mm. I quite like the aperture dial and the camera lightness The image quality and performance is similar to the Canon G series. However, the autofocus is quiet faster in G series and I prefer its ergonomics. For the price, a very good competitor in the advanced compact segment. Actually, LX7 offer the best value for money between the enthusiastic cameras.","I'm not sure it's fair to categorize this camera as a point and shoot.  I've had a few advanced point and shoots over the years and the LX7 is the best of them by far. It is very good in low light, so it takes much better indoor pictures than almost all compact cameras, primarily due to it's very fast lens.  That makes a huge difference.  The other area it excels is minimal shutter lag.  It captures and shoots much faster than any other camera I've used, so if photographing kids is your thing, it's a very good choice. The LX7 can be operated simply or manually, with more options than anyone will ever use, and the interface is pretty simple and intuitive.  It feels like a quality camera and responds like one.<br /><br />So why four stars? Tradeoffs.  It's not a DSLR and it can't match image quality with advanced interchangeable lense cameras. So if you are interested in making huge prints, there are better choices.  Additionally, zoom is limited compared to all of the powerful zooms that are available.  What makes the LX7 a good choice and nearly a perfect camera is that it is small, takes very good pictures, is fast, does well indoors,takes good video, has loads of features and can be had for under $300.  I searched for a long time and found it to the best reasonably priced camera for my needs.  Unless you need a long zoom or make posters out of your photos, the LX7 won't disappoint.","This is a fine piece of equipment fit for an amateur or pro. I really do like Panasonic cameras, and have owned the Lumix LX-2 & LX-3.<br /> I was quite disappointed when I discovered that my camera was defective, and even more so when I found that Amazon had no more stock. So I had to reorder one from B & H, NYC (at a lower than Amazon price).","This camera is great but has some VERY annoying features.<br />The menus are somewhat cumbersome.<br />There is no explanation of the features on the camera in the menu, you must read the manual page by page which is annoying if your out on a shoot.<br />Lens CONSTANTLY retracts when not used for 15+ seconds (unneeded motor wear and tear)<br />Included RAW file software is junk. Canon DPP software is way more user friendly<br /><br />Last but not least is customer support. They wanna know your full name, when you bought it, email, phone number, address, blood type, eye color, favorite movie, ect ect.... then after you finally give them all that they are useless. I talked to a rep on the phone to see if I could disable the automatic lens retraction and he literally had no idea what I was talking about. I asked to speak to someone with more experience and he hung up on me! Totally rude!","I like the size and weight of the camera as it fits my large hands and feels like solid construction. I found the auto-focus to be slow which surprised me after the number of positive reviews. This camera has a lot of potential but if you're looking for the perfect auto point and shoot, I would keep looking. I won't get into the technical aspect of this camera as other reviews have done a great job already. Personally I am looking for excellent image quality which I found more readily in cameras ten or fifteen years ago.","No manual for owner! Read it on internet? Very unconvenient and not quite easy to understand! Buy photographer guide? Yes, and I paid $30.00 more.","With multiple dSLR, micro, and mid-sized (approximately like this) cameras and accessories running around, I expected to ignore this as a very secondary \"grab and go\" tool when a more expensive or larger-sized or finicky system might not be taken.  That's true -- I find myself leaving the other, larger ones behind more and more, but the reason is less for matters of size than because this is an excellent consumer camera that isn't perfect, but for the price range, is extremely good.  Highly recommended for those who don't want to jump into the heavy-bag end of larger Canon and Nikon models, don't want to buy a bunch of lenses, and who take primarily photos and video for non-professional purposes (sharing on Instagram, Facebook, etc).","This is the second LX7 I've tried.  I returned both.  I just can't get good, high quality pictures from this camera.  My Panasonic and Canon camera do MUCH better.  Love the ergonomics and looks of this camera, but it doesn't work for me.  Other cameras do work; I bought a Sony RX100 and the difference is  incomparable.....the Sony takes so much better pictures.","At this price point, second to none.  Easy to operate and takes fantastic photos and videos.  As good as comparable Sony's at half the price.  Highly Recommended!","So far (after a few weeks) I really like this camera.  It offers a lot of the similar manual features of a digital SLR camera, but on par in size with compact digitals.  I would not recommend this for a casual/novice user, because then you'd not be capitalizing on it's benefits.  I haven't had a chance to shoot video with it yet, because for some reason it tells me the grade 10 memory card I have (supposed to be the fastest) won't support it.  I haven't invetigated what the issue is there yet, but seems odd to me.","I admire Panasonic and their pact with Leica, however, I can't say that they've blown me away with anything quite yet. I really like their lenses, but that's about it. As a disclaimer, I normally shoot with a Canon 6D DSLR, so this review may come off a bit harsh. I was also once the owner of the Panasonic DMC-LX5 after reading rave reviews, and after a month of shooting with it, ended up selling it due to some nagging aliasing and performance issues I couldn't get over. After seeing the LX7 on Amazon's lightning deals, I decided to pick up the latest iteration because it was quite affordable compared to when I purchased the LX5 for $500. But once again, it fell short of my expectations, and even at a low price-point, I just couldn't get myself to keep it.<br /><br />First, the good stuff.<br /><br />The lens is amazingly bright, fast, and sharp. During daylight situations, it's snappy and does the job well. You can get literally within inches of a subject and get a clean macro shot. The bokeh has a nice effect and overall, I'm still very impressed with the optics on the LX series.<br /><br />I'd say one of the neatest features is that you can change the aspect ration on the fly and it maintains the full megapixels. It's definitely useful in this day and age with people who love uploading to Insta.<br /><br />Now for the bad.<br /><br />It's unfair for me to compare this to my DSLR, but hey, a good compact in my opinion, can keep up with decent DSLRS, especially when it's boasting a superfast lens. I love to shoot photography without flash but I'm sorry to say that I've missed too many opportunities due not necessarily because of the lens, but because of the focusing. The focusing on the camera in low-light, even with the af assist beam, tends to drag out a bit and I missed many good moments because of it.<br /><br />After a while, you begin to cope with the a/f issues and even then, the pictures for whatever reason just don't come out as nice as I hoped under low-light conditions. The ISO gets very noisy after 3200 and eventually gave up and popped the flash.<br /><br />I think if the flash performance was decent, I would've kept it, but this was the deal breaker for me.<br /><br />The flash is almost pointless. I didn't get into researching on how the flash compensates for itself, but by default, it didn't do a great job. It would either come out over exposed or underexposed in most situations. Granted you can always change the flash power settings in the menu, but nobody got time for that...<br /><br />Not to mention it has issues with Red-eye, even though it claims to prevent red-eye. It's just not cool...<br /><br />At the end of the day, I felt like the overall picture quality was the same from what I remember with the LX5. I was really hoping they'd push the envelope with high-end point and shoots, but I ended up returning the LX7 before our return period. Other than the price, I was absolutely disappointed. The potential is there, but the sensor just felt like the same stuff they had in the LX5.<br /><br />In any case, if you don't care for low-light photography and are looking for a good or even great point and shoot at a low price point, this might be your best bet. It can shoot raw and the lens is bar none one of the best among point and shoots. Too bad the sensor and software can't say the same. Leica does an amazing job with the optics, but Panasonic needs to step up their game.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.","I gave this camera to my wife as a Christmas present. She loves the camera, it takes great pictures and is easy for her to use and yet is adjustable enough that I can use it for low light or back lite pictures. I also got her the megagear case and it works very well and offers good protection for the camera.","There are many technical reviews out there that detail how this camera stacks up to comparable models, but my reasons for getting this camera were not that sophisticated. I've just started using this camera, and I'm still discovering tons of new features so this review is based on my first experiences.<br />What I like:<br />1. Compact (i.e. lightweight) - I used the flimsy shoulder strap it came with and had the camera slung over my shoulder (diagonally across my chest) for over 3 hours and didn't mind the weight.<br />2. Good in low light - This is a tricky one since what one considers low light may be quite different. Most of my low light situations have been indoors with a weak overhead light or a lamp in the corner. I pushed my luck with some of my pictures where there just wasn't enough light for my subject, and I got a little blur. Not the fault of the camera. You just need to be realistic about what the camera will do.<br />3. Stereo sound - Yeah I know, that's like being excited about being able to make a call with a smart phone. I've been using a lot of point-n-shoots that had mono sound that was horrible. This is so much better.<br />What I'm not as thrilled about:<br />1. The lens cap - I don't expect it to automatically open. I'm used to lens caps on my dslr and other point-n-shoots. My main gripe is that it so dang small and is even smaller than the lens diameter. My hands are average size, probably more slender than average dudes, but I still struggle with getting the lens cap off and on. If you have big hands, I pity you.<br />2. The manual focus - Here's where I probably should have done more research. I'm used to flipping a switch on a lens to the \"MF\" setting then grabbing the lens ring and focusing away. This camera is a quite a bit different. It's not necessarily bad... just different, and I find myself struggling to learn a whole new way of focusing with buttons. I'll probably just need to practice.<br />Final Conclusion: For the price, this is a great camera. You get the convenience of a point-n-shoot with all kinds of features and modes for those who like to customize and control their camera. You'll want to check out the manual as a pdf file so you can jump around to all the links. Don't print the pdf file as a hard copy. You'll use a lot of paper, and it won't be as useful.","I recently \"graduated\" to this camera, from my first, very small \"point and shoot\" digital camera.<br /><br />What I love about the camera<br />- very easy to use (but you can still control a lot of elements)<br />- great shots in low light conditions<br />- battery keeps its charge really well (so you don't have to keep charging it while on vacation for example)<br />- small, compact and light weight<br /><br />I was considering getting a much larger SLR, but a photographer friend turned me on to this camera, and I'm so glad she did - because this is perfect for me.  I'm more advanced than a beginner, but I think an SLR would be more camera than I need.  If you're in the middle of the pack like me - this is a great camera.  I highly recommend this camera.","I have had this camera for 6 months now, and bought it because of the great ratings and the fact it was called a \"point and shoot\".  I don't really understand photography that well, and this is too much camera for me!  I've had mediocre success with the auto mode....I took better pictures with cheap-o cameras than I can with this.  If you're a beginner, or not really interested in all the bells and whistles, I'd look for something easier to understand!","Ever since i have learned to use the Panasonic Lumix LX5, I rarely used any of my DSLR's. Now comes this dream of a camera that gives me more creative choices, giving the user a lot more control on the outcome of the image. Image quality is superb for a camera this size, and under different lighting conditions, from bright to dark. I have no problems with sharpness.<br /><br />No longer do I need to lug around 30 pounds of equipment, when all I need can be placed in a bag small enough to hang on my belt.","I have had this camera, the white bodied version, for about 6 months as of this writing. I'll say that, at its current street price of about $300US, it's a steal and about the best compact camera under $600 you can find. In some ways, it's the best you'll find up to about $1000 depending on which criteria are important to you.<br /><br />Different people are looking for different things in a camera, aside from merely its ability to shoot photographs reliably. Is this camera weatherproof? No. Fit in jeans pants pocket? No. Interchangeable lenses? No. Want to blow photos up to 6 foot by 9 foot poster sized images? Ehhh... not the best choice. Need wifi capability? No.  Need to be able to capture that 4 inch creature on your safari that sits 300 feet high in the trees? Not with the built-in lens (The lens offers incredible wide-angle and closeup ability, but not great at pulling in far objects via a strong zoom).  Okay, you get the idea?<br /><br />However, if you're looking for a relatively light, smallish camera which can take astonishingly vibrant photos, can take great photos in low light light without flash, can get great \"bokah\" (the ability to have the foreground be in focus while the background is way out of focus -- great for portraits and closeups) due to its astonishing 1.4 aperture Leica zoom lens, this is a fantastic camera. The LX7 is great for relative beginners because it takes fantastic photos even in its auto settings. But this camera has the manual operation and adjustability that professionals and serious amateurs love.<br /><br />There are people out there, sometimes known as pixel peepers, who seek larger and larger sensors in smaller and smaller packages, and focus a great extent on the number of megapixels on a camera. This can be a mistake. Why? Because the camera's designers don't always assign the pixels to do what they really should do to take the best pictures. Pixels, the receptors on the sensor, can be individually assigned to do one of two things but not both-- absorb light and color, or detailed information of the scene. Designers have to decide the number on a sensor to do one thing and the remaining ones to do the other.<br /><br />A really tiny sensor could have, in one extreme, all pixels assigned to interpreting light and color. This would make for a richer, more dynamic shot, and able to do well in low light, but would leave a blurry image with little detail of the actual subject. The other extreme, having the pixels focus on detail, would leave a more detailed image with its ability to blow up the final image to larger sizes, but colors and dynamics would be washed out and the camera would have little ability to take photos in low light. Pumping up contrast and color after the fact is not all that satisfactory because you're adding artifacts which just aren't there in the original shot.<br /><br />So a solution could be to have a massive sized sensor with lots of pixels assigned to detail and lots of pixels assigned to color and light. Right, but that requires a BIG camera, such as a DSLR or larger (You might be aware of those 5\"x8\" film cameras - those took amazingly detailed and rich shots). But now you want a compact camera, easy to tote around that is not heavy. Okay, so you'll need to compromise with a sensor size that will do well enough in most areas, without compromising too much in any area. Panasonic has done it brilliantly here, better than in ANY of their other compact cameras, even better in certain situations than in a the vaunted Sony RX100 compact camera, with its larger sensor.<br /><br />Some will look at a 10MP camera like this initially and think that I could buy more megapixels for less money. But more megapixels on a smaller sensor (and the LX7's sensor is larger than most compact cameras and much larger than smartphone cameras) means that most of those megapixels are being devoted to detail, not color and light. If a photo is bereft of color finesse, richness and dynamics, it lacks much life. This same sensor size has been used on cameras that render up to 16 megapixels. But Panasonic knew that richness and life in a photo is likely important to the more serious amateur and professional photographers out there. The downside is that you won't be able to blow up photos beyond perhaps 11x14\" images without seeing some relative lack of sharpness. But the images will be much more rich. Furthermore, that ability to take in low light (because more of the sensor is devoted to light and color sensitivity) along with the fantastic 1.4 aperture Leica lens allows you to take low light and night photography often without the use of a flash.<br /><br />While this camera is over one year old in terms of its release, Panasonic's more recent LF1 has a different set of priorities. The same sensor sized camera, it devotes more of them to detail (12MP on the LF1). The lens is slower, so the camera is not as good in low light. The zoom lens is stronger on the zoom end, but it's not as sharp. The LF1 is truly pocketable, able to fit in jeans pocket if necessary. It has a built-in, albeit a weak one, electronic viewfinder -- what you see is what you get. The LX7, on the other hand, offers as an added accessory a really good electronic viewfinder for those who prefer to compose through one as opposed to using the very good LCD. I do find myself using the LVF2 electronic viewfinder on my LX7 as I feel I am closer to the composition (I like getting artsy fartsy with the camera sometimes).<br /><br />Finally, there are physical limitations with regard to sensor size and camera size. The larger the sensor, the larger the lens needs to be in order to allow the all of the light to hit the whole sensor. The Sony RX100 indeed has a larger sensor in a smaller camera than the LX7. But there are situations where the LX7 can, from comparisons I have read, take better photos in lower light, not to mention that the edge to edge sharpness of the LX7's lens is supposed to better than the one on the RX100. So perhaps in the middle of the day in bright sunlight (the easiest situation for a camera to work), you'll be able to blow up the images from the RX100 larger than the ones from the LX7 because the former has a larger sensor. But the RX100 is not a better camera in all situations.<br /><br />But the RX100 goes for about $550 right now. And the RX100II goes for $700. The LX7 is going for $300. See why this camera is such a bargain? For the same $300 you can still get a 2-year old design Panasonic 4:3 sensor size camera (larger than the LX7's) with interchangeable lens ability. But its zoom starts at 3.5 aperture at its widest. Again, the LX7's lens starts at 1.4, MUCH wider. Look up individual Leica 1.4 lenses and you'll see that they go for $1000 and up. To get a 1.4 Leica quality lens in a $300 camera that is as easy to use (though the included digital manual is not very good at explaining the more intricate aspects to the camera -- get the White book guide instead.) is ridiculously great. This camera is an amazing achievement for Panasonic.<br /><br />Taking its limitations into account as a camera which is not a be-all, end-all for all users, Panasonic has created a camera which allows for some astonishingly great photos in a compact size. It's a well-built, solid camera, to boot (nothing cheap feeling about it, except perhaps for the plastic battery door, but minor quibble).  Forget about megapixel numbers. This thing takes fantastic photos!<br /><br />A further thought:<br /><br />Video quality from this camera is surprisingly really good, far better than what I get from my Galaxy S3 smartphone. I'm sure that has to do with both the quality of the lens as well as the camera's built-in sophisticated digital processing - something that also makes the standard JPEG still files top notch.","I am not an expert photographer but I can recognize crystal clear photos when I see them. I bought this based on good reviews in Consumer and on Amazon. I agree with them that this is a quality camera with an excellent lens. It takes vastly better shots than previous, more basic cameras. In short, this is a great camera!","Whats all the complaining about the lens cap about? It appears most people have only used point and shoot with the plastic shutters over the lens. Those things are the most likely to need repaired of any part of the camera, that came from a sales person at a camera store in a large city close to here. Real cameras use lens caps. The LX7 is a fine camera and all these long reviews comparing camera A to camera B , bitching about this and that is so boring and useless. So what if there are small differences, if you enjoy what you have BE HAPPY. Cameras used to be optical instruments , nowdays they are more electronic appliances.  Just think, the LX7 will be replaced soon along with every other toy and all you over active Amazon reviewers will have to do your thing all over again. OH YEAH , I do own a LX7 and i like it. Long live film, anyone remember that? Me Mongo, i have spoken!","I purchased the Lumix for work on film sets.  I needed a camera that could handle low-light situations and take quality photos while still being small enough to fit on my tool belt.  This camera fits the bill perfectly.  Whether I need to photograph a set for my portfolio, or I'm taking continuity shots from the monitor, it performs perfectly.  I also love the battery life, often going a couple of (12) hour days without having to charge up.<br /><br />The shooting speed, size, and range of options make this a great camera for people who need a semi-pro compact or to capture everyday moments.  I highly recommend it.","After years of lugging around a heavy Pentax DSLR, with boulder-like lenses, I decided: enough. I'm not Ansel Adams. I'm a casual vacation photographer. Do I really want to have to carry another heavy bag through airport security?  After scanning lots of reviews -- from CNET, dpreview, and others, including Amazon—I decided to trade in my big DSLR for this Lumix LX7.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Everything you've heard is true: this little sucker delivers. Outstanding glass (it's Leica, after all), superb user interface, excellent portability. And the results?  Jaw-dropping.  The camera excels at macro—some shots of Christmas ornaments this year could be a Christmas card next year—and it's easy to achieve the pleasing \"blurred background\" or \"bokeh\" on many snapshots, thanks to the fast 1.4 lens. This little baby drinks in so much light, I haven't even tried (or needed) to use the flash.  It's just that good.<br /><br />I wish the lens were a little longer—3.8x is on the skimpy side—but if you learn how to use your feet, and how to crop and enlarge on your computer, you'll be pleased.<br /><br />And, as someone else has mentioned, use this video to get more oomph from the camera:<br /><br /> [...]<br /><br />I'm a happy camper.  Take time to learn your way around this camera, and understand its considerable strengths and modest limitations, and you won't be disappointed.","My research paid off!  This camera compares with $800 dollar cameras. It has features that $1300 cameras don't have. I was choosing amongst 6 different cameras that I thought were comparable point and shoot models.  Not often that the least expensive model gets my attention, but this camera is a blast to use.  There may be a feature or two that was missing, but it was hard to pass up the lens of this camera, probably best in its class.  Brightest, meaning fastest lens, Leica lens.  I found a video that was excellently done on a review site for this camera.  It stated it very clearly, that using the intellligent auto mode was the worse thing you could do with this camera, taking indoor shots that were not desirable.  The video shows you how to set up this camera properly, with a one time setup, taking advantage of the fast lens eliminating picture blur and eliminating any red eye as well because you rarely need to use the flash and shutter speed is much faster if set up properly.  The macro mode is stunning, best in class easily.  I followed the video easily with a one time setup and now my wife can shoot this camera like a pro and she doesn't even have to access the menu.  After this one time setup, I don't know if there is an easier camera to use.  Here is the website address to this video:  [...]","This is our second Panasonic Lumix and we are very happy with it.  This camera takes great pictures and is easy to operate.  It has lots of features as well as being a great point and shoot.  We take lots of pictures of the grandkids and needed a camera with a quick shutter speed so we don't miss a shot.  We have own this camera for about a month now and it has met our expectations.","Awesome camera, purchased after reading the review that this is really a Leica disguised as a cheaper camera.  Don't fool yourselves,  it looks like a Leica, but it definitely doesn't take photos like one.  It is however, a great backup camera.","I was always a big fan of the Lumix line and have been holding out to make this next purchase last a while. I knew exactly what I was buying, so the limits of this camera was well understood. This camera went on vacation with me and it has met if not exceeded my expectations. Near instantaneous picture taking and in camera picture adjustments makes this a must have for enthusiasts that do not want to lug a DSLR around with them. There is a whole lot more to learn about this camera. I look forward to mastering the LX-7 and making everyone envious of my shots!","If you need a camera to take family photos, this is basically all the camera you need. It's great for a trip camera too since it is fairly small and light. It has a huge lens f1.4 and you don't need to use the flash light unless you are shooting in a very dark place. I always feel flash light are too harsh and produce unnatural photos. I have a very good DSLR, two three fourth cameras, but this is my favorite camera now.<br />I only wish the flash light can be a bounce flash as Sony RX100, Panasonic GX1 or Olympus EPL1. Other than that, it is a perfect little camera.<br />BTW, I never feel the sensor size really affect the photo quality...I know the theory, the bigger the sensor the better, but I think the LX7 strike the perfect balance between sensor size, fast lens and camera size.<br />Highly recommend!","I will not write as to the quality of the camera but I want to address the repair center. After the battery died abruptly, I was not sure if it was the charger, the battery or the camera itself that was defective. I followed all directions and sent the camera in with extensive notes. After almost 3 months I received the camera back with no paperwork, no comments on what they detected and no comments on what was fixed or not. In calling I was given a reason that made no sense for the repair. Also I had a wrist strap attached that went missing, I will find out in the future if that will be returned. In sending in my camera that was 5 months old, I was required to open a repair order online which never gave any updates,  even if the camera was received.  I believe a company is as good as their repair center and customer service and both failed in this case. Just an FYI for the future, again I am NOT rating the camera.<br />***UPDATE***  FYI,  my camera again will not charge and luckily I saved all th original repair order info.  I was able to call and find out that the charger was defective (if that's the truth) so I'm ordering another charger and battery. Of course it was out of warranty by 2 months (from AX) so I hope to be up and snapping soon.<br />For all that don't appreciate my review you need to think that you want to learn all aspects of said camera and a poor repair center is worthy of the review process.  This is my 2nd Panasonic. My 1st point and shoot was a work horse,  the FX 7 which is still clicking at 37, 000 plus pictures taken. Using Panasonic' s repair center was new to me and disappointing.<br />I hope you will see that all aspects of the camera must be reviewed.  STILL LOVE MY LX7 just wish it was as dependable as my first Panasonic.<br />Thanks for reading and understanding my review.","I was tired of carrying my Canon 60D with an 18-200 lens and wanted a small camera that would fit in my handbag. This camera was highly recommended to me by a camera garu and I'm so glad I made the purchase. It takes beautiful pictures and fits perfectly in my handbag. Once I learn to use all the features, I'll be an even more valuable purchase for me.","Its a nice point and shoot camera. Very fast to open and excellent in low light. It's replace my dead Sony HX9-V and it's far better, except for the zoom.","I love my new camera.  But the batteries are hard to find.  Even the Panasonic co does not have them like in their manual or on their website.  I found one battery on eBay.. ..  but only one.","I tried to find a camera to be able to take dslr like pictures or at night for a decent price ( not more than 400) .<br />This one does the job perfectly and even more, i am suprised of the results. I ve heard a lot about the rx100 or other x20 but less about this one.<br />So when i saw the nice portraits with beautiful bokeh i am able to do now, the nice indoor pictures ( without flash),  i can say that for the price ( less than 300 )it is amazing. This is the best lens on a compact amera actualy ( 1.4 wide angle to 2.3 at 90mm ) and for me the best choice .","This camera is a gem. I primarily use it for videos and quick snapshots. Quality of this camera is awesome. Some nice shots @ F1.4. The aperture ring is a nice addition - easy to set aperture. might be a bit confusing since the lens has variable minimum aperture across the range. Overall - a very good second camera for DSLR users as well as very good camera for people who want to explore the creative side of photography without spending much.<br /><br />Almost forgot - the Macro mode really is good - with shallow DOF @ 1.4 - the macro shots really pop out.","This is an absolutely awesome camera. We used it in Europe and took beautiful photos that look like postcards. We even blew one up to 16\" X 20\" canvas print.<br /><br />A truly easy and logical point and shoot with professional features! We love the retro look paired with a baseball glove colored retro case.","This camera is quite amazing. Finally, a small pocket size camera with a moderate zoom range that lets plenty of light in from wide angle to full zoom. This is a great camera for architectural shots as you don't have to use a flash, even in low light and the image quality is excellent with low noise.","Love this camera ! Great photo quality, amazing video capture. Everything about this camera is awesome, definitely recommended anyone who wants a point and shoot camera that is high tier.","This has been a great camera!  The control on it are amazing, it gives you every option you could want on a point and shoot and then some.  The camera itself can be tricky to master but it comes with a DVD that helps you out on all the hidden details.  The clarity of the images is astounding!  I was debating between this and the S110 and decided to go with this one simply because of the clarity and the large aperture.  I'm not disappointed at all!  Just be aware that there is no automatic lens cap on this camera, as long as you know that, there shouldn't be any surprises.  The only thing that could be a potential problem is that the battery door is a little flimsy, but I think it will hold up for the long haul.","I bought this camera specifically for interior shots of European churches.  My aim was to use natural light even in the most challenging  circumstances.  The camera did extremely well.  Perhaps too well, as some of the finished shots looked brighter than the original scenes looked to the naked eye. The somewhat small sensor was not a handicap as the f1.4 lens kept the shutter speeds fast enough to come away with great shots.  Some people may prefer a more powerful zoom for general outdoor shots, but for dim lighting this camera does a great job.","Excellent Camera... I bought 2, and my friends bought 5.  Why?  It's so good which will give perfect photo in 99% of scenarios.  I have a 3lb Nikon D300 and it is just too heavy to carry on the neck.  Now, I'm really enjoy this one on my Europe vacation.  The fast lens, f1.4, can handle all the night shoot.  Wide angle are perfect to capture scenic shoots.  I use it to capture church group photo with 100+ people, and it comes good in large print, 20\"x8\".  The only drawback is... it's 1.5 year old model.  I hope next one will be a full frame camera, but you will not see the price as low as this.  It's definitely a must-buy for me.","This camera blew me away. I expected a good pocketable (in a leather jacket anyhow) replacement for my older camera - but there's no comparison.  Lightning-fast startup, amazing low-light performance, and really nice pictures.<br /><br />What you give up - Long zoom range<br />What you get - Great zone focusing, stunning low-light performance, really nice pictures.<br /><br />I'm sure you could spend the day comparing this to other cameras - but every professional photographer to whom I've shown it has said the same thing - \"I've gotta get one - that's the perfect non-professional camera.\"","The lx7 is excellent!  I would like more zoom, but understand that is the price you pay for a very sharp lens.  Pictures are razor sharp and the intelligent exposure is spot on.  Fantastic!  Have tried the manual settings but the automatic exposure is just as good. One annoyance is that the lens cap must come off even I only want to review pictures that are on the camera.  It is hard to seen the LCD screen in bright light, would have liked and built in optical view finder, but the optional view finder is so expensive and bulky have decided not to go for it.  All of the similar cameras have a few pros and cons, so i find the lx7 a good compromise.","This is a great carry around camera! It's compact enough to throw in a bag (not pocketable though) and the controls are very intuituve and easy to use. I tend to shoot in A mode so, the aperture ring is perfect for my style. The image quality is excellent and it performs well in low light. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and this is my go to camera when I need a compact set up.","This little camera is a real work horse. For a point and shoot, it provides an amazing amount of flexibility. The best features to my way of thinking is the external aperture settings which can be done quickly and easily. The super fast 1.4 lens speed allows pictures to be taken in very low light situations without having to use a flash. In addition auto focus in macro makes this and ideal camera for real close up photography. Quality photos are a snap with the Leica optics; all in all this is one fine camera.","I was looking for a smaller camera to supplement my Micro 4/3 system. I could not decide between the 10M pixel LX7 and the 20M pixel Sony RX-100. So, I got both to try. Ended keeping (and loving) the LX7. Ended up not liking (and selling) the RX-100,<br /><br />I purchased the LX7 with the excellent LVF-2 viewfinder. (As much as I have tried, for me, relying on the rear screen of a camera is a very poor substitute for having a first-class eye level viewfinder.)<br /><br />This is a really engaging camera to use. I am using it much more than I thought I would.<br /><br />I particularly like having the lens aperture and the aspect ratio control on the rings around the lens. (Unlike most digital cameras, the LX7 maximizes the available sensor real estate for each aspect ratio rather than cropping everything down from the native 4:3 ratio. So, you do find yourself changing the aspect ratio to suit the particular picture you are taking.)<br /><br />Image quality is much better than I expected from a small 10 M pixel sensor. Actually, surprisingly good.<br /><br />I got better fine detail resolution from the Sony RX-100, but the Sony was fiddlely to use and the Sony JPEG colors were simply too cool — something I was never able to properly correct in post processing. When I compared pics of the same subject side-by-side, I always preferred the pics from the LX7.<br /><br />I greatly preferred to use the LX7, and the LX7 plus finder cost less than the RX-100.<br /><br />I ended up never using the RX-100. So I sold it — and continue to use the LX7 on a regular basis.","Small, compact, and beautiful<br />I have a Nikion D5100 and was looking for a second and small camera<br />the batterry could be better","I am not a photographer, and I don't have much patience for cameras that are more complicated than just \"point and shoot.\"  I just realized, when I was pregnant with our first child, that all of the other point-and-shoot cameras we owned took blurry pictures in low light... and I could never find a way to fix it.  I wanted something that would take clear pictures in all levels of light, but also be easy enough to use that we could grab it and capture the quick little moments that happen with a baby.<br /><br />This camera has been PERFECT.  The image quality is amazing in low-light... so good that we almost never even need a flash.  Which is a big plus with a newborn :-)  I couldn't be happier with this camera!","I'm having fun with this camera. The display is sharp and clear.  It is fast electrically.  The pictures are sharp.  I have no problem with the lens cap that some have complained about.  Watch out for after market ones as they let a lot of dust in.  I'd like a 10X zoom but will live without it for the fast lens.  I have other cameras that will handle that task anyway.  I got the DMW-LVF2 electronic viewfinder which is great for eyes like mine that use close up lenses.  I use the pair together all the time now.  The camera fits in my pants pocket at least temporarily, although I wouldn't want to carry it there all day.  There is not much separation between the two shutter release steps.  I have to touch the shutter release very lightly to focus, then press fully to snap the picture.  Sometimes it takes the picture before I'm ready but I'll get used to it.  I recommend it and would buy it again.  I have an assortment of pro and pocket camera equipment and have been taking pictures over 50 years so this is an addition to my tools and not a replacement for everything.  It is great for indoors and low light-no flash photos.","Great camera. A big step up in physical quality and performance from your basic point and shoots. Much better low light performance than cheaper compacts. Feels well made, like a \"real camera,\" not a toy, and makes a nice backup or pocket camera for owners of DSLRs. Only downsides are it's a little bigger than some others: it's a coat-pocket camera not a pants-pocket camera.","As advertised: sharp and fast; the EVF works for most days and almost works in bright sun ( and hence better than my otherwise great Canon S95) and is worth the additional price.  Camera is small and comes close to my Canon D 40.  And of course it is light enough to carry everywhere everyday.  The total  package...S 95 for smallest, Lumix for versatility and Canon D 40 for the big jobs.  Good system Amazon.","I selected this camera as a pocket-able backup to my DSLR primarily due to its excellent lens, class leading auto mode, and its price (currently around $300).<br /><br />If this was my only camera and I wanted to stay with something pocket-able, I would have seriously considered Sony RX-100-II  (at around $700) due to its large sensor and class leading low light performance. However, for those occasions that a low light performance is of highest priority (i.e. in a museum) I would recommend investing the $400 difference in a fast prime lens (50mm f1.4) for a DSLR or outright buy an entry level DSLR with kit lens (Nikon D3100 or Canon T3).","It is an incredible camera that I use almost exclusively. It is superior to my LX3 which still works well and is so much more convenient than my Nikon D5100 DSLR. One thing that I found by chance is that the panorama range can be selected by merely stopping rotating the camera where you want it to end.","This is a great camera and I'm glad I purchased it! It is small camera that you can easily carry with you and it takes great pics. The camera lens is amazing! I feel like a photographer when I look at the pictures that I have taken with the Panasonic Lumix.","Excellent!  I am just starting to use it... I think this is one of the<br />best LUMIX LX series Camera.<br />Amazing that you can do so many thing with tiny camera.","I looked around for days and weeks to find my next perfect camera... After I quit pro photography, I wanted to have something that I can satisfy my urges to take good photos from time to time... The things I look for a camera usually clear sharp images, hot shoe to be able to use my remote trigger if I need to use strobes sometimes... and fast lens. I found all that in LX7, bar-none the best camera around for the price vs. features and image/built quality! It's not a plastic toy, that's for sure.<br /><br />Let me tell you something... if a camera gets its biggest complain from it's \"hanging\" lens cap, that should say a lot about the overall quality of it.<br /><br />Here are the complains about this camera that I read here and other places...<br />1-Lens cap... thank God for the Auto Lens Cover (I got one too), but I would NOT have any complains using the cap came with it... just like on DSLR cameras.<br />2-Sensor size... Really? With F1.4 lens, I would give a rat's rear end for the sensor size... It gives perfect results and that counts for me the most.<br />3-Slow zoom in/out... Ok, go somewhere else then. It sure is slow and I am not making an Oscar winning movie with it... so I don't really care. Again, fast... I mean FAST focusing just makes up that \"slow\" zooming!!!<br />4-No viewfinder! Sold separately... I confess, I tried to get closer to this camera a few times, thinking there is one... and little weird to take photos looking at the LCD screen, but not a big deal!<br />5-Only 24-90mm zoom! Again... really? some of the compact cameras sold more than $1K have prime lenses, either 35mm, 50mm... etc. which, none of them as fast as F1.4.<br /><br />There are more complains, but they are there practically just to complain about something, nothing else.<br /><br />So, in short... If you are/were a pro photographer... or not, and want a camera that will get you perfect photos, with or without total manual settings... this is your machine. Check out my sample pictures. I finally uploaded some that this camera deserves.<br /><br />PS: Video quality is superb... I and really LOVE the fast recording option which shows slow motion actions... pretty cool :)","Love the Panasonic Lumix great camera and small enough to carry around in purse.  Takes great pictures has issues with light coming from outside and around.","Got this after being disappointed with the color on a canon powershot. I'd had an earlier leica model, and this one did not disappoint. The color is just fantastic. Even on foggy/cloudy days, exposure is spot on with the automatic setting. Even shooting into the sun I get some good, creative shots, whereas a lesser camera would wash out or have white balance issues.","I decided I did not want to take my full size DSLR on long motorcycle ride thru Latin America.  After much research I decided the Panasonic LX-7I was the perfect choice!  With its 7X zoom and full featured functionality, this camera will still fit easily into a jacket pocket.<br /><br />Numerous people have written excellent reviews full of technical facts about this camera-not gonna do that.  I will say that in typical Lumix fashion, images are sharp, vivid and dynamic throughout the range of the camera.  I am not a professional photographer, but the \"oh wow!\" factor is here, especially with the camera's Zeiss glass and ability to use full manual controls.<br /><br />Battery life is excellent; I was able to shoot over 400 images a day before needing to recharge.  Ergonomically, this unit fit my large hands (size ten gloves) very well; I never felt in danger of dropping it during ordinary handling.  In addition, I found the controls to be laid out logically.  I also liked the aperture ring for easy aperture priority shooting.<br /><br />The only possible nit could be the camera's ability to handle humidity and moisture…In my experience this was NOT an issue.  My LX-7 lived in a motorcycle tank bag for six weeks.  I dodged two hurricanes and shot hundreds of images on the  hot and muggy beaches of southern Mexico.  I never had a problem-now I'm back and the LX-7 continues to operate reliably and smoothly.<br /><br />There are many \"advanced\" digital cameras out there, so do your research.  The Sony RX series was a contender, as was the Canon G15.  For me, the LX-7, with its full suite of manual controls and preset options was a fabulous choice, at half the price of the Sony.  Feel free to email me if you have specific questions about the LX-7-happy to help as best I can!","This is an awesome camera. It has a lot of fun features and is easy to learn. It has an awesome lens. The best camera I have ever owned. It is definitely worth the price.","it was a great camera for the price with features that i like. I haven't seen any other camera for this price with the slow motion feature at hd. and the quality of the normal picture and video footage is excellent.","Very great camera! It fit my hand very well and the functions are easy to use.Besides, the color is totally great.","Fast shooter, amazing low light lens on par with my EOS DSLR fixed lenses (25 and 50 mm). Don't expect L series quality for your pictures, but the Lumix LX7 can definitely pull a few punches against a DSLR at a fraction of the weight and volume.","I wasn't sure which camera to purchase between the canon s110, the nikon p330, and the Lumix LX7. I first purchased the canon s110, but wasn't too thrilled, so I exchanged it for the nikon p330, which I actually liked a bit better. Both cameras were ok, but not quite what I was looking for. I decided to return the nikon and purchase the Lumix LX7. I am happy I made this final purchase and didn't settle for either of the other two cameras. It takes great photos and has outstanding features, which make adjustments quick and easy. I have had the camera for about 2 months now and I have no complaints. This is a great buy!","I would love to give this camera 5 stars.  It is solidly built and feels good in the hand.  The photos are excellent and I'm sure that if you knew what you were doing you could take some amazing shots with it.  This is a really good little camera for the price.  I prefer it to my more expensive Nikon for taking photos.  I am no photographer so I struggle with the settings.  What I am frustrated with are some of the compatibility issues for movies.  It takes really nice video.  Better than my Sony movie camera which is ancient granted but for a compact sized camera the movie quality is really nice.  However......I have a brand new MacBook Pro.  A very nice computer.  Unfortunately my very nice camera and my very nice computer hate each other!!!!  They aren't speaking at all.  My computer pretends as if my camera doesn't exist.  It completely ignores the files of movies that I have taken.  I looked into it and apparently Mac doesn't recognize AVCHD and the Panasonic insists that this is the way to go.  I downloaded and paid for a AVCHD converter.  I had never heard of this before but figured I would need this to convert the files in my camera.  The program looks simple enough.  Drag and drop file to convert it.  That would be swell if the Mac actually recognized the file.  Now I am no computer psychologist but these two just really don't seem to want to get along.  No nasty messages about compatibility.  It's just a flat out refusal to recognize the others existence.  My Lumix did have a better relationship with my old Mac but that went kaput.  It wasn't an easy relationship but at least the would communicate with a translator.  It's very frustrating to have all these lovely movies on a camera that you can't use.  It may be possible that there is a way around this if you are more camera and computer savy.  If you aren't you may want to wait and see if they decide to make this more compatible with your Mac.","I love this camera. Great pictures and great value. I have had the camera for about a year with no problems and have taken many very special, beautiful photos with it. I highly recommend the electronic viewfinder accessory which works wonderfully with the camera. Overall, a great value.","This camera excels in low light, and takes excellent indoor photographs with no flash. I've got some lovely pictures with it. Outdoors, it's nothing particularly special, and the short (and slow!) zoom is a bit of a handicap -- on a trip to the zoo, I really felt the lack of zoom.<br /><br />Portability-wise, the LX7 is fairly large for a compact, but does fit in my man-sized trouser pockets or a jacket; you may want a hip case for it, or to slip it into a purse.<br /><br />Having bought this camera as a complement to my iPhone (as it has a little zoom, and indoor pictures that best any cellphone and most compact cameras handily), I'm very happy indeed. If this will be your only camera, maybe consider a super zoom compact.","Still playing with it...don't like the night/low light setting (there's hesitation, even with the flash on) the photos come out to orange. Again, must use a little more to determine if we will keep it.","This is the best camera for my needs!  Great image quality for landscapes and buildings; amazing low-light pictures (really, amazing hand-held night shot mode); lots of creative modes or just put it on i-automatic and trust the shot will be good; don't miss an action shot with up to 11 frames / second - wow that's so fast I actually use just 5 FPS most of the time; It has a few high end features that I don't use like RAW mode and the flash hot-shoe;  I've used it indoors (no flash as I don't like flash shots), in a dark church or at birthday parties indoors with the kids for great results; most impressive results so far were night-time action in shutter priority mode to freeze the action and it still came through with its fast lens and 1600 ISO - and the images were good!; the only downside is the 3x zoom, but that's a trade-off for the pocketable size, large sensor, and cost-savings of not buying multiple lenses.  Really a great handy, usable, versatile camera with good battery life, ability to stick on a UV lens protector (big plus for me), not heavy so it comes along everywhere.  Oh, and great image quality all at an affordable price.  The aperture ring is handy as I use A-priority mode about half the time; the built in ND is awesome if you're experienced enough to know when to use it; I don't get much value from the aspect ratios as I crop afterward anyway; video is good but I don't use it much; and did I mention it's small enough that you'll actually bring it along and not mind the weight?  Ok, I've missed the viewfinder a couple of times in bright sun, but you can't have everything.  My next camera could be a GF5 for it's four thirds sensor;  as a prior Canon die-hard fan, I am so glad I took the plunge and tried a Panasonic; never looking back.","I've owned many film and digital point and shoot cameras over the years.  I've coveted the Lumix LX series for years and finally decided to take the plunge.  I'm so happy that I did!!<br /><br />I've always had issues with point and shoots since I generally shoot dSLRs or micro four thirds cameras.  Comparatively, the point and shoots have terrible image quality (which is pretty normal for a point and shoot), have frustrating shutter lag (like the Canon G9 I owned), or painfully low res LCD screens (like the Casio P&S's I've owned).  They can also have issues with being too bulky (like the Canon G series), or have a very slow lens that looks really soft when fully zoomed in.  In general, I'd rather pay 2x-4x the price of a good P&S to get a better camera.<br /><br />The LX7 is not perfect but it's far and away the best point and shoot I've ever owned.  The LCD is good enough to give you a reasonable idea of the quality of your photos, so if there is something wonky, you can correct it right away.  This was NOT the case with most of the early P&S digitals, and even some of the newer ones, like our Casio EX-FH100, which was otherwise a good camera but the LCD was so horrible you'd think you had taken horrible pictures because the screen didn't do them justice.  It's got pretty good response when pressing the release button and very little lag between shots.  So when I take snapshots of my toddler, my nieces and nephews, pets, or any rapidly moving subject, this camera does a very decent job of capturing the photo when you intend to.  It's not the smallest point and shoot, but it is far less bulky than most high end point and shoots.  The lens does not fully retract into the body, so it is a bit thick for a P&S.  But compared to the Canon G series (or similar) this is very reasonably sized.<br /><br />Image quality is about as good as I've seen on a camera of this size and price.  It takes VERY nice photos.  I've used P&S cameras that can't seem to decide where to focus, or they are unpredictable in how they will determine the correct exposure, so on those other cameras I'd have lots of underexposed or overexposed shots.  Not so with this camera.  It does a fantastic job with focus and exposure.<br /><br />The lens is bright and fast, which is FANTASTIC for taking snapshots indoors.  Makes it easy to get a good shot even if the light is less than ideal.  The only downside with the lens is that it only zooms to 3.4x, which makes it tough to photograph more distant subjects.  That said, unless you use this camera for specialized shooting, it's probably a reasonable tradeoff for most people.  The problem with reduced zoom is also mitigated by the high image quality.  Even if you can't zoom in that well, you can take the digital image and crop it significantly without too much loss in quality.  The lens also has a removable cap, which I think is not ideal, but otherwise not a real biggie for me.<br /><br />Overall I can highly recommend this camera.  I'm sure enjoying it!","4 starts because LX-7 has motion picture recording time limit 29min 59sec, I don`t know why Panasonic cameras has this recording limit","But why all the file formats that can't be opened in Photoshop? RW2? DNG? Should provide on the CD a reader for these.","The camera is easy to use and is exceptional in capturing details in images. I am not a professional photographer, but I am a blogger and I frequently take pictures of food, nature and craft projects. I really appreciate the image quality that this camera provides and how it performs indoors and in low light. I have an older sony digital camera and I actually have preferred using the iPhone over the quality of my older camera, but this guy blows them both out of the water. Also, if you plan on taking pictures of moving subjects it does well. I took a great number of pictures of my pets to learn how to use the camera and a few of the images look like something you'd see in a magazine. Excellent quality with minimal effort.<br /><br />You do need to buy an additional memory card. Max capacity for images is something like 15-20 images.<br /><br />I gave this product 4 stars because included in the price are photo imaging software and raw data software which are NOT compatible with apple products even though the website states MAC compatible. It took me over an hour to get a hold of someone from Panasonic to inquire as to what I would need to do to obtain the software, but apparently in the fine print the \"MAC compatible\" only applies to the camera. The software is useless if you don't own windows and if you want something more the iPhoto you will have to purchase it at an additional cost.<br /><br />I am still learning about the camera and its many, many features and I'm nothing but impressed with the quality and ease of the camera.","It's got everything I am looking for in a compact camera. Fast shutter speed, phenomenal clarity and color, and ease of use.<br />Pictures look spectacular......very professional looking.<br />If only it had wifi connection, that would make it the perfect camera for me.<br />My brother bought the same one, and he couldn't say enough good things about it.","For me, having gifted a large bag with two bodies and five lenses and extension tubes and....to my daughter and her husband---leave to them to fight over who gets to use which lens--I am firmly committed to non-interchangeable lens POS quality cameras. I find that I can do 99% of what I do as well or better with a quality camera like this. Got it on a WED, then TH, FR, SA I shot over 500 shots at a local fall festival. Over 230 are posted online and I have received hundreds of thank you's and compliments. Got and used WASABI batteries (reviewed here) and they did come in handy, but this camera takes superb shots, and LOTS of them on one charge from either the Panasonic or the Wasabi battery. Has hot shoe for external flash (my next purchase) and the ability to use very intelligent controls to go manual/creative to auto very quickly and accurately. LOVE IT. Lens (24mm wide angle) is awesome.<br />I love everything about this camera. And if you look at other reviews I do have a good basis for comparison in what I own and use.","Great lens. Nifty gyroscope lets you see if photo is level. Lots of enhancements. Takes time to learn them all. Would reccommend the camera to a friend.","A camera is only useful if you actually take pictures with it.  As much as I love my big Nikon, I often leave it home  because it's just too big and heavy.  This little camera is just what I need:  small and light, it's easy to carry everywhere, it takes great pictures and it has all the features you expect on a big SLR.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the aperture only closes down to f8 and I would have hoped that it would go down at least f16 or f22 on a camera of this quality. Otherwise, the f1.4 lens is awsome and when wide open it lets you soften backgrounds in ways that almost no other point and shoot camera can do. It also suffers from the lack of a cable release attachment but that at least can be fixed with a third party accessory.  Other than these flaws slight flaws this camera is a gem and I love it.","Quality of the pixels and the focus rate as well as coloring isn't as good for the price. I would only buy it for its weight and lens. But the results were so so vs the price. Not too alluring.","just what I was expecting, great camera! The 1.4 aperture can't be beaten, RAW images and a complete manual mode let me use this image for short trips or just to carry around everyday so I don't miss any image in my everyday life","This camera fit my expectation. Never need DSLR camera.  Really great camera, with super Leica lens, replaced my previously owned Lumix DMC-ZS10.","A very high quality point and shoot.  I love the ability to go full manual with a camera I can put into my pocket.  Great for travelling light.  Went with this vs the Sony because of the great lens, and I have zero regrets.","This is a great point-and-shoot digital camera that performs as well as an SLR with interchangeable lenses. I'm not a professional photographer, but a serious amateur. I love this camera! It's light, compact, and has a bushel of features. The price is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality product and more options than the average point-and-shoot digital camera provides.","I am photo enthusiast and used to carry around a bulky canon SLR that was causing a lot of worry specially when I was on vacation or hanging out with friends. There are some occasions when I wanted to take pictures, but could not carry an SLR.<br /><br />That is where this comes in. Spent months researching point/shoot cameras and decided on Panasonic. I am a big fan of Leica lens and love the color pallet/hue that picture bring.<br /><br />Right out of the box I was taking great pictures and although it has modest zoom, but its not a big deal for me. One little thing I found was the menu of the device to be a little off complex compared to Canon or Sony but I am sure with just a little use, anyone can pick it up.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the self retaining open/close lens cap that is cheaply available on Amazon. it is a great addon where you dont have to worry about loosing lens cap.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with this product and recommend to anyone that is looking for great pictures while using a point and shoot camera.<br /><br />PS. it takes great pictures at night too :)","The lens is the difference.  The AI actually works.  AF is fast.  Battery life- great.  I got an auto lens cover--  It is too big to drop in a pants pocket like the canon's I have, so it's not a convenient, but there is NO comparison on the quality of the pics.  Fast, clean, clear with useful zoom.","Was looking to replace my Leica D-Lux4, which I lost after using it for about 3 years.  I loved that Leica so I figured I'd replace it with the newest, improved model, the D-Lux6.  Having read all the comments over the years I thought I'd compare it to this Lumix.  I'm the type of person who would normally go for the \"better\" model, but in this case it was a no brainer.  As I compared the 2 side by side I couldn't see how it made any sense to go for the Leica as the two cameras are virtually identical.  There may be some aspect that the Leica has internally.. I read all of the reviews that compare the two and still can't pinpoint what the difference actually is, if any. As a layman, if there is a differnce, it's not compelling enough to warrant spending double the price (about an extra $400) for it.  With the Leica you do get an external software program license included (Adobe Lightroom 5) which I wouldn't use anyway... I'm talking about the difference in the hardware.<br /><br />I've heard that the Leica and Lumix are made in the same factory.  Let's put it this way... they have to be made by the same company or one would be suing the other... just look at the two side by side... same exact camera.  They just use different fonts with their markings... and the Leica has a bit smoother feel when moving the knobs, which I prefer, but not a biggie and only noticed when comparing side by side to the Lumix.  So I went for the Lumix and have been very happy with it.<br /><br />I've had the Lumix for about 3 months... the photos are fantastic. Works very similar to my old Leica D4 but the photos are better... operates faster... small things you'd expect with a \"new and improved\" model.  Assume that the Leica 6 would be also amazing (and better than my old 4)... just more expensive.<br /><br />Yes, I tollerate the same issue as I had with my Leica... having to remove the lens cap manually to shoot a photo... but I love the quality of the camera and the great photos so much that I put up with it.<br /><br />For the price, this camera is unbelievable.  In this class I feel there is no better choice.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","The LX7 was an upgrade from my Leica D-Lux 4 (Lumix LX3). The LX7 is identical in function to the Leica D-Lux 6 in glass, sensor and overall function, has a nice built-in grip - the Leica does not, and there are only slight differences in menu user interface. The Leica will appeal to those who want to pay double or more for the name and little red dot, but there is no technical justification.  Same camera. So the rest of this review is about the Lumix LX-7.<br /><br />Lumix got this so exactly right, on a camera that has seen gentle evolutionary changes previously.<br /><br />First of all, don't be bamboozled by pixel count.  Although it is billed as 10MP, those are fat sensitive pixels on a large sensor area (1:1.7).  They also evolved from a CCD to a richer, more sensitive CMOS sensor, as many manufacturers have done over the years. The picture quality is superb, even in very low light, and up to about ISO 1600.  Shot at ISO 80-200, the resulting JPEGs are grainless up to 8x10 magnification, and will make a fine 16x20 uncropped. It seems folks are selling cameras with huge MP specs and teeny sensors these days; just so much marketing vaporware. This one makes no such nonsensical lie.<br /><br />I can this a Leica-Sonic, because, make no mistake, Leica did profoundly influence the lens design.  It's not that disingenuous to call it a Vario-Summilux; Summilux is Leica branding for their f1.4 lenses costing many thousands of dollars when made in Germany for the M-Series cameras, and this is a true f1.4 lens at 24mm equivalent. At the 90mm equivalent end of the range, it's still f2.3.  Couple that with excellent anti-shake, and you have a discrete digicam for wideangle, normal and macro use which can shoot hand-held in near zero light at a half-second. It is not for telephoto-lovers, the 20x zoom cameras have more reach but nowhere near this image quality. But at the 24mm end, very little barrel distortion, sharp out to the corners, and you can focus in macro mode objects which nearly touch the lens!<br /><br />Some unique features which no one else offers:<br /><br />(1) The f1.4 lens.  Are you kidding me?  They are not.  Go find it anywhere else, except on your fixed focal length prime lens for the DSLR. It not only allows extreme low light shooting, but even lets you create shallow depth-of field for close portraits, which no other digicams can.  And if you want to do this in bright light, where the 1/4000 sec fastest shutter and ISO 80 would otherwise not allow you to use the f1.4 max aperture, it even has a built-in neutral density filter with a dedicated button, so you can still shoot wide open. Extraordinary lens.  Okay, so maybe Ernst Leitz would turn over in the casket if he ever saw the Summilux name applied to a Japanese-manufactured lens on a pocket camera, but it's a fantastic lens.<br /><br />(2) The variable aspect ratio switch - you can shoot 3:2 like traditional 35mm, 4:3 like an iPad, 16:9 if you know you are going to view on a widescreen monitor or TV, and - new for this version - even 1:1.  All those crops come out of an oversized 12MP circular image sensor, so you can crop before you shoot, not after, and maintain far more image detail. At the flip of a switch just above the lens.<br /><br />(3) The manual controls are extensive and well placed.  You can certainly shoot in iA (intelligent auto) and be hard-pressed to screw up anything, or control everything. But for manual shooters, at least use P, so that you can override white balance, focus or aperture when needed. And the manual focus mode and metering mode controls are excellent. Any time you use A or M, or override the P setting with a well-placed multi-control dial, you see the resulting aperture/shutter speed pairings instantly.<br /><br />(4) It has an aperture ring!! - While most digicams have only an f4-f8 aperture range, making manual control of aperture and shutter almost useless, this f1.4 lens has a manual aperture ring from f1.4 to f8 right on the lens barrel, so you can shoot in A mode like it was a traditional SLR. Even most modern DSLR lenses don't have one anymore.  That is a priceless feature for aperture priority shooters.<br /><br />(5) Exposure compensation.  Any serious pro camera has a bias dial, the +/- exposure control that lets you bias the auto exposure up or down in 1-stop or partial stop increments.  Go find it on an iPhone, nope.  Go find it on most prosumer digicams; it is often buried in menus.  But on the Lumix LX7, the multi-control ring lets you change it instantly, while the display shows you the plus/minus bias and and resulting aperture/shutter speed pairings, either on screen or in the viewfinder.<br /><br />No camera's meter is smart enough to correctly expose every shot without exposure bias. I use this feature with nearly every picture I take, on every camera I use.  I even use it on my Pantech Discover cell phone (sorry, Apple). But on the Lumix, it is utterly convenient and professional, an indispensable tool.<br /><br />(6) The mode dial was stiffened up over earlier versions; it will no longer move by itself in the pocket or case. And when you change it, a spinning dial on the display easily shows you the set mode (iA, A, P, M, etc) in BIG letters, so you know the mode set without removing eyes from the screen or finder.<br /><br />(7) Did I say \"finder\"?  I am a 56-year old eyeglass wearer who grew up on pro Nikons with great optical viewfinders.  While I loved my previous Leica-Sonic (the f2 lensed LX3 / D-Lux 4) for image quality and portability, I could not use it at arms length without the eyeglasses on and off like a yo-yo.  So candid and action shots were nearly impossible, just like most arm's length digicams.  So I never replaced my Nikon's normal lens or considered the Leica D-Lux 4 a true alternative. And after shooting, in bright light you couldn't see or edit what you shot, unless you hid inside someplace dark (same problem with DSLRs).<br /><br />Enter the new Leica-Sonic (Lumix LX7) with the LVF2 viewfinder. The finder, made by Olympus but marketed for Leica (EVF) and Lumix (LVF), slides into the shoe, and transforms this little digicam into a near DSLR, in some ways better. It's bright, contrasty, shows you the accurate framing, focus and exposure and all settings - everything you can see on the 3\" rear LCD.  Or not.  Flip back and forth between finder and screen with a button. Switch on and off the extra finder info with a button. Then review your just-shot picture in the finder as well. Not even my Nikons let me do this, so when you simply must verify exposure, focus or anything else outdoors, the EVF is transformative for photography. Yes, it does create some bulk, but as a tool, it is the single biggest advance in small cameras since we did away with film. Buying this accessory is essential, even if you have to carry it in a separate pocket.<br /><br />(8) Framing. My Nikons and previous Leica-Sonic had an electronic grid you could overlay on the screen when you needed to line up composition, like the lines on a large-format camera's ground glass.  It was too busy and distracting on a small screen. So this time around, Lumix replaced it with a live 'gyro', a horizon line and vertical line which move to help you keep the camera level while shooting, without getting in the way.  As with all the other display features, it is easily turned off and on with a button.<br /><br />(9) Frame Rate. I thought I had died and gone upstairs when I learned how to trick my Nikon D300 into shooting nine frames per second (fps) instead of the advertised six. It has allowed me to capture instants in time otherwise impossible. Anyone not trying out this feature is missing out on capturing something really spectacular; I've taught several students to capture sports action like pros by using high frame rate. Well, this Lumix LX7 shoots ELEVEN fps. Sorry Nikon, but the little mirror-less camera has you beat here. And with a class 10 SD card installed, it will keep up, even at full resolution.  Wow.<br /><br />Nitpick 1:  I've read many reviews panning this camera because it does not have a retractable lens cover. Rather, it has a traditional cap which you manually remove and replace, just like on a real camera, and it attaches with a small string tether to the strap lug so you don't lose it while shooting.  My response is \"Bee-Eff-Dee\". I have to uncap my Nikons to shoot them, and since their lenses interchange, the cap goes in my case or pocket while shooting.  With the Lumix, at least you always know where the cap is.  Let's face it; this is not a toy, it is a serious photographer's small camera (I will not call it a point-and-shoot, out of respect).  So if you want a retractable lens cover, go get a toy camera.  Else, deal with it.<br /><br />Nitpick2: Panasonic markets this as having a 7.5x Intelligent Zoom.  Please do not insult MY intelligence. This is a 3.8x OPTICAL zoom lens, a 24-90mm equivalent in 35mm film parlance. The fact that you can crop in from that by 'zooming' past the optical limits has little practical value.  By now, most digicam buyers get that, so Panasonic is attempting to rebrand digital zoom as something more than digital in-camera crop. But it is not a 7.5x lens, and the product title should not feature than number.  It cheapens an otherwise excellent product aimed at the prosumer market, not the K-Market.<br /><br />Nitpick3: Ken Rockwell, who has authored many fine camera reviews, has routinely panned this Leica / Lumix camera series. In his words, \"it's not a real Leica\".  Well, no kidding, Ken. It also does not cost ten thousands bucks, body alone, plus lenses at several thousand per.  But for most ordinary humans wanting professional image quality and features without a mortgage, it is all the Leica we will ever need.  And for me, I can ski with it at 50mph in my pocket, ride my bike with it in my saddle bag, and always have it handy.  I don't know anyone who would treat a Leica M9 this way.  Most of them sit locked behind glass display cabinets.  Mine makes photos.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I still keep my Nikon's 50mm f1.4 lens for fine portraiture and product photography, and to keep at least one mid-range lens for the D300. But I recently sold my Nikon's ten-year-old massive 28-70mm f2.8 pro lens, for $900, once I bought the Lumix). Why?  Because the LX7 obsoleted the Nikkor. The LX7 cost me far less in total with viewfinder, spare battery, cards, EVF, leather half-case and leather wrist strap than I sold the well-used Nikkor lens for. And because it is far more versatile and pocketable, it takes more and better pictures.<br /><br />All I use the Nikon D300 now for is for ultrawide (the 16mm fisheye and 12-24mm lenses) and telephoto (the 70-210mm f2.8) shooting. For everything else, the LX7 with the EVF is now this professional photographer's primary camera.<br /><br />Just don't call it a point-and-shoot. You will insult it.<br /><br />Bob Reed / Alpine Images","I have owned mine for a couple of months and I'm surprised at how much I really like this camera.  Used to larger format DSLRS and medium format film cameras,  I am amazed at the quality of the LX7's images. I have a series of 12X18 prints that I've framed that are outstanding. I believe that 16X20's would have been possible.  Its imaging quality far exceeds what most people will be asking of it.<br /><br />Just a few of the pros:<br /><br />-Very fast 1.4 lens with wide 24mm (35mm equivalent) lens.  Leica sharp!  Modest  but usable zoom range for inside applications. Very good noise control.  Shoot at 800 ISO without worry.  1600 if you really need it.  In most home situations with fast lens &  800 speed no need for flash.<br />-Very good JEPG's right out of the box.  But plenty of features to allow DSLR type of control. RAW available.<br />-Useful zoom features that allow you to program stops a various focal lengths and a return to last used zoom position when turning on the camera.<br />- Special effects filters that are actually useful. Aspect control and f-stop control on the lens barrel.<br /><br />This camera is  small, palmable, but not really a pocket camera.  It does does not have the megapixel rating of some of the new cameras, but it is an excellent balance of image quality given the size of the sensor.  Too many megapixels on a small sensor can lead to noise issues.  Panasonic understands this and couples a sharp lens, reasonable number of megapixels, and good image processing software to produce a camera that is first rate. I suspect  that with the competition touting more megapixels and larger sensors that this little camera may not be around for too much longer.  At its current price and given its quality of construction and image quality, it's a steal!<br /><br />There is only one thing that really offers an improvement to the existing package and that is a separate optical viewfinder.  Panasonic  offers one but I chose the Olympus VF-1.  An optical veiwfinder fits in the flash shoe on top and provides a wonderfully bright and useful way for you to frame your images, especially out of doors.  See my review of the Olympus VF-1 for a more detailed discussion of this.<br /><br />All of the glowing reviews are not hype, this is an excellent camera!  I'd buy again.","This is a very easy-to-use camera -- lightweight, compact and every control function logically laid out.  The iA and P (program) features work as expected, and the manual settings are as sophisticated as most DSLR cameras.  Anti-shake works very well, making the use of a tripod unnecessary for almost all shootings.  The camera is extremely fast for it's type, and the battery life is more than acceptable.  Best of all, the picture quality compares well to most DSLR.  It would be a significant improvement if there's a built-in view finder, GPS bookmark and wifi capability.  But at this price it's more than a satisfactory purchase.","This is what i have expected from a Lumix LX7!<br /><br />Can't find a better Point & Shoot Camera for Low Light Shoots!","Yes, we have all seen the reviews of the Sony RX100 2 being the best compact camera. It is also one of the most expensive compact cameras. I didn't want to spend $ 1 2 0 0  to get the RX1002 (with viewfinder) so I looked at other options. Boy, am I glad I did. I found this little gem. I have had it for two weeks and so far, I am very impressed with it.<br /><br />Some features that are outstanding...<br /><br />24mm wide (better than most kit lenses cameras come with)Better than the RX100 and RX1002<br />1.4-2.3 Leica lens (2.3 at the long end of the zoom! Unheard of in most cameras)<br />Built in ND 3 stop filter so you can use F1.4 in bright light. Need an ND filter?  Just press the ND filter button.<br />Level<br />Great video with full manual control if you need it<br />Reasonably priced viewfinder (compared to Sony's ridiculously priced viewfinder for the RX1002)<br />HDR in camera<br />Intelligent auto takes great pics if you want to use it as a point and shoot<br />Aperture ring<br />Change aspect ratio on the fly without searching through menus<br />Has the right amount of megapixels to match the sensor. Thank you Panasonic for not playing the more-megapixels-is-better marketing game.<br />1cm macro-WOW! If you use macro and focus close to your subject you get a beautiful blurry background and it makes your subject pop off of the screen/paper.<br />Quiet shutter for discrete shooting-Turn off the beeps and you can take shots in quiet sections of concerts or churches.<br />120 frames per second slow motion video (abeit only 720p and no sound)<br /><br />Don't buy into the the marketing hype that you have to have a larger sensor to get great image quality. This camera gets stunning results at lower iso settings. Since it has a 1.4 aperture, you rarely have to use higher iso settings.<br /><br />I could go on and on but there are already a lot of in depth reviews.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is a serious little compact camera capable of taking some amazing photos and videos. It inspires me to go out and shoot. It is light, you barely feel it around your neck. You go completely unnoticed when you are shooting on the street. No one gives the camera a second look because it doesn't have a giant white lens sticking out of it. It focuses fast so it makes an excellent street camera. Also, for more discrete situations, you can turn off the sound and back screen and take candid pics.<br /><br />It is so nice to have a little camera with a really fast 24mm lens, decent zoom, and incredible macro without having to carry a macro lens. I may end up using this more than my Sony Nex7. We'll see.<br /><br />There are some things it is missing.<br /><br />GPS<br />A moveable back screen<br />Wifi<br />NF communication<br />Focus peaking (This is one feature that Sony has that I would love to se on this camera) I use this feature on my Nex7 camera all the time.<br /><br />If you can live without these features, get this camera today. At the current price it is a no brainer. It is a steal! You will love it.","Wonderful, all-around camera. I upgraded from the LX5. Glad that I did. I upgraded primarily to obtain the faster lens. The extra improvements are a bonus.<br />This might be the least expensive way to obtain both a f/1.4 lens and anti-shake. Most f/1.4 lenses cost at least this much. I’ve not found a low-light situation that the LX7 can’t handle.<br />I also use this as my mountain hiking camera. Great, high-resolution scenic photos. The auto-pan and stitch works wonders for those mountain vistas.<br />I much appreciate having RAW files for those high-contrast lighting challenges.<br />I can operate the camera as a simple point-and-shoot when taking quick, casual photos of our grandchildren and, at the same time, I appreciate the extra control for more studied photos.<br />This being my first Amazon review indicates how much I appreciate the camera.","I have been a fan of the Lica/Panny cameras...my Leica was trashed and I wanted a replacement...so I chose the Panasonic LX 7...I see no difference except the money I saved buying the Panasonic...I won't carry the LX7 in my pocket like I did the D-Lux5....too much pocket lint entered the D-Lux 5 camera leading to lots of sensor dust....The JPEGS are great, the lens is great and I've learned to work around the Panasonic version of RAW files......at the price I paid it was a no brainer","Seriously great lens.  F1.4 allows low light shots, and also great for isolating subject from background, which it does better than its competition, such as the Sony, even though Sony has larger sensor. I consider the 24mm a must. I almost never really need a super telephoto, so the 90mm is not a big issue, especially since I realize that the cameras which offer wide angle and strong telephoto have inferior, slow lenses.  NO camera which does not have interchangeable lenses can maintain quality from 24mm or 28mm all the way up to 200 mm and even more. The specs will reveal the slowness of the lens (which is a direct indicator of quality, especially in low light), more apparent  at telephoto.  I shot professionally for over 20 years, wanted a camera that I would NOT leave at home (as I did my heavy Canon pro camera), would fit in a pocket, would take as good a photo as possible, have 24mm.  Also optional viewfinder, which I wound up buying for shots in bright sun, and is also more natural for me.  This camera had the features, especially real quality, I wanted, while at the fewest compromises.  Looks and  feels sturdy. Easy to use.","Fantastic little camera!!! :) I really like it :)<br />If Panasonic would have added in-caera gps to it, it would be really perfect...","First, I want to say that I love using the LX7. Its an absolute pleasure to hold and the camera's physical controls are perfect.  Secondly, its outdoor and low light performance is excellent.  However, it fails miserably when it comes to taking portrait type photos under artificial lighting. I took the camera to Cancun a few weeks ago and all of the photos of my wife and kids in anything other than natural lighting during the day looked horrible. I tried repeatedly to take photos while eating in restaurants and other settings that used artificial lighting and all of the pictures were either washed out by the flash or had the wrong skin tones. I tried every setting on the camera, which included changing the flash intensity and white balance, and I could never get a good photo. At first I thought I did not know how to set up the camera, but when I used my wife's RX100 it took excellent photos on the superior auto setting. I personally can't stand how Sony has buried most of the RX100's controls in its software, but in the end I have to go with the camera that takes the best picture.  Since I take a lot of portrait type photos of my family, the LX7 was useless to me. I'm outside the return period so I will be selling mine and sticking with our RX100. Maybe they will fix the problems if and when they release the LX9.","They keep getting better and better.  I am a real estate appraiser and I prefer Panasonic with the wide angle lens and great photos.","There is really nothing really bad about this camera. It's a \"mature\" product of sorts with the major flaws of the LX5 being addressed and upgraded where it counts...faster lens and lower noise sensor now with 1080p60 video.<br /><br />I will say that this camera is NOT for Joe Public who just wants to Point and Shoot and expect fantastic results. It's really meant for the intermediate or advanced shooter who likes to get the maximum out of the camera via semi or full manual control. I normally shoot in either Program or Aperture Priority mode to keep the lens in it's sweet spot of about f2.8 or if I want to keep a minimum shutter of at least 1/60 of a second via Program Mode.<br /><br />I normally shoot with a Canon 5D3 when I need fantastic results or super shallow Depth of Field and the LX7 is my \"everything else\" camera for birthday parties, trips to the beach, and just road trips where I don't want to deal with the bulkiness of a DSLR or the risk of damaging my equipment. Compared to my 5D3 and other compacts I used to own including the Canon S95 and even my recently sold Sony RX100, the LX7 images need some work to make them \"pop\". Perhaps it's because I use the Natural color setting which dulls the results for the sake of color accuracy and lower contrast. But the images are TACK SHARP from f/2 to about f/4. Anything beyond that and you begin to see signs of softening due to worsening lens/light diffraction. I have to admit I've been spoiled by Canon's jpeg colors. I have yet to shoot RAW with the LX7 since my use of the camera has been for non critical subjects thus far. But I will try it out soon.<br /><br />I only have a few minor quibbles with the LX7. For one thing, it is lacking some of the more common convenience features of WiFi, GPS, and Touchscreen. It would also be nice to have a built in lens cover instead of the cap. And I'd wish Panasonic could improve the jpeg color output closer to that of Canon's and Sony's. There are times when I wish I just don't have to adjust the colors in Lightroom or Photoshop. But that is really it and I know I'm being picky here. I just find the other color settings to be off. They are too saturated and the reds tend to push towards orange. Blue skys sometimes seem to have a magenta cast as well. But once I think about the fact the lens is at only f/2.3 at full zoom, I quickly forget about my complaints and go back to shooting since there isn't another camera, next to the overpriced rebranded Leica, that has such an amazing lens to keep ISO low and to not have to use flash.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'd say the LX7 is a no brainer if you own an DSLR and want something compact that can fit into large pant and jacket pockets. With prices hovering only slightly about $300, it's actually an excellent value.","Although a larger sensor would be great, I mostly use this camera for taking all my pictures that I post on Instagram so it does that to the all my heart's desire. The f/1.4 aperture makes it so I don't have to always use my flash in low light situations.","I have not even begun to learn everything you can do with it but even on auto it's terrific<br />I was sold at RAW and 1.4 and white","Very Very fantastic camera. Have other full size sensor SLR's and this easily holds its own. The Leica summicron lens with nano coating and digital filter is second to none. Can you say Value? Knew you could. A++++<br />Really wide angle as well.","I bought this just prior to us going on our beach vacation and used it so much while we were there.  Gettign to catch some great moments of the kids playing in the water and sand.  I have used it a lot since then also capturing sports and the first day back to school! plan to buy a guide to teach me how to use the manual focusing settign and all since i really have never had a camera that had options to manula focus!","Came highly recommended by a photographer friend and so far, it has been a great choice.Takes great pictures...easy to use! Love the white color.","This is my third LX camera, I started with the LX3 then the LX5 and now the LX7. The camera is small enough to carry conveniently and give excellent quality photos. The Leica lens teamed with Panasonic's electronic know how is a winning team.","I have the lx 3 for years, great point and shoot. ( 18mm panasonic assor)  I used canon pro equip for work . But when i need a pocket camera these cameras win.  Now the lx 7 has the24mm 1.4 leica lens = 90mm at 2.8 .flash shoe.  Great deal for the price. Loved Amazon since the late 90s but now with the tax added I'm backed to BH Photo for any item over a curtain price.","As a travel writer, I did not need a dSLR with all the lenses and paraphernalia to carry with me when traveling. However, I most definitely need a camera that takes good pictures, is fast and allows me some flexibility over how they are taken. The LUMINX LX7 fits the bill. It is small enough so that it is very easy to carry with me all of the time. It is very fast. On most point and shoot digitals, there is a huge delay in between the time you take the picture and when the shutter closes, not so on the LX7. In odd light situations, I can easily get out of the Auto program and make adjustments manually to get just the picture that I want. There are even adjustments in the Intellingent Auto mode which one does not find in a point in shoot camera. I bought the book Photographers Guide To The Panasonic Luminx LX7 to go along with the camera and it does have a lot of good info in it, way more than the manual that comes with the camera. If you really want to get the most out of the camera, I would suggest getting this book. Pricey but worth it.<br /><br />The only downside that I can see so far on this camera is that the zoom is limited to 7.5X Intelligent Zoom. I would like more but the trade offs for that are not worth the features that I really need and that this camera has.","Just the right balance for speed and excellent pictures.  There is even room to add some personal touches with the options.","The LX7 comes with a great bright lens and great specs; you shouldn't feel the need for better optics.  In short I feel the video taking performance is a lot better than the still image performance.<br /><br />LX7's video mode is among the best one can expect on a still camera although recording time is arbitrarily limited to 29 minutes.  It outperforms my 2 year old Sony mid-price camcorder in video quality and frame rate.  Now my Sony camcorder feels obsolete.  The only saving grace is the Sony's handling and recording time limit is the size of the memory card.  If video get any better than this on a still camera, the camcorder market will meet its demise.  I believe Panasonic knows this and is limiting the recording time on the LX7 to avoid cannibalizing its camcorder sales.<br /><br />Still image is where this camera falls short from an average user point of view and I will sound critical.  (When I read people's reviews I prefer to hear the critical opinion as well as the good points.)<br /><br />It is often marketed as a great camera for the point-and-shooters and more advanced photographers alike, but out of box performance using the iA mode yields subpar result to put it mildly.  The images lack contrast and color fidelity in this mode under any lighting condition, and they are often improperly exposed.  Skin tone appears very pale, resulting in unflattering portraits.  After painstaking fiddling and experiments with settings in PASM modes, the results were acceptable, but at the end I still had trouble getting consistently sharp and well exposed images with proper color.  The contrast and color on this camera are just not right no matter how much I played with settings.  I suspect this is a very frustrating experience for novice and intermediate users; I certainly was and I am not a novice.  It's too bad that the bright lens does bring lots of possibilities for users, especially under low light and its lightning fast focusing speed, but the programming on this camera seems not up to the task.<br /><br />It was my decision to buy this camera after reading lots of glowing reviews and I had assured my wife that this is the best performance we could get for the price.  It was very difficult to admit the flaws of this camera the first couple times I heard my wife's assessments of the images - they were not sharp and look very flat - our 12 year old Olympus C4040 took more appealing pictures with colors just banged on.  After much objective observations and experiments with settings, I eventually agreed with her opinions.  Back to the store where it belongs.<br /><br />If you have the patience and the experience of an advanced user, this camera may work for you.  Perhaps under the right shooting conditions and with the right settings, the performance can be as good as described from all the positive professional reviews.  But for an average user who is more often use it for everyday point-and-shoot and also wants to explore deeper into photography with all the available bells and whistles, I am disappointed and I don't get it.","First of all, the picture quality is great!  The features are great!  and the controls are very very good.<br /><br />I don't love the flash.  Its 'ok'.  And I don't like the low resolution of the Panorama mode.  Aside from that, these is a power-pack, high quality product.","I love this camera. Takes beautiful pictures. I just wish I knew how to use it. You can definitely use it as point-and-shoot but to use the more advanced features, you have to know more about photography. I bought a guide for it though, so hopefully that will help. I'm an amateur, so I don't have a lot of useful info about the camera. But so far I have some awesome pics.","I bought this camera as back up my Leica M9,nice body, focus fast enough, color ok.I sold this camera and change to other small camera with bigger sensor.<br />I recomended this camera for capture family activity and travel purposes.","Never think it is so useful and easy to use too.i love it so much.Cheap and within my expectation.thank you amazon","We just got back from Vegas, which was our first holiday with this camera, and we were NOT disappointed.  i hate using a flash indoors and who wants to lug an SLR, even with a prime lens, around in 40 degree weather? i love the lens on this camera! It's not a replacement for my Nikon D5100 but for a light substitution, it can't be beat! I don't like the fact that it doesn't have an auto lens cap but flicking off the stock cap that comes in the box is getting pretty automatic already.<br />Also, the auto and scene modes are easy enough for my wife to use quickly so it works for both of us!","I purchased the Lumix DMC-LX7K because I didn't want to lug around my heavy DSLR anymore. Although it doesn't quite replace the DSLR, I wanted a camera that would give me that background blur we all love. This camera gives that desired effect...along with many more effects! I am not a professional or amateur photographer, I just like taking pictures to document our life. All I had to do was a little search on YouTube for an intro tutorial and I was good to go. Love this camera!","This camera met all my expectations.  When I don't feel like packing large for my SLR, I take my Lumix LX7 and still shoot with confidence.  It's a great on the go camera that will give you quality images.","I've had the LX5 for almost 3 years now, and I picked up this LX7 for an upcoming vacation (LX5 being gifted to my daughter).<br />It's an amazing piece of machinery and has benched my full-sized Canon with L lenses for almost everything that I do - the convenience at this quality of picture is pure win.","The LX7 is a great camera for the $300 i paid for it months ago on amazon. Why the price got jacked up by 50%, now just 25%, is beyond me.  I do know that I would have bought a second one if the price had stayed at $300.  I've seen them sell for $275 elsewhere.  Just because its a decent camera doesn't mean you should pilfer me.","I'm a real estate appraiser and need a reliable camera that has a wide angle view, good flash, decent battery, and low light capabilities.  This camera has a good feel in the hand and has survived several drops and downpours, and takes good pictures.","This is an excellent point and shoot camera with advanced functions. I really liked the way it feels while holding, its not too small or not too big. Excellent lense, very fast , very good for landscape photography. I really liked the 120fps (slow motion) video capability. I recently bought a lense tube , now i am able to add the tele converter lenses and wide angle lenses. only thing i am disappointed is  i am not able to get a good skin tones using flash.tried couple of settings but unable to get the correct settings,<br /><br />For the price $289.. this is an excellent camera","This camera is awesome, I love the quality of the photos especially the ones taken in darker places (indoor, evening) . I would have loved if the lens cover has a thread that would keep it attached to the body of the camera; I'm always afraid to loos it.","This camera catches action. My pictures capture subtle changes in light and color. it's fast, light  and fits in my purse. The Leica lens is all you would expect.","Awesome evening shots in auto mode. Will take time to fully extract all features, but out of box, has great field of view and is straightforward. Great super compact.","I have not still used some features, like slow motion and time laps. But the performance, en low light conditions, and easey to access features, make me believe that I found \"my\" companion for everyday quality snaps. I am a professional photographer (fashion) and I`m having a ball. However... for the manual focus... id prefer a wheel rather than a little swiveling handle. Maybe needs time to adapt to. I would highly recommend it to pros looking for an truly portable high quality camera for snaps.","It has been said many times that a perfect camera is yet to be made. So, like all things made by human, this camera is not perfect either. That said, it is a perfect camera to fit my NEEDS (not wants, mind you). In particular, I need a portable camera that can operate well in a wide variety of situations especially in low light situation such as inside a museum where flash is now allowed.<br />LX7 has so many features and so much capability that will take a while to be  familiar with them for best results. An electronic book I purchased from Amazon helps. I look forward to the potential of using many of them to my advantage.<br />I have a Panasonic ZS3 before I bought the LX7. My experience with the ZS3 camera gave me confidence about the Leica lens, the size of the sensor, and the Panasonic product in general. I have a picture of the Gierangerflord taken by the ZS3 (with a 10MP sensor) that was enlarged to 16x20 and looking great on my wall. So I am sure that LX7 with the improved 10.1 MP sensor and a better lens will also be able to produce a great 16x20 enlargement which is all I ever need. Also, I dropped the ZS3 once on a hard surface and the LX7 twice (already!)and they came out with only minor scratch. I checked the professional reviews of LX7 and found them rated LX7 comparable to Sony RX100. I took over a thousand pictures on my recent trip (most of them with iA setting) and am very happy with the results. Best of all, the price I paid for the camera was like icing on the cake.","Love this camera.<br /><br />It is very small: I put it in a small pouch on my belt and it goes everywhere with me. Not as small as a smart phone, but close enough and much higher quality.<br /><br />The fast f1.4 lens allows me to shoot indoor pictures without flash. Love that.<br /><br />The rear screen is so clear that I find myself not wishing for a viewfinder.<br /><br />The camera is very simple to operate. I have been leaving it in \"IA\" mode (intelligent auto) for all of my shooting, treating it almost like a point & shoot camera, even though a professional photographer friend urges me to explore using some of the other modes (aperture priority, in particular). I will get around to doing that eventually. Meanwhile, I get great results already.<br /><br />The video is stunning, and I am not even using anywhere near the highest quality settings. I have the camera set to shoot 720p video, producing mp4 files. My old computer can play and edit these files easily.<br /><br />Note that the manual says that if you do use the highest quality video settings (HD, 1920x1080, 60p), and you want to view or edit the video on a computer, you will need a fast computer, specifically, an i7 machine. Friends of mine who edit video concur that such a fast computer is, indeed necessary. I don't have such a fast computer, and when I try to view HD, 1920x1080, 60p video on my computer, it plays in little short bursts. But this is not a problem of the camera; it is just a fact about the data rate required to play HD video.<br /><br />But again, even with the camera set to shoot lower resolution video, the results are great.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fantastic camera, at a great price.<br /><br />Some notes about the lens cap follow below:<br /><br />The original Panasonic lens cap, when attached to the camera, does not have enough room underneath for an adaptor ring and protective filter. But the original lens cap has the advantage that it locks into the outer, fixed barrel around the lens. It does not stick out very far. And it completely covers the air gap between the inner, telescoping barrel and the outer fixed barrel. And if the lens cap takes a hit, the impact is transmitted to the outer, fixed barrel and not to the telescoping inner barrel. The risk to using the original lens cap is, of course, that without a protective filter, the lens could get scratched.<br /><br />For that reason, I tried an EzFoto adapter ring, protective filter, and lens cap (available on Amazon).<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I did not have any trouble removing the thread protector from my Panasonic LX7. The EzFoto adapter ring threads on easily enough, and the EzFoto adapter ring goes on easily and fills up some of the air gap between the inner, telescoping lens barrel and the outer, fixed barrel. But the EzFoto adapter ring and filter protrude from the front of the camera a few millimeters. When the EzFoto lens cap is attached, the resulting assembly is fairly thick, much thicker than the original lens cap. Also note that the EzFoto lens cap is attached to the EzFoto filter and adapter ring, which are threaded onto the inner, telescoping lens barrel. That means that if the camera takes a hit on the front, the impact is transmitted to the inner, telescoping lens barrel. (And the EzFoto lens cap comes with a small tether, but it is not at all clear how the tether is to be attached to the lens cap: the hole in the lens cap is much too small.)<br /><br />But in my last 25 years of using various kinds of cameras, I have never scratched a lens. My wife is very careful with the camera. When our 6-year-old son takes a picture with the LX7, even he is very careful to not touch the lens. The lens has gotten dirty, because we use the camera in a lot of fun situations, like at the beach on a windy day. But I have usually been able to simply blow off the dust with a squeeze bulb. The one time that the lens needed more than that, I used FormulaMC cleaner and a microfiber cloth to clean it very carefully. It came out looking like new. Our LX7 is a family camera, and we have fun with it and do not obsess over it, and yet the lens remains in perfect condition.<br /><br />So I don't think a protective filter is necessary. If one wants to attach some other kind of filter for special effects, then the EzFoto kit would be essential.","Very fast camera, wide zoom lens.  I would love for it to have a swiveling LCD and a longer zoom like my bigger, heavier, older DMC FZ50, but this one takes better pictures and is nice and compact.  I bought the electronic viewfinder that plugs into the hot shoe, which works wonderfully.","I bought this as a P&S that I could get into action quickly from a pouch on my backpack belt for extended backpacking trips. Secondary use is as a family camera.<br /><br />This fits the bill. My dSLR stays in the pack, and this is perfect for documenting the journey as I go. Easy to get into action and back into my camera pouch (an M-Rock 2010 Mesa Verde — perfect if you install an auto lens cap on the camera!). When I'm above tree line, the panorama feature is awesome! HDR works nicely, too. Great in-camera functionality. Love the aperture ring and the aspect ratio (?) ring. One quibble with it, though, is that I found that I had bumped the aspect ratio and not realized it, and was taking 16:9 stills when I wanted 3:2. I almost would rather that be a setting in the menu, and use the ring for something more useful (I really don't find myself changing aspect ratio all that often at all).<br /><br />Raw feature is great, battery life is excellent (took a couple hundred photos and reviewed a lot in playback, over 12,000ft elevation, battery still going strong). Love the built-in ND function, and it really does do well with macro (not true 1:1, I don't think, but I was impressed with the quality of the macro). I'm not going to get insanely technical with it, but if you want a P&S that has raw capabilities, multiple aspect ratios, aperture ring (really nice to go from 2.0 to 8.0 on the fly when going from macro of a flower to panorama of a mountain vista), ND built-in, panorama and HDR functionality, great battery life and quality photos, this is a great option.<br /><br />Oh and yes, 1080 video. I do a lot of video work as well, and this takes very nice video (I use the mp4 setting, much easier to drag-and-drop to Mac and view without having to convert or use their software - ain't using the footage for pro work). Convert with free Mpeg Streamclip to ProRes422 and you're set for Final Cut X (lame) or Final Cut 7.<br /><br />Worst thing I've encountered so far is something I mentioned earlier, might be a bit too easy to mistakenly knock the aspect ratio to one you don't want (same with aperture).","Used to use an analog SLR and then decided to get a compact digital camera (one step up from an entry-level digital camera) several years ago.  That camera served me well, but I decided to upgrade because I was planning to take a long vacation this year.  Was debating between an advanced compact camera or a DSLR.  Decided to go with this to avoid the bulk and weight of a DSLR while travelling.  This camera was an absolute joy to use.  Fantastic lens, beautiful photos with little flare, nice color saturation, phenomenal image stability (allowing me to take hand-held night shots), and so unobtrusive that I could take documentary-style street photos at will.  The only negatives are the lens cap, fussy buttons, and the lack of a programmable lens dial.","First of all, the most important feature of a camera is \"does it take good pictures\" ?<br />Well, the LX7 takes outstanding pictures.<br />For example, I took a photo of a dark purple flower that has raindrops on the petals, but has yellow-green stamens in the center.  There's lots of subtle detail in the texture of the petals, but the sharpness of the water drops is shown too, and the high-brightness stamens were not \"washed-out\" either, they showed lots of detail and color.<br /><br />You see, it might have only a 1/1.7\" sensor, but it has an outstanding Leica lens, and as I have seen with other cameras, the glass can make all the difference between a good camera and an excellent one.<br /><br />So then I took out my DSLR with its expensive F2.8 lens, and took the exact same shots with the LX7.<br />Every time, the LX7 was neck-and-neck with the DSLR, and sometimes the LX7 was better and showed more shadow detail.<br /><br />Then I took a night shot at ISO 12,800 and one second exposure with both cameras.  Again the LX7 was very comparable for graininess and noise.  (I usually don't shoot at 12,800, I just wanted to see what they'd do)<br /><br />And all this was just straight out of the box before I adjusted all the settings, and there are a LOT of settings, you can take a picture in full auto or any other way you want with lots of creative modes, scene modes, and programmable modes too.<br /><br />It has an F1.4 lens, so you can get great bokeh.<br />It'll focus down to 1cm in wide-angle.<br /><br />The hot shoe will fire my Canon flash, so I don't need to buy the Panasonic flash.<br /><br />This camera takes totally awesome pictures.","This opinion is valid when the LX7 is associated with the electronic viewfinder LVF2, which I also use in my GX1.<br />Never had this much pleasure with a camera, and I have printed many pictures at 20 x 30 cm which are hard to tell from prints from my other cameras (Panasonic GX1, Nikon D7000). But keep in mind what it is. It does not replace an SLR or a medium-format camera for some applications, and shall never give you the limited depth-of-field they are able to produce. On the other hand, a zoom with its apertures are impossible to get elsewhere, and have allowed me to take many otherwise impossible to get night photos. Also, macro is much easier and, because of the depth-of-field, potentially more efficient with the LX7 (e.g., when wanting to send someone a picture of a small object). Some of my LX7 pictures are in seriouscompacts.com, look for lcsolla.","I would have given it five stars, but the poor excuse for a User's Manual brings it down a notch.  Just in case anyone has the same experience as I did, note that the Retouch functions are not available when the image quality is set to RAW or RAW+jpeg.  The manual lists situations in which Auto and Creative Retouch do not work and is written as though the list is all inclusive, but it does NOT mention RAW or RAW+jpeg at all (like I said, poor manual).  I shoot in RAW or RAW+jpeg 99% of the time, so I guess I won't be using the Retouch function.  For what it's worth, I did find a workaround -- shoot in RAW+jpeg, copy the images from the SD card to a computer, delete the RAW images (but not the jpegs), put the card back in the camera, and the Retouch options then become available.<br /><br />To sum up, amazing camera -- poor manual.","I got my camera today and I really like it.<br /><br />But I can't find where the lens cap string. I looked in everywhere in the box but there is no string.<br /><br />Unless that I like it.","Great for indoor shooting because of the fast, fast lens!  Easy to adjust on the fly with the aperture ring.  I love the white baked on finish.  If you watch this camera you can get a great price too!","There are already dozens of great in depth reviews of this camera, there is little point in restating what has already been said. I find the LX7 a worthy replacement for my dearly departed LX5. (Don't get salt water in the LVF connector)<br /><br />The one thing I don't recall anyone else mentioning is the O.I.S. On the LX7 the image stabilizer seems greatly improved over the LX5. I'm getting sharp hand held shots at 1/2 second and my limit with the LX5 seemed to be 1/8 second.","The Panasonic LX7 arrived at my doorstep earlier than the expected date given from Amazon.<br /><br />Have already used the LX7 for a trip to Bangkok and the item works flawlessly.<br />No aperture ring issue or any battery life issue.","Fast lens - f/1.4 to f2.3  I was able to shoot at iso 250 to 500 in the Air and Space museum near Dulles airport.  With my SLR's I need 1000-3200. Zoom range is very usable. I shot 5 fps shots during a family ceremony allowing me to capture expressions.  HDR mode is mildly usable and there is 3-stop bracketing for better results with HDR PC programs.","This camera takes amazing photos that have generated some very favorable comments from viewers. I have yet to unleash its many features, but keep trying new ones with incredible results. This will serve me for many years to come. Well done, again, Panasonic. This replaced my LX-3 and although it doesn't allow for optional lenses and caps as that one did, it is very versatile and full-featured. I love it.","The quality is really good. You can take pictures in evening and there will be no blur neither noise. iPhone is a copy machine comparing to this cam :)<br />Camera is a bit heavy, but that's good, cause it won't slip through your fingers :)","Just a great camera with low-light capabilities and excellent image quality.  I have the previous LX5 model and love them both.  Very well built camera - well worth the money. I am using this camera almost exclusively while my DSLR just sits.  It works great as an automatic point-n-shoot camera, but also has all the manual controls one could want.","Nope, this camera is a belter!<br />Best $350 I've spent. I mostly use it as a 'take everywhere, do everything' camera","I bought this camera for my daughter as a birthday gift. She thoroughly researched this camera before asking for it as a gift. My husband spent additional time reading reviews etc and agreed it was a wise choice. The pictures have been fantastic!","This camera's features, flexibility, and quality output were more than I expected. It's easy to use in all modes. It is small and light making it very easy to carry in different ways. (It's not small enough for most pockets, but that fine for my style.) I love the fast f1.4 lens for very good low light shooting. I also love the 24mm wide angle. It doesn't go out very far on the tele side, but that's fine for what I shoot. The sensor is large enough and good enough that I don't do any post processing noise reduction!<br /><br />Highly recommended.","I bought this after trying the Canon S100.  The S100 was great -  excellent image quality for still and video.  Very ey to use, but had one major flaw:  it had am ever present clicking noise during video recordings!!!!  I needed a compact camera that provided excellent still and video images without clicking sounds!<br />So far the jury is still out on the LX 7.  The image quality is good and there is NO clicking during video recording.  The AVCHD format is a bit tough to transfer to PC and requires a few extra steps.  I own a Lumix G3 micro 4/3rds and I love it.  The LX7 has a larger learning curve.  For now, I'd say it's okay.  If you can find it for sub $300 it's probably worth it.  This body style really isn't that compact.  It's a tough fit in a pant or coat pocket.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I ended up getting rid of this camera and went back to a Canon S100.  The LX7 received such great reviews and it may offer more manual features vs the S100.  For me I loved that the focus noise was absent compared to the S100.  However, the images were a bit dull as was the video.  Plus, the video at 60fps is a pain to deal with unless you have a super powerful machine.  It proved difficult on my 2007 iMac.  Ultimately, when I compared the image and video quality to that of the S100 I just like the results of the Canon better.","The Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7 is the best compact camera I have ever owned with respect to image quality and usability and features.  I love the fast f1.7 lens at the wide end and f2.8 when the telephoto is rack all the way out. Don’t be put off at the 10.1 mp size as the lens quality more than makes up for this smaller size sensor. The weight of this camera is more than any point and shoot that I have ever seen, but that’s because of the lens being so big with 11 elements in 10 groups. I just returned from a trip to Europe and this camera performed flawlessly.  When Photographing the inside of the cathedrals, I was able to hand hold at f1.4 1/60 of a second with no problems.","I was looking for a camera in-between my Canon Elph point and shoot and Canon SLR.  Because of my Canon history/loyalty I was primarily considering the G15.  After much research I went with the LX7 and couldn't be happier.  The G15 was $100 more at the time of purchase and I could not justify the price difference as most reviews say the LX7 quality and features are just as good if not better than the G15.  It is a nice coat pocket size camera and quality is far higher than the average point and shoot (or camera phone).  The in camera features like one touch color, HDR are fun to play with at the time of composition without a lot of post-processing time (I prefer to shoot, not mess around in Photoshop).  If you are like me and find yourself leaving your SLR at home because of the bulk but left wanting more from your iPhone snaps this is the one to get.","It takes great low light pictures. It's fun. It's easy to use. It's a great point and shoot! Battery life is pretty good, too!","Small, powerful, look good, everything you want, i really happy, the picture quality is over the regular point and shot cameras","The speed and action of this lens is amazing. I have another Lumix DMC LK5 (?) which is good but not as precise as this one. I still need my larger camera for wide angle shots, but extremely pleased with my purchase. Another great feature is to get the action this provides and have it fit in my purse.","After running a Lumix LX5 for the past year I found the LX7 to be even better.  At first I questioned pictures shot on the LX7-  untill I shot the same subject side by side Comparing LX5 to LX7.  The LX7 is a tad more complicated than the LX5 but they added a few functions that improve shooting.  If you are familiar with the LX5 it will take a tad to get over the swapped delete and quick view buttons.  The Video function is a lot better,  Overall a worthwhile product.  only two minor issues; start up is slow by a tad and it does like its batteries.  Buy extra genuine Lumix Batteries (two extra are perfect) at you'll be ready for anything!","This camera was all that was advertised.  My one quibble is the lack of a decent printed manual.  The pamphlet they included is, typically for Panasonic, little more than a list of features.  And it's cryptic to boot.<br /><br />I got this in advance of a long trip, and a manual would have been helpful as I don't always have access to the complete PDF manual, which is also not as well written as it could be.<br /><br />The camera itself does have a sweet lens and performs as well as any small sensor camera I've ever used.","Very nice compact camera with high quality photos. The only problem I had is that  Adobe RGB colour space is NOT included in contrast to what has been advertised!!","It is a compact camera with complete manual adjustments.<br />If you are in a hurry, just turn the knob to automatic an shot, the qality will be awesome!","I was lucky, and picked this up on Amazon the other day for 298.00, just a little over what a used 1 was at the same time-<br /><br /> PROS- For the price, a great lens, very fast, very sharp, indeed.<br /><br />  Great build, really feels substantial for a P&S.<br /><br />  VERY GOOD FEATURES- makes you want to experiment.<br /><br />  Handling is good, I added a small camera holder, makes it super nice to use.<br /><br />  Price- I've compared to all current offerings in this same class, the price I paid is best buy for the money-<br /><br />  SHUTTER- VERY GOOD, VERY FAST, better than alot of DSLR'S on the market-<br /><br />  Focus- VERY QUICK, really locks onto subject with amazing speed.<br /><br />  OVERALL RATING- 5 STARS<br /><br />  CONS- battery door could be more substantial, as reported kind of flimsy, but may hold up well-<br /><br />  Zoom is fairly slow, but no big deal, this model could stand for alot bigger zoom-<br /><br />  Battery life could be better-<br /><br /> Many people have complained about the small lens cap- I fixed that problem with the auto lens cap- on Amazon. I chose the 1 for filter use, and also added a B&W UV filter, with the adapter filter ring. WORKS LIKE PANASONIC SHOULD HAVE DONE TO BEGIN WITH!<br /><br />All in all to make a long story short, if you are looking for a camera with a FANTASTIC lens, GREAT features, GOOD handling, SOLID VALUE, SMALL SIZE, FAIRLY POCKETABLE, and not too many cons, the LX7 is a 5 star choice.<br /><br />  And most of all, IT TAKES AMAZING, CLEAR PICTURES, SHARP AS A TACK WITH ACCURATE COLORS- (AND THIS CAMERA TAKES AMAZING SHOTS WITH LITTLE TO NO LIGHT)- after buying and trying many different brands and models of cameras over the years, I finally found a very good choice- I will not be sending this 1 back!<br /><br /> And NO, it WILL NOT replace your DSLR- but this LX7 is a great pocket back-up!","We had a five year old Canon digital elph, and wanted a new camera to take pictures of our newborn. I had every intention of learning all the manual features of this camera and take advantage of them. Alas, having a newborn means I don't have the time or desire to do that. Luckily, the full auto feature of this camera is amazing and has taken some incredible photos for us. The white color looks very slick.","I've owned a couple nice Casio and two other Panasonic P&S (TZ5 & ZS9) cameras and have enjoyed them all.  I use my small cameras a LOT for visual note taking ... like a shot of how the wires connect to the back side of my PC computer before I take it off the stand to upgrade the video card inside ... or make a picture copy of the instruction book for the new TV that'd I'll be sure to misplaced when I need to reference it.  Oh, and the boxes from stuff I've bought ... and DVD covers before the discs go in album folders.<br /><br />The LX7 continues to let me do that kinda stuff (in style) and also provides me with a great compact option for high quality (especially in low light) wide angle still and video photography.<br /><br />The DMW-LVF2 External Live View Finder makes an excellent addition to the camera for serious photo work.","I have been trying for years to find a point & shoot camera that would take good photos for those times when I don't want to carry my heavy Nikon SLR.  I have purchased and returned many, many cameras -- Fujifilm, Canon, Nikon, and other Lumix models, for various reasons but mostly because of the quality of the photos taken indoors.  The Leika lens, the sturdy metal feel of the Lumix DMC-L7W camera, and most of all the quality of the photos taken with it under any condition elevates it above the rest of the P&S pack.<br /><br />The only thing that prevents my 5-star rating:  the removable lens cap is a pain.  I would have rather had a lens cover that opened and closed automatically like most P&S cameras.  Also, FYI, the flash does not pop up automatically when using the \"Auto\" setting on this camera.  This is helpful most of the time because you can decide yourself if you need fill-in flash, something that isn't possible on \"Auto\" with a lot of P&S cameras.  But by the way, this camera does take great photos without the flash most of the time (in museums and other places where you can't use a flash).<br /><br />I'm very happy with this camera!  In my opinion, the quality of the photos taken with it are between the usual P&S shots and SLR photos.  The small size makes it easy to bring along wherever you are, unlike an SLR.  Hope this review is helpful!","Oh I suppose you can continue to read reviews and specs, but the idea of this camera is to have a camera with you at all times. Small enough, but I can maintain a grip better than with very small p&s. The bright lens does a wonderful job and I'm very pleased with my choice.","It does take time to look through this detailed book which is a good thing. There is a lot the camera can do and you can't learn it all in 5 minutes. For this you can get a less functional camera. The only issue I've had so far is in using the pop up flash. If the camera is in burst mode that function overrides the set up menu of a forced flash. The menu shows it will flash but the LCD setting shows correctly that it will not. The problem is knowing why. I figured this out by going to the Panasonic support site and looking up FAQ. They do have a live chat but it was not working when I tried to use it. Between this book and the Internet support, one should be able to resolve their questions.","I had used it for 2 month now and have only 1 word for this camera: love it. The only wish I have for this camera is it has the auto len close design.","i have been thru many cameras...Right now i work with a pentax k-5, a canon g11, and 2 panasonic mirrorless cams..I purchased the lx7 mainly for a small handy cam for indoor photo capabilities without flash..This camera has exceeded my expectations!...<br /><br />The LX-7 is capable of taking photos that you could not do with a point and shoot just a few years ago. I brought this camera along to an indoor concert to check its capabilities as i was sitting in the first row, and i knew the limited zoom would not be an issue...<br /><br />In spite of the tricky stage lighting the results blew me away!<br /><br />As long as u are aware the limited zoom will not be a problem, I doubt you can find a camera for the money (i paid $299) that would give you the quality of the results that you can achieve from the LX-7","I am an old school guy and I love my full mechanical Leica.  To me, digital cameras are just a consumer product - there is not much to it.  I use digital only because they are cheap and serves the purpose.  I always buy Canon when it comes to digital, but the pictures are always very flat without life to them.  This Panasonic changed my view towards digital cameras - it is simply amazing and versatile!  I have taken more photos in one month than all the photos that I have taken with the previous camera.<br /><br />The first reason I picked this camera is for the Leica f1.4 lens - no matter what people say, there is no comparison to a Leica lens. This lens is no joke - for a non-SLR camera, it is probably as good as it gets. The second reason is the 1080p video function.  At first, the functions of the camera is a bit overwhelming, but once you get the hang of it, it is very easy to use.  I keep my setting very simple - at 24mm, never use zoom, and change ISO, or B&W to be a little creative.  The best part is you can mimic almost any effects with the built-in functions.  I carry it with me everywhere.  I even bought a handlebar mount to put the camera on my bike when I go riding.  It is that much fun with this camera!!<br /><br />Last advice, but a cheap spare battery and you are good to go!  Enjoy.","DMC-LX7 is a very nice P&S digital camera to have, comparing to a lot out there. But it still has some shortcomings, just to list few of them of mine (who is just a general average user).<br /><br />I mainly used it for food photography. It took good Macro shots with nice Bokeh. However, due to its fast lens (why I bought it for), it is hard to get a sharp focus (just like its predecessor, LX5, or the other fast lens alike), especially under the poor lighting. Although it was upgraded to the MOS sensor, but the size shrinks to 1/1.7\". Though it still takes good images, the image quality doesn't seem to improve any. I wish the post DMC-LX7 can have a bigger MOS sensor. Maybe that's why the DMC-LX7 seems to focus on the Soft Focus features (Soft Focus, Radial Defocus, Smooth Defocus, etc) instead of a Sharp Focus feature that every photographers want (at least that's what I want).<br /><br />DMC-LX7 comes with the Aperture Ring, which maybe a nice feature for some people. But I rather have a Manual Focus Ring instead of an Aperture Ring. It is VERY awkward to adjust the manual focus with a Focus Lever Dial, especially if you want to apply the Rack Focus while shooting the video.<br /><br />In addition, the sound of the adjusting the manual focus dial is recorded with the video. Don't think there is a way to turn on and off the sound recording. There is no sound recorded while shooting with the High Speed video mode. I wish the post DMC-LX7 can have that the options of turning on or off the sound recording, that it can shoot the action cam video, that the options of choosing the frame rates (fps) instead of \"A, S, P, High Speed\", and that it can make the real Time Lapse video instead of shots.<br /><br />The last, the lens cap! It is VERY inconvenient trying to get the cap out of the way while taking the shots or forgot to take it off. I wish the post DMC-LX7 can have a build-in cap (like the one with DMC-ZR1).","I had a Canon 110 HS. I got this camera as an upgrade. The reviews (not just here, but on other camera review sites) were glowing, and I really digged all the manual control on the camera, not to mention the sick aperture. Got the camera, was so so excited, and went out to the park with my kids. Took some pictures. They were underwhelming on the screen. I came home, took a closer look on my monitor. Yep, not that great. Grainy (at 80 ISO) and colors were just kind of off. I took some head-to-head shots of stuff around my desk with the 110 HS, took both raw and JPEG files with the Lumix, kept the aperture at 2.8 to make a fair comparison (Canon is a f/2.7 maximum aperture). I could not deny the results. Canon was just much better, at both color rendition and details. I mean, my 5 year-old could tell the difference when zoomed in to actual pixels. Don't get me wrong, I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this camera - after all, I plunked down significant cash on it. At the end of the day, I decided to keep the Canon and sell the Lumix. Just for the record, I probably had between 10 and 20 compact digital cameras through the years, a few Canons, a Nikon, a few Panasonics, an Olympus, a Fuji... so I speak from some experience. In the compact world, Canons rule.","Amazing lens, very good functionality and performance, great low-light photos taken without flash regardless of zoom setting. Good battery life, fairly light and compact, well built. Distinctly better than previous LX3 and also Olympus XZ1, which was sold once this LX7 was used. Shooting in RAW format yields the best results, printing up A3-sized photos of great quality without a problem.<br />The video recordings are also very good, and no wonder there are now several sites dedicated to the LX7's usage as a semi-pro HD videocam (with an external audio recorder), not to mention many examples of slick videos made with this camera.<br />At current prices often under $300, there is no better quality compact-sized camera - Canon, Nikon, Olympus can't compete, while the rival Sony RX100 is still twice the price (and less good lens).","[This review appears on my web site along with some 1920x1440 photo samples and a video frame-grab. Search my name to find it.]<br /><br />After several months of playing with the pocketable Panasonic DMC-LX7, here is what I think about it so far...:<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />-- The overall design, small size, low weight, and handling characteristics of the Panasonic LX7 are excellent - and it even fits nicely into a shirt pocket!<br />-- Its 24mm-90mm lens (35mm full-frame equivalent) is a very good and fast f1.4-f2.3, and it can take surprisingly good stills and video even in low light levels.<br />-- The zoom range can be extended from 24mm to 180mm-equivalent with \"iZoom\" enabled, with surprisingly good quality even at 180mm. The image quality does decline gradually as the zoom is extended beyond 90mm, but it remains useable for smaller images even at 180mm. The good close-focus capabilities of this lens are also maintained, so decent macro images can be made even at 180mm.<br />-- Close-focus photos can easily be taken with the LX7, and even animal activities can be caught due to the very fast shutter response.<br />-- The LX7 is very easy to use and to control in ALL modes. This camera was designed to be used by both snap-shooters and by those who like to \"fiddle with the guts\" while using a camera.<br />-- It has MANY good adjustments in well-designed and organized menus, and numerous external controls are also available for changing and optimizing camera functions. Some of these can even affect aspects of the internal digital image processing that are normally beyond user control. All things can be independently adjusted, and the LX7 gets an A+++ for this. A brief printed manual is included with the box, and the rather lengthy complete manual is included on a disk, also in the box, along with some additional photo and video editing software. The LX7 complete manual (all 226 pages of it!) is also available online as a PDF file.<br />-- The built-in light metering display and the camera leveling indicators are good. Interesting is the ability to move the image in the display panel upward to clear some information display areas (and all non-image material can also be cleared from the display).<br />-- The high-resolution OLED rear screen is good, and it can be made VERY bright by adding together the effects of adjusting a couple of different menu controls (although doing this does shorten the small battery's run time). Several other types of display adjustments can also be applied to customize the viewing image. I find the LX7's screen easy to use for precise framing, even in sunlight.<br />-- Mini USB/AV and HDMI ports are provided.<br />-- A high-resolution accessory EVF is available, but it is relatively expensive compared with the original cost of the camera - and it may well be worth the price for some users.<br />-- The lens is quite sharp, and it is even good when used wide-open throughout its zoom range (which is limited compared with that of many other compact cameras - but that trade-off is a useful one for having generally much increased lens speed available, and also for having its very high lens image quality).<br />-- Having an aperture ring on the lens is handy, as is having the focus-mode and aspect-ratio selection switches also on the lens rather than having those functions in the menus.<br />-- Setting the aperture to f2.2 (or to a smaller aperture) results in having what is essentially a constant-aperture zoom lens, useful when shooting video.<br />-- The easily-engaged macro function works well for extending the lens focus range, and it is a useful feature.<br />-- The various available shooting aspect ratios are 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, and 1:1 and, except for the last, all use the maximum sensor diameter available for the aspect ratio chosen. As a result, the image frame's long-side coverage angle is greatest with the aspect ratio set to 16:9, which can be useful with some types of subjects and with video with the lens set at its shortest focal length.<br />-- The photo quality is generally very good, even in fairly low light levels - and video shot in low light is also surprisingly good.<br />-- Image noise is fairly low, especially for a camera with a small sensor.<br />-- The image doesn't have faults commonly seen in competing models, such as obvious CA problems, field curvature, illumination problems, and soft corners (and sometimes even soft edges). Even at remarkably wide stops, corners and edges look good in the LX7 images.<br />-- The image stabilization works well, and it permits the successful hand-held use of shutter speeds that are considerably slower than those normally possible.<br />-- Auto-focus is very fast and accurate, even in low light levels. I have been able to shoot sharp close-ups of a cat in low light that would be very difficult with any other camera I have used.<br />-- Overall, the color is excellent - with a minor exception being that it sometimes tends to render some reds as more orange than they really are (although it often avoids a common tendency for blue skies to tend toward green in lighter-toned areas near the horizon).<br />-- The video specifications are the same as for the excellent Panasonic TM700 camcorder, having a 28Mbps 1920x1080 60P video mode available (but, see below...).<br />-- The video image is (fortunately!) unusually free of the common CMOS rolling-shutter distortion with panning.<br />-- Video shot in bright light can be good (but not excellent), but (in common with most other still cameras with video added) it is not as good as that shot with a good similar-spec camera designed primarily for shooting video. The 28Mbps 1060-60P video is, though, MUCH nicer-looking than the 720P \"AVCHD-Lite\" video offered on many other compact cameras. It also looks better with motion than the video taken with most other cameras, which are limited to a 30P sensor frame rate.<br />-- Video shot in low or medium light levels can look quite good, possibly because the lower edge contrasts likely to exist there show fewer of the image defects that can be more evident in bright light.<br />-- A stereo microphone is included for video.<br />-- Compared with the Panasonic GH3 body plus a zoom lens, the LX7 costs a small fraction of the price, it is FAR smaller and lighter, and its lens is generally almost three stops faster - but the video quality taken with Panasonic's best current micro four thirds format bodies is often considerably better.<br />-- Given its high quality, its price can be quite moderate compared with its competition. While the  Panasonic DCM-LX7 retails for $500 in the US, it often sells for $450, and occasionally it even sells for $300, making it then a \"steal\"! Also, its functionally-identical \"partner\" camera (the Leica D-LUX 6) continues to sell for $800!<br />-- A quite good 1.4-megapixel compact eye-level viewfinder is available for the LX7, and it can tilt up for low-level shooting.<br /><br />As I continue to enjoy using the LX7, I remain very impressed with (and surprised by) its photo image quality. Overall, the LX7 is a VERY good all-purpose pocket camera which is stronger with stills than it is with video, and it can take high-quality stills and better-than-OK video under a surprisingly wide range of conditions...<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />-- The LX7 has a poorly-designed lens cap, and I replaced the original cap with something else that worked better - but if the original cap is used and it isn't removed before turning on the camera, the camera warns that it must be removed before turning the camera on again, preventing damage to the lens extension mechanism.<br />-- One must pay an absurd amount for a small accessory threaded filter ring adapter and a new lens cap in order to fit 37mm filters on the lens. This part should have been originally made an integral part of the lens front structure. I ordered the replacement, but I was unable to remove the front ring from the lens to permit the installation of the Panasonic accessory ring, so I cancelled the order. I was also unable to remove the larger ring around the lens (this should bayonet off...) to add an inexpensive auto-folding cap. I eventually made my own cap with one that now covers most of the retracted lens barrel, and it comes off easily enough so that there can be no possible damage to the lens extension and zooming mechanism when the camera is turned on.<br />-- There is no way to attach lens converters to the front of the lens (even with the accessory 37mm lens thread adapter installed on the lens) since the weight would have an ill effect on the lens telescoping and zooming mechanism.<br />-- Serious lens flare is too often apparent when the sun is within the field of view or just outside of it (but otherwise there are generally no lens flare issues).<br />-- Panorama photos often have unwanted vertical lines in them, and therefore using that mode may result in unsatisfactory images.<br />-- The unmodified video quality is often so-so even in 28Mbps 1080-60P mode. Also, no matter what the picture settings are for video, some sharpening \"halos\" still show on high-contrast edges, as, oddly, do some occasional \"stair-stepping\" (aliasing) artifacts which are not ordinarily very evident with progressive scan 1080 video. These may indicate the use of some over-sharpening to offset sharpness losses that occur with down-sampling the stills resolution to the video resolution. Even so, the HD video quality from this camera (given its very small size) can look surprisingly good.<br />-- The zoom control is generally too fast for video use, and the LX7 unfortunately lacks menu control over its speed.<br />-- There is no remote control of any kind available.<br />-- While the LX7 can record acceptable-quality stereo sound with its built-in microphone, it (not surprisingly) doesn't have microphone and headphone jacks.<br /><br />Overall, the LX7 is a nifty little camera, but I think it could easily have been even a bit better - but I really like this camera, I enjoy using it, and the results from it are surprisingly good!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />--DR","I absolutely love this camera. Had to downgrade from the dslr systems so I do miss some of my old lens capabilities. But this camera suits more of my needs than not. The only complaint I would have, is that the HDR filter within the camera is not really useful. Maybe I'm just used to the HDR filters in apps. Anyways, this is a camera not an editing tool. Also my favorite thing about this camera is the macro capabilities. True 1:1 macro. Images are all true to color, sharp, and consistent.","This camera does everything pretty well but what I particularly love are its B&W settings (monochrome) and is macro focus. I take tons of close up pictures that are just incredible. It has tons of custom settings so you can pretty do anything you want with it with the exception of more megapixels/resolution. That would be the only limitation.","I sold my Nikon D90 because it was too much of a struggle to carry with me all the time, also the cost of additional lenses were too high for hobby purposes.<br />This camera is the perfect balance because it's light, pocketable (depends) and makes exceptional pictures and shoots great video. Settings are pro-like and easy to find.<br />The only downside after the D90 was the battery life, because with heavy usage, it would last from 8am-5pm but no more. I bought an extra factory-made battery so now it's the perfect setup.","This is the only compact camera that will allow you to take publication-grade photos of interiors and exteriors. The crucial factors are the 24mm equivalent zoom, RAW, a hot shoe, and a very fast lens. The difference between 24mm and 28mm may not sound like much, but it's often the difference between usable and unusable in interior shots. (24mm gives you a view angle of about 84 deg while 28mm is good for about 74 deg).<br /><br />The hot shoe allows you to mount either a strong flash (with suitable light modifier) or a wireless transmitter to trigger strobes. The Panasonic DMW-FL360 External Flash (GN36) for Panasonic L1 DSLR and FZ50 Digital Camera is a good flash that integrates closely with the LX7. For architectural work, however, a strong manually-set flash is all you need, and substantially cheaper.<br /><br />Most people like the auto settings the LX7 chooses, while some don't, but it's basically irrelevant for architectural imaging, where you almost always want to shoot a series of RAW images spaced 1.33 or 1.5 EV apart over a total range that may, in some cases, need to be as great as 11 or 12 EV. The LX7 makes this easy in manual mode.<br /><br />You can get even better results with a modern dSLR or micro 4/3 body paired with a fast 24mm lens -- particularly in terms of lower noise and finer detail in dark areas. But a 24mm lens as fast as the LX7's is going to set you back something like $2,000. And of course the result is not as portable.<br /><br />One of the features of the LX7 that can be pretty useful for quick shots in many circumstances is its HDR mode. It won't match what you can do by shooting a RAW sequence over a broad dynamic range and processing them in ACR 7 and Nik HDR Efex 2, but it's vastly faster and often does a remarkably good job.<br /><br />For exteriors (and landscapes) the LX7 makes it reasonably easy to mount a polarizer. It's worth spending the extra for the Panasonic digital camera options PL filter DMW-LPLA37 because it has a particularly low profile that minimizes any risk of vignetting at wide angles.<br /><br />The LX7 may or may not be the best compact for general photography, but it's definitely a very good one. For me that's a bonus on top of its wonderful performance for architectural photography.<br /><br />*  *  *<br /><br />Added: I see that people express frustration with the the price of the Panasonic digital camera options filter adapter Kit DMW-FA1 and the difficulty of installing it. There are solutions. I got EzFoto 37mm filter adapter ring & Chamois Cleaning Cloth for Panasonic Lumix DMC LX-7 Leica D-LUX 6, replaces Panasonic DMW-FA1 Filter Adapter, which does the job well for much less money. It does not come with a lens cap, as the Panasonic does, but a substitute can be acquired cheaply -- for instance Everydaysource Camera Lens Cap , 37mm Black, which has a string to attach it to the camera.<br /><br />I did spend the money for a (very expensive) genuine Panasonic digital camera options PL filter DMW-LPLA37 rather than one of the cheaper alternatives because the LPLA37 (but not the Panasonic DMW-LPL37 37mm Circular Polarizer Filter) is made to be very thin so that it doesn't cause vignetting at wide angles.<br /><br />Many have complained that they cannot unscrew the thread protector from the front of the lens so that the adaptor may be attached in its place. The problem is that it's all but impossible to get a good enough grip on the small, smooth protector. The solution is a rubber grip pad, such as Fox Run Rubber Jar Opener. With this you grip the little ring firmly enough to turn it.","It is compact and easy to carry around and yet with lots of manual controls.  The picture quality is very good.  It is not a 5 because the external lens cap is annoying.  It should have a built-in lens cap.  With all the features and quality at a reasonable price, I guess I have to live with the minor design flaw.","I have noticed a lot of people like to compare this camera to the Sony RX100, and the older LX3. However, I compared it to the Leica D-LUX 6 which is almost identical to the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7, except for a very few slight variants, the biggest, being that the Leica cost about $800, while this LX7 can currently be gotten for around $350.  I bought it for it's Macro capabilities, to replace my outdated Nikon D70.  I like how it can focus in the Macro range under the manual control, and the macro auto focus works great as well.  Instead of having to take many retakes of Jewelry to get that perfect shot, I was able to get the perfect shot in one take.  Within 5 photos, I knew this by far was the best camera I have ever used.","Since the first time you'll get this device in your hands you'd love the premium feel, the grip as well as its very attractive design with a combination of both modern and retro look.<br />As for the quality there is nothing to say as this camera will do everything you'd expect it to do. Everything looks very good. Most of low light shots I've taken so far were without activating the flash and yet the shutter speed is very fast and the photos are full of light and detail, too.<br />You'd really love the startup time of the camera as well as the very fast focusing which will make your experience worriless.<br />The video clips are very nice in terms of video and audio quality.<br />If I'd go and mention every positive aspect of this camera I'd have to write a very long review as it really performs very good in every situation be it photo or video shooting. The only downside I'd mention is the camera's weight but yet nothing that you can not handle as well as its relatively slow zooming time however is nothing that really bothers that much so far.<br />In few words I'd say this camera is one of the best cameras in terms of quality and value of its range.<br />I'd recommend it to everyone looking for a camera of this range.","I am no professional photographer, but I researched this camera for several reasons: I had a bad experience with another high-end point and shoot that did terrible in low light, indoors, and at night; I am about to have my first baby and wanted a camera that would capture my important memories without blurry pictures; and I wanted it to fit in my diaper bag or purse.<br /><br />This camera has far exceeded my expectations in every way. My husband and I just took it on vacation and I was blown away with the quality of the low light, indoor, and night photos I took, sometimes of objects miles away over water. I took over 500 pictures and NONE came out blurry. I cannot tell you how happy I am with this purchase. Would recommend this camera to anyone with similar needs to mine.","FORWARD: Despite my best intentions with my original product review, many Amazonian faithful found issue with my approach in comparing it to another camera that I also purchased here on Amazon. My hope was to 1.) illustrate WHY I came to the conclusions I did instead of just saying so and 2.) to offer an alternative camera suggestion in the event that searchers wanted such an opinion. However, because we only have words here and true intention is sometimes misinterpreted, I've acquiesced to the flustered parties and redrafted my review to focus just on this camera and it's pros and cons alone. Undoubtedly others will still disagree with my opinions (they are opinions after all) on the camera for sure, but but suffice it to say, I've done my best to iron out the wrinkles that some found with my original review.<br /><br />AT THE END OF THE DAY, I SINCERELY HOPE YOU ENJOY WHATEVER CAMERA YOU PURCHASE, BE IT THE LX7 OR ANY OTHER.<br /><br />MY NEEDS: I wanted something with decent optics, a usable zoom range, decent low light performance (high ISO), a hi-res screen, accessory shoe and access to full manual controls. Pocketable wasn't a major criteria, but the big SLR-style super zooms were definitely out. My target budget was no more than $400 if I could help it.<br /><br />I considered several models, but at the end of the day the LX7 was one of the cameras I really wanted to try.<br /><br />COST: When I purchased mine in April 2013 the Panasonic had astonishingly dropped to an impressive $289 in the black body. It had been around $399. As of this redraft it's about $330 which increases the value (and therefore my overall rating) of this camera.<br /><br />HANDLING: The LX7 is a smallish, sleek little camera. The downside to this is that there isn't a lot of grip in my opinion, but many users looking at a camera in this class my be looking for clean and sleek over robust and grippy. It can make it easier to get in and out of a coat pocket, for example, and it's arguably more contemporary and sophisticated looking than some of the competition.<br /><br />OPTICS: The LX7's lens is somewhat wider than a lot of the competition (24mm, vs. say, 28mm) and is noticeably faster in the aperture department. The 24-90mm or so equiv. zoom range is admirable for general use, but those seeking a bit more zoom should obviously look elsewhere. There are other cameras that boast longer ranges in not extraordinarily larger packages. Keep in mind, however, that the longer the tele, the slower the aperture, esp. in bodies in this class. Images are generally pretty sharp, even in lower light, but I found the macro mode to be somewhat sluggish and even with manual focus tweaking activated, images often came out soft and even hazy. This wasn't in every case, but it was often enough over a short enough period of time to certainly stand out. On the plus side, the camera has an excellent aperture ring setup and the f/1.4 max aperture is a real bonus and the feature that Pana pushes the hardest to help separate itself from the pack. Aside from the mentioned frustrations, it's a good lens.<br /><br />METERING/COLOR: While the LX7's color and, most of the time, it's exposure are fairly good in natural light, especially outdoors, the camera does have a tendency to overexpose and in artificial light white balance can be heavily skewed. Colors are often rendered dull and inaccurate under these circumstance. Ironically, despite the tendency to over expose many general shots, esp. the highlights, the camera seemed to suffer from a bit of underexposure in interior settings. This was one of the major concerns I had when deciding whether or not to keep the camera. Keep in mind that if you're willing to help the camera out, you can fix many of these problems with manual adjustments to exposure, saturation, etc. However, for a camera with these capabilities (fast lens, current sensor/processor) and at this price point, I feel that the results can and should be more accurate out of the box.<br /><br />HIGH ISO: The LX7 is good at ISO performance esp. through 400. By 800 however, many other cameras in this class that I've both owned and tried begin to really stand out. Most general shooters likely wont have too much to quibble about here, but for the price, know that other models can give you cleaner images under more demanding circumstances despite the faster lens on the LX7. If you're current camera is an iPhone or a 3+ year old PAS, you will likely have no issue with image noise.<br /><br />LCD: This was another area that was super annoying. The screen isn't very high res.  in PRACTICE, despite the 920K rating. The menus look crisp and vivid, but actual live view in shooting seemed subpar for a camera of this quality. It looked pixelated in use. I couldn't figure this out. Maybe it was refresh rate. Too many other cameras in this class have a cleaner live view mode. It won't make or break an image, but it is frustrating when there's no other framing option like a built in EVF. (Keep in mind the optional EVF for this is VERY good in my opinion).<br /><br />QUICK LIST OF ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND GENERAL BULLET PRO/CON:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Fast lens - f/1.4-2.3 is outstanding for light capture<br />- Excellent aperture ring - can adjust aperture by twisting the lens ring<br />- Handy AF switch - quickly adjust from AF, Macro AF to MF with a 3-click slider<br />- Great construction, solid feel - but a bit slick and not a lot of \"grip\"<br />- Small for the feature set - e.g. there's a decent amount of tech in this smallish size<br />- Hard coated LCD is easy to clean<br />- Quick AF under most circumstances<br />- Quick one-click ND filter<br />- Excellent OIS (stabilization)<br />- Decent macro (but can produce milky, soft details)<br />- 2 custom modes<br />- Accessory shoe for flash or EVF<br />- Video in 60fps (though ridiculous MTS format), 30fps, 120 fps<br />- Excellent OPTIONAL EVF w/ tilt 90 (a stretch to list as a pro since it's not included and more than $100 more)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Menu resetting is MADDENING, if you accidentally back out of the menu system, you start at the top of the first setting, NOT where you left off<br />- Aspect ratio switch is a waste of a good switch space IMO<br />- Menus are not intuitive<br />- Back jog wheel is too close to body, rotating not smooth<br />- Lower resolution image detail on LCD in use (menu graphics are sharp however)<br />- Somewhat disappointing performance over ISO 400, esp. in decent light<br />- Traditional 3:2 slightly lower res than 4:3 ratio<br />- Zoom tele a tad short for the class at 90mm, even with the aperture at that mark<br />- Zoom is slow compared to some competition<br />- Tad harder to grip due to slick materials and minimalistic design<br />- MF magnified viewing is terrible, performance not much better<br />- 120fps video only 720p with no manual controls (only EV comp)<br />- Only 1 function button<br />- No histogram in video mode<br />- No Kelvin option WB<br />- Inconsistencies in WB and color, esp. in artificial light<br />- Camera has a tendency to overexpose, esp. in outdoor shots in daylight<br />- Color is mostly good, but can be rendered muted at times<br /><br />NOTE: Extensive AF performance in video mode not tested.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: When I set out to get a PAS in this class, I pretty much had my mind made up on the LX7. The look and potential of the LX7 is good, but too many problems and inconsistencies with usability and image quality were enough to justify returning it. For general everyday shooting it's a decent camera. However, I do feel that it should be smarter out of the box when it comes to exposure, white balance and color under artificial lighting. More experienced users my find other issues with output like edge softness, ISO performance, etc. These things in and of themselves aren't devastatingly bad, but more experienced users will likely pay closer attention to these things and find that they come up short of the mark when compared to other cameras in this class.<br /><br />I returned this camera in favor of a different one in the same class. Many users are EXTREMELY happy with this camera and you may very well end up being one of them - and I hope you are. But I encourage you to try out as many models in your budget as you can before making your final decision - this is just smart shopping - and take full advantage of Amazon's excellent return policy if ANY camera you decide upon doesn't suit you needs.<br /><br />RATING BY USER TYPE:<br /><br />\"An every day Joe looking for a good point and shoot that will be superior to your iPhone, is sleek and sophisticated and under many situations will produce admirable quality output\" I'd say this is a 3-4 camera (though I would advise shopping around)<br /><br />\"For the more experienced user who knows their way around camera settings and exposure, who's looking for an every day camera so the DSLR can stay at home and who is more likely by their nature to notice exposure, WB and color inconsistencies\" I'd say this is more of a 2-3  camera. (IMO there are other cameras in this price range that will better suit your needs)<br /><br />OVERALL: 3 stars. Despite the limitations and performance issues that I encountered, I think many general audiences will really like this camera. I certainly do believe there are better performers and values in this class, but the LX7 offers enough good features to warrant an average rating.","I sold my canon 30d DSLR and bunch of lens then purchased this p&s LX7.<br />Especially HD movie mode is best ever!<br />I couldn't call it just highend or p&s easy camera.<br />really can enjoy as a manual mode if you want.<br />also I bought the used which one is deal on amazon site. full re-package, perfect condition just like new, around 250 bucks!<br />looks good, takes good.","24mm, f1.4, RAW, Lecia lens, need I say more. The perfect compact for architects, with a very wide lens for constrianed interiors, fast glass for dark interior spaces, RAW to allow a wide range of post processing to increase shadow detail, and crisp detail for printing and electronic documentation. Way less hassle than lugging a DSLR with a superwide lens. Shoots RAW plus JPEG, so you can later decide if you want to keep just the JPEGs, or archive the RAW files to keep as an record or to edit your architectural work.","Good picture quality... so far only complain is the lense cap... it should've been automatic as in the ZS Series.","I'm a big fan of Lumix cameras, having owned the GF1 with several Lumix lenses and having previously used the LX3. The LX7 has great reviews, so I was looking forward to receiving it.<br /><br />I have charged up the battery and just powered it on to take a few pictures and received an error message (system error (OIS)).  I've tried several more times and each time, I can just about manage to take 1 photo or get 20s into the menu system before the same error message comes up. I checked online forums and found someone had a similar issue with the previous model, but didn't see any replies on how to resolve, so I assume it's not a common problem.<br /><br />I'm sure this is still a great camera, but am disappointed in the quality control given Panasonic Lumix's reputation. I eventually managed to contact Panasonic and they require me to ship the unit to their repair center in TX. I received slightly different instructions on how to do the return via their web service vs a service agent. I haven't been impressed by Panasonic's service considering I own many of their products and have found them great.<br /><br />Thank goodness I bought this on Amazon though. Amazon sent an immediate replacement and asked me to ship the faulty unit back without charge. I've already adjusted the custom settings to my preference and snapped some indoor pictures.  The speed of the lens is fantastic (i prefer to avoid using the flash), and the autofocus performs well - quick enough for me to take pictures of my son running through the apartment. I'm a big fan of Panasonic's iA setting (auto), which is intelligent enough to pick the right settings for the photos I'm taking. The range of filters looks fantastic too - I've been using the HDR option on my iPhone for backlit outdoor shots and am happy the LX7 features this now.<br /><br />I've revised my initial rating from a disappointed 1 star to a happy 4 stars. I know this camera will do everything I want and more, but haven't been impressed by Panasonic USA's customer service process, so with-holding a full 5 stars.<br /><br />In case you're looking for a case for the LX7, I did a lot of research and eventually chose the Lowepro Rezo50 from Amazon. It fits the LX7 perfectly, with a small zip pouch at the front for a spare battery or memory card.","The bright F1.4 len of the new LX7 is very useful in low light condition. However, please be reminded that a F1.4 in a compact camera is different from a F1.4 in a DSLR.","Panasonic has a winner in the LX7. When I saw the great price Amazon had one day, I grabbed it and I am not disappointed in the camera. I love the fast lens. Like others have said, the lens cap is joke, what were you thinking, Panasonic? Luckily, other companies have a better lens cap. I have a number of p & s cameras, this is because I can't afford the Canon wide-angle lens that I want (maybe if I stopped buying p & s cameras...). The LX7 has a 24mm wa length and I love it, plus you can zoom out if you want to. I am not that impressed with the macro function but I am still learning the features of the camera so I am probably doing something wrong. It does close focus very well. A problem that I have is that Photoshop CS5 doesn't support LX7 Raw format so I have to use Silkypix to shoot raw. That is a beef I and others have with Adobe, I understand their point but it's frustrating for consumers. Why should I have have to buy CS6? The HDR function is just ok, it would be nice is you could select whether you want 3, 5, or 7 exposures combined and the output is jpeg, raw would be better, it comes out better than a single exposure. Other cameras output jpeg too. Don't just take my word for it, check out Flickr groups and see the picture quality of the LX7.","Very good product for the price.  It does what it was advertised to do.  It would be nice if the zoom was a little bigger and it had more mp's.  However the lens is great and makes up for the other things.  Overall I am very satisfied.","Purchased to replace LX3, which I loved and got 4 years of solid use out of. Gave to my dad. I was going to upgrade to the RX100, but did not want to spend $600+ on this type of camera. At $300 for the LX7, I thought it was a good compromise. It's not really truly pocketable, but something I can put in my coat pocket, in my wife's purse, or around my neck. Since I came from the LX3, the menus didn't really bother me. The image quality is on par with the LX3, video is much better, especially the \"slow mo\" ability. However, image quality pales in comparison to that of my Canon 60D with Sigma 30/f1.4 lens. I thought that I would be able to go with the LX7 full time and thus sold my 60D, but no realize that for indoor photos of my family, I'll need to replace the 60D with another large sensor camera (at least APS-C). The LX7 will suffice for outdoor stuff, videos, and photos in good light. I'm waiting to see how Fuji upgrades the XPRO1/XE1 to decide how to replace the 60D.<br /><br />If you can get the LX7 for <$300, then I'd do it. You won't get a better deal than that. If you can wait, then look for better point and shoot cameras with APS-C sensors and fixed lenses through the end of the year and into early 2014.","This lightweight, beautifully made camera does everything I want it to do better than any of my bigger and more expensive cameras.  One problem only: the LCD isn't bright enough in direct sunshine.<br /><br />If not for that, this would be a six-star rating.","The lens and image quality are better than anything I have seen. Blows my Nikon SLR out of the water I terms of features and ease of use. I love it so far. Time lapse feature is a little hard to work out. Read the reviews to set your mind at ease, buy this camera, and start shooting some of the best pictures.<br /><br />One thing I'd change is the lens cap and the ability to quickly add filters and the battery life seems just OK.","I love this camera...great image quality, great video quality, nice control placement and nice menu system... I can tell you the image quality at 24mm, F4 and ISO 80 is the same as mi Nikon D300s with the nikon 12-24mm @f8.0...","I purchased this camera for my wife. It needed to fulfill the following requirements:<br /><br />1. Size: compact enough to carry around in a handbag<br />2. Ease of use: point and shoot<br />3. High image quality<br /><br />We were able to try it out on a short trip. How did it do?<br /><br />1. Size: Acceptable<br />I would not call it a compact -- it's somewhere between a compact and a micro 4/3. It's just small enough, but the lens on the front causes the case to be a bit bulkier.<br /><br />2. Ease of use: Failed. Reasons:<br />- The iA mode (and iA+) is not intelligent enough. It would choose lower shutter speeds than needed, given this is a very fast lens. I created a Custom 1 settings that negates some of this (minimum shutter speed 1/60 and max ISO 1600). What you lose by using C1 mode is some of the smarts that are helpful, such as the detection of portrait or landscape photography and other enhancements, which is a pity.<br />- The flash does not pop up automatically. Also something you do not want to think about.<br />- Lens cap has to be removed manually. Will likely purchase one of these aftermarket lens caps.<br /><br />3. Image quality: Acceptable<br />Under the right conditions, and with all settings selected correctly, the images look very good. Forget iA mode indoors, as it will disappoint with low shutters speeds, especially with the flash not popped up. Also, somewhat unexpected, I noticed a good amount of lens flare in various images, taken indoor and outdoor. What you get is a mixed bag of images, regarding quality.<br /><br />Overall<br />We were on the verge of returning this camera, but the reality is, that at this price point (we paid $300) and size, there is hardly anything else that competes with this camera. Like said before, when you get everything right, it does make very nice pictures. Compared to the previous compact Panasonic my wife has, this is still somewhat of a setback regarding convenience. There is just too much thinking required for quick point and shoot type of situations:<br /><br />- Take lens cap off<br />- Switch on camera<br />- Are we indoors and there is decent/low light? Switch to C1.<br />- Are we indoors and there is not enough light? Popup flash. May consider iA mode now.<br />- Are we outdoors? Switch to iA mode.<br /><br />All of the above would be so much simpler if iA mode actually works.<br /><br />Panasonic folks - please provide a small update to the iA mode. Make it just a teeny bit smarter regarding balancing shutter speed and ISO (don't go lower than 1/60 or make that an option). A small change will make a huge difference and will push this camera in the top of its class. Right now it's a bit crippled (great hardware, but a broken iA mode). An electronic flash popup will make it even better.","I weighed up buying the Sony RX100 and this camera.  While the RX100 generally gets slightly better reviews due to its large sensor, I got this on special offer from Amazon at half the price of the Sony.  I really don't care much about the number of megapixels... so long as the lens is good.  This lens is exceptionally good, even at full aperture.  At the price I can carry it around and not worry as much.<br /><br />I have previously been very disappointed with particularly the low-light performance of every compact digital camera (last was an 8MP Canon) I've owned, instead using Nikon D50 and then D90 DSLR with prime (35mm and 50mm) lenses.<br /><br />The image quality is exceptional, and comparable to many zoom lenses on DSLRs.  The wide aperture allows me to avoid using flash indoors (which I hate), and I can get a great background blur for portraits.  While I had previously almost exclusively used aperture priority on the DSLRs, the Intelligent Auto on this camera does a great job of making good decisions based on its recognition of scenes.<br /><br />This is the first compact that I've bought that I can really use acceptably in place of the DSLR in many situations.","Great low-light camera.  Small and light enough to take anywhere--I didn't want a bulky SLR.  Sharp blur-free pictures even in dim-light.  Very sharp view screen just like Apple's Retina display.  In my opinion, it beats 1/1.7in CMOS competitors like the bulky G15, S110, P7700 in performance and features.  Love the HDR (takes multiple shots for greater dynamic range in the picture.)  Good battery life--no complaints.  I couldn't afford the leading larger-sensor size Sony RX-100, so this camera is a great compromise.  My only peeve is it doesn't have an auto-lens cover.  I often forget to remove the lens cap while powering it on.","Other than having the red LEICA dot & name on the body for about $500.00 more, this is the best all around compact digital camera that is an all purpose carry around camera that one could hope for.<br /><br />I know that's saying a lot but a 25mm~90mm zoom lens with a f/1.4~f/2.3 aperture is fantastic. I very rarely use flash and this camera gives me that extra edge in \"available darkness\" shooting.<br /><br />My next favorite camera that this replaced was my old standby Nikon Coolpix 8400 with a 24mm~85mm ED Nikkor zoom lens.","I bought this camera as a replacement for my 2 year old CanonG12. I absolutely love my trusty G12, but my 53 year old eyes really could use a viewfinder better than the optical one on the Canon. So I thought the Lx7 with the optional LVF2 viewfinder would be just the ticket.<br /><br />When the camera arrived, I was very pleased with the overall package. The LVF2 provided exactly what I wanted in terms of a viewfinder, it is bright and sharp and with the diopter adjustment i could see my subjects with laser precision The f1.4 lens with 24mm wide angle seemed like great improvements over my G12's f2.8 28mm wide angle. I knew I was giving up 50mm in telephoto length, but figured the trade off would be worth it for the faster wider Lx7 lens.<br /><br />Then I started shooting and I was happy with ergonomics and camera feel. I shot comparison shots of everything with my canon as well. After shooting I was convinced that I had made a good upgrade choice. Then I started looking critically at my results. What I saw, was that the LX 7 produced very nice images. And if I had nothing else to compare them too, I would probably have been happy with my purchase. But when I compared the images critically with those from the G12, there was not a single image where the G12 did not look better and in some cases much better. It was better in terms of noise, better in terms of color balance, better in terms of sharpness and more often than not better in terms of the exposure choices it made. Now, I know much of this was due to jpeg processing. I think I just like the processing the Canon provides better than Panasonic's. And yes, I could shoot raw and post process, for the best image quality but that is not my thing.<br /><br />The LX7 has a bit of a noise problem that starts at ISO 400 and the G12 is good to 1600. I thought the 2 stop faster lens would make up for this, but that was not the case in the critically examined images.<br /><br />Overall this is a good camera. I would say it is a very good camera in most respects, but it is not at the top of class, or even close, for jpeg image quality. So I will be returning it along with the truly incredible LVF2. I really wish I could slap an LVF2 on my G12, and I would be in heaven. A minor issue was the fact that the Lx7 with the LVF2 viewfinder on top doesn't fit into any of the commercially available small camera cases designed for a belt loop and that makes carrying it a bit more difficult and the lense cap is inconvenient, but I know there is an aftermarket cap that can solve that issue.","It is said that the LX7  is not better than LX5.<br /><br />I dont know that, but the price of LX7 when I bought was not reasonable.<br /><br />At least, it's conventient and useful.","CMOS chip, though smaller yields better res. Fast lens yields heretofore impossible good effects, Broader array of programmed effects. New lower price: you can't miss!!","I was amazed with the beautiful color in the photo.<br />The HDR setting is so good.  The special settings whether in scenes or creative control give many options to make very unique photos.  I also use the manual settings and like the close up in the aperture priority setting mode.  I have generally used other major brand name cameras, however, this little Panasonic Lumix rates right up there with the best!","I started photography on a classic film SLR, and moved up through various point-and-shoots.  This camera was a gift: My requirements were that 1) it needed instant response, unlike my old digital with the lag, and 2) it have manual override so I could get more creative with certain shots.<br /><br />I like to think of myself as pretty good when it comes to figuring out things with menus.  I can't figure out this camera.  I can't even figure out why the flash doesn't work, even when I have it set to flash.  At least, I think I do. I can't seem to locate the most basic functions on this camera, and any one page of the instruction manual (which I had to download from a website, since it's not included) is almost too technical to understand.  I suppose I will have to read through all 180 pages and hope for the best.<br /><br />I would return this camera if I could and go with one that has fewer bells and whistles.  The shame is, it takes excellent pictures and quickly.  However, it's so much effort to learn how to use that I often default to the iPhone camera.","I love this camera.  It's compact size belies its super ability to take pictures in low light.  With this camera I donot use flash anymore.  It reminds of the old range finder Leica.  It can be best used as a street walk around camera for quick shoots. This is the same camera as Leica dlux 6 but at half the price and at a discounted $300 it is a bargain.","I really wanted to give this a 5, because this camera is great for me, and I love using it. However, there are enough small issues to dock a star, so I had to go to 4. Let's start with what I like I suppose. I personally like shooting in Raw and jpeg, as I like the option to post process. I also have the Micro Four Thirds system, with a few cameras (OMD, GF3, GX1(former), EPL1) and several lenses. The quality, bokeh, etc of this camera isn't the same as the m43s, but it is far better than a standard point and shoot or a camera phone. It has pretty acceptable noise up to ISO 800, and takes excellent photos. It's size is also good: while the lens does stick out a bit, I can fit it into most of my pockets, and when I can't, it can fit in a small unobtrusive belt pouch. Aesthetically I think it looks nice as well: I purchased the white one myself. At $300(which it goes down to from time to time) it's also an excellent price. The camera gives you very excellent manual controls, auto bracketing up to 3 shots at 3 EV(loved this for HDR), and several built in features. It has several custom modes that can be saved with full settings, which averts one of the negatives below.<br /><br />Now for the bad. I haven't used it much, but from what little I've used it, and from what I've read online, the iAuto of this camera is pretty bad. I've seen it reduce the shutter speed too low on occasion, and it probably has some other issues, or features I wouldn't normally use. I don't like iAuto, so this is fine for me, but some people want a point and shoot with minimal setup, and this may be an issue. This can be averted by using one of the custom modes and setting various settings and limits (such as minimum shutter speed, maximum ISO, etc etc). There is an excellent guide on youtube and dpreview about this. Continuing on, I also had issues with the flash. I had to manually adjust the flash compensation when using the flash at close distances; it was washing out faces at close portrait distance. Finally, higher ISO settings have unpleasant noise, high chroma and banding, which I couldn't remove as easily, and I haven't kept a shot above 800.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Excellent Manual control (PASM, ability to set min shutter speed, and lots of other goodies)<br />Quite good Intelligent Zoom, though I don't use this much.<br />Very good image quality at low to midrange(800) ISO.<br />Raw, I don't like shooting without it<br />Price: When it goes for $300 new, this price is excellent.<br />Very fast lens throughout entire zoom range, great for low light shots.<br />Good macro mode (I have this on my m43 in a better way, so it doesn't matter as much to me, but it's still nice, as close at 1cm focusing)<br />Neutral Density filter is very useful, as it allows you to stay below f4(diffraction limit) in bright daylight. It also has a nice setting to choose how it is auto applied.<br />Shot to shot is quick, high speed burst, fast focusing<br />Hot shoe for an excellent EVF(which I no longer have, but had for my GX1) as well as external flashes (man, it looks<br />Video seems great so far.<br />Built in OIS is very nice, my minimum shutter speed is set to 1/15 and haven't had any issues.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />Manual focus isn't what I'm used to, but it isn't bad either.<br />Zoom speed takes a little longer, slowing down the otherwise stellar performance, but I didn't find it that much of an issue.<br />The cap is a lens cap and not an auto. This can be fixed a bit with some 3rd party adapters, but I ended up preferring the lens cap anyway. It just looks better, and since it can just hang from the camera, it isn't that bad. It's sturdier than the auto lens cap as well. There is also a third party cap that will allow extending; I believe it requires the 37mm filter adapter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />iAuto mode seems useless. I lack experience here, but what experience I had, I hated.<br />The flash seems to require manual compensation adjustments, which seemed a bit buried. Maybe there's a way to assign it to Fn.<br />High ISO(over 800) is full of Chroma noise and banding, making it difficult to use the pictures.<br /><br />So there you have it. If you want a point and shoot with out of camera jpegs only, this can be a problem. There are ways to fix it, but I don't think this is the best camera for you. High ISO noise is also an issue. I have yet to use the RX100, but it has better performance here from what I've seen. Some have stated the G15 has better ISO3200 noise performance too. However, if you use the settings right, this camera produces very excellent shots, is small, and is much cheaper (at $300 anyway) than competition(especially the RX100). It's a very handy additional/portable camera. It's also a great camera to come up from Point and Shoot, for those who want to learn some more manual control and be a bit more creative.","Great results with this camera and it arrived a day early, thanks! Taking it with me this summer on vacation.","I received this 2 days ago and uses as a secondary camera, took many shots, image quality is superb. Happy with the product.","A first rate, intelligently conceived, superbly desighned, very useful camera.  It is slightly larger than earlier LX's, but provides useful extras.  The lens is an impressive improvement.  Apart from telephoto lenses, this camera has everything one needs for excellent work.  It is also sensibly priced especially when compared to the Sony RX-1!","I bought this camera specifically for the food macro mode. To my delight, it's held up against DSLR's. If you're a food blogger looking for an affordable camera that doesn't require you to learn all the DSLR skills, this is a very good choice.","Panasonic DMC-LX7 Review<br /><br />I know shopping on the internet leaves out that “hands on” feeling you get from shopping at a store. There is no weight to be felt, no balance, It’s hard to tell if something is chromed plastic or polished stainless.  You can’t see if one of your own accessories works with the unit. (Speedlight?)  And sometimes you just want someone else to look into something and tell you about it... tell you the real deal behind some of the marketing jargon and labels on the box.  If you just have to feel it, go shop at a store. Just remember that they deserve some business from you if you go in there and handle the merchandise and such.  Yes, the prices are usually a little higher.  Yes, they charge sales tax at the register. (You’re supposed to pay any sales tax from internet purchases in your state tax return, so this shouldn’t be a factor)  But buy something from your local camera store, even if it’s only prints you buy.  Support them as well as Amazon.<br /><br />Now on to the review, almost all of which I wouldn’t have learned from a few minutes of experimenting in a store, it has taken a few days to learn these things.<br /><br />Cons are arranged from most to least offensive and pros are from least to most thrilled about.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Firmware: Time Lapse is one of those features you see on the list and say... YES! I want that! But it’s not a sole reason to buy.  After all, I have a GoPro, DSLR, several unused Android phones with cameras, and an old Canon P&S with the CHDK software.  I’m set for TL units.  However, I’m still disappointed in this because the time lapse settings are limited to sixty shots at the most,  and one minute between shots at a minimum.  Do I get this correct,  a 2 second maximum length of a time lapse clip that takes at least an hour to make?  Three words... Firmware Update Needed.  Really, send a firmware update that opens this up to as many shots as we want to take... and more importantly...down to the 1 second between shots range as well.<br />Grip:  Remember,  I'm coming from a D7000 with a battery grip.  It's huge in comparison.  It's super easy to grip, hold and control.  The lx7 is small.  It fits in my pocket.  It's small enough that I have to say it's difficult to hold on to.  I can hold my DSLR with one finger under the lip of the grip and gravity keeps it there. I'm cautious about using one hand with this little thing.  Not much room on the back for my thumb to grip it with.  If I’m rotating the thumbwheel, I MUST grip it with the other hand, because I lose the grip with my right hand.<br /><br />Zoom control: I realize this is typically a camera that people are advancing to from a <$200 p&s,  but I hate the zoom being on the shutter release instead of the barrel.  If we could have a rear button programmed to release the shutter, this wouldn't be so bad, but running the zoom seems to loosen my grip just like adjusting the thumbwheel does.  I hear this is where the Sony outshines this unit, in that the lens ring can be programmed to operate zoom, focus, or aperture. (obviously not all three at the same time)  An alternative would be to make the zoom control operated by the thumb, even via the same ring on top, just put that protruding part toward the back instead of the front... or dare I say it...BOTH.  Let the user decide which  part to use.<br />Tripod mount:  This is way off center.  Way, way off.  If it were closer to center,  then leaving a tripod mount attached would allow it to rest on a counter without being crooked... But, it’s a very lightweight camera and being off-center is not a problem except for the most flyweight of tripods.<br /><br />Neutral:<br /><br />Sensor size. I’d have loved to see a larger sensor, but I chose this over cameras that do have larger ones. This one is 10MP at 1/1.7”  However, I think this unit makes up for sensor size issues with that wonderful lens.  Since *most* of the photos will be taken with adequate light or a flash there isn’t much of a problem with the very low light end of the spectrum.  I’d rather have consistently sharp (which they are) and fringing free (again) photos over something that can turn out a muddy shot taken by starlight.  10MP is more than enough for nearly any print from this...really, even though the manual says it’s only good up to A4 size.  When you get to a 36” print, do you really need it to be 300 pixels per inch?  Isn’t it going to be viewed from about 4 to 6 feet away?  You’ll never see the pixels at 75 pixels per inch from anything more than 2 feet away. If you would like to test this, just look at your 75 pixel per inch monitor from 2 feet or more, or your HDTV which is only 2MP from more than 4 feet.  Lots of articles on this, so I’m going to leave it at that.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Quiet.  It's near silent in operation when you turn the beeps off. Only the faintest click is audible from the shutter.  I took it on a ghost hunt.  Nobody could hear it,  and it wasn't overly bright from the screen in the darkness.  I’m not sure, but I think it dimmed itself somewhat in the ambient light.<br /><br />Flash hotshoe:  Yes, this WILL fire a modern Canon and Nikon flash when they are set in Manual mode. (Not TTL, you will need a Panasonic flash for TTL, Metz also makes one to work with the Lumix series)<br />Style :  Wow,  this thing is great looking.  I got it in white,  because I'm soooooo tired of the typical black, heat generating, I-look-just-like-everything-else camera. The white and silver looks great.  Why is Pentax the only maker with white DSLR Cameras?<br /><br />Features:  Lots of them.  There are creative modes that can be applied after the shots are done, nice for those of us that like to shoot RAW and edit later.  Many, many different scene modes, that I actually like.  Again, some people just want RAW, and others just want scene and style shots.  While I doubt I’ll ever shoot in sepia or B&W, as I like to do that in post-production, I do see myself using several other modes from time to time.  I like them.  There is a lot more to this than just creative styles, it also has white balance bracketing.  Not only white balance bracketing as in temperature,  but two dimensional bracketing,  to include both blue/yellow and magenta/green selection.  Not only two dimensional bracketing,  but it's fully user selectable on both sides of the center shot, not just a +- 1 or 2.  This is usually a Pro/Enthusiast level DSLR feature.  It can even learn what you look like (or your most often photographed human subjects) and tag the photo with their name(s). Your mileage may vary here, especially for twins.  Aspect ratio bracketing is available, although I don’t see myself using that.  It’s fast... I think it shoots 11 frames per second (jpg) and can go up to 128000 ISO in the extended ISO range.  (this essentially increases the sensel size on the sensor by combining nearby pixels to increase the sensitivity, therefore it saves the shot as a 2 to 3 MP jpg image, a bit blurry, but if you really need a starlight illuminated action shot, you got it.)  For most shots of 1/20 or faster you’re best off at ISO 3200 or lower.  Standard tripod mount long exposures are fine. (I recommend using the 2 second timer delay)  If you really want a camera that takes action shots in the dark, you’ll need to shell out about $8500 and get a f2.8 or faster lens and a Canon 1DMk4 or a Nikon D4.  But for just a few hundred bucks, this pocketable camera really is a great low-light shooter.  (Hint: use the night scene mode until you understand the exposure triangle.)<br /><br />The Lens:  Did I mention the lens?  It’s incredibly sharp and free from distortions.  It focuses quite fast.  Sure, it’s only 24mm to 90mm equivalent.  But it’s a high quality 24mm to 90mm.  Crop it if you want to zoom further.  But wait, there’s more.  iZoom, a feature built into software, helps you zoom further than the optical zoom.  It’s not just cropping the image like most digital zooms, it actually interpolates the pixels to get a better image than cropping will provide.  Yes, it works.  No, it’s not perfect.  If you’re thinking it will work like the computers in TV shows that take a pixelated shot and enhance it to read the licence plate, you’ll be disappointed.  You’re living in a fantasy world also.  The lens is still fantastic, though.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality, flexible, pocketable camera (as long as you're not wearing skater jeans).  Good for novices, good for a step up from a basic p&s or camera phone, and it's good for a pro to carry as an all-around or traveler camera.  (Which is what I want it for the most)","Love this camera. It is my compact option when I am not using my Nikon D700.<br />This is my second Lumix camera. Compact, full of possibilities, greatest lens ever! Half price of a Leica with same performance.","First of all - I'm not a professional serious photographer...but I'm one step above point and shoot amateur, with appreciation for some manual controls...This is my 2nd Panasonic Lumix camera. I thought I would never buy another Panasonic camera after their initial lousy support and customer service. I gently dropped my first Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ20 ultrazoom camera 4 years ago from my car seat to the car floor. Panasonic never would repair it for any reasonable cost, nor replace it. Since then I've been trying an ultra-zoom Canon SX-IS camera, and it can't compare. The autofocus at 20X zoom is useless. Impossible to take a picture that isn't blurred. I now decided to give up trying to find an ultrazoom at a reasonable price (under $500), so instead I decided to try a Panasonic Leica camera again. I love this camera! The lens is so-fast. The low light photos are great. The autofocus while taking action pictures is outstanding. I can even shoot my 6th graders hockey games with reasonable clarity. Not perfect. But pretty decent quality. This camera must be delicate, as Panasonic tried to sell me 3rd party \"Drop Camera\" insurance, so it sounds like the problem hasn't gone away. As long as you're careful, it takes great pictures. I'll live with 4X Zoom, and 7X digital zoom...love the camera!","I bought this camera as a small compact camera for the few places that I cannot bring my dslr.  It serves this purpose perfectly.  It has an F1.4 Leica lens which makes it better than any of its competition in low light and shallow depth of field.<br /><br />This camera is basically the same camera as the Leica D-Lux 6 at less than half the price, I wouldn't be surprised at all if every component is identical and the only differences are purely cosmetic.<br /><br />My only two complaints are that the camera has a limited zoom range and that it is only a 10 megapixel sensor.  Also a GPS sensor would be a nice addition to this camera.<br />I am told that the 10 megapixel sensor was chosen to allow for an f1.4 lens that would have been cost prohibitive in a larger sensor camera.<br /><br />Overall no camera on the market has every feature that I would want in a point and shoot camera that I can carry everywhere, but this comes very close.","Fun to use.  Lots of controls.  Love the fast 24 mm wide angle.  Great for pictures in darker locations like churches, museums, and restaurants.  Like the customization features.  Fits in purses or larger pockets.  This is a great \"go anywhere\" camera for everyday and vacation use.","panorama features awesome<br />quality is very good<br />I love white colors<br />very fast focus<br />nice painting features<br />most reason for purchasing was full HD movie in AVCHD and mp4","This camera is as large as you can get while still being able to fit it in your pocket. I originally had a Canon Rebel but ended up always leaving it at home due to its size.<br /><br />This camera has a fantastic lens and has produced many great pictures. I prefer to not use my flash and wanted a camera that took great natural photos sans flash. This camera did not disappoint.<br /><br />Before this, I also owned the Lumix LX-5 but it was stolen. That is also a great camera if you want to save a few bucks.","I have been using Panasonic cameras since 2002.I started with the travel zooms and moved up to the LX7.I use it for family photos and I take it with me hiking and traveling.I also bought the LX7 guide to go with the camera.There's so much that the camera can do,so far it's been great.","I like this camera a lot. Controls are very logical if you rely on manual settings. It literally takes just a couple of seconds to set up the aspect ratio of the shot, aperture and ISO (all of the three during those couple of seconds - amazing). The lens is very nice: the focal range is very useful, it is very fast and actually more than useable wide open. Optical stabilization works well. It is not as good as in the best cameras, but it definitely helps at longer shutter speeds. Manual focus is available and easy to use.<br /><br />Video features are quite good, probably one of the best among photocameras. LX7 is capable of shooting 60 frames per second at 1080p resolution. Full manual controls are available in this mode (aperture, shutter, ISO), the aperture and shutter priority modes are also present. There is some moire present (no color moire though). Subjectively the video appears sharp and only careful examination shows that the camera seems to have only half the resolution in the vertical direction (the smallest details, the thinnest lines are never smaller/thinner than two pixels in height). The camera has a very interesting feature: it is capable of shooting 720p video at 120fps for more than 7min. There are 3 issues in this mode though.<br /><br />1). The only controls available in this mode are \"Start recording\" and \"Stop recording\". It would be nice to be able to set the shutter speed.<br /><br />2). Moire is stronger than in 1080p mode from the same camera (again, I haven't seen any color moire).<br /><br />3). The video appears to have some motion blur. When I was inspecting individual frames, I noticed that every frame contains some faint copy of the previous frame. When watching at 30fps, this artifacts appear as slight motion blur.<br /><br />Photo quality is very good, as long as we are talking about the lens sharpness, but the sensor is just not that great. It is definitely better than the 1/2.3\" sensor in the cheaper cameras, but is much worse than the one in Sony RX100. Personally, I would prefer a camera with slower lens but larger and higher quality sensor.<br /><br />The camera is quite comfortable to hold. I don't think it's important because if you shoot less than 20-30 photos in a row and less than 300-500 a day, it is ok to hold a camera of any shape. However, for some users it is important, therefore I mention it. :)<br /><br />The camera is not quite pocket-able but this is the price one have to pay for the excellent lens.<br /><br />This camera is not the best in terms of image quality but it is extremely fun to shoot with it. I think that it strikes a perfect balance between image quality, features, user interface, and size. It is not perfect at anything in particular but quite good at nearly everything.<br /><br />I'd like to add that my other photocamera is Nikon D3s with a set of primes and high quality zooms - so I am familiar with better quality cameras.","I bought this camera since I want buy a new one to replace with my old Ricoh CX1.<br />When I found there was $100 off, I decide to buy it.<br />And I also bought a auto lens cap which makes this camera a good choice for pick-up shoot.<br /><br />I would be appreciated if there is a language option - Chinese.","I bought this camera for my mother to make a shots of her grandchilds. That's why I decided to find a camera which has such features like light weight, rather small size to keep in woman's bag, ability to make shots indoors without flash, fast autofocus, some programs like portrait or landskape. Also the strong side of LX7 is its video, sometimes it would be necessary, I hope. My mother also likes macro shots of camera to take a picture of flowers or her culinary results.","I am having trouble seeing a movie I take with this camera on TV or on the Computer moniter.  I have a Nikon and Sony camera and take movies  with both, and can see them on TV or Computer---but not with this Panasonic.  I have same problem with the Panasonic Lumix LX5. I love the camera but cannot find a way to see movies taken with this camera.<br /><br />Can anyone help?<br />Steve<br />Flolrida","I have been using a Canon S95 as my secondary video/still camera for travel photography.  The S95 has served me well, but it is limited to 720p video and can not autofocus once recording is started.  Looking for an upgrade I considered the Canon S100, Canon S110, and Sony RX100.  After doing a lot of research on dpreview.com and other sites, I decided the LX7 gave by far and away the best bang for the buck.  This is my third Panasonic camera.  I also have the Panasonic Fz150 and FZ200.  All three cameras are very well designed and provide excellent results.  They are, in fact, also sold under the Leica brand name for hundreds of dollars more.  While I have yet to find the \"perfect\" camera, I can't say enough good things about these three.<br /><br />If you want to see one of my travel videos shot almost entirely with the FZ150 go to [...].  The FZ200 is a great upgrade to the FZ150.  The Lx7 provides the perfect complement -- giving fannypackitability and low light capability to round out the team.","I compared LX7 and ZS20. I decided to get LX7 over ZS20.<br />Here are the reasons:<br />1. I will use this mainly for taking kids picture. A lot of time indoor. LX7 takes much better picture indoor.<br />2. VERY solid construction. Look and Feel. LX7 feel better construction. ZS20 is not bad. I like ZS20 20X lens, but more moving parts = easier to break???<br />3. Manual Control of Aparture.<br />It was very hard to decide though, becasue ZS20 has more feartures like GPS, 20X lens which by the way VERY GOOD!!<br />However, I decided to purchase LX7 for f1.4 lens, better construction and manual control of aparture.<br />Update:<br />The Price I paid: March2013 $298. The price incresed to $398 (April 2013) If this is the price, I would buy ZS20 (Around $250).","Good pictures but Zoom is puny, still working with it and looking forward to first trip with it. More to follow","I initially sent the first camera back because I was unable to remove a lens ring that needs to be removed before lens accessories can be attached.  Once this ring is removed, an adapter ring must be added before filters can be attached.  Once filters are attached, the original lens cover will not fit, nor will the auto lens cover that some are selling.  I also bought the $40+ lens accessory kit that Amazon recommended.  This kit is BAD NEWS for a number of reasons.  (I have reviewed the kit elsewhere.)<br /><br />Other than that bit of mis-engineering, I like the camera.  I do reporting for a newspaper, and overall, it does a better job than my Nikon D-70 camera did.  It does very well in low light conditions, and the number of settable options is borderline staggering.  I like the wide range of color correction that is available.  Like the D-70, the trigger response is very fast.  I am still getting used to the lack of a SLR viewer, but I will get there.<br /><br />I purchased a Vivitar DF-183-OP Speedlight, Panasonic version, for the camera so that I could do bounce illumination.  In my opinion, it does not integrate very well with the LX7.  Consequently, I hardly ever use it.  I hate to use a flash, but the built-in flash helps for some situations.  My D-70 had a feature that would expose for the flash, but keep the shutter open to bring up the background.  Very nice.  I have not discovered anything quite that good on the LX7.  The closest equivalent wants to flash twice, at beginning and end.<br /><br />Really, the nits are minimal.  I got mine for $299 during a holiday sale.  The LX7 is a lot of camera for that price.","This camera packs a lot of punches when it comes to features.  The best one that I love about it is the 1.4F lens.  I took photos that have low light exposures but they turned out great.  It is solidly built, nice coat finish, and perfect to the touch.  The gripes I have about it arethe following: the 3.8x max zoom, could have been more; it lacks the wi-fi capabilities as well, present on most recent released compacts; it will take you quite some time to get familiar with the many features as the manual didn't really helped that much.<br /><br />Overall, for the price I paid for it, I would say it's an absolute good buy and great handy gadget.","This is my third LX series camera.  After having the LX2 and LX5, I knew the LX7 would be a great product, and it is.<br /><br />There are tons of features - so many that I wrote an ebook to help myself and others wade through the details.  That ebook is now available here on Amazon!<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Lumix-DMC-LX7-World-ebook/dp/B00BVR0OD4/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1363652273&sr=1-1&keywords=dmc-lx7","I've had the camera for about a week. I waited about 2 months to buy it and snagged it for $299. I also bought the book for sale on how to use the lx7. I am using manual mode already and its pretty cool. I like it. Definitely a camera for someone who wants a vintage look, creative control, and desires high quality craftsmanship.","I was seeking a easy and cheap camera to be comparable to an SLR. It is apparently not able to take a same quality picture as an SLR, but still much better than that taken by a camera of below $100. I also has a lot of lovely options. I like it.","I've only had this a few days, so i'd like to come back in 6 months and update, but so far I really am liking this camera.  The video is amazing at 1080p60...  I have an older High Def camcorder (Canon HV10) and this video trumps that easily.  Even indoors the video is crystal clear.  I haven't taken many pictures, but indoor shots seem to come out great (compared to my older camera).  Macro shots looks very good.  The lens is super fast.  Focuses so much faster then my old camera and snaps of shots so quick..no waiting around anymore!  The camera seems to be mostly metal, which i like...and has a nice little rubber grip...It really feels like a high quality piece of equipment.  Obviously nothing is perfect, but so far I like what Im seeing...for the price (and i researched a ton of cameras...and wanted to RX100---but too much in the end) its an awesome deal.","I just received my LX7. I want to thank everyone for their posts and reviews. I'm an amateur hoping to learn photography as I go. I've owned in the past some Canon point a nd shoot cameras and they produced excellent results.But for the life of me I cannot get good pictures with the LX7. Even in the Intelligent Auto Plus mode or out door Scene Mode the scenes are dark and out of focus.Even when you manually adjust the brightness and focus the photograph never even comes close to what is displayed on the LCD screen. I would really appreciate any help from Amazon LX7 owners. There is something I'm doing wrong ,just can't figure it out. I know this a good camera but the manual just isn't helping much.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />With tips from Amazon LX7 owners I've been able to get good pictures from the LX7. I could only get good pictures though in Manual Mode. With the camera in Intelligent Auto Mode or the Scene Modes\" the pictures were just not acceptable to me. I read a review on line where the camera was described as pretty much \"set it and forget it\" point and shoot, really?  I'm a novice and I just want to capture an image quickly with no fuss. AND YES! I read the manual (I took the time to print the whole thing out). The LX7 is easy to use, a very small learning curve. The menus are very well laid out. Its not a complicated camera at all. The construction is impecable! This is not cheap plastic. The LX7 has a nice heft to it. It feels substantial in your hands without feeling heavy. Individuals with good photo knowledge will be happy with this camera, as I said I'm just a novice. Panasonic toting this camera<br />as a high quality in default \"Auto Mode\" point and shoot is a little exaggerated. It is a high quality camera in \"manual Mode\".","I wanted something more compact to replace my DSLR. I mostly take indoor shots of children, so low-light performance is paramount. I heard a lot of good things about the low-light performance of this camera, and wanted to give it a try.<br /><br />First I took pictures side-by-side with my iPhone 5. It's not even a competition -- the pictures from the Panasonic are so much brighter and less noisy. If you're thinking of getting a \"real\" camera to augment your camera phone, this would be a good choice.<br /><br />Next I took pictures side-by-side with my Canon T1i DSLR with 40mm prime lens -- it's not much of a competition here either. The T1i pictures are much less noisy for equivalent ISO. The DSLR combo is at least a full stop better.<br /><br />I am returning the Panasonic, because it's not good enough to compete with the DSLR nor compact enough to compete with the iPhone (which is what I use for most of my \"photography.\")<br /><br />I will say that the controls on the Lumix are very nice and well laid out. It doesn't feel dumbed down at all, and has all the manual control I want and use in a real camera.<br /><br />** clarification update **<br /><br />for this price, I think this is an excellent camera.  I would probably keep it if I didn't already have a DSLR and a bunch of lenses.<br /><br />(And the wife says she won't carry an extra camera (additional to her phone) no matter how compact.)","I have been thinking of buying a good P&S apart from my Nikon D5000 DSLR (which is already quite old). Purchased LX7 after some online research and I find it to be surprisingly Great for the price I paid. I am delighted at the pics I get with even default settings. Lens at f/1.4 is incredible and focuses very fast. Colors are crisp and (as many others noticed) excels at dull-light performance. Oh! almost forgot about its superb video quality - does a great job with fast moving objects. again, bright lens comes in handy for great indoor videos. Overall, a Great Buy!","I am pretty happy with my LX3 even though it is missing some advanced features (see my previous review).  I skipped the LX5 and finally can't resist the $299 offer on the LX7.  I have not been able to try all the new features so this is my initial feedback:<br /><br />Be able to take on a filter without an extension unit like in the LX3 is a big step.  However, you have to purchase a separate $26 adapter which comes with a 37mm len cap.  Ok, no problem I will pay for it, but it is out-of-stock for a few months now.  There is OEM adapter selling for $10 on ebay but without the 37mm len cap (I want a official LUMIX cap).  Why can't Panasonic include the adapter ring and the 37 mm cap with the product?  They don't cost that much.<br /><br />The product does not come with a printed manual of the advanced features.  Again, why try to save a few bucks, Panasonic?  A lot of people still prefer reading hard copy especially with high tech product.<br /><br />The time lapse feature is awesome except it has limited setting.  I am waiting for a firmware upgrade that offers custom timing.<br /><br />The 1.4 lens is awesome; so is the progressive video mode, the built-in HDR, the fast focus, etc.<br /><br />It is a good product line which keep getting better.","LX3 and 5 were solid metal products.  This one has a cheap feel.  Images are not sharp...looks better for video.  Pricing for this item varies too much.","This is the best point and shoot digital camera I have every used, and I have used many of them over the last 8 years, mostly Canons. I really like the Canon point and shoot cameras, which have produced very good pictures and the Canon software is very convenient for keeping track of which pictures have already been downloaded and placing them in a designated folder. I read all of the great reviews of both the LX5 and LX7, which convinced me to take a chance on the Panasonic LX7, especially since it came with a 1.4 lens, which is unheard-of for a point and shoot camera.<br /><br />Hear are the Pros of the LX7:<br />* Very light and compact<br />* Decent battery life<br />* Very bright and clear screen<br />* Takes pictures nearly instantly (lag time almost unnoticeable)<br />* Very sharp and bright pictures, better than Canon, likely due to the 1.4 lens<br />* Colors are as accurate as Canon (not perfect, but about a third requires some quick correction using photoshop color cast)<br />* Videos look and sound as good as Canon (Like that you are allowed to take up to 30 minute videos, which is better than Canon)<br />* HDR setting is convenient for producing more accurate lighting<br />* Takes great pictures in low light, most likely due to the 1.4 lens (have not used the flash yet because of this)<br /><br />Here are the Cons of the LX7:<br />* Manual lens cover is inconvenient, but OK since I am use to using the old film SLRs<br />* Noticeable barrel distortion at wide angle (worse than Canon)<br />* Software requires you to manually select which pictures you want to download, which is laborious when it is hundreds of pictures and you do not want to select all of them<br />* Software does not download pictures unless you are logged in as administrator (most of the time I do not log in as administrator for security purposes)<br /><br />If it was not for the software inconveniences, I would have given this camera 5 stars. Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a fairly small, light, and fast camera that takes great pictures under most conditions, and does not require mega-zoom. I hope that they decide to improve their software in the near future, which would make user experience so much better.","Got this camera to take photos of my family which includes a fast moving 4 year old.  I have been able to finally get good pics of my son as he moves around with limited blur. Still need to take time to earn the in and outs of this camera.","After spending the last 40+ years, starting with the original Pentax manual SLRs, then Canon and finally moving to Nikon Fs then Ds because of Nikon's policy of maintaining lens interchangability from one design to the next. I thought I'd like to give a point and shoot a try after my son(a professional photog) showed me results from his Lumix LX5. When I decided to take the plunge, I chose the LX7 because after all those years of manual and Aperture or Shutter preferred shooting found on most SLRs, I found they were available on the LX7, that and the trusty f1.4 aperture I had grown accustomed to.<br />Sure enough, I find myself leaning heavily to the LX7's Manual mode, shoving the camera in my pocket or on the passenger's seat next to me in the car and leaving the SLR bag at home. As far as results are concerned, it has produced some truly fine 8.5X11 landscape and wildlife blowups with a minimum of computer \"fixing\". I'm as pleased as I can be because I find this camera so familiar and comfortable to use.<br />The only thing I miss is the SLR's viewfinder which I will probably add shortly to my LX7 accessories. After that, I just may buy a decent point and shoot with a long lens and then sell my SLR equipment.<br />This camera also has to compete on occasion with an ancient Leica IIIg I occasionally pull out if I want to shoot black and white film which I can also do on the LX7 if I have to.","I bought this camera because although I use an SLR, I wanted something more handy for carrying around all the time. I had an older Lumix and it took great pictures although lacked many of the features of this camera, including the manual controls.<br /><br />When I saw the lens on this camera, I had to have it. I needed a wide angle for indoor people shots, but I also wanted some zoom capabililty. This lens does both and at an unheard of f/1.4. No other point and shoot can match this lens. I compared this camera with the Sony RX100 and the Fuji X100 and although both have larger sensors, they lack other features that this camera has.....and cost twice as much!<br /><br />I do wish that this camera had a viewfinder as I find that I get sharper pictures when I hold the camera up to my eye and that it zoomed out just a little bit more. But overall, it's a great camera and the pictures are amazingly bright!","bought it because by my friends' recommendations and the great reviews.  my friends are semi pros but I am an amateur who wants to have better quality photos than what  simple auto P&S digital cameras produced.  I am amazed at how much this camera can do (all the advanced features in such a compact size).  actualy my petite sized wife and me (taller and with larger fingers prefer this size than more smaller compact cameras because it is easier to hold the camera while shooting without the fear of the camera slipping out of our hands.  I have a lot to learn  to get the professional features  in this great camera like some other reviewers  that had purchased it.  it is a relief that I won't need to carry bulky DSLR equipments or additional flash units for the kind of use (less  complicated) I need and still get great results.","Look, I really do. It's a great step up from a point-and-shoot. It has full manual controls besides focus (it does have manual focusing, but you have to use a cursor to select it and it's slow and bad and not worth your time). It takes RAW (RW2) and JPG. It's pretty light, but a little too big for a pants pocket. The one thing I don't like so much is the sensor. It's a little small for a camera this capable. You can get great shots, and the f/1.4 aperture really helps make things look professional (with a nice background bokeh/blur) but if this had an APS-C sized sensor, it would be (in my eyes) ideal. Also, as much as you wanna believe 10.1 MP isn't enough, it is. Almost every photo I've taken has been fine at the size. Would I mind a few more megapixels? Not at all, in fact this at 14 or 18 MP would be killer, but I think the sensor size is the only thing to complain about. All in all, I'd buy this camera again, for the quality. It's built well, and attractively, and the photos it takes mirror that quality.","Owning a RX100, Canon t3i, GH2, Fuji X100, this is the camera I ultimately chose for the simple reason that this camera is the best balance for very good photos (not as good as RX100), but in addition, and very important for me, excellent video (much better in lower indoor light than the RX100, and GH2 lens kit).<br /><br />FOR those interested in VIDEO:<br /><br />Although not as pocket-able as the Sony RX100, the video on the LX7 is much clearer, sharper, the colors outstanding, and better low-light compared to my Panasonic TM900 camcorder.  For home videos or travel videos the quality is superb (with the right settings), and the low light 1.4 lens is great for low light conditions indoors, around the house.  I was pleasantly surprised how it destroyed the RX100 in smoothness, color, and most importantly the professional look of the videos.  I also own a hacked GH2 for video.  The GH2 is probably considered outputting the BEST video quality under $4,000, rivaling neck and neck with probably the high end Canon Mark II/III.  So, my standards are quite high.  Obviously not the same class as the hacked GH2, the LX7 is really a solid choice for home video, or casual use, and in my opinion, outputs much better skin tones, color distribution, and clarity compared to the frustrating RX100.<br /><br />So, although the LX7 is not as good in the image department compared to the RX100, and is a little bit bigger, it does provide excellent results in BOTH photos and videos. The LX7 has replaced my GH2 + $1000 12-35mm lens for casual video, and takes pretty good quality images for me to decide enough was enough with the RX100 video output.  The LX7 provides excellent results in both areas (photos and videos), and I am very happy with the purchase, and more importantly, in the excellent video quality.  The 1.4 lens is outstanding.","This is the camera. For everyone who has thought about buying a Panasonic for a while, do it. This is the camera! Don't buy Canon, whatever you do. They have a recurring lens problem - you might like your Canon, but the fact it, you just never know when you'll get the dreaded lens error, likely while on vacation, and then you're screwed and stuck without a camera. Yes, Canon will fix it free of charge, but what good does that do you in the moment? And what if the error keeps happening despite being repeatedly fixed by Canon (3 times, same camera!!!)?<br /><br />Anyway, this camera is all about quality, not much else to say really.","I was looking for the right price to buy this item for a long time.  I saw the deal and I purchased it.  Picture quality is good and it is just the right size to carry it around everywhere.","I have a Canon T4i. After seeing the prices of the Canon large aperture lenses I fainted. Upon revival I decided to try this camera to see if this could take comparable pictures in low light. This is probably the best compact camera I have ever seen, in low light. It takes good looking pictures when other compacts simply can't, largely because of the fast lens and bigger sensor.<br /><br />But when you zoom in and pixel peep, the fringing and noise reduction is very visible when compared to even the kit lense from a DSLR. Bottom line if you are solely interested in pictture quality, an older model DSLR like the Nikon 3100 or a Canon T3i is now available at similar prices with a kit lens and will take a better picture.<br /><br />If you simply want the best compact for taking low light pictures without a flash, this is the camera for you.<br /><br />And for those people who will point out I'm comparing a DSLR to a compact, I would like to point out I'm comparing what you could spend your money on.","Got it on cyber-Monday for $300.  At that price it was worth it to me, but not more than that.  At full price I would've probably went for the RX100, but at less than half this one won.<br /><br />Resolution is good for a small sensor but it doesn't compare to large sensor.  The real strengths are the wide, fast lens and total lack of shutter lag.  I bought it for indoor photos of kids and it hasn't disappointed.  Some issues noted by others are true, the lens cap is a minor annoyance, but nothing I haven't dealt with before, and sometimes the processor gets indoor fluorescent lighting wrong.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy and two friends who've checked it out have since bought it as well.","I bought lx7(1080P) to upgrade my lx5(which only has 720P video). I am very happy with it. I am waiting for LX 9 :)))","I have an old Panasonic tz7 and canon t2i. The old adage works well, \"the best camera is the one you have when you need it\" -- portability is the key here. The old lumix tz7 served me well over the years but the frustration was with terrible pictures with flash in low light situation. Last week, I had the waiter took a picture of my wife and me in front of the restaurant sign at night and the picture turned out dark and out of focus with the TZ7.<br /><br />So when I saw the review of the 1.4 F stop on the LX7 and the $100 price drop to $299. I decided to get the WHITE version of the LX7. I took some pictures in my kitchen with the the natural light from the widows and the photos turned out very good. I think this LX7 will serve me well in traveling and low light conditions which many times I have (restaurants and in-door).<br /><br />I thought I would miss the long 10x zoom of the old TX7 but in reality most of my pictures have been in door of family events. The long zoom is nice to boast but not useful. The fast lense is very useful.<br /><br />ANother feature I like is the FAST FOCUS and the locked AE/AF - this means if I compose the shot of us and ask someone to take the photo, hopefully it won't be out of focus.","It takes good pictures and video, has more features than I need, and is faster and with fewer out of focus pictures of my quick daughter than the Canon I am replacing.  It is also bigger, not a pocket camera, but you can stuff it in a large jacket pocket no problem.  It's not nearly so large as my DSL, and packs well inside a sock stuffed in a 10 1/2 men's shoe.","I previously commented to another reviewer-Lowell-who was comparing this camera and The Sony RX100 in hand held low light-- which is the better camera for that purpose.I wasn't very happy with the RX100 indoors. This camera can get a hand held low light shot that the RX100 could only dream of while it rests on a tripod and kicks up it's ISO. And with all the accolades the RX100 gets about low light thats like saying you like to toast kittens over a roaring fire. I'm getting good sharp shots at 1/10 handheld (fantastic image stabilization on the LX7 and wider lense) vs 3 seconds tripod or resting on something (RX100 weak image stabilization although larger sensor) to get a similar shot.  I like both cameras, I own both, but I know which one wouldn't have ruined my shots of my kids last Christmas indoors and which one we'll use outside sledding with a little more light.  And thats what my review is about- hand held low light without annoying flash--you know--the kids and everbody else runs from the camera.  Here comes flashman! This camera is the best compact camera I've had for that and I've tried out alot. If you want a compact camera for low light, one that still lets you freeze the action do yourself a favor and look on the photo sharing site Flickr and type in this camera. Too many wonderful low light shots there.","I am a pro photojournalist (former newspaper staffer, current freelancer). Been  getting paid for my photography for over 20 years. Have traveled all over LatAm and Caribbean and have ALWAYS used Poing + Shoot cameras. Back in the film days I used the famous Olympus XA2, the Olympus Stylus (zoom and non zoom) and when digitals came around I used a Leica Dlux1 (even had stuff prublished w that 1.3mp cam. When Canon came out w their G series I owned each model from the G1 to the G10, then switched to the S models and owned the S90, S95 and S100. I even owned a cool looking but terribly performing FujiX10 which I dumped in 2 months. My last Canon was the S100 until I discovered this camera. I was blown away by what I saw. It isn't as compact as the S100 and it doesn't perform as great in high ISO as the S100 (not crazy about it past ISO640 but I never have to even go that high. The LX7 has an incredibly fast 1.4 lens which @ ISO400 is incredible. Hell, I don't even need 1.4, I ca live w/1.8 very happily. The LX7 has a ton of features, too much to list. I don't need that many to be happy but I'm constantly mixing formats, film styles, motor drive speeds etc to create custom settings. For those of you who shoot video, this camera will blow you away. I looooove the HD 120fps option. Quality in low light is amazing. Sound is OK, no outside mic jack so bring your own audio recorder if you are serious, in fact, do that no matter what camera you use. Audio is king. I immediately ordered the LVF2 to out on the hot shoe. It was like adding some extra home made bbq sauce to those incredible ribs you smoke for 8 hours. I was in love w the camera already, now I'm ready to marry it. Recently shot a travel gig in Puerto Rico for a magazine and packing my gear I had to talk myself to pack my pro DSLRs instead of just taking my LX7. In the end, I coulda done w.out the heavy Pelican case and the L lenses and coulda shot everything w.the LX7. It's that great. I also ordered an extra Panasonic battery (don't get the aftermarket ones) and haven't needed to replace the batts while working yet. With the LVF2 you don't consume that much juice. I consulted a god friend who lives in Cuba and shoots a lot of street photography for European magazines, and he sealed the deal for me when he told me he uses 2 Panasonics, an LX7 and an LX5, as his digital Leicas. Did you know that the Leica D-lux 6 and the Panasonic LX7 are the same camera. Only difference is the red dot on the Leica and the diubled sticker price.<br />I already have two colleagues getting LX7's. If you're a serious photog who carries a P+S this is the camera you need, unless you wanna throw down some big bucks for a Fuji Xpro1 or an M9.","I have to say that for $350 this is an awesome compact. I have been looking for a compact camera to use  when I don't feel like taking my DSLR with me and I have found it. For a while i struggled with the decision between the LX7 and the sony rx100 but at almost half the price i decided to go with the LX7. So far I am very happy with it. The reason to buy this camera is for its low light capabilities. Being able to adjust shutter speed, aperture and ISO very quickly and did I mention the huge 1.4 aperture? The auto focus is instant and unlike the cheap compacts there is absolutely no shutter lag. Also it is capable of 11 pictures a second in burst mode which is nice for capturing kids running wild. It can shoot raw which can really help if you use post processing software. I recently began using light room and am amazed at how much detail it can recover from an over or under exposed image. If you're not post processing yet i strongly encourage to do so and to shoot RAW.<br /><br />Just a quick update. The camera went on sale for $300 a few days after i purchased it. I asked amazon for a refund and they refunded me without hassle. This is how you run a business. Their customer service is why I buy almost everything from Amazon.<br /><br />Also I was a little dissapointed with the low light performance until i realized that i had accidently turned on the ND filter which lowers the light by about 3 stops. Once i read the manual and figured out what i had done wrong it's been working very well. While my dslr can still take better pictures this is an enormous step up from any compact camera i have ever shot.<br /><br />Update 3/1/2013<br />I noticed that the White Balance selection is not that great on this camera... this is comparing it to my nikon which is excellent at it. This can be corrected in post processing as long as you shoot RAW. For me it does not take away anything since I don't mind post processing, but if someone only shoots JPG i could see how this would matter much more.<br /><br />Update 10/8/2013<br /><br />I have made the decision to sell the camera. I enjoyed using it for a number of months and I captured some really great photos with it, but in the end it just did not live up to my IQ standard. I still think that for the money the IQ is excellent, but I plan on purchasing the fuji x100s which is 4 times more expensive and justifiably has much better IQ. Throughout the seven months I owned the camera it has performed admirably especially given the price point.","..just received my new LX-7 today and it is quite a werk of art. Still learning the nuances in dealing with a new camera menu from a new company. The camera menu takes some getting use to if you are from the Canon or the Nikon family. Nikon (d5100) or the Canon (g12)<br />** just a quick note about removing the barrel ring when re-fitting the DMW-FA1 Lens adapter to the LX7. Many people have mentioned having problems removing this ring. Some have even gone so far as to use pliers and vise-grips. Use clean hands and carefully attempt to rotate only the small outer ring counter-clock-wise. Push and turn carefully. Easy.*<br />I will include more camera info in the future.","My 7th Lumix since 2008 when I got a TZ4 which still takes great pics but has no manual control. Camera expertise is above a basic point & shoot, but not ready for a DSLR with different lenses; F-stops confuse me among other things camera-related + I don't want to carry around a heavy DSLR. My other Pannies-most of the time I've left the dial on iA or a scene setting since I don't know enough to use it on full manual control other than using Aperture Priority.<br /><br />Opening a camera box has never taken my breath away until now! The white camera is STUNNING and this is my most \"pro-like\" camera yet.  The build-quality, other than the battery/SD door, is top rate, although tapping my finger against the body it almost feels like plastic. I *think* it's aluminum as cheaper Panasonics I own are aluminum - other web sites say it's metal so I'll take their word for it. The tripod mount is metal, too.<br /><br />NOTE: Regarding the flimsy battery/SD door--this is identical to the door on my DMC-TZ4 I've been using since 2008. The TZ4's door hasn't broken, maybe it's stronger than it appears but at the same time I'm careful with it.<br /><br />Why didn't I order this sooner?  THE LENS CAP! I've owned bridge cameras and I absolutely HATE dealing with a lens cap. I could NEVER get in the habit of removing them so I'd get an error message. (My thanks to the reviewer who enlightened me that an auto lens cap was made for the LX7, sold by RainbowImaging.) You can purchase it here but I got it $5 cheaper on eBay.  It comes in silver or black.  RainbowImaging Self-Retaining Auto Open Close Lens Cap Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX7 Leica D-Lux6 (Silver / White)<br /><br />Features of this camera I love/PROS:<br />My #1 love is the low-light capability due to a larger sensor.  I rarely use the flash, even indoors.<br />Pet owners: You will LOVE this...photos will show every strand of fur on your cat or dog, no glassy-eyes, no red-eye (see the photo of my cat I uploaded here).<br />Manual control aperture ring.<br />Made in Japan!<br />Fast shutter response, fast recycle time to next photo.<br />Superb video quality.<br />Size. Not too big, like a bridge or DSLR; although I do wish it was slightly smaller overall since I'm having trouble finding a case. Buttons have enough room between them so you don't accidentally push the wrong one.<br />Fantastic photos - honestly, I have not deleted one yet due to it being poor quality!<br /><br />CON: Panasonic decided to reverse the Quick Menu and Display Buttons on this camera - WHY? I'm having a very hard time getting used to this change.<br /><br />I recommend a Class 10 SDHC card if you're using your camera for videos, the video playback quality is better and they cost only a couple dollars more than a Class 4 or Class 6 card.","About me: I am into photography for at least 15 years and have used many film and digital cameras. I consider myself as advanced amateur, i know how to use DSLRs into full manual mode, flash photography with speedlite and using Adobe photoshop. However, I am still one of those who don't understand the histogram :) ... in fact never tried to understand.<br /><br />Cameras used in last few years - Many P&S including mega zoom Sony HX1 and currently possess Canon S95, Canon T1i & T4i DSLRs with multiple lenses. Also, kept Canon camcorder Vixia HF100 (sold sometime back).<br /><br />I am a father of 2 year old and developed reasonable skills in last few years in photo as well as video. I feel that i am reasonably placed to review a Camera like LX7.<br /><br />In very short words: Everything a Canon S95 can do, Panasonic LX7 can do better. PERIOD.<br /><br />Still want to read more into this lengthy review? :)<br /><br />Lets start from Video (since this is least covered in other reviews):<br /><br />I had a Full HD Canon camcorder Vixia HF100 (having 1/3.2 inch sensor) which was easily replaced by Canon S95 P&S for video simply for wider angle and better low light capability. Canon S95 with 720p was better than my old camcorder with 1080p.<br /><br />S95 can not zoom optically while video and no continuous auto-focus. Recently purchased Panasonic LX7 which beats canon S95 on all fronts - Continuous auto-focus, amazingly clear videos in home under average light conditions, wide as much as 24mm, goes up to 90mm on telephoto side (zoom could be less for some people) and a very big aperture which starts at F1.4 at wide end and F2,3 at the telephoto end.<br /><br />Also, sensor size (1/1.7) is bigger than most of camcorders in market (typically 1/3 or less).<br /><br />I am not saying that LX7 is better than all non-pro Camcorders but yes, its better than many cheap camcorders. Camcorders are faster in focusing, faster to adjust to brightness of light and have more optical zoom. However, lot of camcorders under $500 are struggling from at least 1 of the following issues:<br /><br />1) Smaller sensors of size 1/4 inch or even smaller (1/3 or bigger is considered decent for a camcorder to give it a good low light capability). Personally, i will never purchase a camcorder with a sensor smaller than 1/3 inch even if you load of lot of features in them like projectors (typically Sony does so).<br /><br />2) Many of Canon camcorders have 1/3 inch sensor, amazing low light capability (probably not matched by LX7 but i believe comes close) but these Canons start at disappointing 43mm at wide end which makes them useless for use at home with my kid. If you must buy camcorder, consider some Canons like M50/500/etc.. and buy a wide angle conversion lens which itself is nearly $200. But again, they do frame capture rate of 24p recorded at 60i... i am not very sure about the issue here but looks fishy. I can convert my 60p video to 24p using software (i have adobe premiere but yet to learn). Every manufacturer wants to advertize 24p somehow.<br /><br />3) Some Panasonic camcorders have good size sensor and wide angle but still reviews says 'bad in low light' and they don't do 24p either.<br /><br />Panasonic LX7 beats not only Canon S95 but also Canon T4i DSLR with 18-135mm STM lens in low light conditions for video. Aperture starts from F3.5 on T4i's 18-135 lens which is really not good for low light. Canon T4i has better/clear audio than LX7 and S95. I am sure that T4i must be better for videos in good light conditions using 18-135mm STM lens (but never tried in good light). In good light, LX7 will not have aperture advantage over T4i.<br /><br />This is my observation by making a lot of side by side videos holding 2 of them together and filming same subject, later played back on 37 inch 720p HDTV (sorry, i don't have 1080p TV). Please note that your old computers might not be able to play the 1080 content nicely and colors might look dull.<br /><br />If you have more money for camcorder, you can look at Canon VIXIA HF G10 or high end sony camcorders (do compare the sensor size).<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) White balance (this con applies to still pictures as well): You must learn to set the white balance correctly. Do little bit of learning to set custom white balance and save the custom balance (Set White 1 and Set white 2). You can also tweak the auto white balance to some extent to suit your shooting conditions. I do it to reduce the excessive yellows.<br /><br />Honestly, my first day use was an disappointment because of strong yellow cast in pictures and videos). This is the worst camera i ever used with such horrible auto white balance under certain conditions. However, it needs little bit of learning. I am no more effected by this issue due to some time spent in learning the white balance but wish it was better in auto like Canon S95.<br /><br />Note: I would have returned the camera if my primary use demanded the use of flash frequently. The white balance is horrible with flash (tested in indoor average lit conditions) and often results in strong pale colors in part of picture (uneven colors in foreground and background).<br /><br />2) The videos at highest resolution are done at 60p. It could have killed many high end camcorders if Panasonic had put the ability to do 24p. Doing 60p means that i should use a shutter speed of 120 (closest is 125 on LX7) respecting the 180 degree shutter rule. In practical terms, i lose one stop of light as compared to 24p in low light conditions. Some might not agree but its true that 24p is most preferred for videos to look smoother and happens to be most compatible format for playback on TVs, although most of sports/action is shot at 60p now a days.<br /><br />Still, videos are very bright & crisp with LX7, i could not have purchased any camcorder within $300 (price paid for LX7) having better quality as well as wide angle lens.<br /><br />3) Stereo microphone could have been better (as in Canon T4i) but still reasonable for its price and size.<br /><br />4)Some Maximum time limit (not sure how much)on videos although i never make any video even greater than 5 minutes but it can affect many users.<br /><br />5) Not pocketable - I knew it before buying and i never kept even much smaller Canon S95 in pocket. Yes, it will go into Coat pocket and that i how i carry it but plan to purchase a fitted case for it. Good thing is that there is minimal chance of accidentally switching-on in bag/pocket due to sliding on/off switch.<br /><br />6) There is a dedicated switch to change the aspect ratio for picture/video. I find it annoying. It could have been buried in menu and should have been independent for picture and video. I always want an aspect ratio of 16:9 for video and 4:3 for pictures. Having physical button means i should remember to change it when shooting video after pictures or vice-versa. I hate accidentally taking pics in 16:9 and videos in 4:3. Having it in menu and independent could be better. Any Pana designers reading this review?<br /><br />Now the still picture ability:<br /><br />Better than S95 mainly due to brighter lens on wide as well as telephoto side. The lens is actually usable at F/1.4 (not soft) and it has much less shutter lag than Canon S95. I disliked Canon S95 mainly for its high shutter lag while doing pics of my kid running/playing resulting into blurry pics.<br /><br />This camera has a hot shoe which is useless for me since i do all flash photography with my DLSR using speedlite and don't intend to make any investments here. It is nice to have for some people but i wish it was not there to make camera smaller/lighter.<br /><br />I purchased LX7 during holiday offers for $300. I feel that the Leica lens used in LX7 itself is worth the price i paid.<br /><br />The only camera which is a true competitor of LX7 is Sony RX100, comes at a much higher price (more than twice the price i paid for LX7) and its superiority over LX7 is still debatable.<br /><br />My wishlist - A camera of Sony RX100 sensor/size, Panasonic LX7's Leica lens, minimum 6x optical zoom, real 24p video, slightly better stereo mic, and in-built flash having ability to bounce by tilting vertically and rotating to sides. Should be priced with-in $500 to become the best seller and keep people like me interested. Am i asking for more ;)<br /><br />Hope this helps, feel free to ask questions or comment. Please be respectful.<br /><br />Update: 05-Aug-13<br /><br />After seeing a review my another member, i was thrilled to learn that LX7 can fire a canon speedlite mounted in hot shoe. I tried, YES, it can.... It fired my Canon 430 EXii. Next, i will be trying with Yougnuo RF triggers and update this review. (Disclosure: Canon 430 EXii becomes very top heavy with such a small cemara, holding LX7 with 430EXii mounted is really a punishment to hands ;)<br /><br />Update: 03-Apr-14<br />My original review for Video remains unchanged. However, i must admit that for still pics i am not getting many keepers, lot of my pictures go to recycle-bin these days. My expectations from myself have increased and there is something i don't like about LX7 pics - probably not as sharp as i like, less resolution, more noise and haze. I am in market for new camera probably Fujifilm X100s but will not sell LX7 because of nice video which i shoot in indoor conditions with my little son, else i am not much into video stuff.<br /><br />I think that such a nice lens of LX7 is being wasted on a mediocre sensor. Panasonic should have used atleast 2/3 inch sensor (if not 1 inch like RX100) with 12 to 14 mega pixels to use this beautiful lens better. Dropping the rating to 4 stars. Overall, 3 stars for still pictures (still better than Canon S95), 5 for video.","I bought it as used item, but comes in box like an original new one. I'am so happy with it because one of my fav machine was an Lumix LX-3 few years ago. This new LX model is the highest level of the pocket sized Pro machines.","The lens lets in significant light, allowing natural light photography in so many marginal lighting situations that it can become a go-to piece of equipment whenever it gets dim. The in body IS permits slow shutter speeds, which in conjunction with the f1.4 lens, is capable of producing useable results in hand-held situations in available light. The available square image shape can remind one of the images produced by some of the medium format cameras -- which can jump start some unique framing options. A draw-back is having to use the supplied Silkypix software to open and edit the RAW files produced by this camera, since it apparently takes upgrading to Adobe CS6 or Lightroom 4 to be able to have the latest Camera Raw plug-in to work with the RAW files produced by this camera.","Incredibly bright lens for this class of camera. Great focusing time even in low light. HDR setting is amazing. Very happy w the purchase.","I've used Canon SLRs for a long time, but they don't make good home video cameras. I shoot mostly candid pictures and videos of my kids, and there aren't any SLRs on the market with reliable autofocus in video mode. The Canon T4i is a step in the right direction, but its autofocus is still way to slow for video.<br /><br />This camera is an excellent video camera but its low-light photography capabilities are lacking. My favorite feature is its ability to shoot 720p video at 120 frames per second. The camera encodes the video at 30 frames per second on the memory card so when you play it back a 10 second shot is slowed down to 40 seconds. My kids and I had a blast making movies of them jumping around and doing flips in slow motion. There are very few cameras on the market right now with that capability.<br /><br />Pros:  this is the best general-purpose video camera I have ever used. And I have used a lot of cameras. Also takes great pictures as long as there is plenty of light.<br /><br />Cons:  I wish the power zoom lens was faster. It takes too long to zoom in. And I wish the camera could handle low-light no-flash photography better.","I bought it in $299.99 to replace my old LX3. The f1.4 fast lens and very fast focus made taking pictures more easier. I could capture my kids in action without turning on the 11fps burst. Focus is instant and accurate like SLRs do. Even I constrained ISO to <800, I still can take good pictures at night w/o turn on flash, thanks to the large lens and image stabilization. This model met my needs and expectation: small, fast, good image quality and relatively cheap.<br />The reason I did not rate 5 stars is: small image sensor(1/1.7\"), even in f1.4 the blur effect is still poor. HD movie has 10min limitation.<br />I wish they will release larger sensor (>1\") in the next version, include GPS/WiFi function and social network (FB, Instagram...) function...","I have a LX5 so I got this for my wife and if mine is great this one is even better. Looking forward to explore the timelaps-funktion","i have both the lx5 and lx7. I got the first one in the 2011 black friday and it was my companion for an around the world trip. it suffered in my pocket (both of them fits my light rain jacket without problem), being carried around in my shoulders (again both are then are great for this and if u are travelling and are not into raw or photoshop u are going to be really happy to have a light camera and not a dumb DSLR) and being placed without any case or protection in my backpack thru numerous chicken buses, trains and boats. it survived well but reaching 30k photos I decided to get the LX7 in the black friday sale of 2012.<br /><br />LX5 advantages<br /><br />my first deception was regarded the building quality. is not metal like the lx5 and it really sounds fragile.<br />- fragile in the building<br />- fragile because the adaptor ring (that i use for heavy fisheye lenses - even a 0.21X - in the lx5 without any problem cause was attached with the body of the camera) now stay in the lens and i dont see as a wise move to keep anything except a light filter.<br />- fragile because im really skeptical that the aperture ring can survive intense use<br /><br />my second deception is related with the lens upgrade. u get one f-stop more but seriously i dont see any improvement in real conditions. the quality of the photos are pretty similar.<br /><br />my third deception regards the filters. i kind of like the ones in lx5 and the lx7 ads some silly ones (like the sparkling effect that my girl loves but well...) but changed the way the high dinamic and the film grain work out<br /><br />LX7 Improvements<br /><br />1- the lcd screen is much better and i bet that any perceived improvement in the quality of the photos is related with the first impression u get looking this pretty viewer.<br /><br />2- although im really skeptical about the aperture ring quality it was a nice add specially cause panasonic keep the aspect ratio one<br /><br />3- the focus was improved but i normally use the automatic and my impression is that both lx5 and lx7 are not really great for macros (buy the canon s95, s100 or s110 if u want a nice experience in this regard)<br /><br />Competitors<br /><br />I was really divided between buying an advanced point and shot or a micro 4/3 like the olympus one. the price is pretty much the same but, and is a big but, besides buying a pancake lens for around 150-200 dollars, there is no way to those being pocketable. So we are talking about much more money and u dont get a such wide lens (although the size of the sensor in the micro 4/3 practically equates the gains of the huge (1.4) aperture of the lx7.<br /><br />I think the canon s95, s 100, s110 are really for small hands.<br /><br />the sony with 1 inch sensor is just way too expensive<br /><br />the canon g series and the nikon 7000s is too bulk<br /><br />so in my view the main competitor is the lx5. and for the current prices or any difference bigger than the 50 bucks that it was in the time i got the lx7 the lx5 is a better choice.","Just got back from Florida and I took over 400 pictures. Mostly all savers. Fast focus. Many controls. I wish lense had a little more reach.","thanks for amazon ,i get the camera on a perfect price and it can do whatever i want , god  it is  over value with price $299","For over the past 2 years my Panasonic LX5 has been my pocket-friendly, carry-everywhere compact camera; and I used it primarily for very low-light shooting (no flash, hand-held; mainly still photos, but some videos) of local musicians in bars, clubs, concerts, etc. I didn't really need a replacement for the LX5 but got caught up in the Cyber Monday buying spree when they discounted the newer LX7 for $299. I justified to myself that the faster (1 f-stop ) f/1.4 LX7 lens and the higher resolution Full HD (1080p) LX7 video was worth $299 (minus what I might sell the LX5 on ebay for), and the LX7 would be my new pocket-friendly carry-everywhere compact camera for the next 2 years, And I was certainly impressed with the first LX7 test shots of some local musicians in very low light shooting conditions, better than the LX5 shots (which were pretty good).<br /><br />Then I got to reading the great reviews on the Sony RX100 and wondered if perhaps my new pocket-friendly carry-everywhere compact camera for the next 2 years should be the RX100 (even at the higher price) rather than the LX7. So I purchased a RX100 and ran some back-to-back tests with the RX100 and the LX7. For my low-light shooting conditions, I felt the LX7 was a better low-light camera than the RX100, in that the overall pictures were brighter and had more detail in the darker areas. This was true for the wide end of the lens, and even more true for the long end of the lens. My conclusion was based on shooting in the Program mode and the Shutter priority mode, and the video mode.<br /><br />The LX7 bright lens throughout the entire focal length range (wide angle thru telephoto) was a pleasure to use, and was even more noticeable in the video mode. With the LX7 in video mode, I could start out with a great picture at the wide end of the lens, zoom in to the long end of the lens and the video image still stayed bright. With the RX100 and it's darker lens, I would start out with a great picture at the wide end, but when I zoomed in to the long end of the lens, the image got much darker than at the wide end. I loved the RX100 camera with all its great features and have no doubt that the image quality with its larger megapixel (20MP) sensor would be better in some shooting conditions than the LX7, But the 10 megapixels of the LX7 are more than I need for my shooting requirements, and low-light capability is more important to me than megapixels (although it might not be for others).<br /><br />The RX100 did have one nice low-light feature that the LX7 didn't have in the \"Anti Movement Blur\" mode where the RX100 would takes six shots in a rapid sequence, typically at a high sensitivity setting and a (relatively) fast shutter speed, and then combines them into a single image that has somewhat less noise than a single shot taken at the same ISO and exposure settings. The LX7 has a similar mode (Handheld Night Shot ), but not as effective at the RX100 Anti Movement Blur mode for my shooting conditions, in that the RX100 mode is more willing to pick a really high ISO setting like ISO 1600 or higher to maintain a fast shutter speed, whereas in the LX7 Handheld Night Shot mode, it seems to go only as high as necessary to avoid camera shake. That is, the RX100 Anti Movement Blur mode would shoot at higher shutter speeds and ISO levels than the LX7 Handheld Night Shot mode. The RX100 Anti Movement Blur mode was very good for extremely dark shooting situations (like the audience in the dark, with no direct light), but not so valuable with musicians on stage with a little light. But still a feature I wish the LX7 had.<br /><br />I think the Sony RX100 camera with its relative large sensor is a great low-light camera if you are shooting only at the wide end of the lens; but for all around shooting (throughout the full focal length range) under my shooting conditions, I think the Panasonic LX7 does a much better job with its smaller sensor but brighter lens.<br /><br />Actually I was kind of puzzled by some of the great low-light reviews on the RX100 camera. It's true that the RX100 sensor is much larger than the LX7 sensor, but the RX100 sensor has twice the megapixels than the LX7. The resulting pixel size of the RX100 is still larger than the LX7 pixels, but only by about a .77 stop at the wide end based on my calculation. At the wide end, the brighter lens of the LX7 is about 0.72 stop better than the RX100, so that essentially cancels out the advantage of the larger pixel size of the RX100. And at the long end of the lens, the low-light advantage become more in favor of the LX7 camera. Many of these reviews are based on only high ISO performances, which is not the same as low-light performance which takes into account the brightness of the lens (bright lenses can operate at lower ISO values). In several online blog postings where actual \"real-world\" back-to-back photos were shown between the LX7 and the RX100, the LX7 appeared to do an equal or better job at low-light conditions at the wide end of the lens, which tended to confirm my own back-to-back testing.<br /><br />Also, the image stabilization on the LX7 is excellent, I've taken many photos at 1/5 second with no camera shake blur. I feel that I could even shoot slower.  I've not been able to quantify how the LX7 compares with the RX100 on this issue, but I've read where the LX7 is better.<br /><br />In summary, I feel the RX100 and the LX7 are both excellent compact cameras and can recommend them both; but for me the low-light capability of the LX7 in normal shooting modes (Program, Shutter Priority, video mode, etc.) in both wide angle and telephoto gave it the edge. So I kept the LX7 and returned the RX100. I would have like to have kept them both, but I felt the LX7 would have been the one I would have used most of the time.","I bought the LX7 as an update to my much loved LX3... It has exceeded my expectations. Better sensitivity and a faster -- and longer -- lens means I can now capture hand-held images at night. The neutral density filter allows more flexibility in capturing bright images. The multiple aspect sensor is perhaps underrated... and having the 1:1 aspect ratio included on the LX7's external controls is a big plus. Things that could be better? The elimination of the LX3's dynamic black and white setting was not welcomed by me. And all the improvements to the camera (mostly done in the LX5) caused the size of the camera to increase just enough to make it less pocketable. Add the -- excellent -- electronic viewfinder and the size of the LX7 is encroaching on some micro 4/3 models. Nevertheless, I would buy it again and I do recommend it.","so far, it's a nice camera but I'm a big frustrated with the manual controls. Not being much of a photographer (I'm a filmmaker so I rarely try to shoot still photos), I was hoping with spending a little more money I would get something that would be a little more familiar as far as a professional video camera controls go. So far I haven't achieved the looks in my photos I'm trying to get. Seems like I'll get there at some point.","If you are looking for DSLR alternative, this is your camera. Small but full of features, I used it as my backup camera sometimes. But I bought it mainly to upgrade my wife's camera and she loves it as well. Highly recommended.","The LX7 is very portable and can fit inside a small belt pouch. With its f/1.4 lens, i am now getting low light shots without using the flash and even a tripod. Without the flash, i am getting more dramatic and candid shots. I have not used my dslr ever since.<br /><br />It is a bit heavier than the ordinary point & shoot and has a protruding lens even when the camera is turned off. If Panasonic can do something about the protruding lens without sacrificing quality, then this would be the best camera.<br /><br />If you are tired of bringing around your bulky dslr, then the LX7 is a great alternative camera.","I brought this camera before xmas and it arrived 2 weeks later in singapore ! I would consid3r that fast ! And the product and its packaging looks brand new and well protected !! It is highly recommanded !! LX 7 capture amazing pictures! Great seller and products !","First of all, let me say that I am a DSLR, I own a d90 and few good lenses, but I need a pocketable thing to go around....I think That is ok for a point and shot, It really has manual and priority modes, but not very straight to work with. overall built quality and photos are very good, lacks optical zoom but I rather this, and have a beautifull luminous and fast lenses... you can get some blurred background, like dslr, but not like one. If you want a cheap, well built, possibility to take raw photos, and NO COMPROMISSE  with manual settings, this can be the one, it features the iA, (inteligent auto) and it is quite impressive how this lumix can solve almost any situation. But, as a dslr user, I really want more, more manual control, more flash control, more flexibility on my hands, so I just sold my lumix and will give a try with nikon coolpix 7700. When I grab this one, I will pass through and update this review....","I chose this camera as my first \"serious\" digital camera. Before I purchased this, I had only used point and shoot digital and film models. When I was camera shopping, I was specifically looking for something that was relatively compact and could take good low light pictures. Based on various customer and magazine reviews, this one seemed to have what I was looking for and enough manual features to play and grow with.<br /><br />So far, I am very happy with the purchase. I have yet to really explore its features but here's what I've noticed so far:<br /> -- excellent low-light, most pictures can be taken without the flash;<br /> -- takes nice macro photos with minimal depth of field or defocused background<br /> -- variety of settings including aperture-priority; shutter priority; manual setting; and various other settings.<br /> -- seems to produce accurate colors.<br /><br />The few things that I dislike are (1) its kind of bulky and heavy (2) cap over lens and (3) expensive accessories (I plan on purchasing an extra battery and lens protector which are about $40 each).<br /><br />FYI--If you want to use a 37mm screw on filter for this camera, you'll need to order the filter adapter first and you'll probably need to order it from Panasonic since I don't recall seeing it being offered through Amazon. Another hassle with this is that the adapter is often on backorder. Perhaps there are other companies besides Panasonic which offer a filter adapter for this model and I would also suggest checking for this.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this camera to someone that wants the flexibility that the manual controls provide but doesn't want to commit to a larger or more expensive camera.","Been into digital cameras for years.  My first digital cam was a Canon G1 (purchased in 2000).  That Canon was a beast and looking at 12 year old pictures it's clear even back then it was a good, solid camera.  This camera was meant to replace our walk-about elph (my kid's been playing with that one for a couple years).  Still messing with it but thus far I'm not sure it was even worth the Amazon sale price of $300.<br /><br />Plus:<br />Decent low light pictures<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bulk v. image quality<br />Lens cap<br />Very slow start up time<br />Slow response to inputs/controls (slowest damn zoom ever)<br />Slow auto-focus<br />Clumsy flash<br />Flimsy battery door<br /><br />Not sending it back yet but don't think I have much time before my return window closes...","Picture quality is superb. Wish it had better zoom and Wifi, to prevent dismantling of the case.<br />Otherwise I am very happy with it.","Delivery was earlier than indicated, which was a pleasant surprise.<br />Camera image quality is similar to what is provided by online review websites.<br />Just take note that the camera sent does not include any camera case or additional peripherals. This can be positive or negative depending on how you see it - for me, it was OK because I wanted to buy my own custom case and get my own SD cards.","Infuriatingly difficult to do simple things - like adjusting the exposure compensation.  So I can't get good pictures because there are so many deep diving into the menu steps that need to be remembered just to make simple camera adjustments.  This is my third and probably last Panasonic brand camera because of this chronic \"menu designed by geeks instead of normal people\" problem.","This camera is a great step from the LX5 which has been a workhorse for our family.  Last year alone over 22,000 photos/videos all from the LX5.  This camera, the LX7 seems to have a slightly different auto balance for exposure, so we are still trying to dial that in, but I love the aperture control on the lens ring and when exposed properly the quality is AMAZING for both video and photos.<br /><br />Again, there seems to be a different engine processing the exposure rules, so out of the box we've had some blurriness that was troubling, but that's just a matter of knowing how we shoot, where we shoot, and how the camera can handle those situations.  The mark of how great this camera can be, is that we can dial it in to shoot exactly how we like to.","Two reasons that I wanted this camera: 24mm wide focal length, and f/1.4 - 2.3 aperture. Got a very good price on Amazon, paid for next day delivery, received it before noon the next day! I had been using a Canon S95, also a very nice camera, but sold it and got this LX7. I previously owned the Panasonic Lumix TZ5, so I already had a good feel for the camera. I have been taking twilight, night, and indoor shots, hand-held, with pleasing results. I might not even need to use my tripod - well, for those 5 second and longer night shots. Just don't think you can put this in a shirt pocket, it has some thickness to it. Be sure to use the lens cap strap or you will certainly misplace it, but it's not a big deal to use a removable cap - all the big DSLRs have them, right?<br />This camera has a dedicated aspect ratio dial which makes it easy to play with the square format, something I've liked when using medium format film. I have also played with the Creative Control Modes, something I've never bothered with before, and also shooting multiple exposures - I'm now addicted and always have to try a few. I do a lot of street and urban landscapes, and this camera works really well for this type of photography. Don't forget - it has a Leica lens, without the Leica price.","I am an amateur photographer, most pictures I take are of my family.  I own a Sony DSC-HX100V and a Canon SD870IS  both cameras are OK, but the Sony has poor low light performance and the Canon is too old to compare fairly to today's cameras.  So I had bought the Sony DSC-HX9V, but it is almost identical performance to the DSC-HX100V, so I decided to sell it and buy the Panasonic LUMIX LX7  instead, which is about the same size and type of camera, but with much better performance for my needs.  Just last night I took some pictures at a family dinner and used both the Sony DSC-HX100V and my new LX7.  The difference is like night and day.  I was not expecting such great results, but I was amazed at how natural the skin colors are and how great it captures light in low light shooting ( not dark, but indoors and at night )  Being a Sony fan I wanted the RX100, but when they dropped the price of the LX7 a couple of weeks ago, I decided to give this GREAT camera a try and boy am I glad I did.  Best camera for the money and compared to the RX100, the LX7 takes nicer pictures for my use.  Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to take DSLR like images with a compact solid camera. We will take a family cruise in a few months and guess which camera is going to be in my bag...","This is the fourth in the Panasonic LX series and it is the best.  The port for the add-on electronic viewfinder makes this camera very pleasant to use. The latest edition of the add-on finder is vastly superior to the one which fits the LX5.  The lens is fast (f1.4 - f 2.3)  and the images are sharp.  This is a great everyday or travel camera.","I received the LX7 as a gift because I wanted to upgrade from my LX5. After owning the LX5 for a couple years, what I'm not happy with the most is the build/material quality over the LX5. The body feels more plastic, the lens cap is cheap and isn't metal anymore, the white finish is flat and looks cheaper (I have the camera in white). The neck strap is way cheaper. Maybe these are small things to pick at but overall it just looks and feels cheaper which I'm sure it is because that's how it goes in general with any product... those not owning previous models of this camera won't know the difference anyway but this camera has definitely been cheesed down.<br /><br />Aside from that, the new menu UI is much better. The lens seems to have less distortion and fringing at it's widest. The 1.4 is nice and creamy and bright. ISO 80 is a plus. The auto white balance handling seems a little better. RAW shooting will definitely get better results overall when images are processed. And I believe the CCD sensor in the LX5 is superior in quality to the CMOS in the LX7 especially with RAW shots. Granted this is no full fledged DSLR but with the right tweaks and editing you can get pretty close in quality. I've printed 30x40's off my LX5 before.<br /><br />Another bug suck factor seems to be the battery life. On my first test on a full battery I shot less than 100 shots (no flash) and used half the battery with minimal display playback. The camera sat for a few weeks with no use. I turn it on to take a picture and the battery is DEAD. How does the batter drain with no power on? The exact same thing happened to my husband who has the same camera in black.<br /><br />Lastly, the price... why does it fluctuate so much? This camera is NOT worth more than $400. It should sell for less than $350 tops. Thank god we got them on sale when we caught the price at $249. I think I am going to sell my LX7 and go back to LX5.","It's funny, I owned analog Panasonic video camera with DV-cassets - back in 199x something. It could make still pics back then too, 1mp or so. When I looked at LX7 pics on high zoom - I became nostalgic. The noise and artifact pattern look pretty much the same - how's that possible? But this is just an awesome compact. The capabilities are immense. I never saw a low light quality like that on a compact. Video quality is the best there is out there. That's why I bought it - a compromise between high quality video and pretty good picture quality. One can feel a trade off Panasonic is facing - bigger chip or faster lens. They decided for faster lens. Will see how that works out. Bigger chit would probably be a wiser choice, but I am not so sure here...Anyway, my first pictures look good, slightly below my high expectations (I am devoted DSLR), but I think I will keep it :).<br /><br />If you're 100% picture quality fan - I'd go for G15 or G1x. If you need a capable all-rounder compact - get this one. Never considered Sony...had bad experience with their compacts, never again.","For the price of the camera I was really disappointed with the color quality. This can be adjusted somewhat within the camera but not enough so they look true to life. I have had Lumix cameras in the past and they didn't have this issue. The lens is great but not worth the price with the compromised colors. Of course you can tweek colors in a program like Photoshop or Lightroom but I wanted a point and shoot of high quality that I could just do that...point and shoot. I returned the camera.","I love this camera. It's performance is so fast picture to picture,focus start up... The image quality is superb especially indoors. My only con is the buttons feel a little flimsy but overall its a fantastic camera.","Having been a religious Canon P&S believer for 10+ years (my DSLRs are straightly Nikon, by the way), I was disheartened by a broken SD880IS (CCD fungus), a short-lived S90 (focusing malfunction) and a defective S100 (sensor defect).  While Nikon's offerings in P&S are not on par and that some other alternatives (those I like, such as the Sony RX100 or Fujifilm X10), are above my budget, I opted for an LX7.<br /><br />Although I already knew the dimensions before I made the purchase, I was still shocked to see how big it was.  By volume, an LX7 is a full 200% the size of S100, but holding in your hand it feels even larger because of the lens component intrusion.  I used to carry the S100 in a small pouch on my belt.  That's no longer an option.  This is a huge drawback, as they say the best camera is the one you have with you.  There is no way I can carry this camera with me to meetings, classes, and conferences.  I can only comfort myself that cell phones are catching up in terms of optical capacity.<br /><br />What I do not like, comparing to Canon S series: 1) No GPS; 2) This tremendously larger camera comes with an even (tiny little bit) smaller sensor and significantly fewer pixel counts; 3) The big exposure ring looks cool, but is not as ergonomic as the little front wheel found in Canon S.  In addition, it's not programmable.  The inevitable mechanical clicking sound could be a deal breaker under certain scenarios; 4) The lens cap! 5) The menu can't be more confusing; 6) This camera can really benefit from a lens hood at all time.  In other words, this design mandates a stay-on lens hood.  Panasonic engineers should figure out a way to make it happen; 7) The rear wheel and the battery switch feel flimsy.  The four directional buttons are tricky to fumble with; 8) There is literally no good case for this camera, not even the Leica Case for DLUX 6.<br /><br />What I like, also comparing to Canon S series: 1) faster focus; almost instantaneously right on; 2) writing to storage card seems to be parallel to normal operation.  There is little delay between two shots; In auto mode, the camera intelligence seems to be reluctant to go above ISO 400, which is a good call to my taste; 3) Manual focus works well, what a nice surprise! 4) The hand grip; 5) Much closer distance for close-up; 6) Easy access to an intuitive AF/AE lock; 7) The level gauge comes handy, really helpful; 8) Everything else people had praised about, such as the fast lenses, the hot shoe, etc.","I shoot weddings professionally and wanted a vacation compact body to carry around.<br />I have shot with the LX3, 5, and eventually purchased the LX 7 for several reasons:<br />f/1.4<br />Higher Res LCD screen<br />Full 1080p HD recording<br />Stereo audio in recording<br />Updated Sensor (better low light shots)<br />High fps (up to 9).<br /><br />When shooting with this camera and using flash, I usually have to dial back exposure comp to -1/3.<br />Phenomenal compact, and remarkably agile AF too.  Worth a buy, especially when it was recently discounted.","You will fall in love as soon as you start taking pictures with this camera. The quality of the pictures and video appear professional and if you have a good eye you will be amazed at what you can do with this little camera. I am attaching a link with some pics I took straight out of the box in a place near I live.<br />1) [...]<br />2) Go to youtube and check all the Lumix Lx7 videos. They are not exaggerating with the quality. For 300dlls it will be very hard to be better than this!","My sister is a professional photographer but she rarely likes to drag around her full size DSLR cameras and lenses.  THIS is THE camera she chooses to have in her purse @ all times.  Every shot she took in auto mode looked fantastic.  After her full approval of the camera I sat and waited; pouncing for purchase when the price dropped to $299.  You can't buy a better camera with such an array of features for this price.  I'm not at all familiar with a camera's manual settings but can easily try out my hand at them, then when I think I've monkeyed with it enough, I just reset back to original settings and the camera goes back to taking perfect pictures.  I do know that in AUTO mode the lens on this camera can deliver fantastic, indoor, average light shots, QUICKLY and with NO FLASH, flawlessly.  I'll try to add a photo I took in auto mode, in near darkness with the exception of an outdoor porch light that was all the way across the street.  The photo could be mistaken for being taken at 4pm in the afternoon when it was actually taken at 9pm.  Most of the photos of my children have come out beautifully with no post editing.  Even then, you can have a blast with post editing either on camera or on your own computer.  The high speed video feature is really fun, too.<br /><br />The camera feels great in your hands.  I do hate the cheesy manual cap that comes with the camera and immediately outfitted it with the Auto Lens Cap for PANASONIC LUMIX DMC LX7 LX-7, LEICA D-LUX 6 + MagicFiber Microfiber Lens Cleaning Cloth It's a must have for this camera, at a really reasonable price.  I bought a class 10 SanDisk Extreme Pro 16gb card, to ensure I have the best available write speed for the 120fps, high speed (too fun) movie option.  Honestly, I have not been able to find any documentation as to what this camera's actual write speed is, but at least I know I have the best card installed to handle what this camera can possibly deliver.<br /><br />For the average family user, you will not be disappointed at all.  Grab it while the price is low.  If it goes back up...wait it out, it'll drop again in a couple of weeks.","Easy to operate, great pictures. Recommended by my bro in- law, who owns professional cameras and lens. Good choice and great price.","Vintage and fabulous. Great lens and high picture quality. But the color on the screen could be improved, for it's colder than the original.","I've owned a Panasonic LX3 since 2008 and been very happy with it -- the LX3 has stood up to some (unintended) rough treatment and it continues to take excellent photos even with a cracked screen.  And having a 24mm (equivalent) wide end rather than the more common 28mm wide end has been really nice when taking landscapes or shots in tight quarters (for me, a wider wide angle is more important that a longer telephoto).<br /><br />I bought the LX7 as an upgrade to the LX3, and at $299, the cost of the upgrade was worth it to me.  I've had it about a month and it works very well.  The faster lens (1 stop faster), longer reach (90mm equivalent rather than 60mm), better movie capability, and aperture ring all are things I frequently use.  Image quality is at least as good as the LX3, and the LX7 gives me greater ability to have the background out of focus for portraits or macro shots.  Build quality feels as good at the LX3, the control layout is better (for example, I like the preview as a button rather than as a sliding switch as on the LX3), and the metering is consistently good.<br /><br />I also use a Canon T2i, and of course the Canon has the advantages that a larger sensor can provide. But in many situations I don't like lugging that around, and in most situations the output of the LX7 (like the LX3) is more than good enough, so the LX7 gets far more use.","Excellent feel.great pictures. No need for flash.a b c d e f g h I j k l m z","I have a DSLR (Sony Alpha), but only using it twice a year at weddings. Otherwise, I've become a Lumix fan, having a ZS7 and ZS20. I got this camera because it was a great value at $299 on Cyber-Monday (The almost identical Leice D-Lux 6 with the same Panasonic electronics and Leica lens is $799(http://www.amazon.com/Leica-DLUX-10-megapixel-Digital-Camera/dp/B009E3VFDA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356698296&sr=8-1&keywords=leica+d+lux+6).<br /><br />It has a hot shoe for an external flash (and external optical or electronic viewers). I am really impressed with its creative modes though I may still go a bit overboard on the star filter. Fortunately, you can take regular pics you took and add the filter effects afterwards creating a copy with the desired effect.<br /><br />I wish it had a greater zoom range, but that's the price you pay for having such a fast lens. Plus, that's what my ZS20 (20x optical zoom) is for!  The hand-held night setting is pretty impressive, too, taking multiple shots and then combining them for a blur free final pic.<br /><br />The ability for a compact camera to take RAW pics is a great bonus, too. So far, I really, really like the camera and highly recommend it!","I will love to have a view finder too, or at least Amazon should offer a EVF separately.<br />I do not like the lens cup, further I could not unscrew the external lens ring to attach the autoamtic lens cup.","I like this camera good quality for the price $299<br />Not enough compact for the pocket but it's ok to transport it in you bag.low range optical zoom and 10 mpixel it's not enough for big pictures.","For me, in many ways the best cameras in this category were being made around 2005. They were bridge cameras with much bigger 2/3\" sensors, 28-200mm f2.8 lenses, flip out and twist monitors and evfs all included (e.g. Minolta A200). Now all the manufacturers have value engineered them, so we have most of this category with tiny sensors (except Sony RX100) the Canon G15 without a flip out monitor or evf, the Nikon F7700 without ANY viewfinder, the Fuji X10 without a flip-out monitor (plus wierd sensor processing - orb issue), the LX7 with 90mm max zoom and fixed monitor, the RX100 pared down to lens and fabulous sensor (with price tag to match), and finally all the Micro 4/3rds cameras with only a 28-84mm equivalent zoom.<br />How come the cheaper superzooms get evfs & flip out & twist monitors, but not enthusiast models?<br />So since they are all missing limbs, I decided to get the cheapest to last for a couple of years and see if any of the manufacturers finally decide to offer the full kit. The LX7 dropped in price to $300 and I snagged it.<br />Nevertheless, I have been pleasantly surprised. Yes, the zoom is a little too short for me (112mm would be fine) and I miss the flip out monitor for videos and kid shots but it has some great tricks. My favorite is the 'fixed' focal lengths. If you set it up right it moves directly between 24, 28, 35, 50 etc and the zoom memory returns it to previous zoom on start-up. This stops all the endless fiddling with the tiny zoom lever. Also, the f-stop ring makes Aperture mode a doddle to use, plus it's fast and polished in just about every operation. Yes, this'll do for now.","I was considering buying the LX7 to get a brighter and wider lens, and improved video in a pocket sized point and shoot. Huge discounts for Xmas sealed the deal. It ticks all 3 boxes pretty well.","Great camera.  My husband is very happy to play with features.  But even he admitted that automatic mode gave him the best picture.  And he considers himself a pro.  The neck band is a little awkward since the camera is really small and lightweight.  He replaced it with wrist band from old camera and it is fine. The lens cover is a little small for his fingers.  Would be nice to have lens cover going over and not inside.  Minor inconveniences we can live with.  Great pictures and amazing movies.  At $299 it priced right as well.","The price could not be beat ANYWHERE!!! I was originally looking at a larger format  DSLR camera, when a friend of mine in the video biz suggested I look at this. As most of my picture taking is outdoors the weight ( or lack of weight and bulk) and the lens speed was of particular importance to me. The lens is very very fast and able to produce low light pictures as good and in many cases better than a DSLR. With a camera case slung around my neck, it weighs less than 3 lbs. making all day carrying a delight. It has filled a perfect inch for me. It shoots JPEG and RAW pictures and will shoot 1080p movies, awesome. Save your neck and shoulder and get one.","It met my expectations.<br />The only con would be the lens cap that is easy to loose since it is not fixed to the camera body.","I am a novice camera user and am still trying to wrap my head around the technical aspects of photography.  That being said, I'll admit that I still enjoy taking pictures, especially of my family.  So I did a TON of research into the perfect camera (by my standards) and found that the LX7 fit these criteria:<br /><br />*size: not as cumbersome as my husbands T2i which I've come to refer to as the \"3rd child\".  I didn't need a pocket-able camera since I don't usually put cameras or phones in my pocket.<br />*low-light use: like most parents, we are always taking pictures in various scenarios; the holidays and birthday parties don't usually offer optimal lighting...so after reading many many many reviews, I came to see that the LX7 is great at low-light shots.<br />*macro: I take pictures for ebay and etsy and while I don't need my shots to look like I paid to have them taken, I do like a nice, clear, picture.  This has been next to impossible (especially with jewelry) with my husband's t2i since the only lens he has is huge and I can't zoom into the detail I want.  I have resorted to using my old Sony point-and-shoot for close-up shots, but I have to add A LOT of supplemental lighting, of which the quality isn't that great.<br /><br />With those criteria, I found the LX7 to fit the bill, but at the price point of almost 500, it was too much to spend on something I didn't \"need\", but when the price dropped around Cyber Monday, I promptly informed my husband and he generously purchased it as a Christmas gift for me.  That being said, I have only possessed this camera for a little over 24 hours, so my review is premature, but I will update when/if I see necessary.  Here's how it met my criteria:<br /><br />*size: PERFECT! it's small enough to throw in a bag or purse but large enough to stabilize.  On a side note, I feel I need to discuss the whole \"strap\" situation that many feel is a major concern.  Yes, the strap on the LX7 is awkward.  It's really a matter of personal preference.  I ordered a wrist strap for around 8 bucks.  I probably won't use the neck (shoulder) strap that it comes with since the camera isn't quite big/heavy enough to warrant a neck strap.  Again, I will update this review if my opinion changes once I actually use the wrist strap but so far I haven't found much use for the neck strap.<br /><br />*low-light use: I used the camera all day on Christmas and played around with it today (the day after) and rarely used the flash.  The camera takes great pictures in low-light situations.  I took lots and lots of shots of my Christmas tree without any supplemental lighting and they are all beautiful.  Just like any point-and-shoot, the flash tends to be very harsh and doesn't \"fill\" like it should, but I think that fact that you rarely need to flash makes up for the actual flash deficiencies, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />*macro: now this is where Cupid struck.  I love love love the macro.  It's divine! I've been playing around with the settings and tweaked it so that it takes perfect shots of the tiniest little toys.  I am very impressed with how well, even in the auto mode, it takes pictures and gets the fine details.  All without the harshness of the flash.<br /><br />Some other notes are that I did put the pictures on my desktop (an iMac) and they look superb.  Not 100% of the gift-opening pictures came out great, but there was A LOT of movement in a relatively low-lit area. I am very happy with how easy this camera is to use.<br /><br />And one more note on the lens cap since I feel I need to put my two-cents in.  Really, people?? really????? It's not a big deal.  It took me 1 nano-second to figure out how to very very quickly remove the lens cap with the flick of a finger.  I would rather not purchase an after-market supplementation that requires me to dismantle my camera to apply.  Those \"auto\" lens caps don't seem very safe to me.  I would worry about dust getting in.  Also, since it seems like most LX7 users also use a dSLR, I would think that the tiny lens cap (and supplied strap) wouldn't be a big deal.  But, that's just my opinion!<br /><br />I know my review isn't full of technical jargon and that's because I'm not familiar with all of that.  I think that if you're looking for an excellent point-and-shoot, this is the camera for you.  I think that if you're looking for a camera to carry around instead of a clunky dSLR, this is the camera for you.  It's the \"have your cake and eat it too\" camera :)","This is my first point and shoot.  I have been using a Nikon D 80 for many years and I love it, however, it is heavy!  I can be very creative with this camera without getting a sore neck.","I had previously owned the LX3.  This unit is a big improvement over an already excellent product.  At the one day price, I couldn't pass up the deal.","Amazing camera for low light photography as it has a super fast F1.4 (bright lens).  Also offers full manual control but you can use it as a simple point and shoot, it has one of the best auto modes in the business, press the button and it does all the hard work for you.<br /><br />Takes amazing video and one of the few cameras to offer full manual control for video if you like getting creative.<br /><br />The LX series of these cameras has a cult following and for good reason, this is a great camera for those who want the features of a DSLR but without the weight and bulk.<br /><br />Note, this camera fits in a jacket pocket not a trouser pocket.","We have really enjoyed using this camera.  It is easy to use and takes a great photo or video.  We got it in time to take on our vacation in Hawaii.  The day & night time photos turned out so nice.  We would highly recommend this camera for the casual user.","I'm just a casual amateur photographer. I mainly take grand kid and pet pictures. I was looking for a camera with good low light performance and also a camera with fast recovery between shot.  My older cameras (Canon G5 and Casio Z750) both have poor low light performance. Neither camera could auto focus on a black cat with low room lighting. Both old cameras had very slow recovery between shots, especially if flash is used. The Lumix LX7 has none of these faults, this is the proverbial can take a pic of a black cat in a coal bin camera. It does everything I want a camera to do, very well. I have only owned my LX7 for month and still discovering all of the extensive auto and manual features. But so far I'm very pleased and glad I made the purchase. An added bonus, I bought this camera on Black Friday here at amazon for only $299.00.  This camera is worth its full retail price!","This is the best camera for low light conditions at the price point! Fast point and shoot. I wish it could come with the auto lens cover and support  panaroma shoots.","I initially bought the Sony RX100 from Henrys falling for all the glowing reviews about the 1\" sensor and how great low light performance was.  After using for it about a week and trying it out in every scenario I can, I came to hate my decision... The low light performance is great don't get me wrong, it's the 'everything-else' that I had issues with.  In every other scenario, the RX100's performance was mediocre at best and most of the images produced I was actually able to duplicate and in some cases perform better with my very old Canon S3is.  Again, the ONLY area this camera performs great is in low low low light... The typical indoors at bar or at home performance of this camera is nothing to out of the ordinary and only shines in very low light settings... I mean candle light levels is the only time RX100 shines versus other advanced compacts.  I returned the Sony RX100 for full money back (up to14 days in perfect condition at the store I bought it from).  Lastly.. I am never one two review a picture camera for its video performance, but this cameras video shooting capabilities were not bad... not great but not bad either.  The tripod hook on the bottom of the camera is in the WORST position imaginable... it effectively cuts off the power ports on the bottom of the camera when using a tripod...the limitations of no EVF is just sad for this price level of a camera as well.<br /><br />I than purchased the Panasonic DMC-LX7 from Amazon for MUCH cheaper than the RX100 and began my rigorous testing for the week ahead of me.  I was very pleased first of all with the feel of the camera as it felt solid in my hands and the rubber grip made it feel much more comfortable to hold with one hand.  The quality of the photos produced in by this camera far surpassed my expectations and in all but very very very low light levels, beat the RX100 by miles. Having said that, the f1.4 lens on this camera is amazing in low light and takes extremely sharp and clean pictures, even in very low light conditions.  In regular indoors and outdoor conditions, I can easily say that this camera far surpasses any other advanced compact I have tried.  It even performs better in some cases than my Canon T3i DSLR.  The brokeh of the f1.4 lens on this camera is just awe inspiring  awesome. the sharpness and the details of the pictures produced are just amazing.  I bought the EVF as well for this camera and use it most of the time and and extremely grateful that Panasonic has this option. the battery life is pretty good to average for cameras in this range, it felt that the RX100 and this camera exactly the same in fact.  The macro performance was again, much better in DMC-LX7 vs the RX100.  on top of all the areas that this camera is amazing, it even has a built in ND filter which performs amazingly.  With the ND filter and the 250sec exposure time (the highest by far in this range of cameras.) I was able to produce some of the most stunning pictures I ever produced.  Some I would even dare to compare to Nikon D4.... With the ND filter, I was even able to produce very long exposure shots in daylight conditions... Again, I am not much for video reviews of picture cameras, but I can't leave this post without mentioning the amazing performance of the 120fps full HD video in this camera.  The videos produced are amazing quality and you even get a full spectrum of manual controls while in video mode!.  The high speed video is HUGE plus for this camera as well and the quality of the video is comparable to most $500 range video cameras. All in all, this camera is far far more than the listed price of $449.00 with its amazing performance of the f1.4 lens and the ND filter and the 250 sec exposure time.","for such low price, how can one refuse the experience with such camera with  a Leica f1.4 lens?  The answer is no one could.<br /><br />Compared with LX5, there is not significant change but the lens and sensor.  The pic quanlity is slightly better than the lx5 in low light conditions. More functions in lx7, but not very useful to me.  The use is similar to lx5, the aperture ring is fun to have, but not necessary to add weight..<br /><br />sizewise, still the same as lx5, a little bigger to put it into pocket.","I did a LOT of research. An obsessive amount. This was the winner, and now that I'm using it I am not disappointed.<br /><br />Quibbles: You can't shoot RAW format in Intelligent-Auto mode. Which is a pity because IA mode is awesome. But at least the JPEG creation on this camera is superior to the LX5 (the previous model). The LX5 JPEGs were really messy. These are cleaner.<br />Another quibble, although I appreciate the ability to adjust exposure compensation, the multipurpose dial and software implementation is a bit fiddly. I'd prefer a dedicated control for this.<br />The lens cap. It has a lens cap. Really annoying in a P&S. I keep forgetting to take it off, and I'll probably lose it eventually.<br />And a completely unreasonable quibble: no dedicated microphone jack. You won't be using this for commercial film production, despite the video quality. But almost no camera in this price range has a mic jack anyway. (The onboard stereo mics are fine, as far as they go.)<br /><br />Raves: The lens. The low-light capability. The way it fits your hand. The lens again. The fast focusing. The excellent VR. True HD movie-making. Responsive, fast operation.<br /><br />It's a small sensor, so there will be noise at high ISO, but it is not too objectionable and looks very much like natural film grain. With adequate light, the pictures are quite smooth.<br />This is my 4th Lumix. Panasonic is doing a very good job.<br />For a lot more details, visit dpreview dot com -- I found their reviews very helpful in making my decision.","For a while I had been considering a DSLR.....Then I realized after vacationing with my sister who has a giant DSLR...she hardly ever took it off \"auto\" and not only that, it is huge and bulky and awkward to travel with. I then realized what I wanted was a hybrid between a point and shoot and a DSLR. Something compact enough to travel with and not give my back problems, fancy enough so I could mess around with depth of field and exposure, but casual enough that I wouldn't feel guilty for using the automatic setting, but most of all a camera that could produce great sharp true to color photos... My top pics (based on reviews and photography blogs) were the Sony RX100, the Fuji X10, the Canon powershot S110 and the Lumix LX7. The unfortunate thing is I could never pull the trigger on a high priced camera that I couldn't hold in my hands before buying (yes I always like to try things out at frys or best buy )...it was hopeless.Then the LX7 went on sale and since Amazon has a pretty good return policy, I thought I'd try it out. At $300 cheaper then the RX100, I'm glad I got the impulse to buy this camera. I'm really having fun taking photos. The AF is quick and pictures come out very sharp! I love the creative control, and even though it's not a pocket-sized camera (at least not in skinny jeans), it's very portable with a handy neck strap. It's confusing as a non-pro to go online and read dozens of reviews all day and hear thousands of criticisms about every single camera even the most expensive of the bunch... I realized I just had to ignore most of what I read. I'm glad I chose the LX7, for the price and of the features (even something as simple as a level gauge is blowing my mind!). I look forward to testing it out even more.<br />If I had to list one issue with the LX7, it's the lens cap. I'm not used to putting one on and taking it off, so I've bumped the lens with my fingers a few times when I'm hastily trying to cram the camera back into my bag. I wish there was a legit lens filter to fit the LX7 on amazon..that would solve my anxiety about scratching my lens ..But I guess this camera is pretty new, so add-ons haven't really come out yet.","I picked up this little marvel as a Black Friday special.

In this time I have also used Canon S90 and S100, and Nikon DSLRs.<br /><br />First off, I think it's funny how the features that camera companies market as being the big selling points for their products differ to the reality of what is actually great or mediocre about them. With all the buzz-words Panasonic and others throw around with each release, it becomes a challenge to parce out what's really new or meaningful for this model compared to previous ones, and its competitors. That said, here are for me the main selling points of the LX7:<br /><br />What I like:<br /><br /> - The lens. Unbeatable f/1.4-2.3 max aperture range, with 24mm wideangle! That is a full stop brighter across the zoom range compared to the LX5, and unmatched by any other compact zoom camera.<br /> - Noticeably improved autofocus speed compared to LX5 (even after the LX5 firmware upgrade)<br /> - Noticeably improved shot-to-shot lag time, as well as shutter-button-press-to-capture lag time<br /> - Nice, 920k-dot LCD screen<br /> - The multi-aspect sensor. Introduced in 2008 with the LX3, this continues to be one of the great (and under-appreciated) features of the LX series. Enables 24mm wideangle at every aspect ratio (except 1:1, which would likely make the sensor prohibitively expensive).<br /> - The electronic level is surprisingly useful, and should save me a lot of time in post-production just straightening the images. I leave it turned on pretty much all the time.<br /> - The ND (neutral density) filter is a welcome addition, especially given the diminished minimum aperture range.<br /> - Another oldie but goodie: Panasonic's Intelligent ISO. Automatically adjusts capture settings based on camera shake and focal length; very useful! I get more usable shots from my Panasonic LX-series cameras than I do with my Canon S-series cameras because of this feature.<br /> - The macro is very good on LX cameras, with extremely close focusing distances when zoomed out.<br /> - Marketing gimmicks: 3D (kinda fun, actually, if you can convert the files), time-lapse, HDR, panorama, high-speed video, 1080p video with stereo audio, aspect bracketing, multi-exposure night mode, some good burst modes for JPEG shooters, and some other nice features I'm not likely to ever use.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br /> - It's noteceably bigger and heavier than the LX5.<br /> - Relatively slow zoom in/out (same as LX5). Trade-off is that there is no mechanical noise during zoom in video recording (as in Canon S-series). Might prefer a mechanical zoom similar to Fujifilm's X10 and XF1.<br /> - No one likes the lens cap. Still. I bought one of those auto-folding ones from Amazon at the same time, so at least those sellers & manufactures will continue to see healthy sales. It's nice, but makes the camera seem even larger (and more difficult to fit in a pouch/pocket/etc.<br /> - I also hate the shoulder strap Panasonic seems to love to much, and echo others who have suggested including some kind of wrist or hand strap instead. I end up folding the shoulder strap and taping it into a neat handle that straddles the top of the camera; this is infinitely more useful for me (and safer to boot).<br /> - The dedicated aperture ring. I appreciate the attempt at adding additional external controls, but I would have preferred dedicated EC, ISO, or shutter speed to aperture. On compact cameras, there is little reason to shoot in aperture-priority mode, as the depth-of-field is going to be deep in just about any setting, so this is really just a big waste of a feature that could have been really useful. Of course, a multi-function ring would have been the obvious choice. Perhaps Panasonic wanted to save this up for the LX9?<br /> - To accommodate the aperture ring, the aspect ratio and focus dials on the LX7's lens barrel are smaller and closer to the camera body compared to the LX5. They are also harder to adjust, and are oriented in reverse to the LX5... not an issue in and of itself, but a minor annoyance from those upgrading from an older LX model.<br /> - Likewise, the mode dial takes more effort to turn compared to LX5. I imagine this change was implemented thanks to feedback from previous models saying that the mode dial was too easily bumped accidentally while the camera was not in use. Fine. That happened to me a couple times. But I miss not being able to easily change it with my thumb; now I need a thumb and forefinger to adjust the dial while I hold the camera with my other hand. And in fairness, the dial now protrudes slightly more.<br /> - Panasonic effectively replaced the LX5's Focus button with a White Balance button, which is fine, but they also removed white balance from the quick menu, which I find annoying.<br /> - Cannot delete image after capture in image review... seriously? I consider this a bug. Would also be nice to scroll between images in image review mode.<br /> - Still relatively slow buffer--not for shot-to-shot, but shot-to-playback.<br /> - Poor color rendition (Adobe RAW defaults, compared to larger-sensor cameras)<br /> - Menu is more attractive than predecessors, but still tricky to navigate, and cannot be navigated quickly. There is also no in-camera help.<br /> - Image quality not the greatest; effectively unchanged from predecessors. Panasonic actually uses a smaller sensor in the LX7, presumably in order to accommodate the bright lens. A fair trade.<br /> - Slightly shorter battery life compared to LX5. Granted, the LX5's battery life is pretty solid (for a compact), and on the LX7 I think it's still solidly above average. My guess is it's the drain from the hi-res screen. Another fair trade. One nice thing, however, is that the LX7 and LX5 use the same batteries. I wouldn't mind, however, a much larger battery, as there's room for the hand grip to extend thanks to the protruding lens.<br /> - No GPS. I like having this option on my S100, but it does take a toll on battery and camera size.<br /> - Panasonic's mystifying folder hierarchy and file naming conventions. Would be nice to be able to browse a cleaner card, and customize file-naming convention (but one that makes more sense would be a good start).<br /><br />Don't let that long list of cons scare you; it's always easier to come up with things that aren't perfect than things that genuinely please you. It's just a heads-up for things that may or may not bother you, as well as a hint to Panasonic for things they should work on for the LX9.<br /><br />Before I bought the LX7 I was also considering Fujifilm's X10 (or its future successor), the more compact XF1, or nothing at all. I really love what Fujifilm is doing with their stylish, retro designs and innovative controls built around very capable compacts that supposedly product stunning JPEGs but lousy RAW images (due to their maverick sensor designs). Check 'em out. In all honesty, I might not have upgraded if it weren't for a momentary, massive price drop on the LX7 (others have mentioned that Amazon's price for this camera tends to fluctuate). But now that I've got it, I'm pleased with the progress Panasonic has made, and sold my LX5. It's a pleasure to use compared to the S100, which I might sell also, except that its size lends itself better to sticking into a small bag for \"just in case\" occasions.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the Panasonic LX7's shining star is its bight lens. Add to that a nice screen and faster operation across the board, along with everything the LX series already had going for it, this camera's a real winner.","I have used the LX5, S95 and now the LX7.  Also own a SX40 and older point and shoots.  You can read praises for this camera all over the place, so I shall try to mention only what prominently stood out to me.  I am not a pro, but just your avergage Joe wanting to take better pics of the kids and family in low lights indoors.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-----<br />King of low light.  In low / indoor lights, though noise is evident at low ISO (around 300ish) the results are quite usable and superior to most other point and shoots.  What really makes it stand out is the F/1.4-2.3 bright lens combined with the ROCK ROCK (yes I said it twice) solid stabilization.  To those that are not so familiar with the numbers \"F/1.4-2.3\", what that means is the lens lets in lots of light which keeps the shutter time low, and add to it the excellent stabilization, you can take blur free shots almost all the time.<br /><br />Ok, when I said King of low light, I have to tell you that I have not used any camera that costs more than $500 (I wish I could try a RX100 sometime).  Neither have I tried any sensor bigger than 1/1.6<br /><br />Fast fast fast.  _BOTH_ focussing and shooting.  Something in addition to the low shutter time seems to make this camera shoot so fast fast.  Especially shots in succession like in auto bracketing or in the built in HDR mode.  May be a big internal buffer or something.  Auto-focus is extremely quick (I think more so in the AF tracking mode).<br /><br />Like the C1/C2 custom modes (four of them).<br /><br />HDR scene mode (see some remarks on it at the end).<br /><br />Cons:<br />-----<br />This one - I am really really annoyed with.  You cannot use the timer (2/10 sec) option when doing auto exposure bracketing.  They put both of them on the same menu which is insane in my opinion.  When you do auto bracketing you normally have the camera on a tripod, and have a timer option so the camera shoots the 3 shots after a small delay by which the camera has stabilized.  This is important because you want the 3 shots to be perfectly aligned.  It may not be fair to knock off two stars for this reason from an excellent camera, but I guess people may specifically read 3 star reviews and I want them to know about this issue in advance.  Had I been aware of this, I may not have purchased it.<br /><br />PANASONIC, please fix this with a firmware release making it a near perfect camera.<br /><br />LATER EDIT:  I have come to forgive this to some extent since I can align the multiple shots in software.  The problem still exists though if the exposure time is not going to be fast...<br /><br />This one annoys me a lot, but does not affect any functionality.  When in review/play mode you have 15 seconds (non customizable) before the lens will retract.  I often seem to easily pass that limit while inspecting shots, and hence the lens keeps moving back and forth and the motor whirring.  Why such a big hurry designers?  30 seconds (or a customer option) would have been so much better.<br /><br />General remarks:<br />----------------<br />The S95 paled in comparison to this in indoor low light shots, especially when zooming in (even a bit) because the S95 lens quickly becomes slower as you zoom.<br /><br />The lower battery life (compared to the LX5) is very noticeable.<br /><br />With almost every SD card, the camera said \"This card was formatted by an external device and is not suitable for recording\".  However it continues to record to the card.  May be camera prefers the card to formatted by the camera so it can perform better - if that is the case, please display a non-confusing message.<br /><br />The wide angle lens is very nice.  But I don't know if it is working against my needs.  When I am shooting indoors/kids at F/1.4 (wide end) from a few feet away, I have so much other junk in the frame and the subject occupies only a small portion of the frame.<br /><br />I like the fact that the tripod socket is not obstructing the SD card/battery cover.  So I can leave the tripod base plate on it permanently if needed.  However I do not see using this camers on a tripod at all, for reasons that it is plenty fast and the auto bracketing feature (requiring the tripod) being crippled by the timer issue I mentioned.<br /><br />The build in HDR is nice and I was really looking forward to seeing/using it.  However it does not give you any control over ISO, +/- compensation or anything.  And if you use in low light it will end up using a high ISO to keep the shots fast.  Overall it does give better pictures in some situations and is a very nice bonus feature, but having no control over what it did fell short of my expectations.  The S95 has HDR too, but it will ask you to put the camera on a tripod and you better obey.  No tripod required for the LX7, shoots 3 shots so quickly even handheld, and gives a good final result.","I wanted to compare my new Lumix LX7 against a Sony RX100 and decided to just take some random images using each cameras automatic modes. I just wanted to see if there were significant differences in the hands of an amateur. (ie since automatic mode tends to be used the most). The images were a mix of landscapes, macros, indoors, etc.<br /><br />In general the IQ differences between the two were very subtle.<br /><br />The Sony very slightly edges out the Lumix in most scenes for IQ.  The biggest difference I noticed was that the Sony did a much better job with automatic white balance. It was pretty impressive in this regard. (not much need for post processing).<br /><br />The Lumix did a better job then Sony in close up Macro's.  (even when Sony images are cropped)<br /><br />The Lumix seems much better built then the Sony. Hinged connector access door, better switches, better flash pop up and overall it's much more ergonomic.  But that comes at the expense of larger size/weight.  Other then the smaller size the Sony just doesn't feel as good in your hands.<br /><br />When the LX7 goes on sale for $300 it seems like a \"no brainer\" as long as ultimate pocketability isn't a major concern.","I bought the LX7 as a replacement for my LX5, and my observations here are mainly about the differences between the two.<br /><br />Generally speaking, almost everything about the LX7 -- start-up, focusing, and of course the f1.4 lens -- works faster and/or better than on the LX5. Perhaps most importantly, the LX7's f1.4 lens is every bit as sharp as the f2.0 lens on my LX5. And despite the camera's small sensor, identical daytime scenes photographed with my LX7 and with my Canon T1i are indistinguishable as 11x14 prints.<br /><br />The LVF-2 electronic viewfinder for the LX7 is a pure joy to use, markedly improving upon the LX5's LVF-1 in resolution and (to a lesser degree) brightness. But it's also noticeably larger than the earlier EVF, which slightly undercuts the LX7's charm as a high-end \"stealth camera\". (BTW, the EVF for the LX7 can NOT be used on the LX5, nor vice-versa.)<br /><br />The LX7's menu listings remain a jumble -- not exactly confusing, but way too lengthy and convoluted to memorize easily. It really helps to spend a couple of hours with the on-screen manual before venturing out with camera in hand -- and a couple of hours in the field becoming facile with manipulating the settings in real-life situations. Many of the possible settings -- like, say, saving a file in RAW format -- work only in SOME of the shooting modes. The \"intelligent HDR\" mode, for instance, saves only in JPEG format. (Now why go to the trouble of using HDR if you only get a jpeg file to work with?)<br /><br />The lens itself feels quite vulnerable. The front element is large, not recessed, and does not allow for the addition of a lens shade. And it WILL get wet if exposed to even the faintest hint of mist or drizzle.<br /><br />Also, the battery runs down more rapidly on the LX7 than it does on the LX5. (The LX7 uses the SAME battery as the LX5, however, so if you're upgrading you can use the batteries for the two cameras interchangeably.)<br /><br />CONCLUSION: despite my nit-picking, the LX7 is a truly wonderful camera! I owned an LX5 prior to this, and an LX3 before that -- each has performed admirably, and each has been a notable improvement (or advancement) over its predecessor","Great compact to use. Pictures come out great and there is quite a lot of controls.<br /><br />Only upset over the lack of accessories and not all of LX3 / LX5 accessories can be used with this camera.","This camera has a lot of features for most users.  Fairly simple to use.  The manual is 226 pages, a little much.","it is a good deal.  I think it worth it. I would always check the websites in the future. Haa","Well firstly when I think about this camera really I think what doesn't it have?<br /><br />LIKE<br /><br />-f/1.4 lens<br />-1080p 60fps / 720p 120fps with manual control over the video and fantastic quality<br />-takes up to 60fps pictures, and can configure to 50, 30, 10, 5 and 3 with continuous AF<br />-Full manual photo control<br />-All types on picture modes and filters that you could want (though honestly i don't really use them much)<br />-Hardware controls up the wazoo, aperture ring, aspect ratio slider, focus mode slider, focus knob, and shutter speed knob, video button, hot shoe<br />-Great battery life, over 300 shots<br />-Photo quality not to far from the RX100 from what I've seen.<br />-Very speedy, quick AF and operation, I never feel like I'm waiting for the device.<br />-Great design easy to hold<br /><br />NOT LIKE<br />- AVCHD was difficult to work with, I converted to MP4 and stuck it to play on my xbox and it had issues playing it.<br />- The camera is just above pocketable, It really seems like they could have made it smaller.<br />- The zoom, but really that's just how things go with a high aperture lens.<br />- I wish it had more high speed options like 240fpsh the fz200 has this feature<br />- no ability to view photos without turning it on completely<br />- Lens cap is slightly annoying<br /><br />Overall one of the most fun cameras I've had, I like it much better than the canon s100 I had. It originally caught my attention with the ability to do 720p 120fps which is amazingly fun, I like seeing the high speed videos options becoming more abundant. Hope to see what other tricks the have for the next generation of this.","I have been a strictly DSLR user for years. But recently I found that I had a need for a compact camera, when taking the DSLR wasn't appropriate. I needed something I could fit in a pocket and it had to take RAW images. From there I was spec comparing, and it really came down to price. With the 299 price tag during Cyber Monday, this was the winner.<br /><br />This is the first Panasonic camera I have ever owned (I do have a panasonic video recorder with some similar menu titles) so it took me a while to get used to the layout. I'm not a big fan of jumping into on screen menus to makes changes, as I feel it's much slower than using the mini LCD on top of most DSLRs. So I'm very glad for the aperture ring (I do 95% of my shooting in aperture priority). I'm also very glad for the wheel that allows me to change my exposure compensation. However, the Quick Menu could use some work, as I don't find it quick enough.<br /><br />I also like the button layout choices.  My left hand is basically free to make aperture and focus changes, while my right hand does the rest. The text on the buttons is hard to read, but the positions feel natural as I was able to quickly memorize them. I think it's GREAT that the movie recording button is recessed, making it almost impossible to accidentally press.<br /><br />The size and weight f the camera is also respectable. I can easily fit it in a jacket pocket, and depending on the pants I am wearing, a pants pocket. The camera feels dense and sturdy overall, expect for some of the top buttons which I'm afraid could be bumped off. Of note, I have very large hands, and this camera feels very comfortable in them. There is enough space between each button that allows me to press them without hitting others.<br /><br />Now that the physical aspects of the camera are out of the way, how does it perform? Starting with the autofocus, which is lighting fast. I recommend setting the autofocus box size as small as possible. This helps ensure that the point you want focused is in focus. The focus tracking feature is pretty handy, especially for kids and pets.<br /><br />The inboard flash isn't any good, just like all built in flashes I have ever used. But the inclusion of a hotshot is fantastic. I can throw on one of my manual flashes that allows me to bounce the flash around and also use my wireless triggers. I did notice that there are very few panasonic compatible TTL flashes, which is a concern if you are not comfortable setting flash strength manually.<br /><br />Quality of photos is outstanding for a compact. I shot in a number of different lighting situations, and was very impressed at the results. Sure my DSLR takes higher quality photos, especially in tricky light, but I would expect nothing else. I did notice a slight bit of chromatic aberration in some high contrast areas, and the auto white balance is a bit towards cool/green, but those thinks are easily fixed in post when using RAW. and surprisingly, when the sun is in the frame, I like the burst created by this a bit better than from the DSLR.<br /><br />I find the image stabilization to work very well. I can keep the ISO low but continue to get decent photos. Nothing compares to using a tripod, but at least this gives me usable images in low light.<br /><br />One thing that is a big annoying is the write speed of images. Auto focus is fast, menus are fast, shutter lag is short, frames per second is high, and the LCD is very responsive. But writing images to the card is annoyingly slow (I'm using a fast card). The main downside here is that you cannot view images while the buffer is clearing, and you cannot fully power off until the buffer is clear.<br /><br />Some minor additions to the review:<br />* I would prefer to not have a neck strap, and just a wrist strap. A neck strap just isn't needed for a compact.<br />* You need to remove the battery to charge it. It seems to be able to keep the time, I just hope there isn't some hard to replace mini battery that will die in a few years. It would be great if it could charge via the USB port.<br />* The ND filter is a nice touch. Combine that with a physical ND filter and you could get some very long exposures during the day.<br />* The included software (as least for the Mac) is crap. Don't bother with it.<br />* There is an included strap to connect the lens cap to the camera. I almost threw it away because it was packed strangely.<br />* I cannot understand why the main menu has so many pages per section. It takes forever to navigate. Hopefully as I get my main setting settled, this wont be too much of an issue.<br />* The histogram is lacking. You can only turn it on globally (can't choose to just have it show during playback) and there is no RGB histogram. The latter is a major disappointment.<br />* The aperture only goes down to f/8, even in manual mode. Under most circumstances, this isn't a big deal, although the fastest shutter speed is only 1/4000, so bright sunlight could be trouble. Luckily the 3 stop ND filter helps mitigate the problem.<br /><br />Overall I find this a fine compliment to my DSLR, but I personally wouldn't use it as my only camera.","I've been keeping an eye on this camera for a long time. The only concern was that the price is a bit too high.<br />And suddenly I found the Black Friday Deal, 299 dollars, really worth it!","I order this camera and I got it overnight, that was fast.  The camera arrived in excellent conditions and its working fine.  I am waiting for my new SD XC memory.  On the mean time, I am using the internal memory.  The image quality are outstanding for this little camera.  This is my first Panasonic, it's a good looking camera.<br /><br />I am a Canon user for years. I have the Canon G1, G5, G7 and 50D they are very good cameras.  I have expose my cameras to some not normal conditions (starry night attached to a telescope, in some instances the conditions change (humid, rain, dry, cold, hot, high altitude, even at sea), some cameras will stop functioning. I hope this Panasonic does the job.<br /><br />I will keep playing with my new toy LX7 for now and let you know.","Great little camera I also have the LX5 they take great pictures I shoot in 16.9 mode to use some in my HD movies the resolution is great.","This camera is very versatile.  You can leave it in automatic and get great pictures or use the manual functions to adjust to your taste.  The best part of this camera is the 24mm wide angle lens and the HDR function for high contrast situations!","I bought this camera while it was on sale for $299 over the Thanksgiving weekend.  I had previously purchased and returned ... an Olympus XZ-1 and I was ridiculed ...and accused of being a photographically ignorant individual because I expected a camera to take relatively good pictures consistently ....while simply relying on the program or \"intelligent\" program modes.<br /><br />I mostly wanted an upgrade to the Canon IS 700 I bought my wife about 6 years ago and spent a substantial amount of time before settling on the Olympus XZ-1.  In my review of that camera, I stated ...that I might have gotten a lemon..... and related the consistent underexposure which was worse with flash ...and related that I ultimately returned the camera when I could not even get  consistently good pictures setting a custom mode with exposure compensation of +.7 with flash and two f stops without.<br /><br />I was told ....I should use the histogram ...rather than expecting the camera to get a useful photo in one of the auto modes ...... I was told to use manual mode ....like most \"camera knowledgeable\" purchasers of the XZ-1 would do .....I was told that the picture on the OLED was not indicative of how the picture would look printed or on screen and therefore I should only shoot in raw mode and edit the results if I expected good pictures ......and the list of \"I should\" went on and on...<br /><br />I explained that I might wait until the XZ-2 came out and hope the metering issues I experienced were resolved.  I finally deleted my review because frankly the comments were becoming rather uncivil.<br /><br />Notwithstanding that I purchased the camera for my \"point and shoot expert\" wife ...I wanted a camera I could exert more control over in challenging or unique lighting situations .....I stated that I thought a good ...electronic  metering digital camera should take consistently good pictures without a histogram and in fact without an OLED screen which is truly for the purpose of composing the picture.<br /><br />My wife took pictures on a trip to Canada with her old Canon and the Oly Xz-1 ....the Canon pictures were ...consistently good ...the XZ-1 results were consistently underexposed.<br /><br />I was waiting ....and watching ever since I returned the XZ-1 ...vacillating between waiting on the XZ-2 ....taking a chance on the $650 Sony RX100 ...with a 28 mm wide angle vs 24mm .....with a lens that starts at f1.8 but ends up at f4.9 ......and without a hot shoe or accessory port ...hence no aux flash or viewfinder if needed ....<br /><br />I was also considering the Panasonic ...but I had never owned one ...(Canons ...all the way from F1 ....A1 ...EOS3 ...to the digital I bought my wife) ....and Panasonic  doesn't have a long history of building cameras....<br /><br />I also considered the new SONY NEX6 ...but to match the compact size of the XZ-1 ...I would need the pancake lens and have to forego the zoom ....or haul two lenses and switch between them.<br /><br />Having used manual and then programmable 35mm film cameras over the years....the most attractive feature of the digital cameras ...is the spontaneity of point and shoot .....which also meant compromised picture quality...I would probably still be shooting primarily 35mm on my EOS3 with my Metz 45-CL4 if you could buy and get the film processed conveniently.<br /><br />But...since I married an Asian lady.....I discovered another side benefit of digital cameras ....you don't have to process and print every single picture .....that is a point that may be lost on most American men that don't have wives of Asian descent.<br /><br />But...I digress.....the point of the review should be the LX7 ...so here it is ...<br /><br />It worked perfectly out of the box ....in both iAuto mode and program mode....the colors were good ....the pictures were not underexposed .....the low light ability of the f1.4 combined with  24mm wide angle are ....amazing ....it took my wife all of about ½ hour to conclude we were keeping this one (barring any electronic or mechanical catastrophe in the next few weeks)<br />And this is just based on her initial \"point and shoot\" expertise.<br /><br />I have only snapped a few shots using the Aperture  mode at f1.4 and was equally amazed ......<br />To sum up....the camera is great....at $299 ...it was an absolute bargain ...I had paid $270 for the XZ-1 before the price drop and would have been thrilled if it had worked as well in person as it sounded on paper....<br /><br />If you get the opportunity to buy LX7 at $299 again ...I would not hesitate...especially if you can get it from Amazon and have thirty days to try it or return it....I can pretty much assure you .....you will keep it. By the way ...this has a video mode that actually works ...versus the XZ-1 .....<br /><br />I probably should have had my wife write the review instead of me....she is much less wordy ...having come to the US from the Philippines....her English is quite good but she is much less verbose than I am.<br /><br />In fact ...I can sum up her review ....in three words ......... \"WOW\" ....and \"Holy Cow\" ....that's all she had to say!<br /><br />The only ...less than desirable ....point I will note...is the zoom is slower than on other cameras....but then....some of my other choices would not have even had a zoom to match at the size and pic quality I wanted.","I've been a camera hobbyist for years, having owned many high end compact cameras, and I've experimented with DSLR's for a while.  I'm not a pro by any means but do love photography, both for family/kids and also landscapes, trips and various creative expressions.  I'm probably your typical camera hobbyist.  My other camera is a Sony SLT A33, with a decent collection of Minolta/Sony lenses.  I caught this Panasonic (my first) when it dropped to $299 and I took a chance on it, feeling guilty doing so. ;-)  But no regrets now, it's awesome.  I was considering the Olympus XZ-1 and LX-5 as alternates, which are now pricier, but I prefer this camera for the better lens and faster/more accessible performance to those.  The Sony RX100 looked interesting, but not at 2x the price.  My Sony SLT is extremely responsive with an outstanding sensor and tons of features...but I find I just don't use it that much.  Maybe its the heft, maybe its the gap in my lens collection, I don't know.  Even though its relatively small compared to SLR's, it is always too much and too little, if you know what I mean.  After years of experimentation with camera systems there's no escaping that realization that all camera solutions are really that perfectly united combo of body+lens.  The real question is, when you leave the door...what combo of lens and body do you bring with you?  The power and flexibility are always going to be lacking unless you haul a bunch of stuff around with you.  With an SLR/SLT, and even with all the diminutive new mirrorless systems, you get tons of power and flexibility at the price of carrying multiple lenses and having to buy and protect those expensive lenses, each and every day.  This is as true for the NEX systems as it is for a high-end Nikon DSLR.  Do you carry a big bag of lenses and accessories around your neck 24/7?  Is that fun?  Did you spend $1500 minimum on extra lenses?  If you answer no to these questions then you're not really tapping most of the power of those better camera bodies.  Some folks out there are into photography enough to do that, and I can understand that.  But for most of us hobbyists I'd argue that all interchangeable lens systems are a real pain.  Interchangeable lens systems work great as a system for manufacturers to sell lenses, but I doubt they're what most of us want/need.  I've thought like many I suppose that I'd invest in a decent body and upgrade the lenses over time, and I did that.  But it never really satisfies.  The better lenses are always very expensive, and each individual lens has major strengths and weaknesses, and/or are difficult compromises.  Even if you buy those nicer lenses you're always wanting to fill the gap in use, thus necessitating the 30 lb bag around your neck.<br /><br />Enter the Panasonic LX-7, its a relatively compact awesome portable system that just takes great photos and leaves plenty of fun for the hobbyist.  I find this lens range is extremely awesome, the combo of wide angle and wide aperture makes for an awesome family camera especially indoors where you can really capture architectural spaces and compositions of people within those spaces.  For me 28mm isn't enough.  The wide angle is a god send and I don't know how I lived without that for so long (oh I remember, quality DSLR wide angles are ridiculously pricey when you factor in the 1.x+ crop factor from your typical sensor).  I can't really imagine a better arrangement than this lens range. The fact that the lens is so bright allows you aperture affects that I've never seen on a compact, depth of field just like a DSLR; truly easy to isolate a subject from its background.  For macro shots there is no better camera for non-pros, it can focus to 1cm!  Autofocus is fast. It has an 11 fps burst mode.  Video capability is great.  The lens is truly sharp, not soft like others have mentioned.  Check for yourself on the camera review sites and carefully examine the sample photos for that sharpness.  I'll bet this is the best lens on any compact...wide, ultra bright, and ultra sharp corner to corner.  This sensor is good enough to get the job done, and the LX has tons of features to assist making the most of that lens.  Don't fret over just high-iso performance, things are fine at night to ISO 800, and you can easily limit the camera to that in the menus.  The aperture ring on the front and dial on the back allow you to use Manual mode to adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.  Its amazing most cameras don't have that capability since ISO, shutter speed, and aperture are so much of photography.  About my only wish would be for the ring to be programmable, maybe for manually focusing...but otherwise I'm quite happy!","The Panasonic DMC-LX7: Its Own Class of Camera<br /><br />The notion of compact and \"pocketable\" form factor cameras is a matter of perspective. Just like an \"affordable\" camera has a lot to do with what you personally feel is an appropriate price bracket, if a camera is pocketable or not depends on how big your pockets are. The Lumix LX7 retails for about $500, is one of the flagship fixed lens cameras from Panasonic, yet has already been discounted in various spots to forty percent less than retail. At $300 street price, it is less dollars than some small-sensor long zoom cameras, yet is still about double the price of some very competent point and shoot cameras. If you are interested in optional (but pricey) features, the hot shoe of the LX-7 lets you instantly add the Panasonic DMW-LVF2 1,440,000-dot equivalent electronic viewfinder (about $200) or your choice of a few external flash units as well.<br /><br />The LX-7 is the latest incarnation of the LX-3 / LX-5 series of more or less compact cameras that have featured a bit larger sensors and brighter lenses than the run of the mill compact cameras, along with the ability to save images in RAW format. Compared to its well-received predecessor, the LX-5 has a sharper 3-inch LCD with 920,000 dots, a faster F1.4-2.3, 3.8X lens, faster shooting performance, and comparatively spectacular video capability. It records at up to Full HD video at 1080/60p and additionally offers high speed 720p video recording at 120 frames/second. Compared to the LX-5 this is a substantial upgrade, as far as I'm concerned, in most all key areas. Its CIPA standard battery life is reduced to 330 images from 400 in the LX-5, likely due to its improved resolution LCD. It is a bit heavy (0.66 lb / 10.51 oz.) and bulky (4.37 x 2.68 x 1.81 in.) compared to the shirt pocket type cameras, but similar to the LX5. It does fits the platform of pocket camera, but a coat-pocket camera rather than a shirt or pants pocket camera.<br /><br />LX7 Basic Specifications<br />Resolution: 10.10 Megapixels<br />Lens: 3.80x zoom (24-90mm eq.)<br />Viewfinder: LCD 920k<br />LCD Size: 3.0 inch<br />ISO: 80-12800<br />Shutter: 250-1/4000<br />Max Aperture: 1.4<br />Dimensions: 4.4 x 2.6 x 1.8 in. (111 x 67 x 46 mm)<br />Weight: 10.5 oz (297 g) incl. battery<br />MSRP: $500<br /><br />100% crop image quality at ISO 1600 betters the upscale long zoom cameras, such as the generally impressive DMC-FZ200. Its faster lens and slightly larger sensor (1/1.7 inch) combine to make this came a low-light superstar, bettering the similar sensor size equipped Canon S100 and S110.<br /><br />Let's say you are considering moving up to the LX7 from a compact long zoom travel camera, such my current favorite in that class, the Lumix ZS-15 or the generally excellent Canon SX260. Now, you net the sharper LCD, a bigger sensor, and the LX7 lens is far, far faster than the ZS-15's F3.3 - F5.9 array. You'll also appreciate the included external charger, the hot shoe of the LX-7, and the obvious superior low-light capabilities. By low light, I mean the indoors version of low-light, without using the flash. If you accustomed to post-processing, the RAW images of the LX7 will be another appreciated advantage.<br /><br />On the flipside, the LX-7 is around twice the price, you might miss the 16x optical zoom, and you'll notice right away that the LX-7 is noticeably bigger and heavier by comparison. You'll also notice right away that there is no integral lens cover on the LX7 and the lens cap is removed manually (an aftermarket solution is readily available). If your focus (pun int.) is primarily on convenience and economy, the ZS-15 is most assuredly easier to have with you all the time, easier to quickly just throw into a pocket and go.<br /><br />The reasons there is so little consensus in the preferred camera is that we all have divergent notions of what a camera is supposed to do. Naturally, image quality defines a desirable camera, but there is the snapshot level of quality image and then the \"I want to make posters\" level. Satisfying snapshots are the most common output of a camera to no one's great surprise. Yet, if your camera has wondrous image quality, but turtle-slow shooting performance, it is easy to forego image softness only discernible if you hold an 8 x 10 a few inches from your nose in favor of a faster camera that is less hassle to use.<br /><br />Video capabilities get better and better in \"still cameras,\" one of those things not important to you . . .  unless of course it is. This camera delivers strongly in the video department. The same goes with time lapse, high-speed video, creative effects, and so forth. The technically \"best\" image-capturing unit may not at all be the best choice for you if the image stabilization is poor, you can't see the LCD, the batteries are perpetually dead, and some of the specialty features you really want don't exist. In all of these areas, the LX-7 is either very good to class-leading.<br /><br />The LX-7 aspect ratio selector means you can shoot 3:2 images at 9.5 Megapixels. That completely fills the 3:2 aspect ratio screen and is where I've found myself doing most of my shooting. The image stabilization is excellent, the Panasonic \"iA\" (intelligent auto mode) yields impressive results if you aren't inclined to experiment with the program or scene modes.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This camera reads like a compilation of everything most people claim they want improved from their economy, compact, point and shoot. It has a better LCD, a bigger sensor, first-rate video capabilities, a hot shoe, JPEG, JPEG+RAW, and RAW capability, and includes the fastest lens in this category of camera today: F1.4-2.3. It includes an external charger as opposed to \"USB only\" charging, its 330 CIPA battery life is better than most compacts, and it has enough manual controls and scene modes to keep people experimenting for a very, very long time. This unit captures truly excellent video with a wondrous high speed video mode as well, 720p @ 120 fps.<br /><br />Time lapse, high speed video, an external charger, and a built-in neutral density filter might seem old hat by now, but it actually is ***anything but***. The next step up the food chain, the larger sensored $650 Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-RX100 lacks not just one or two of these features: it lacks all of them. Yet, the RX100 is lighter in weight, if not on the wallet, something than cannot be said for some others in the category. The RX100 actually offers very little over this camera, its diminutive size and higher resolution are the two areas that cannot be denied. What closes the gap is the extremely fast lens of the LX-7.<br /><br />It is hard to fault this camera. In many ways, this is a one-stop compact personal imaging center for both still images and video. The only video consideration is not the video quality, but the inability to plug in an external mic. The only thing you might miss as a still camera is the lack of a long optical zoom if you feel that cramps your personal creative juices. The overall speedy focus and shooting performance is immensely satisfying; as you won't find yourself waiting for this camera to respond. If there is such thing as a bullseye in the price / performance ratio, this camera seems to nail it.<br /><br />In somewhat of rare and pleasant happenstance, this camera does everything it promises to do. Not everything always works as described, but the Panasonic DMC-LX7 actually does. Those looking to upgrade from the LX5 won't have to go past the faster lens, sharper LCD, and vastly improved video to find the LX7 an appealing successor. This is simply an all-around excellent piece of equipment.<br /><br />It scores top-of-chart in image quality and video quality in its class. Its shooting performance makes many cameras seem turtle-slow shot-to-shot. Finally, can be considered a screamingly strong value as well. Nothing competes with it at a $300 street price that I'm aware of and I mean ***nothing***. For many, many folks this is the only camera you'll need or want . . . and it leaves scant little lacking in a non-system reasonably compact package beyond what comes in the box.<br /><br />I did add Progo DMW-BCJ13e Power Pack (Two Li-Ion Rechargeable Batteries and Pocket Travel AC/DC Wall Charger with Car Adapter & US to European plug) for Panasonic DMW-BCJ13, DMW-BCJ13E, DMW-BCJ13PP. Works with Lumix DMC-LX5, DMC-LX7 Digital Camera. Fully Compati... that is really quite a bargain in battery-land, and a Lowepro Rezo 50 Camera Bag. The Lowepro Rezo 50 works particularly well if you go with a standard lanyard on the side of the camera rather than the dual strap supplied array. My final addition was the Auto Lens Cap for PANASONIC LUMIX DMC LX7 LX-7, LEICA D-LUX 6 + MagicFiber Microfiber Lens Cleaning Cloth.<br /><br />The Progo batteries are excellent, no loss of functionality vs. OEM batteries, slightly better life, and a fraction of the rip-off priced Panasonic branded batteries. With the Auto lens cap, everything goes neatly into the Rezo 50 bag including the two extra batteries. This is where it reaches, but does not exceed, my own personal limit of an easily portable camera array.<br /><br />Copyright 2012 by Randy Wakeman.<br /> All Rights Reserved.<br /><br />If you are on a budget, and want a better than standard compact camera that is a bit smaller, consider: Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black) for $249. Poor video compared to the LX7, a slower lens, weak low-light ability, but significantly smaller in size.<br /><br />For longer zoom, economical compacts the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS15 12.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom (Black) is a screaming deal at $149 and the Canon PowerShot SX260 HS 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 20x Image Stabilized Zoom 25mm Wide-Angle Lens and 1080p Full-HD Video (Black) is now (finally) at a competitive $200 price point.<br /><br />If you want a RAW capable long zoom fixed lens camera, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black is a top choice, but still at a salty $500 price point, and it is too bulky to be considered compact by most.<br /><br />For image quality, though, this LX-7 betters them all, and in low light or for video, it makes them all looks embarrassingly weak.","Just a great camera from all perspectives. Also just the right size. do not know what more to say about this camera.","I am impressed with this small camera.  While learning all the features and having to take some shots in low light I set it on Intelligent-Auto and was amazed at how bright my shots appeared taken in a darkened room and also outdoor night photos.  I revisited inside a dark historic church and my photos seemed to make the church come alive. I love the wide angle feature that my older DMC-fz20 did not have but has a great zoom.  I am still experimenting and playing with this camera.  Indoor shots of boat models through glass reflections and other odd shots turn out decent.  I test all types of shots.  This camera includes all the features I wanted except super zoom & GPS which I can live without.  The zoom feature is decent and wide angle shots don't appear to show blurred edges.  The macro is super but it does at times take a few seconds to register the focus.  It's great for trips or carry along on a drive.  The only caution would be the more things running on auto the less battery charge available.  I always suggest having two batteries for each camera.  It is solidly built and easy to tote around by a wrist or neck strap.","No complaints about this great little camera. The aperture wheel, the ND filter and the higher resolution screen are excellent upgrades from the LX5. Highly recommended if you want manual controls and good image quality on a pocket camera. The factors that made me decide for this camera was the great size along with the hot shoe that some other compact / mirrorless don't have in this size range.","Nice improvement over prior model lx5. Still one of most compact well equipped cameras. Small sensor does not seem to affect pictures as much as would expect. The lense alone is worth the price of the camera","I have the D-Lux 4 and the D-Lux 5 both Leica versions of the Lumix LX series. This time I bought the LX-7 rather than the D-Lux 6, and the LX-7 is absolutely the best of the lot. Fantastic operating system.- fast, accurate, relatively low noise, and the reason for buying it- the Leica Lens, as always is terrific. P.S. it really should be used with the LVF 2-EVF to make it legitimate.","The Panasonic LX-7 is the latest in a line of high end compact cameras that are reasonably pocketable and can produce excellent photos (and videos) in daylight and lowlight conditions.  Previous models have been well received and unless you have them side by side you would be hard pressed to see any real differences in the way the LX-7 looks and feels compared to it's immediate predecessor, the LX-5 introduced two years ago.  This time, however, the LX-7 is not alone and in fact there is an elephant in the room, the Sony RX100, that really cannot be ignored if one is to understand the merits of the Panasonic LX-7.<br /><br />The Sony RX100 has made it to the Time Magazine list of 25 best inventions of the year - and as we know, Time is never wrong.  Well almost never.  The RX100 is truely pocketable, able to fit into a shirt pocket whereas the LX-7 needs a jacket pocket.  The RX100 has 20M pixels and the LX-7 has only 10M pixels, potentially improving resolution and cropping ability.  The RX100 has a sensor that is 2.8 times the area of the one in the LX-7.  And to get these features the RX100 sells at a different price point than the LX-7, roughly 150 dollars more at suggested retail and because the LX-7 has been undergoing price fluctuations lately, I've noticed that sometimes the difference is closer to 240 dollars!  This cost difference alone may steer many away from the Sony, unless, of course, you really want a high quality shirt pocketable camera.<br /><br />Now why consider the LX-7, other than price.  It's the lens. The LX-7 has a lens that extends from 24mm to 90mm (35 mm camera equivalent values) while the Sony starts at 28 mm and goes to a little above 90mm).  The LX-7's widest lens opening is f1.4 and never exceeds f2.3 over its range.  The Sony RX100 starts at f1.8  and quickly goes to f2.8 (at 35mm) and eventually goes to f4.5 at 90mm.  This means that the LX-7 has about a half stop advantage at wide angle, a 1.44 stop advantage at 35 mm and nearly a 2 stop advantage at 90mm.  What does this mean for the performance of the LX-7, since this is one of the prime reasons to purchase this camera?<br /><br />The large sensor is the heart of the RX100. Because its area is 2.8 times that of the LX-7 its noise or grain at any ISO value should be significantly better (lower) than the LX-7, in fact if it had 10M pixels it should have about a 1.5 stop advantage.  The fact that it has 20 M pixels, means that the area of each pixel is cut in half and the advantage over the LX-7 drops to around half a stop.  Of course, there are ways to combine the pixels, effectly increasing the area of each pixel and to reduce the noise again.  I took a look at the RAW samples of the LX-7 and the RX100 via the dpreview site and compared them at ISO 400.  In my view, the RX100 is clearly better at ISO 400 than the LX-7 at ISO 400 but the RX100 at ISO 800 looked worse than the LX-7 at ISO 400.  This crudely confirms that the RX100 sensor has somewhat less than a 1 stop advantage over the LX-7. What does all this mean with respect to daylight and low light photos?<br /><br />In daylight (good light), the RX100 should perform about 1 stop better than the LX-7 since both cameras are probably at their lowest ISO setting and have similar lens openings.  Fortunately, the Panasonic LX-7 noise or grain is reasonable at this setting and unless one pixel peeks (looks at really large blowups of small sections of the image) one will not see much difference.  Also in dim light at 28mm, since both cameras would probably be set to the lowest f stop, the RX100 would have a one stop advantage.  Once one moves away from 28 mm, however, the Panasonic LX-7's lens has a two stop advantage as stated above, and it can become the camera most likely to produce the lowest grain.<br /><br />And lets not forget the 24mm wide angle of the Panasonic LX-7.  For some, this is the deal clincher.  Sure it can get more people into a group picture in close quarters, and more landscape into your images, but many believe, in fact that it should be used as a close up lens, providing a sense of depth to your image. Move in close to an object, and have an interesting background and this lens will add perspective to your image.  Just don't try to make the closeup object an adult face since they will not be happy with the big nose look - mine is large enough as it is.<br /><br />So the LX-7 works well in daylight (the RX100 may work a little better if you care to pixel peek), but the advantage really goes to the LX-7 in dim light because of its relative constant f stop.  Having 24mm doesn't hurt either.  If only it would fit into a shirt pocket.<br /><br />I suppose another consideration might be purchasing the previous model, the LX-5.  As of this writing it is still available for around 300 dollars, and I've even seen it for sale at 250 dollars.  The construction differences between the LX-5 and my LX-7 are really minimal with both being high quality.  The LX-7, given its f1.4 lens and improvements in its sensor, mean it has about a 1.5 to 2 stop improvement in light gathering ability over the earlier model.  The display screen resolution has doubled to over 900,000 pixels (nice).  There is an aperture ring around the lens akin to cameras of old, a convenient touch and selecting aperture using it is way easier than using the rotating wheel on the camera rear.  The LX-7 can also show a horizontal and vertical level which can be helpful in some situations. And the video resolution has increased from 720p to 1080p - true HD. I'm not sure that the LX-7 white balance works well, but since I shoot in RAW, this has not bothered me since that is simple to correct (and one of the reasons to shoot in RAW, of course.  Post processing with Adobe Photoshop CS6 makes processing RAW straight forward since ACR is becoming the perferred work flow, but that is another story.)<br /><br />For me, the LX-7 is the camera to take when I want to travel fairly light and I am not worried about subject motion  in dim light(High ISO).  For the most part the LX-7 has decent image quality up to ISO 400 (shooting RAW) maybe even ISO 800 with some noise suppression.  But it is not a DSLR.  IF you look - pixel peek, you can still see noise, even at base ISO and bringing up the shadows can also create visible noise.  As the saying goes, there is no perfect camera.  When I want really low noise, or I expect really dim conditions with movement, such as the grandkids in theater productions out comes the DSLR.  Also shooting inside museums (paintings), if allowed, seems to work best for me with wide apertures and high ISOs, another use for DSLRs.  But naturally the price to pay is size and weight and sometimes large cameras just seem out of place.  For the moment, this camera represents state-of-the art performance, in a reasonably small package and a reasonable price. But the Sony RX100 just may show the way forward.<br /><br />12/20/2012<br />This was a really great camera when I bought it at over $400 but when it went to $300 it became sensational.  Since I still had some time left on the Amazon return policy I contacted them and they sent out a new LX-7 at the reduced price which I shipped back to them unopened for the refund on the original camera which I kept.  Great, but a little cumbersome.  You would think that they would just credit me with the difference, saving postage.<br /><br />As I use the camera more, I find low light performance works as well as I thought it did initially and, in fact, I am more willing to shoot at ISO 800.  Using a Topaz Labs plug-in and Adobe raw processing has produced very useful results at this and even at ISO 1600 for small prints.  I have found that using the display as a viewfinder in bright light can be a pain (as it is on all such cameras, it seems) so I have used my savings to purchase the Electronic Viewfinder (EVF) which adds bulk to the camera when attached.  It comes in a little pouch that can go in a pants pocket and I will probably use it on bright summer or winter days or when I shoot grandchildren in plays (the lit screen can be annoying in a darken theater).  This EVF gives a really crisp image and, like the Sony RX-100 probably points to the future.  I suspect that if this is an example, we will see more of these at even higher resolution on SLR type cameras (Sony and Olympus already are there, it seems). Anyway, at prices close to $300 this camera is hard to beat.","*I'd really give four and a half stars since I don't mind most of the negatives I list below.<br /><br />Purchased last week, had a weekend shooting at a concert and outside rock climbing, then around town for the week. Taken ~200 shots, a little video.<br /><br />Cons (since this is what you want to know about first)<br />- Price on Amazon fluctuates wildly (from $413 a few days ago, up to $488 today). I bought at $449 and consider it a camera worth the price, at least this month.<br />- Auto white balance is meh.<br />- Not supported yet by many open-source .raw developers (RawTherapee, UFRaw). There might be fixes I'm unaware of.<br />- A little too large for the average pants pocket<br />- Cheap rear dial; ND/MF button doesn't feel solid either<br />- No remote<br />- Slow zoom<br /><br />Pros<br />- Good low light performance. Has small sensor vs. other premium compacts, but faster lens. Sensor is better than LX5 (acc. DPReview.com). This was important, as I considered the LX5 as well (for ~$150 less)<br />- Aperture ring is nice<br />- Sweet, sweet movie mode settings with mic that works well indoors.<br />- Great resolution on the LCD<br />- Aspect ratio control is surprisingly convenient, though I wish I could lock it.<br />- Quick access menus work pretty well<br />- Step zoom setting that lets you choose 24, 28, 35, 50, 70, or 90 mm focal lengths. Setting \"Lens Resume - Zoom\" to \"on\" while shooting in Aperture Priority, then saving as a custom setting basically gives you a rangefinder style camera with a fixed prime (as long as you don't change the zoom before you turn the camera off). Hope Panasonic someday includes a feature to customize startup zoom directly.<br /><br />I haven't bought other premium compacts, but this is way way better than a regular compact, and its feature suite seems tailored towards video. I would presume, based on my experience with Nikon DSLRs and Panasonic's mirrorless cameras, that there are better stills cameras out there (feel free to comment below), but the video will be hard to beat.  I want all around performance, and am pretty happy with this camera, but for high depth of field, I'm going to use a Nikon DSLR.<br /><br />*Update 12/16/12<br />I've taken the LX7 outdoors some more, and have noticed that there's some chromatic aberration in the lens that's especially visible in strong light. Silkypix gets rid of some, but not all of it.","I won't make this a long review, but I will say that I own an LX3 and recently purchased a Sony NEX7. I did not like the NEX7 and sold it here on Amazon. I purchased the LX7 and I m very very happy with it. I was always amazed by the pictures I got from the LX3. I sold all of my pro gear because I was tired of lugging it around and I am perfectly happy with the photos from the LX7, in a much smaller package. In my opinion if you are looking for a high quality advanced point and shoot you will not go wrong with this little brick.<br /><br />Oh yeah -  Lieca sells it as the DLUX6 for $800.00. The hand grip is extra !","I have had an LX2 for several years (I bought it because Nikon didn't have anything competitive at the time). The LX2 went with me everywhere and I shot many thousands of images with it. So I figured it was time for an upgrade. I did read the spec's and figured the limited zoom range (no improvement over the LX2) was OK so I'd compromise.<br /><br />When I got the LX7 I immediately realized that Panasonic had made the camera BIGGER. Not by much, but BIGGER. Does the lens need the body of the camera to be bigger?<br /><br />The user interface has changed: There is a \"funny red button\" on the top of the camera that is for video -- right next to the shutter release button. I will still have to set the knurled dial to video mode to shoot so why does the camera need a second button? Simplify, simplify, simplify. And yet _another_ button on he back to display the images. The dial selection of the LX2 is clearly superior: select the mode you want; turn the camera on; press the shutter button to take a picture or start the video. Less is more.<br /><br />The LX7 has improved in one minor way: the finger grip no longer has a shiny metal part that was pure styling in the LX2 without any function. However, they just couldn't resist writing LUMIX in the middle of the lens cap and putting a circular decoration on the thing. This is a CAMERA, it's a tool -- leave all the names and logos to the silly FCC label underneath -- displaying the brand name is for Gucci bags.<br /><br />The LX2 would shoot 10M pixels in 16:9 mode. Now I only get 9.5M. I'm NOT going to shoot in the old-fashioned 4:3 mode to get 10M pixels. Screens are now 16:9 or 16:10 -- it was silly having 'variable' aspect ratio in the first place, on the LX2 -- anyone can always crop images after they are out of the camera.<br /><br />I could be wrong but I detect much more barrel distortion in the LX7 than I experienced with the LX2, maybe it is optimized for 4:3 ?<br /><br />I think I need to see what Nikon & Canon has to offer.","Let me start with what could be better:<br />Color/White Balance especially under artificial lights.<br />Zoom speed and response.<br />Somewhat Flat Colors from the JPEG Engine.<br />Noise at ISO400 and above.<br />Having said that, this lit<br />tle gem is worth every cent that you spend on it. The Strengths are:<br />Rich feature list.<br />Physical Controls.Expandability with Flash Hot Shoe and OVF/EVF.<br />Killer Video.<br />Great Image Quality.<br />Great set of filters, stackable, in camera.<br />Good in camera Panorama, Hand Held Night Mode, HDR.<br />Can be used by all, from beginer to advanced photographer.","I feel bad for this camera because it got overshadowed by the Sony RX100, which everyone thinks is so amazing because it has a sensor that's midway in size between a compact camera and an APS-C DSLR.<br /><br />Leaving aside the RX100, the LX7 is the best compact camera I have ever owned with respect to image quality and useability and features.<br /><br />Some of the wonderful attributes of this camera are:<br /><br />1. It focuses as fast as an entry-level DSLR.<br />2. Built-in level.<br />3. \"Step-zoom\" allows you to select focal-length-equivalents of 24, 28, 35, 50, 70 and 90mm.<br />4. Manual focus gives you an electronic depth of field chart which changes as you change the aperture. This makes it great for either zone focusing or for finding the hyperfocal distance. There's also an \"MF Resume\" option which will return the lens to where you last manually focused.<br />5. Lens is really sharp, only minimal corner softness at F4, and very useable wide open, more so than the Sony RX100.<br />6. I also see nearly zero purple fringing with this camera--I'm not sure if its the amazing lens or Panasonic post-processing tricks, but it's nevertheless impressive.<br />7. Lens is so fast that this camera is actually a BETTER low-light camera than any entry-level DSLR if you are only going to be using that DSLR with the kit lens. The lens is also faster than the RX100, so you need to take that into account when you compare the two cameras. The lens is fast enough to give you a little bit of blurred background, something I've never seen before on a compact camera.<br />8. Widest angle is 24mm (equivalent), which is a premium feature that you don't get on basic DSLR kit lenses and you don't get on the Sony RX100.<br />9. For a sensor if its size it's probably best-of-class, with better DR and less noise than sensors from a few years ago.<br /><br />The negatives of this camera are:<br /><br />1. Not as small as a Sony RX100. It is not a pants pocket camera, but fits fine in a coat pocket. The LX7 is slightly more pocketable than an Olympus E-PM1 with the Panasonic 14mm pancake lens.<br />2. The LCD is nice, but not as nice as the one on the Sony RX100.<br />3. Has a lens cap you need to remove before using the camera. The camera comes with a little cord you can use to attach the lens cap to the camera so you don't lose it, but I tried it and hated having a lens cap dangling around. So far I've only lost one lens cap in the last ten years, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.<br />4. Even at base ISO, the sensor is a good distance behind top-quality larger sensors, like the one in the Nikon 3200, so if your photographic goal is to make really huge prints, I recommend a Nikon 3200 with a sharp lens like the Nikon 16-85mm DX VR lens. But you would probably not notice this sensor's shortcomings in anything smaller than a 13 x 19\" print.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />If you are going to buy an entry-level DSLR or micro-four-thirds or NEX camera, and are only going to use that camera with the kit lens, then you are probably better off buying an LX7 instead. This camera even has a flash shoe and can be used with a real flash, so there's nothing you can't do with this camera just as well or better that you can do with a DSLR+kit lens.","A pocket camera with 1.4 - 2.3 24 to 90  (35 mm equiv) that shoots RAW under $450. Nothing out there competes with these specs.  Image quality is great except in low light. I owned the LX3 - a great camera in its day, but noisy. LX7 is certainly worth the upgrade. The panorama feature is fun and the \"iA+\" lets you easily adjust brightness, white balance and defocusing. Of course, IQ does not compete with my GH2. That said the interface gets 3 stars and the user manual 2. set \"Program Diagram\" to \"MTF\" what does that mean? \"enhances accuracy with ND filter\". Got that? the one-point color is fun, but I would never have guessed that you need to hit cursor-left to get it to work without the manual. Why cant that be offered onscreen? Contrary to what the manual says, i dynamic and Digital Zoom cannot be selected in the program modes, but only in C1 and C2. I would like to know the difference between extended optical zoom and izoom. In any case the manual seems utterly confused and doesn't describe what the camera does.","This camera is great its got alot of new things besides being able to shoot low light, and better video.....Its sensor is CMOS where as the LX5 is a CCD. I feel the LX5 yields better photos than the LX7.Better to me is sharper and white balance on the LX5 is better out of the box. Like I said the Lx7 has alot of cool new items but they should have stayed with the CCD...sensor...","I have read all the reviews by all the \"experts\" comparing this camera to just about everything. I am not a professional. I'm just a guy who likes to take pictures of my family and the things I see on the occasional trip. Of course, it's better if the pictures look like they have been taken by a professional with a big professional camera. I have owned a Lumix DMC-LC5, which was nice and gave me a few of those, but had the limitations of an early generation digital camera, and a Lumix DMC FZ-20 which  was a significant improvement and gave me even more of the professional quality pictures I love, but it still had limitations, especially in poorly lit situations like indoor shots. I'm getting ready to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip out of the country and I wanted a special camera to make it easy and convenient to take great pictures and I didn't want to lug my bulky FZ-20 around, either. I bought my DMC-LX7 because of the promise of much better low light shots so the first thing I did when I got it was take some pictures inside the house at night without a flash. I was amazed. I may never use a flash again! It is almost like this lens creates its own light. Almost as good as the human eye. Just for grins, I turned out the lights and popped on a flash pointed to the ceiling and fired off a few shots. The results were eye-popping. The whole room was flooded with light that was evenly dispersed and natural. Probably the best shot I have ever taken of the room. Outside at night I got some fabulous shots of lit up houses and door-fronts. The daylight pictures were equally impressive as well. The automatic and creative settings really produce exceptional results. I may never have to try to figure out the finer points of manipulating ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed again. Yes, the camera is smaller than I expected, but I don't see that as a negative. It fits easily in my hand and, yes, I can one-hand it and I'm not a big guy. It is heavy for its size, but I don't see that as a negative. It feels solid and serious, not like a toy. You do have to take the lens cover off to do anything and it is small, but the handy little lens cap strap hooks nicely to the same metal loop for the neck strap. You'd have to be a real klutz to lose it or to not figure out how to attach it. If you are looking for a great little camera that takes great low light (and bright light pictures as well) this is it. And Lumix said, \"Let there be light!\"","Waited months for this camera but unfortunately will be returning after a few days of use. Prime reason: poor usability.<br />It is heavier than most P&S cameras i have used (including the canon g12). This makes it very difficult to use it single handed. The largish grip does not provide a confident hold regardless of what you see in images or other reviews. It kept on tilting forward due to large and heavy lens element. I do not use a neck strap so maybe for those of you who do, it will be more balanced.<br /><br />Second big reason for the return is the blasted lens cap. I read reviews of the Lx3 and LX5 where people were complaining about the lens cap and i thought they were being over-critical. I mean what's a little hassle if you get good image quality in the end right? I use a DSLR too so I thought it would be fine. But i was wrong. The lens cap is much smaller than typical DSLR caps- so it is more prone to getting lost. It also slows down the whole act of taking a picture- before the click and after.I have a toddler so speed is important for me. Panasonic provides a lanyard to keep the cap locked to the body and i thought that should do it but guess what, the cap does not come off automatically when you turn the camera on. You need to manually remove it and then begin shooting. Since the lens zooms when the camera is turned on I thought the lens cap will fall off due to this action and since i had the lanyard connected, it would remain tethered. Not so. Enough said about the lens cap.<br /><br />Third reason: You can't preview captured images without turning on the camera, at least I couldn't. I tried holding the playback button for a few seconds hoping it would turn on the LCD but no luck. So back to the power button. But when you do that, the camera wants you to first remove the lens cap so that it can do its thing of zooming the lens and getting the camera to a ready state- which is not what i wanted. I just wanted to preview previously captured images. So again i have to deal with the lens cap. C'mon Panny, what the heck.<br /><br />Fourth reason: The image quality was not as good as i expected despite the Leica lens. The colors were not as true as my other cams can produce.Most pictures looked over saturated. Maybe there are settings that can improve this but i expected it to work out of the box.<br /><br />Finally, and this is a small one, the power button is also weird. It's not the usual push in to power on. You need to slide inside. A slide-out to power on seems more intuitive to me if you can't have a push type button or a decent size knob like on the panasonic GX1.<br /><br />So what it boils down to is a bad user experience for even the most basic aspects. Old Panasonic users may find this review pretty harsh or even useless but as a first time Panasonic user who expects the best image quality from a 2012 model P&S camera that should be easy to use, I found the entire package less than usable.","My primary requirement for a camera is that it be compact, but still take great pictures under the conditions I run into often. I hike and climb a lot and do not want the bulk of a DSLR hanging in front of me, and the camera must be accessible so I don't delay the group while digging my camera out of the pack. So I gravitate toward the compact camera that gives me as much of the DLSR feature set as possible.<br /><br />I chose the LX7 primarily because it has a very fast lens. For me that means handheld shots under a thick forest canopy are not blurred because of slow shutter speeds. My previous camera was the DMC-LX5, the predecessor to this model and it was great. I'm replacing it because I made the mistake of taking movies in a sandstorm during a hike down Buckskin gulch in Utah. Ever since that the camera has been complaining when sand grains stick in the lens mechanism and get inside the camera on the sensor. So don't do that!<br /><br />When the LX7 arrived I downloaded the PDF manual (much easier to read than the small one in the box) and went through the new features to familiarize myself with how to use them. I kept being delighted with the improvements over the LX5 that make this the best camera I've ever owned for hiking/climbing shots. In brief, they are:<br /><br />1) Fast lens - good for hand held shots in dim lighting situations (forests, twilight, ...). You don't hold up your companions setting up a tripod shot.<br />2) Wide angle - no need for a panorama when the wide angle lens can get it all<br />3) Compact - light and small enough to hand around your neck all day without being uncomfortable<br />4) Raw - Most of the time I take jpeg simply to document the hike. But when dramatic lighting or scenes call for it I can kick in the Raw for a killer result.<br />5) Bracketing - many outdoor shots with snow or sun/shadow scenes have huge contrast. Exposure bracketed shots combined in post solve this.<br />6) New! Auto HDR - LX7 will do the bracketing and merging in camera. Haven't tested enough to see if it beats (4) for quality though.<br />7) New! Auto Pano - I take a lot of panorama shots from viewpoints, and it's time consuming to stitch them in post. The LX7 will do them in camera.<br />8) New! 3D - I know, 3D is overrated, but for that shot hanging over the cliff nothing else works as well. LX7 has a 3D photo mode.<br />9) New! Time Lapse - I don't do time lapse much because I couldn't, but I hope to capture progressive alpenglow from camp, and a time lapse of 3 shots 1-minute apart also works as a long self-timer. I've nearly fallen scrambling on steep summit rocks to get in the picture withing 10 seconds.<br />10) White body - I bushwhack a lot and twice my camera has \"sneaked\" out of my case when I forgot to close the zipper. White cameras are easier to find!","I will try to keep this short and sweet. I am not a professional photographer, but would call myself and \"advanced amature\". I studied the whole spectrum of high end pocket digitals for weeks before making my purchase, reading all of the reviews and finally settled on the Lumix DMC-LX7. I have no regrets. Panasonic hit a home run with this camera. Forget everything you have heard about sensor size and pixel density, this camera is techno nirvana. The bright, quality leica optics matched with the 10.1 MP sensor produces truely jaw dropping, sharp, and super bright image quality. The light gathering capabiliity of the optics is such that I rarely actually even use the pop up flash, even indoors with room level lighting. The wide angle lens feature is a benefit that surprised me with it's utility. Until you have the capability, you really don't know what you are missing.The camera quality is startling, the features intuitive, and I am thrilled with Panasonics latest entry into the high-end pocket camera market. I believe this camera will be the yardstick by which all others are measured. I also have a large frame Nikon DSLR and find that I rarely use it any more as I can get comparable results with none of the hassle. Oh, one more thing, I almost forgot... the Hi-def video will BLOW YOUR MIND! Go on you tube and check out the video quality of this camera... and be prepared to be amazed. If the price level of this camera is within your budget, buy it. You will be one happy camper. Have fun. PS: I eventually ended up buying an aftermarket black leather case (that was marketed for the LX5) that provides total protection for my investment, looks cool, and I can throw the camera in my pack while hiking without worrying about the camera getting banged up.","Got one today from Amazon. I've been playing with it all day and like it a lot. Similar to my LX3. I got up to speed with it pretty quick  and have been having fun with it. Shot about 20 macro photos with no focusing problems. Not a fan of in-camera editing, preferring to just get the RAW file and head to Photoshop. But...some of the options in the 'artistic' mode on the LX7 are worth messing with. Now if Amazon gets that required (ugh) $30.00 'filter adaptor' (that should have been built-in or free with the camera) I can proceed to go on off for another $40-50 for a B&W UV filter to protect the lens, something that wasn't easily possible with the LX3 without buying one of those tubes and keeping it on all the time. I have an optical viewfinder (24mm) that sits in the hot shoe of my new camera and is helpful shooting outside in bright light and looks cool. No complaints.<br /><br />Update.<br />I should address the lesser video capabilities of the LX7 v. the LX5. I realize everyone doesn't feel this way but it wouldn't matter to me if no still camera had video capabilities, in fact I'd prefer it. As others have noted, there is no perfect camera. I'd leave the speakers off this one too as well but I realize competition being what it is the video horse has left the barn.  Unless something totally unforseen happens, I'm going to like this camera for quite a while. It focuses faster, in fact it has a high speed focusing option that speeds things up considerably from its predecessors, it should be left turned on in my opinion.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this camera, I could have bought the new 20mp Sony or the new Samsung or any other camera of that class. I'm glad I stayed with the Panasonic.","There is a CMOS sensor in the LX7, and it is a nice sensor. ISO800 is useful rather than ISO400 on my LX5. RAW is clean, even at very high ISO (1600). In the presence of noise, the RAW clarity remains. More importantly, the CMOS sensor eliminates the vertical purple lines that appear around bright lights in the LX5 videos.<br /><br />IMO, the biggest feature of the LX7 is the addition of FullHD Video. But Panasonic has crippled the LX7 so it can film a maximum clip length of 30 minutes. No weddings, no lectures. The LX5 films AVCHD until the battery runs out (about 2hrs 16mins) but the improved FullHD video on the LX7 stops at the 30 minute mark. And at the 30min/4 mark if you shoot at the high speed mode 120fps (x4 framerate)(it only gives you 7 minutes). So forget any idea of leaving your camera focused on a tree, hoping to catch that magical bird takeoff. If the birds haven't flown in 7 minutes, your LX7 has stopped filming.<br /><br />Additionally, when I try to use Shutter-Preferred Creative-Video mode to get smooth motion-blur, I find that I am not allowed to use the bokeh from the new lens. When I engage the new internal ND filter in Shutter-Preferred mode, in order to maximize bokeh, I find the lens is restricted to f4. I cannot use the f1.4 - f3.5 stops. So I cannot get decent bokeh from the new lens unless I jump through hoops and use an external screw-on ND filter (there is an adapter to buy, too).<br /><br />I understand that Panasonic are terrified that these new cameras will hurt sales of their camcorder range, but there is no excuse for crippling the LX7 in this way. Panasonic are making you carry both a camcorder and the LX7 in your pocket when you travel. IMO If Panasonic want to sell these LX7 they had better put their thinking caps on, and issue a firmware upgrade ASAP... The RX100 has changed the game...","This is a difficult review to write since I still own and love my LX3 and LX5 cameras. When this one was announced, I could not wait to try it. The F1.4 - F2.3 lens was the only draw for me, so that is what I focused on when I received the camera.<br /><br />The good things are:<br /><br />Great resolution for such a small sensor. The noise behavior is good up to about 400iso and manageable if you have to use 800 (better by about a stop, than the LX5 IMO). The speed of operation is great, locking focus quickly and shot to shot times are much better than nearly any other P&S out there. The screen is lovely, and you can reasonably see it in bright sun (at least enough to compose a shot). It has a distinctly better fit in my hand than the LX3/5, feeling more like you can keep hold of it. The aperture ring on the lens is great, nicely clicking into position and felling like the detents are of a quality that high end DSLR's would use/employ.<br /><br />The bad thing is:<br /><br />The lens. Yes, it is a Leica branded lens, and yes it is a faster aperture. However, that F1.4 - 2.3 are deceptive since to get the legendary sharpness from either end of this lens, you have to stop down at least one full stop. Not as sharp wide open as the LX5 I am afraid. Next, the thing seems to rear focus on all Macro shots where distance to subject is sub 6\". I tried about 20 or 30 shots to have this work as this one feature is what Panny have done so well in the LX series so far. Every shot in that range, rear focuses. If you imagine a shot of a ring, where you are 2\" from the  ring to lens, then focus on the stone in the front area of the ring, it would consistently hit about half way through that circle of the ring before getting sharp.<br /><br />I loved the camera and really wanted to keep it. Alas, I cannot do so when I know that is one thing that would limit my shooting with it, and the softer images wide open would end up frustrating me. I have returned it.","Wow, this was a tough upgrade decision. Sony's RX100 is superb competition, and I was certain *IT* would be the camera that pulled me out of the Panasonic camp (I also own an old Panasonic DMC-FX50 \"bridge camera\" in addition to an LX5, which replaced my LX3 -- plus my wife kept a Pana FX35 in her purse before she switched to Sony's slim TX9.<br /><br />Despite keeping these few cameras around (really just the 3: the FX50, the TX9 and now the LX7), I'm just your Joe Average photographer, shooting mainly the kids, family/friend gatherings, special events, and some home construction-type projects, and other hobby interests.<br /><br />And what I've ever really wanted out of the LX series is a compact, low light-capable camera with a respectable set of manual controls. Exactly what the SONY RX100 is with its huge sensor, and of the two, it is unquestionably the better performer for indoor shooting situations of fast moving kids, compared to the LX3 and LX5.<br /><br />If that were my only criteria, I'd have never ordered the LX7, and might be typing up my thoughts on the RX100 instead. But maybe my four years of familiarity with the LX3/5 got the better of me. Maybe I'm just a sheep with a Panasonic logo branded on my flank. But there were a couple of sore points with the Sony that just plain made me unsatisfied. Rather than trash the RX100 (not my intention), here's my list:<br /><br /> - There's no escaping the benefit of the wide 24mm lens on the LX series. Not to mention the handy aspect ratio mode switching right on the bezel. And I use the 1:1 aspect ratio more than I care to admit.<br /> - The Panasonic's hot shoe is a hot commodity when I need it. I have a Metz 36-AF4O (since replaced by the Metz 36 AF-5, I believe) which is about as big as the camera itself, but provides more than adequate light with bounce capabilities.<br /> - Two of my gripes with the LX3 and LX5 were the difficulty of adjusting manual settings via push-button & thumb dial inputs. The LX7's aperture ring and dedicated manual focus lever have addressed this, with varying degrees of satisfaction.<br /> - I get to keep my LX5 spare battery, which isn't such a huge deal, but just know that its shelf life is spectacular. Although my predicted number of shots between charges has decreased, per the manual. Nothing drastic; still great battery life.<br /> - Most importantly, the Panasonic LX7 has a certain ease and quickness about it -- probably due in part to my use of its predecessors -- and combined with the newly added manual controls, it feels to me the design is finally at a point where I can set up various shooting solutions with a minimum of fuss and button pressing, nearly (but not quite) like my SLR days many years ago. The \"user experience\" of the Sony, by comparison, felt a little too menu driven and sticky.<br /><br />Where did Panasonic fall short with this new model?<br /><br /> - For one, the image quality really hasn't changed. My thoughts are that the LX3 was excellent, but the LX5 tended to focus a little soft -- although nothing that stood out horribly amiss; maybe within the normal manufacturing variations? I don't want to speculate on sensor sizes or type playing a role, but I can attest Sony's RX100 shoots a \"cleaner\" or \"crisper\" portrait-style photo -- although that difference disappears once the image is downsized for printing/sharing.<br /> - There's still no remote. Or cable release. Or Bulb mode. Can't tell you how much I enjoy those features on other cameras. For the LX5, I have a cable release adapter that slides into the hot shoe and extends an arm over the shutter release for a cable release to activate, but the hot shoe has been realigned on the LX7 so it no longer works.<br /> - I continue to have trouble reading the silver-on-silver symbols etched onto the 4-way keys.<br /> - If you're one to complain about the lens cap (I'm not, but I know a lot of LX users HATE the thing)... well, it's still here, and it's smaller than before, making it a little more difficult to clip on/clip off.<br /> - I once committed to never buying a camera without a tiltable display, but that's just not an option. All things considered, the LX7 display is not as bright at the RX100, but is very visible in all but direct daylight, and viewable from off angles without the colors inverting.<br /><br />What did Panasonic get right with the LX7 update?<br /><br /> - The redesigned lens is noteworthy. It's a definite improvement over the LX5 for indoor shooting, and that extends through the entire zoom range (still only 90mm, which was an improvement over the LX3). I find that I take the vast majority of my photos on the wide end of this lens, but in low light settings, I've been forced to if I'm trying to avoid using the flash. With the lens redesign, I've got a little more flexibility in my zoom before resorting to higher ISOs.<br /> - IC? Firmware? Who knows! The camera is snappier than its predecessor, in all aspects: start up, menu navigation, auto focus delay, and shot to shot. It gets shots off near instantaneously. And the kicker is a burst mode!<br /> - I can't say I was disappointed by the 720p video of the LX5, but full HD video is a treat -- especially with memory prices as cheap as they are compared to two years ago.<br /> - Finally, a dedicated white balance button on the 4-way controller! (Panasonic eliminated the \"Focus\" key featured on the LX5, and also added burst mode selection to the shutter self timer key.)<br /> - I'm very excited about the inclusion of a time lapse feature. This was overdue.<br /> - The clickable, dedicated aperture ring, especially, and the manual focus lever, sort of (light applause -- needs something more \"ring like\")<br /> - The mode wheel is substantially firmer, preventing inadvertent turns while in the pocket.<br /><br />Some random thoughts on the Sony RX100: It feels a little \"rough\" at startup (i.e. not-so-smooth lens extension, kind of rough feel & sound), and starts up about a second slower than the Panasonic, but not having to remove a lens cap negates that. Zoom time from full wide to full tele is about one second snappier on the Sony. I felt that the Sony's auto white balance \"got it right\" more often than the LX, but the custom white balance is at minimum one level deep into the menu (if set to the Fn key). Shutdown immediately after snapping a pic is an agonizingly slow 5-6 seconds for full lens retraction; 3-4 seconds if the camera is already at idle. And not so much a dig at Sony as a kudos to Panasonic, but with the 28mm constraint on the wide end, switching from 4:3 to 16:9 simply crops the top and bottom of the frame, whereas on all the LX cameras with their unique sensor usage, I actually gain extra pixels on the sensor to help compose the shot I want.<br /><br />Panasonic's history of product support HAS to be a consideration. They released mid-cycle firmware updates for both the LX3 and the LX5, and with the unexpected LX3 update in particular, added new features -- not just bug fixes. (Wish I could say the same about the FX50, but that's a story for another day...)<br /><br />I wouldn't be so bold as to recommend the LX7 over the RX100, but only want to give a little insight via some of the features I hold in high regard. They both definitely have their strong suits. If you're at all familiar with the previous LX cameras, you have a solid basis for understanding the LX7 improvements, as well as its shortcomings. That certainly didn't stop me from happily purchasing the RX100 before giving the LX7 a chance to hit the streets, but by doing so I immediately proved to myself that there is still no \"perfect camera,\" and with the compromises that I had to accept, my preferences fell mainly back to the LX line.","Updated 2/22/13 to revise comments on image quality<br /><br />Took this camera out on a trail yesterday with me. Overall, I think it's a solid performer and better than its predecessor for the most part.<br /><br />The camera feels a little cheaper than than the LX5. It's not flimsy, but it seems like the body is composed of plastic vs. metal on the LX5. It doesn't feel as solid as the S100, but it doesn't feel flimsy though. The button layout on the back of the camera is almost exactly the same as the LX5. Including the silver buttons whose labeling is hard to see. But that is just a minor annoyance overall.<br /><br />The screen is a definite improvement over its predecessors, sharp and crisp and much more usable in direct sunlight, and it also seems larger. Composing a shot with this camera is a much more pleasant experience overall than the LX5.<br /><br />The aperture ring on the front of the camera has a nice feel to it when adjusting the aperture. However, I would have rather seen Panasonic put in a customizable ring like on the Canon S100 rather than just for adjusting the aperture. But there was nothing of the sort on its predecessor so it still is nice to have the aperture ring there.<br /><br />The firmware on the camera is a lot faster than its predecessor. The write times have improved (I am using a Class 10 SanDisk card) but you still want to get a decent memory card for this camera so you won't get slowed down by the write times. The camera has a fairly decent menu system in order to access different features. The Panorama mode works very well and dare I say, even better than Sony's implementation. However, unlike Sony who puts it on the mode dial on a lot of its cameras, you have to go into the scene mode first and then select the option from there.<br /><br />Image quality is really top-shelf for a compact camera. This has a lot to do with the sharpness and color performance of the lens. Depending on how you view things, there is a chance you might actually like the photos from the LX7 better than the RX100 due to its excellent color performance. Colors are vibrant and saturated but not to the point where they look cartoonish and overdone. Color accuracy is also excellent. It is not the high ISO king but processing RAW will help you get usable files as high as ISO1600. The JPEG files are an improvement over the LX5 and the RAW files are simply stunning and compare quite nicely (at low ISOs) to APS-C cameras. Very pleased with the images from this camera.<br /><br />Another strong suit for this camera is autofocus performance. It is the fastest enthusiast compact I have ever shot with in that regard no matter what the lighting conditions are. However, like its predecessors, the lens zooms VERY slowly. It's a shame that Panasonic did not do anything to speed that up in this model.<br /><br />I have not messed with the movie mode but from what I see it does a pretty good job. Honestly, I don't do much movie recording so I don't really have much to say on the performance.<br /><br />I think the LX7 is a great little camera. Image quality is excellent, especially considering the sensor size. The AF performance is also very quick. There are some operational annoyances, but overall, this camera is a good choice and has been very reasonably priced as of late.","Packed this little gem in my bike pack today and took it to Papago Park for some fun. The camera is very easy to use. I love the external controls, the ND filter and the iA additional controls. The scenes are fun to use and provide additional options for controlling depth of field (blur) and overall color of the image (WB).  Menus are very easy to navigate.  The camera feels very sturdy, easy to hold, has a hot shoe and external viewfinder (which I have just purchased).  I wanted a small camera to carry everywhere as a supplement to my Panasonic G3 and other bigger SLR's that could shoot in RAW.  The big news, of course, is the f 1.4 lens. It is wonderfully sharp and extra wide (24mm equivalent). This allows for handheld low light photography at lower iso's.  The shots taken with the zoom and extended zoom look quite good, much to my surprise.One of the most fun scenes is \"panorama\" which takes a burst of shots and then combines them. (This is a lot easier than shooting the panorama by matching up edges as in other cameras).  PDF Manual is well written and easy to use.  Higher ISO's (320 and above) are noisy, but that is easy to cure in Silky Pix. Other problem, Lightroom and/or Picasa don't recognize this RAW file type yet."]},{"name":"Nikon D500","amazon_reviews":["I started as a boy in around 1965 developing (B&W) film.

I'm astonished at how well this works in low light. It was unthinkable back in the day that a person might shoot at 6400 ASA (ISO) with a polarizing filter on AND get anything usable out of it. I can do just that all day long with this little gem.

I used to use that only up to ISO 1600 (RAW) or ISO 640 (Video), now I can push to 3200 / 1600 respectively and get cleaner results!","Switching between the D800 and D7200 really messes with the muscle memory -- all the controls in different places.  Finally a 'little' quick-handling Nikon which is functionally (almost) the same as the work camera.  Build quality feels 'pro', too, though I believe Nikon is lumping the D500 in with their Enthusiast set.  Too bad.  Just tape over the name plate (always do this anyway) and it will look like a slightly smaller D800.  I've attached a picture to compare appearance, size.<br /><br />The shutter is very quiet -- just a beautiful, quick 'chhopp'.  To me it sounds like a Nikon F2 with the mirror locked up.  The first time I fired it: \"Oh crap, what's wrong?\" -- but it was perfectly fine.  I have almost no interest in the 10 FPS or the huge buffer, but good to know it's there in case the UFOs start landing.  It's no wonder the sports and wildlife people love this.  Maybe I should get my kid to try soccer again or take up hummingbird photography.<br /><br />The face detecting AF is hugely important, though I hate to admit I've come to depend on it.  The D7200 only does this in it's (mostly useless) live view mode.<br /><br />There's an auto-assist focusing fine tune feature that doesn't get mentioned much, but it makes adjustments very, very easy.  You'll know what this is about if you've done it the old fashioned way.<br />--<br />Overall image quality seems the same as the D7200 (so, excellent).  If you believe the test-based reviews it's a smidge better at the high ISOs and slightly worse (in terms of dynamic range) at the very low end.  However we are missing a few million pixels coming from any 24MP model – 13.6 percent, if my math is okay, which is significant..  If you're shooting specifically for large prints you'll miss those.  Clearly it's a solid 'work' camera and not intended to out-do the D7200 on pure image quality.  You want the D500 because it's a tough little monster with the 'pro' control layout you're used to.  If you're taking pictures of lakes with a tripod at ISO 100 (and are inclined to us a DX body for this, why?) then the D7200 would most often be the better choice.  It's going to be better for general purpose family/vacation photos, too (user settings, pop-up flash).  This isn't a put down -- I'm using and loving both.<br /><br />The D500 is better than the D7200 at higher ISO settings, but it isn't a world of difference in terms of image quality.  I notice the subtle differences above ISO 1600.  It certainly 'works' better in lower light situations because of the superior AF & metering.  It's still a DX body though, so you won't be shooting in the dark with it (full-frame always wins in these situations) despite Nikon's marketing.  The artificial top end ISO settings aren't very useful.  It's still pretty impressive at ISO-6400 though.  You go beyond that when it's a choice between getting the picture and not.  I know people are shooting up to ISO 51200, so it's there if you need it.  The quality up there usually doesn't meet my needs.<br /><br /> However, and it's a big \"however\", 51200 is great for news gathering (or being creepy).  This random child (attached) insists on using a small string of multicolored Christmas lights as a year-round night light. It's strung across the wall about 5 feet away.  The D500, at ISO 51,200, gave this 1/100 sec. @ f1.4.  The scary thing is I could have hand-held an exposure in a significantly darker room.  Impressively there's quite a bit of usable detail.  Most impressive is the color, because darn it looks good.  Again, small string of multi-colored Christmas tree lights.  Possibly the matrix meter recognized the face and adjusted color accordingly.  I don't know, I'm not a D500 expert.  The attached photo was shot RAW, then exported directly from Lightroom's library -- never taken in for developing.  So whatever out-of-the-box LR's default interpretation is, voila.  No output sharpening, nothing.  The jpeg is warmer and more of a mushy mess.  Shoot RAW. *** I'm trying to upload both, but the review only shows one, so I'll try to just leave the RAW version.***<br /><br />You'll see articles about how these sensors are essentially ISO-less, and I will just mention that yes, it's true.  The cameras are adding very little noise of their own so you can set your ISO to 51200, or set it to 3200 and 'push' 4 stops in LightRoom – I've tried this; the results are virtually identical.<br />--<br />Caveat for the unwary...<br />Unfortunately (but I considered this before jumping in) I got into the habit of triggering my speedlights with the little pop up flash, which this body does not have.  I get that this might make the D500 more sturdy, but really I just think Nikon wants me to buy the new SB5000 flash.  Well, back to the TTL cable I go.  You can of course trigger a speed light with another in commander mode in the hot shoe, but how much do you want to carry around?  Yes, yes, I know optical-triggering CLS is flawed and radio is a better idea.<br /><br /> I can't get the Snapbridge app to stay connected (Galaxy S7) and have thus far transferred zero images..  I have VERY low expectations after the underwhelming D7200 wifi experience, but though D7200 WiFi transfer works poorly, it does at least work.  I'm seeing mostly negative reviews from people using Snapbridge, as well as from professional reviewers (and look at the Google Play reviews), so I don't think it's just me.  I wonder how many, like myself, are resigned to keeping the D500 in 'airplane mode'?  If the connectivity is something you're looking forward to, seriously look before you leap.  If it's something you might rely on just don't leap at all.  Snapbridge hurts like a broken promise and seriously affects the camera's utility.<br /><br /> So aside from the 4-stars it's a 5-star review.

Thus, in no particular order:<br /><br />Low light performance:  good, fine, not exceptional.  The pseudo-ISO range of up to 1.6 million is, as one might expect, mostly a gimmick.  That said, images are surprisingly free of truly horrendous noise modes until you get above ~200k or so, which is pretty impressive and a significant improvement on prior DX models.  Nonetheless, the quantity of noise is similar to prior bodies - I estimate only a third to half a stop's improvement over the D7100 this replaced for me.  That's with RAWs.  It's entirely possible the built-in JPEG processing has advanced and offers a more significant advantage vs JPEGs in older DX models.  I haven't compared.  Bottom line is I still rarely share photos from ISOs above 10k, and those I do require plenty of careful post-process noise reduction first.<br /><br />Autofocus system:  improved vs the D7100/D7200, but not as dramatically as many reviewers make out.  Yes, having more focus points is nice, though in practice it doesn't seem to make much difference to key focusing modes like 3D tracking… *maybe* it's a little more capable of tracking smaller subjects, that would in prior models slip between the cracks in the focus points grid, but it hasn't blown my socks off.  And more holistically, autofocus is *not* as awe-inspiring as many reviewers say.  3D tracking is marginally better, but still easily confused in baffling ways.  Autofocus speed is as always dominated by the lens.  It does seem less prone to racking focus back and forth, though, which I do appreciate.  But the biggest disappointment, as such, is that it doesn't seem to work noticeably better in low light conditions.  I still find it struggles to focus accurately in ISO 6400+ conditions, just like the D7x00 line before it, even with f/1.4 lenses.  And it's general accuracy with large aperture lenses is still poor by my standards (i.e. many photos miss focus, especially when not using the centre focus point).<br /><br />Shooting speed:  10 FPS is definitely appealing.  You get used to it pretty quickly though, and then only consciously appreciate it when you go back to using any other Nikon DX camera and they feel like slugs in comparison.  It's gratuitous for most people's photography needs (I focus on wildlife myself, and it's only occasionally necessary).  But, the big story here is actually the buffer size, and support for fast SD & XQD cards.  With good cards loaded (e.g. Lexar 2000x SDCs, or Lexar 2933x XQDs) the shutter button becomes infallible - you press it, you take a photo.  Nikon's prior DX cameras drove me nuts in this respect, and I've missed countless photos of the years with them.  This improvement, with the D500, is actually one of the biggest draws of this camera, for me.<br /><br />Size:  entirely subjective.  It's still tiny compared to a D5, and it's still a bit smaller even than a D810.  It's quite a bit bigger than any the the other Nikon DX line, at least post-D300s.  Personally I like the larger size in most cases - it leads to a larger hand grip which makes it significantly nicer to use for long durations, vs smaller DSLRs.  It's also not particularly heavy, despite its size, which is nice.<br /><br />4K video:  I'm not a frequent videographer, so in theory I shouldn't care much about this… but, the difference in quality between the video on the D500 and all of Nikon's prior cameras - DX or FX - is huge.  I can't handle low-resolution 1080p video anymore - it just looks horrible once you start recording 4K.  While there are some wishlist items for the video support - e.g. higher bitrates, lossless recording formats, etc - the only real limitation it has right now is that 4K video is taken from a significantly smaller crop of the sensor than other video modes (not to mention photos).  Sometimes this is convenient (e.g. for telephoto reach), but it does reduce low-light performance, and, most notably, really limits how wide an angle you can record at - even with a 10mm lens you're actually only achieving ~22mm in 35mm terms, which is a fairly pedestrian wide angle, and definitely not the super-wide-angle that you want from a 10mm lens.<br /><br />Controls:  as always with Nikon's cameras, most things are in sensible places, but some are not, and on the D500 some are downright baffling.  Overall I actually prefer the button & dial layout of the D7x00 family more.  For example, having a dedicated button for \"QUAL\", which as a RAW shooter can only offer me the opportunity to accidentally switch to JPEG Small (a.k.a. JPEG why are you even bothering taking photos?), is just stupid, and I've fallen prey to its accidental use, and lost photos as a result.  Likewise a dedicated white-balance button is a very dubious choice for a higher-end camera like this, where the majority of users will be shooting RAW, and those that aren't are likely to set the white-balance once for an entire session (e.g. sports photographers).  Lastly, the addition of the dedicated AF joystick seems fantastic in principle, but is in my experience slightly crippled by not being easy to reliably push in vs push sideways.  There is a dedicated AF-ON button next to it, but I wish I could not need it, using the joystick instead, in order to save crucial time when adjusting focus points, and autofocusing.<br /><br />Flash:  not having a built-in flash is a bit annoying, as it means putting a relatively heavy & bulk speedlight or wireless controller in the hotshoe instead, which makes the whole camera less usable in general, but especially for macro photography (where previously I could use the built-in flash to trigger detachable SB-R200 macro speedlights).<br /><br />GPS:  not having built-in GPS is particularly frustrating, and I don't buy Nikon's excuses as to why it purportedly can't be done, given other magnesium-alloy-framed cameras offer it.  Nikon claim you can get the same end result using the SnapBridge app on your mobile phone, but the app doesn't reliably nor regularly sync your GPS position to the camera, so you can end up with GPS time & location stamps that are tens of minutes out of date, on any given photo.  Essentially useless even if you're only moving on foot.  And the app doesn't sync at all if the app crashes or is even just *not* frontmost (e.g. you pull your phone out to do something else, and forget to bring SnapBridge back to the front afterwards).  As a wildlife & nature photographer I ultimately still need a dedicated GPS dongle attached at all times, in order for geotagging to actually work reliably.  The only good thing I can say about SnapBridge is that while it's active in GPS sync mode it barely makes a difference to the D500's battery life, though it shouldn't given it hardly ever syncs anyway.  It does drain your mobile phone battery at noticeable rate, though.<br /><br />Viewfinder:  it's a significant step up from most of Nikon's other DX cameras, though won't impress anyone used to recent / higher-end FX models.  It's certainly very nice to have, no doubt, and other DX cameras' viewfinders seem quaint and difficult to use in comparison.<br /><br />Memory cards:  while I noted previously that it's great to have high-performing storage, that lets you shoot at 10 FPS for essentially as long as you want, XQD cards remain very expensive compared to equivalent SD cards (despite the bigger number, the Lexar 2933x XQD isn't perceptibly faster in real-world use than the Lexar 2000x SDC, but costs twice as much).  If you're a simultaneous-dual-card wielder, this is a problem because you essentially have a 50+% premium now in order to save photos to two cards simultaneously.  Plus the XQD cards are *way* bigger, which you might think doesn't matter so much, but get a few of them together and suddenly they're taking up a noticeable amount of space in your bag, whereas the same number of SD cards wouldn't even register.  And that's without even factoring in the XQD USB card reader(s) you'll need to carry around with you…<br /><br />SnapBridge:  oh yes, one other thing… the oft-touted photo syncing feature of SnapBridge?  Completely unusable.  Its use of Bluetooth fatally cripples it (among many other flaws).  Forget about it entirely.  Get a CamRanger [or similar], or just an extra memory card & rotate periodically - one in the camera shooting, the other in a card reader uploading.","Coming from a D5000 is a big improvement.<br /><br />Here is what I like:<br />- Double the size of the image (20megs instead of 12megs)<br />- Better ISO (can go up to 8000 without problem, before hard time at 1000)<br />- Way faster (10fps instead of 4fps)<br />- Video is 4k instead of 720p<br />- Focusing is faster and doesn't light up a light like the D5000<br />- Compatible with my YONGNUO flash!<br /><br />What I do not like:<br />- I can take a lot less picture. Around 450 pictures, the battery die. Before I could get around 600.<br />- Video focus is very bad. I though people were picky when they were saying that it cannot auto-focus but that is very true. I have a small child and it's impossible to get anything in focus. Also, the noise is terrible when trying to get the focus.<br />- When you delete the RAW, the jpg doesn't delete. With my D5000, they were synchonized hence deleting a bad picture didn't needed 2 deletes.<br />- The .nef is not working with my old version of Photoshop and not update available. I need to convert with .dng which is time consuming.<br />- Transfering from QXD card requires a cable, I use to just pop the SD card into my laptop<br />- Snapbridge was fast to setup for me. Didn't had problem like others BUT the application is slow. To take picture from the phone is impossible. The delay is about 3-4 seconds so if you have a kid, forget that between you press and the picture is taken it's too late.<br />- Snapbridge doesn't let you save picture into your phone's SD card, just the main memory... that is a bummer.<br /><br />Overall, it's an upgrade but it doesn't seem to be ready for everything. If the video could be usable and the Snapbridge working as advertised it would worth it without being perfect. Nevertheless, I'll keep the camera since it's a lot better than what I had.","Great camera! Blown away by image and video quality, not to mension ISO capability.","I have used and Owned the D80, D90, D7000 and now the D500.  The D500 smokes them all, in all areas.  This camera is not for a beginner.  If you don't know how to use a camera in aperture mode, or manual mode for example, you are going to be scratching you head because there is a huge learning curve for a beginner.  There are no simple auto modes except for program mode.  If you know how to use a camera then you will be fine.<br /><br />Everyone posts the pros to this camera and I agree there are tons.  Its the best camera I have ever used to this date.  I am very happy with the purchase and I have no regrets.<br /><br />Remember though...<br />Not a camera for a beginner.<br />No auto/scene modes<br />No pop up flash; must purchase external flash<br /><br />The only disappointment came from Snap bridge.  Snap bridge did not work as well as I'd hoped.  I had high hopes for this but it takes time to sort images and get connections.  Hopefully Nikon fixes this problem with another program.  It does have bluetooth and wifi so there are options to work with.<br /><br />All in all, I love this camera.  I use it with my 70-200 2.8 VR II and also my prime lenses and my jaw drops all the time with the results.  Buy good glass and you'll be amazed.  This camera has exceeded my expectations when it comes to speed, image quality and iso performance.","As a user of M4/3 format I was reluctant to go to a larger body. But the D500 is amazing. I like to do birds in flight and with the 200-500mm Lens the keeper rate is impressive. I have had this camera for several months now and have had no issues with it. Love it.","It's the newest and the bestest Nikon (maybe any camera) ever. I've shot with Nikon cameras since 1979 (F2AS, F3, D80, D90, D300 and now the D500 - I also now own a D5500). I loved my film cameras (wish I had kept them), but this is the best Nikon digital camera I've ever used. It is truly amazing. The images are great, exposure is spot on (pun?), and all the buttons are there and exactly where you need them. The focus Sub Selector (joy stick) isn't just a gimmick. Using it really is a lot easier than using the Multi Selector. (Just a tip, not a unique function of the D500. Set up \"back button focus\" utilizing the AF-ON button. You'll love it.) I like the size of the D500 body, but wish it was just a bit lighter (although it is noticeably lighter than the D300). But, hey, when you've got everything but the kitchen sink thrown in, it's gonna be a bit hefty. This camera is beautiful, incredibly functional, makes amazing images (even at very high ISO) and is just all around great. I love this camera.","I am blown away by this wonderful camera. I purchased this as an upgrade to my D90 and have already shot 2 magazine features and covers with it. This camera has the fastest and most accurate auto focus I have ever seen. Also the low light capabilities are mind blowing. I am finding more and more capabilities every day. This camera is making me look really good and I like that! If you're looking for a camera in an affordable price range that gives pro level results, you cannot go wrong with this absolutely wonderful Nikon D500. Also this seller was fantastic and the shipping was fast.<br /><br />CONS: while this camera comes with great networking capabilities an Bluetooth, Nikons SnapBridge is worthless. One of the reasons I decided to pull the trigger on this purchase was so I could use my iPad Pro as a live monitor on live shoots, but I was highly disappointed to find out that SnapBridge is nothing more than a marketing ploy by Nikon. The level of difficulty in pairing devices and keeping them paired makes it unusable. This is not an issue with the wonderful D500, but an issue with Nikons less than honest promotion of their extremely lame software, SnapBridge. While I'm disappointed inNikons lack of attention to their obviously faulty software, I take nothing away from the D500 and give it my 100%  enthusiastic recommendation! Maybe someday Nikon will take their software seriously and put out something worth downloading that will actually stand up to their as of yet false claims....(Fingers crossed!)","Love the camera. Easy to use but SnapBridge is a waste. I have tried to pair my Iphone and camera for five hours no success. My other beef is with the lack of a on board flash. In order to have off camera flash I bought 3 radio triggers so I could use my SB 700's. This worked for 2 days. Works fine with my 7100. Not only not working with radio triggers but the flash won't work when attached to the hot shoe. Very disappointed","back some years ago, i purchased a just released D70 camera body.  that body has travelled the world with me and contributed to two magazine cover shots.  this past december i was doing a Christmas card shoot when and error message came up - CHA.  well that ended that and so i sent it off to a certified Nikon repair center in CA.  after they looked at the body, they told me it was the media reader that had failed.  NO REPLACEMENT PARTS FROM NIKON AVAILABLE, and they shipped it back to me.  so i contacted another repair center and they told me the exact same thing.  they also volunteered that this was a common problem with the D70 body.  so now i have an expensive electronic hunk of junk.  Nikon customer support?  tough!<br /><br />and silly me i bought the just recently released D500, what was i thinking.  this body is doing a fine job but i am holding my breath waiting for it to fail as well.  before i would spend a dime more with Nikon, i would certainly be investigating their competition and for sure checking into their customer support policies.<br /><br />thought you would like to know...","A heavy and easy to control camera.  Nice rate of speed for action shots.  Like the duel sd card slots. Think I'm good for the next yr or so.","Awarded The Best Camera of 2016 by numerous publications and outlets.<br />There is a very good reason this Camera is so highly rated and I am sure you have read all of them on the numerous reviews all over the place.<br /><br />If your thinking about buying a D500 and your already use to or know what to expect with the size and form factor of a DSLR then stop hesitating and just pull the trigger because the D500 is an unbelievable camera at an unbelievable price.  It's hard to imagine what Nikon was thinking when the created the D500 and put everything except the larger sensor from their $6000 D5 into the Sub $2000 D500.  Whatever happened the end result is that they handed the public a fully professional DSLR at one third the price.<br /><br />My own experience has been excellent.  The D500 takes excellent pictures, it surpasses my older D4 in every area and that in itself is a feat considering we are talking about a Dx camera vs a much more expensive Fx Camera.  The low light ISO capability of the D500 is phenomenal. It's not until you experience the ability to take a very good picture with the light of a single candle in a dark room that you appreciate just how good this camera is.  Shooting at ISO 800 looks like ISO 200 on my other DSLR's.  The AF on this camera is off the chart. I was actually able to track some small moving birds fairly accurately with the 3D tracking technology.<br /><br />The list of positives is long and distinguishes and already posted all over the internet :)  so let me just say that I was hesitant at first and I was thinking FUJI, Canon and the D810 but I am so happy that I went with the D500 and the 16mm-80mm kit lens combo.  The picture have been phenomenal and the camera is a pleasure to use.","I purchased this camera principally for wildlife/birds and aviation photography.  Specifically, I wanted the extra reach over my D810 and more importantly, the faster autofocus/shutter release and better tracking capability of things that move, shift or otherwise jiggle around.  All the other features that the camera has really did not enter into the picture for me (pun intended) though after using the camera for a bit I have to say that some of the features really started to grow on me.<br /><br />Aside from indoor test shots, I've been trying to use the camera in real life situations over the past few days, but the weather has just been awful since I got it.  I did, however, manage to get a few shots in, including the two attached pictures.  These are far from my favorites bird pics, but I think both somewhat show the capability of the camera (mounted to my Nikkor 200-500 f/5.6 VR).  Both were shot at 500mm with the lens/camera on a tripod/Wimberly Sidekick.  The Doves were shot at f/6.3, ISO 360, 1/160.  Heavy cropping (68%).  The Junco was shot at f/5.6, 1/125 and ISO250.  It is massively cropped to 1295 x 1813 (90% crop).  Both shots were post processed in Lightroom (cropped, sharpened, de-noised, etc).<br /><br />My feelings on the camera - the shutter release speed is simply STAGGERING.  I knew it was going to be \"fast\" but when I shot my first burst, I just couldn't believe it.  There is absolutely no doubt that I will get more \"keepers\" than the 5/6 FPS D810.  AF speed seems faster than the D810/200-500, but I have not really had a chance to get in any fast action bird or airplane in flight shots yet.<br /><br />The reach is the reach and I'm happy for it.<br /><br />IQ and ISO performance seems to be outstanding.  But, I still am very happy I have my D810 which, to me, performs better in both categories (as a FX camera should).  For landscapes, architecture, portraits, floral shots, street/people I still think the 810 is a better choice if you have to make a choice.  I'm happy (and consider myself lucky) that I could swing buying both bodies and given what I am seeing with the D500 would always be wanting for one or the other if I couldn't.  Plus, my wife is big into birding so she was 100% on board with me buying a \"bird\" camera.  How cool is that!<br /><br />Regarding the features that I didn't think would be all that important to me.  I absolutely LOVE the tilt/touch screen (with all its functionality) as well as the joystick.  Swapping the ISO/Mode buttons didn't do much for me.  I shoot manual with auto ISO and don't feel the need to have the ISO button any more \"accessible\" than the Mode button.  I would rather have it the way it is on my D810 but, okay.  I do miss the AE/AF lock button for exposure lock (I use the AF button for 'back button focus') but have my camera set up so that the joystick \"button\" when pressed handles AE lock so no harm, no foul.<br /><br />Oh - one more thing....the battery life on this camera is DEFINITELY worse than my D810.  I have the camera in airplane mode (Snapbridge to me is still very much buggy, \"beta\" software) but it didn't seem to help much.  Get an extra battery - you'll need it!<br /><br />Those are my thoughts/impressions right or wrong...hope it helps.<br /><br />Happy Shooting!","Everything the reviews claim it to be. Shots at up to iso 6400 so far, ZERO noise. New flash settings feature for for-or-background on the fly, all adjustments at the touch of a finger, so zero delays on a shoot. The only drawback I have is, the deeper grip. Not sure why Nikon decided this was needed, but I'll get used to it. Definitely not a beginner camera, but for a pro, you'll love everything about it.","There is good news...Amazon.com has reduced prices on some of the Lexar XDC memory cards. In fact, significantly lower than the Sony brand for the 32/64/128GB cards!","Focus is fast and accurate. High frame rate is great for sports action.","This is an amazing camera!  It's basically a $6,500 Nikon D4 with a crop-frame sensor.  That may seem like a serious limitation, but it's really not that big a deal -- especially given the price!  Especially impressive are the coverage of the autofocus points -- they cover almost the whole frame, horizonally -- and the low-light performance -- exceeding the abilities of my old, full-frame Sony a99.  Just about the only thing I can complain about is that the controls are very hard to learn (at least if you are new to Nikon) -- I dare say inscrutable!  But once you get used to them, they are amazing.  So it's not a big problem.  Just know that you won't often be handing the camera to a friend and saying, \"take a few pictures of me.\"  This is a serious camera for a serious photographer.","Killer Camera! Though, Nikon direct had a better deal with a free grip!","Phenomenal camera! Blows away the Canon 7D Mark II. Better images than the Nikon D5.","I purchased my D500 w/ 16-80mm lens a few days before thanksgiving and received it the day before. I compared it to my D300s, there are some some good points to the D500, the low light capability is a huge bonus. I went with the kit for the wide angle capability of the lens. After 7 years with my D300, it was time for an upgrade. I did find the deeper grip of the D500 to be unnecessarily deep IMO. The new button layout will take some time to get used to, but it shouldn't take long to sort it out.<br /><br />The one down part I ran into was after taking some photos over Thanksgiving, (using only RAW) when I returned home to load them in Lightroom, I discovered my version did not support the D500. Now I'm forced to purchased Lightroom version 6.5 or later, which will cost me another $150. I was bummed. Because of this I haven't been able to fully test my new camera.<br /><br />Once I'm able to fully test the D500, I look forward to fully testing and reviewing it.","Don't ask yourself if you should get this camera, just do it.","Pros- everything amazing af/fast/no buffer/4k/all the features/high iq<br /><br />Cons- almost nothing, few glitches, I do wish nikon would start putting in some of the features found in sony and Canon.<br /><br />If I could rate this 4.9 stars I would. This camera is the real deal, believe the hype.<br /><br />10fps, no buffer,  lightning fast accurate af that can grab perfect focus in damn near pitch black conditions, low light is just stupid good, images from iso as high as ten thousand are not only usable but with a little bit of editing skills look almost perfect, above 10k-50k grain is noticeable, but usable, built in motor dx means that you have access to a massive library of lenses, 4k video!, built like a tank, all the pro features you would expect af fine tune which can be automatic, hss, bright view finder, tilt touch LCD that's incredibly solid when extended, fantastic control you can change almost anything without having to use the screen, tons of custom buttons.<br /><br />As for the negative a few glitches here and there. Mines worked perfect except for one freeze up. The battery issue should be no problem as long as you update and get the new l-ion20 battery which nikon will replace for free. I've also heard that some cards have trouble. The camera is the next generation the d5 and d500 are leaps and bounds above all other nikons in speed, af, high iso, so there are bound to be some glitches.<br /><br />I also wish nikon would bring over some of the cool features from Canon and sony. Dual pixel af/Canon double fine tune/sensor stabilization. And nikon service as well as the rest of the camera companies doesn't hold a candle to Fuji. I feel these are worth mentioning because choosing a camera is just as important as choosing the camera manufacturer/system.<br /><br />Overall I'm super happy, the main thing I love about this camera is that the performance is so good it makes photography easier. Not having to struggle with low light af/af accuracy/a buffer/high iso performance is amazing, and makes it where I can just do my job, all I have to worry about is the actual photography not messing with the camera.","Revised: 11-20-2016<br />After a few weeks with the D500 I have started to notice substantial flaws with the camera. When comparing the ISO with the D750, using the same exact settings, the D500 had considerable noise at 800+ Also when looking at the photos closer, it was obvious that the photos were all soft or slightly out of focus. I'm not sure if I received a defective product but this camera does perform well in broad daylight with low ISO ranges.<br /><br />I have waited over a year to purchase my backup camera to my D750 and I finally pressed the shutter (pun) and ordered this beast. I generally shoot portraits, wedding, events, and have been getting into collegiate sports as I am currently a student at the University of Maryland.  The D500 has all the specs of an amazing sports/action camera and I believe it would be a perfect fit for someone like me who can't afford a D4/D5.  In the past few weeks I have been using the D500 in multiple scenarios ranging from portraits, events, and of course sports. The first several shoots happened to be in broad daylight so I expected no issues in terms of noise or missing focus. The photos were sharp and even a bit bright in the highlights. The next few weeks I had the opportunity to shoot basketball which is where I began to see substantial flaws. Approaching relatively low ISO (1000) I was seeing substantial grain in the images and upon later inspection I could tell that all the photos were slightly out of focus. I tried the autofocus fine-tune feature and everything remained the same. Heavy noise at low ISO's and soft images. I tried multiple focus settings and still, no perfectly sharp images. I have returned mine and will be saving up for the next Nikon body to release.","Excellent Camera, Auto focus is superb, ergonomics are great, fit to big hands well, handles high ISO nicely, etc, EXCEPT battery life is appalling AND will NOT accept third party batteries. Once battery life is improved (possibly via software update) would give 5 starts, Would also have given 5 stars if it would accept 3rd party batteries, seeing as all my other cameras accept them, and I have invested heavily into many of them, simply because the third party ones tend to be better.","The Best crop camera you can have for the price.","Fantastic DX DSLR, does everything I had hoped it would after extensive research. Only complaint is that if I had waited two weeks it would have been $200 less and I could bump up the XQD card size.","Outstanding product.","This is without a doubt the best crop sensor on the market at the time of this review.  I'm not saying this as a Nikon fan boy as I shoot Canon, Nikon and Sony.  This camera has the best focusing and tracking system that I've ever used.  If you use a good lens this camera grabs focus almost instantly and tracks your subject very well. The image quality is also amazing for the sensor size.","Wonderful camera. Image IQ and features are super!","I bought it for shooting birds and grandsons.  It performs extremely well but when I am not shooting moving objects, I still prefer my full frame.","I'm still a relative beginner when it comes to photography and videography, but this camera is a beast. The 'manual of arms' aka interface is extremely easy to use, even for a novice like me. The performance specs are on par or better than anything else in this range in my opinion. I've researched all the competitors on the more and less expensive ends and I can't be happier that I went the D500 route. Yeah the \"kit\" lens (fwiw it's an $1100 Nikkor) isn't great, but if you're a beginner like me, it's fine, especially for half off. If you're a pro, you'll likely have a pile of glass anyway and can save the $566...you'll also probably not need this review.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, just pull the trigger.","LOVE this camera! Takes amazing video, love it more than our Blackmagic Production 4K Camera. Don't like the crop factor on it but if you can get around that it has beautiful footage.","My recent purchase of the D500 has made me happy that I bought this camera. I was looking to upgrade to a higher end camera and for me this exceeds my expectations. Fun and easy to use. There are many features and the menus are easy to navigate.

Plus, the file size is managable compared to full frame hard drive eaters. As in the case of even the much respected D810, the D500 performs way better mechanically, as a camera.<br />Many argue that as a Portrait or Landscape camera, the full frame models are superior. I believe the truth in it lies in the camera operator.<br />And their experience in lighting, composition, and software savy.  Another factor is the \"Glass\" you put on the camera.<br />So, if you're deciding between moving up to, say a full frame D750, now you can consider a different path. Upgrade to a D500.<br />Unless you are building a professional indoor Portrait studio. Then save up a bit more for a D810.  Or just wait to see what Nikon brings out next.<br />My \"Kit\" includes D500,  Nikkor DX 17-55mm f2.8G ED,  Tokina DX 11-16mm f2.8 Pro,  Nikkor DX 35mm 1.8 prime.<br />Keep your crop sensor lenses.","I rented this big, boxy brute and must say, it wasn't much fun to use. It felt like trying to shoot with a cantaloupe, terrible \"hand\". The 7D Mark ll on the other hand is a pure joy to shoot with. It's IQ and DR are world class as well. There's a reason you see all that white glass on the sidelines!","This is an awesome buy. When I first pressed the shutter release aiming at an osprey as it lifted from the water an undeniable smile was on my face. With the 10 frames /sec and the bottomless buffer with an XQD card it is an amazing tool to have. It aquires focue=s very fast and has a wide veriety of features to aid your photography. There are quite a few amazing reviews on youtube that can answer just about any question you have. My only regret with this purchase is that just over a month of buying the body only the combo went on sale for $500 off but it was too late for me.","I read almost all of the reviews that were on Amazon at the time that I bought my D500 and they were mostly five stars. I wholeheartedly agree. My wife and I are ballroom dancers and I take a lot of photos at dance competitions. I was very pleased with how quickly the D500 focused on various subjects and captured them in motion. I was a little skeptical at first that this camera does not have a built in flash, but it really does not need it. The result is that my pictures do not have any shadows and the colors are crisp and rich. I also have the D810 and it is not quite as quick to focus, so I get more blurred action shots with it. The D500 also can shoot in a rapid burst mode. I find this very helpful for dance instruction since I can stop action and point out mistakes. Finally, I have purchased a number of used lenses here from Amazon. Since Amazon does give a guarantee on them, they have all been as good as new for about one fourth to one fifth the cost. In summary, you cannot go wrong purchasing this camera.","Outstanding camera and even forgiving more than might be expected from a professional model.","Great camera/  Howev er, Nikon cut off its nose to spite its face by making sure third party batteries will not work with this camera.","The D500 is finally here.  Without any hesitation I can recommend this camera to any professional needing a fast, somewhat compact, fully capable DSLR.  I've shot Nikons since 1967.  My last Nikons were a D4 and D750.  The build quality of the D500 is definitely comparable to the D4 and much more robust than the D750.  The button layout is perfect for me.  I love the size and weight.  The image quality is excellent.  I could care less it is an APS-C sensor.  Some will disagree.<br /><br />I think the metering system needs getting used to.  The \"Highlight Protection\" meter mode is quite handy.  Through consistent use, one will learn how to adjust the metering via the EVF function.  The folks that complain about blown highlights may not entirely understand how the metering system works.  I noticed on my D750, I virtually could not blow a highlight.  The D500 meter does not appear to react the same.<br /><br />The camera is wonderful to use and shoot.  I bought a used 17-55mm f2.8 DX Nikkor lens to use with it.  The only knock I have is on Nikon, not the D500.  Nikon needs to update the 17-55mm DX and the 12-24mm f4 lens for this camera.  (Nikon has ignored the pro DX lens line for years!)<br /><br />This camera is finally the professional grade DX camera body many of us have been waiting for.","I am a serious amateur photographer, and was looking for a camera that could support my ability to get more keepers when I am photographing action events, wildlife, and grandkids running around.  I ordered the camera and 16-80mm kit lens from Amazon.  I also own an Olympus OM-D E-M1 and several of their pro lenses.  I studied Thom Hogan's guide for the Nikon D500 for several days to make sure I understood how to setup and take advantage of all of the features.  After a week using the Nikon D500, including taking about 50 pairs of test photos to compare the same subjects taken on the Nikon and Olympus in Lightroom, I decided to send the Nikon back.  I was surprised to find that auto focus on a number of still subjects was sharper using the Olympus (equivalent on the rest), and when zooming using Lightroom to pixel peep on the image pairs taken under low light conditions, when I noticed a significant difference between the two I preferred the raw Olympus image in about two out of three cases.  Not what I expected to see.  The Nikon D500 was impressive on continuous mode using a fast XQD card, and was very quick to focus in almost every situation, but I expected the performance on still subjects to at least be the equal of my Olympus.<br /><br />Bottom line, I really wanted to love the Nikon, and was expecting it to be a clear winner in a majority of my comparison tests, but I couldn't justify investing in a whole new system given my results after a week of shooting and testing.  I give Amazon 5 starts for making it easy to return items when defective or dissatisfied, but can't give the Nikon D500 more than 3 stars given what I was expecting after everything I read about the camera.  FYI, I used a Nikon D7100 before I bought the Olympus, and was generally very happy with my images taken with it, but couldn't tolerate the excessive oil splatter on my sensor requiring me to clean it frequently between shoots.","The camera was broken right out of the box - it happens. I had purchased directly through Amazon, with this concern in mind. Amazon replaced with no issues - other than being 8 days slow. But back to the camera - I enjoy bird / nature photography - it locks in and holds focus beyond<br />my hopes and expectations.","While I have not purchased the D500 from Amazon, I recently \"rented\" it from Lens Rentals Dot Com along with the older version of the Nikon 24-70mm f/2.8 lens (for FX) and Nikon SB-910 flash.  As background, I am not a professional; I use my cameras mainly to photograph my toddler daughter and other family members, and have over the past few years \"owned\" Canon 5D Mark III, Nikon D810, Sony A7RII and Fuji X100T, which eventually made it on to eBay to partly fund the next -- yes, as known by enthusiasts (or pretends ones like myself), I have G.A.S. (that is, gear acquisition syndrome of buying, then selling via eBay, then upgrade to the next latest greatest -- convincing myself I need such cameras when still old Nikon D40 and SB-400 flash can produce great photos).  Reason I am mentioning the 3 full frame sensor cameras and 1 crop sensor (Fuji) are meant to be a point reference.<br /><br />Nikon really knocked it out of the park on focus speed and overall build of the D500. Simply solid and reminds me of an old D300 I owned, yet ruggedness of its older, bigger sibling, the D810.  As to keepers, I would say this camera exceeds all of the above (based on recent uploads to Adobe Lightroom and related comparisons).  This camera's buffer (with an XQD card) simply rocks versus, say, the Sony A7RII that would lock up, black out, where you would need to wait for the buffer to clear (with a message \"Write to memory card. Unable to Operate\") before you could even review a photo on the LCD -- often anywhere from 2 to 5 seconds, which is a bit absurd yet a known issue with such a mirrorless camera (maybe to be resolved with the newer Sony A9 series of cameras .... you can view an online discussion by Phil Steele comparing DSLRs versus mirrorless and how mirrorless are still not yet there on autofocus speed, especially fast moving objects (in my case, an energizer toddler).  The D500's focus speed exceeds the D810 and far surpasses Canon's old 5D Mark III (yet should be interesting to see what Canon's 5D Mark IV will offer in August 2016).<br /><br />In terms of sharpness, I would say this camera comes close to the D810, but not as sharp a higher end megapixel beast like the Sony A7RII, which, yes, might be sharper to a certain degree, but will lock up on writing an image and will not focus even remotely as well as the D500 with fast moving objects (again, toddler in my case).<br /><br />As to colors, hmm, the D500 is similar in color to the D810 or Nikon colors; Sony A7RII has nice colors but a little over processed; Canon's 5D Mark III's colors were pretty good; yet, king (or queen), recently for me was my old Fuji X100T - fantastic colors with little post-processing.<br /><br />In terms of low light performance, another home run -- just WOW -- the Nikon D500 allowed me to take incredible portrait, full body, toddler action shots in different conditions with no flash and the sharpness, decent colors and details produced combined with the quick autofocus really put this camera in its own league.<br /><br />Overall, beyond those looking at the D500 for sports and wildlife photography, the D500 can be a great compliment to the D810 or similar, be used for portraits, and reliable build for various conditions, especially when paired with higher end lens.<br /><br />Would I buy this camera? If invested in Nikon lens, absolutely (if you can afford the body and not a victim of G.A.S.)!  The camera produces fabulously sharp, in-focus images, countless keepers, decent color, and super solid build. Otherwise, still awaiting to see Canon's 5D Mark IV to be released soon and same with Nikon's D810 successor likely in early 2017 (yes, I still have G.A.S.). Good luck on your purchase decision.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After 3 days of using the D500 indoors, outdoors, various lighting conditions (with the above lens and flash), this camera is just fantastic in terms of keepers.","Amazing camera. Paired with the 70-200 2.8 it's fantastic for sports as well as portraits!!!","LOVE IT","Nikon delivered all that was promised on this camera. I'm a semi-pro wildlife shooter and this camera gets it done. Outstanding AF, 10fps, virtually endless buffer, and the best low light performance available in an APS-C format. For truly low light shooting I'll hang on to my D4 but for most of my shooting this is now my go to camera.","Best upgrade I have ever done,  amazing camera,  amazing pictures and video :)  Worth the Big BUCKS!","The Nikon D500 is an awesome DSLR. Being a DX camera, I was a little concerned about the low-light performance of the sensor -- the 1.5x crop factor has never bothered me. However, the D500 is incredible at outside night and also inside with little lighting. I get usable, high-quality, low-noise images at 10,000 ISO with a little help of noise reduction in Adobe Lightroom. If I'm just using a photo to post to Instagram or other low-quality image platforms, I can easily use an image shot at 25,600 ISO. After traveling to Paris and Rome, and watching the Bastille Day fireworks at night and visiting museums with less-than-ideal lighting for photography, I am completely impressed with the camera's ability to function in varying lighting conditions.<br /><br />The autofocus system on the camera is also unbelievable. I often shoot in single-point AF, but when I've used the continuous 3D AF tracking for my dogs or moving subjects, it rarely does not capture them in focus. Coupled with the maximum 10 frames per second, it's hard not to get the shot you wanted for subjects in motion.<br /><br />The build quality of the D500 is also superb. It feels sturdy but not ridiculously heavy or overdone. The placement of buttons (like ISO, focus point knob, etc.) are very intuitive and natural to use. To be honest, I don't really use the touchscreen except to zoom in on image previews. Even when scrolling through images, I still naturally use the button because the touchscreen scrolls in the opposite direction of an iPhone (if you swipe left on the D500, it scrolls back, whereas on the iPhone, it scrolls forward...this is just my personal preference). Also, being an iOS user, it's a bit annoying that the SnapBridge app and functionality on the camera is still not available -- although, it is available for Android users.<br /><br />Other than those small, insignificant things, I really have nothing negative to say about the D500. Moreover, the D750 (a full-frame camera) is similarly priced, but you do not get the features that the D500 packs. If if you want the full-frame equivalent of the D500 -- the D5 -- you would have to shell out another $4,500 on top of the D500's $2000 price tag.<br /><br />If crop factor is not an issue for you, then the Nikon D500 is the perfect camera for someone who is either an enthusiast or semi-professional.<br /><br />Hope this helps.","Best camera I've owned yet! Fast, sharp! Feels nice while in hand!","Outstanding camera.  I have the D750 also.  Fun to use and full of features.  Works great with wildlife - fast focus.  Got some great shots at Lion Safari.","Perfect camera. It's quite an upgrade to my old 300. I was thinking about the D5, but I have the DX lenses and decided on the 500. It was the perfect choice.","incredibly fast, and exceptional camera for wildlife","Great unit but had to return due to camera freezing up","Camera fully met my expectations!","I photograph whales, dolphins and other difficult to shoot wildlife. An unpredictibly rocking boat, fast moving sea creatures that appear out of nowhere and weather conditions that range from dark and foggy to bright reflections scattered everywhere. Challenging conditions and subject matter. Nikon finally offers a DSLR that can overcome all these obsticals. The very expensive flagship cameras of Canon and Nikon also allow 8-14frames per second, pro-build and superior autofocus. This camera costs $2000 and has the state of the art autofocus only the Nikon D5 shares. It \"grabs\" your target and holds onto it for 200 shots in full raw at 10 frames per second! This is an incredible advance for such a low price. Group autofocus helps me to keep focus on a whale or dolphin despite solid, changing water splashing and confusing every other conventional af setups. The variable ISO and dynamic range of this camera provide beautiful color and spot on exposures at combinations that used to be unusable. Like 1/3200 @ f/8 on an overcast day. ISO 1600 is not only usable but almost noise free. The D500 is approx.  21 megapixels and DX/cropsensor. The viewfinder is huge and bright at 100%. The LCD is very cool and must be handled to be appreciated. Built to shoot high over a crowd or down low for a closeup. Also features touchscreen funtionality like an ipad.<br />We are buying another D500 soon. My wife loves her old D300 but this one blows it away.","extremely pleased!","Brand new.  It's taking me some time to learn the ropes on this one.  I'm a novice and I'm only using this for family shots and anything I happen to see out in the desert.  It's quite an upgrade from my Nikon D90.  The quality of the pictures is superb.  I agonized over getting this one or making the jump to an FX like the 810.  The ability to shoot 4K movies and the expeed 5 processor tipped my purchase to this camera.  However, so far I haven't found anything that will accurately play my 4K movies.  I'll have to research that.  Also, the battery does not last that long at all.  If you purchase an extra battery or two, make sure they are Li-ion20 or it'll be even worse at keeping a charge.  If you didn't receive the 20 battery, I believe you can send it to Nikon for the enhancement.  I also got the lens they packaged with this camera.  No complaints except I hear the noise of the lens focusing when I'm trying to shoot movies of my family.  With everyone moving around the autofocus is constantly refocusing and you can hear the sound of it when the movie is replayed.<br />More of my shots are in focus now as compared to my D90 (ancient).  Again, when family comes over and everyone is moving around it is sometimes difficult to get consistently good shots (focus).  No problem with this camera and if you move it to continuous mode....BAM!  10 pictures just like that.  I get really candid shots with that .....(lucky I have a 4TB drive in my computer). I also bought the SB-300 speedlight as this camera does not have a pop-up flash.  Since a diffuser was suggested and was cheap I threw that in too.  Works great.  I get great pictures of family during the day and all kinds of desert critters in the middle of the night.  This was a big expense for me but so far I'm happy with my purchase.","This camera lives up to the hype for wildlife and sports photography. Fast focusing and low light performance are excellent.","this is more a need of help.<br />im a profissional photographer in portugal... 90% ok my work is wedding<br /><br />all the nikon produts come verry late to portugal.....we cant buy at this day a machine in portugal like D500(15day they said)<br /><br />anyone use this machine for weddinds?  what do you think ?  my albuns are  60x40 cm<br /><br />a put a d810 test, if you can see this is the reason i dislik d810 ( green color in shadow) the same photo with d800 is perfect","I will update at the top of this review when I feel I may need to.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />A couple months in and the camera still kicks ass. If you're thinking about it, just do it.<br /><br />----------------------------------<br /><br />Alright, so I've had the camera for almost two weeks now.<br />I've shot probably half a dozen different landscape scenes. A couple portrait shoots, and lots of lowlight material. I'm fascinated with the Milky Way for night sky photography and this camera powers through it very nicely. ISO 1600 through 3200 looking very clean in comparison to the old D5300. I'd say close to full frame performance in regards to high ISO noise handling. Dynamic range is absolutely phenomenal. I'm able to pull up lots of detail out of shadows and pull down the highlights very nicely when needed. No problems at all yet with battery life - In fact, I got about 950 shots on an 85% charge in a timelapse, so I'd say it's right on the money. Also have had no issues with the Lexar XQD with this camera like others have reported. I am having some issues with Lightroom taking FOREVER to import these photos when connected via the USB. For most shots, I just transfer to the SD card and use my card reader, but for some things, I have to use the USB to transfer direct from the camera and Lightroom (CC updated and D500 Firmware updated) and it seriously takes probably 3 or 4 hours to import 8 or 10 gigs in. Wondering what might be the issue there, but outside of that, I have no complaints. This camera has proved its worth nicely.<br /><br />The illuminated buttons have also been a blessing for my night sky shooting.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />So far, I have nothing but love for this camera. I'm coming from a history of low-mid level cameras, so this jump was significant for me. Most recently, I'm coming from a Nikon D5300. The pro features I were expecting are truly great. The button layout is much more than a gimmick. Having the ISO button on the right side, thereby freeing my left hand at times is such a practical and appreciated decision by Nikon.<br /><br />The touch screen is nice for what functionality it has. I was hoping to be able to use it in more of the menu side of things, but I'm not taking away a star for that. That wouldn't change the quality of my images.<br /><br />The focusing is everything you've probably heard about. It's crazy. It's so fast and so, so accurate. I haven't even had a chance to use 3D tracking yet, but its normal continuous focus really works incredibly well.<br /><br />The ISO to noise ratio is incredibly well controlled. As a landscape photographer, I have low tolerance for noise, especially with astrophotography. I was always looking for ways to reduce noise in post because the lower tier cameras just can't handle it well. I was testing some of that out with the D500, but on a sunny evening/sunset and I shot some images in ISO ranges I never thought I would call acceptable. I'm talking ISO 25,000 with just a little bit of noise reduction in lightroom and I wouldn't have an issue posting to social media. Even 52,000 wasn't out of the realm of possibilities if I were in a pinch. That is absolutely insane to know that I can say that now, but this camera is just that good in that regard. I haven't had the chance to do astro with it yet and test out the high-iso in low light conditions, but I got the camera on a full moon, so in a week or two will have some results to show for that.<br /><br />The LCD screen resolution is nice and bright and clear, and the viewfinder is very nice. I especially like the round eyepiece. The button illumination is awesome and will really come in handy for us astrophotographers. It really feels like a pro body that got the attention to detail it deserves.<br /><br />The processor is so blazingly fast. I have it set up to save RAW files to the XQD (Been using Lexar with no issues) and Jpegs to the SD with snapbridge sending 2mb copies to my phone for quick Snapseed edits going out to Instagram in no time.<br /><br />The battery life is great. The camera shipped with the newer version of the ENEL15 battery and I have seen very good performance out of it so far.<br /><br />The camera itself is bigger and heavier than my D5300, but the grip is deep and offsets that extra mass as it's easy to hold.<br /><br />I have not tested out the video yet, so I'll be sure to do that upon updating my review.<br />(Be aware that I shot my first batch of uploaded pictures with the Nikkor 18-135 f/3.5, so if I had sharper glass, I would have sharper images)","This camera is special. I own D800 too (which is awesome), but I love some of the things that this camera can do. Autofocus, high ISO, low noise to mention a few. I am very happy with it.","For those of us who've been waiting nine years for the D300's replacement, it's here, and exceeds expectations.  It'll take you time to digest all this new DX body can do, but it truly does blast off accurately focused and exposed 10 frame-per-second bursts, do 4k video and time-delay sequences with aplomb, and shoot in impossibly low light.  Robust build quality, menus familiar to Nikon shooters, and the flippy screen is more useful than you can imagine until you use one. Recommendations; Lexar's 2933x XQD card for main memory works great; the Lexar 1000x SD card for backup had initial problems talking with the D500 but Lexar replaced it promptly with a newly revised card (new firmware) and that now works great.  Most important:  the 16-80mm Nikon VR lens released with this body is fantastic, a must-buy new normal lens for Nikon DX.  Not the build quality or weight of the mid-range FX lens, but sharp, contrasty, quick enough in focusing, great smudge-resistant coating, and unreal VR capabilities. I repeatedly have shot tack-sharp 1/8 second exposures with it at 16mm, 1/15 at 80mm. See attached. 1/8 sec at f7.1, ISO 100, hand-held with the D500 and 16-80 at 16mm.  Not bad for a 5x zoom walk-around lens.","As a professional photographer I have always used Canon cameras and Canon lenses but the reviews for this NIKON D500 were so high - dPreview.com gives it a 91% rating - that I was compelled to switch brands.  This is everything I want in a camera and more.  I also bought the new Nikon 16-80mm lens and it is exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you, Nikon!","Still learning everything about it, but so far all of what I read in dpreview rings true.  A great sports / action camera for under 3k.","Everything is good about this camera exept battery life its horrable compared to my d7000 . Other than that its a superb DX dslr made by nikon and anyone else. Must be some firmware to fix battery life. I did recharge a few times before this review. Seems some bug software related. Im returning my copy because of that. This body is not cheap to live with that and i want everything to be perfect . Sorry nikon i will wait until you fix that.","After over 110K actuations on my D7000 (I'm not a pro), the temptation for greater low light abilities, \"newsworthy\" autofocus, better white balance, and overall more responsive results proved too enticing to resist. I like having so much of Nikon's top technology in a camera body that I can afford, and I would say that the experience of the D7000, which was quite good for its time, has helped me appreciate the direction which Nikon has taken over the years. Like many, I was torn between the D750 and this model. I'm not a sports photographer, and most of my \"best\" work is portraiture. However, what made the decision for me was not the trove of opinions about which camera should be used for what. It was the basic feeling of \"what would I like my camera to do better?\" When I answered that question (having gotten many thousands of gorgeous photos out of the D7000), I realized that what I needed was quicker performance from powering-on to shutter-release in challenging situations. Generally, I could get the photos I wanted with the older camera body. But, when I missed it was because the camera couldn't respond fast enough in low light -or that what came out was too full of noise and color distortions to \"feel\" like the moment I'd experienced in real-life. That situation is utterly gone now (so far...it's still early...). However, I would caution other users like me not to expect a perfectly smooth transition. The D7000 was absolutely second-nature to me after so many years. The D500 seems to show different slightly different defaults for color \"tonalities,\" jpeg sharpness, saturation levels, and metering choices than what I was used to. Nothing bad -just not what I was expecting. So, I'm still in the process of doing \"test\" photos where I shoot the same scene, note my instincts for the settings, and watch how they translate onto the big monitor. Once I've learned how to get what I \"see\" in a situation, I'll have truly made the switch. More knowledgeable photographers might intuitively skip this step. Regardless, it's working for me. And, I actually have no regrets about choosing this over the full frame D750 (which I'm sure is also terrific). FYI, the only lens I use is the Sigma Art 35/1.4. No need for anything else. Good luck with your own decisions!","Nikon did it right on this model.  I received this body the first week it was released and since then have shot dozens of sporting events logging upwards of 30k frames.  Superb low light focusing, quick and reliable auto-focus, well-placed control positions for ISO, EV adjustments on the fly and the touch screen makes it enjoyable to quickly scroll/enlarge photos for review.  Since I started using this body, my D3 and D4 have been sitting in my equipment cabinet.  The only complaint that I have is that now I literally have 50%+ more quality tact sharp photos to sort through after each shoot.","I purchased this camera for wildlife photography but am also very impressed with it's low light capability.  Probably the finest DX on the market.","Great low light ability with very little visible grain","Just love it","I was using Nikon D7100 before upgrading to D500.  Autofocus & low light capabilities of the D500 are outstanding.  Makes it possible to shoot wildlife earlier in morning & later in evening. I normally shoot in manual shutter & aperture control with auto ISO.  I had the max ISO set for 1400 on the D7100; I now have it set for 16,000 on the D500.","Yes, yes, yes!  A million times yes!!  This camera is an absolute beast, the 10FPS is freaking insane, and the autofocus & control is wonderful!  Also, the high ISO quality is amazing, I can shoot up to 16,000 and have totally usable pictures for most applications!  Although I wish it came with a dual SD option, this camera overall is wonderful, and I look forward to getting a lot of use out of it!","This is one of the best cameras I have ever used and I have been shooting for over 30 years.  Don't believe the BS reviews about battery issues, use the newer Nikon brand batteries and it works just fine.  After 5000 plus shots this thing doesn't miss, yes it's that good.  I have a D810 and use to have the D750 and this new camera puts them to shame on focus tracking and speed.  As for the SD card issue well it's not an issue at least for me, I use a Lexar 128GB XQD and it works flawlessly.  I don't use the SD slot as the 128GB XQD can shoot over 2500 Raw 14bit lossless compressed and there is no buffer issues hat I have experienced.  Overall this thing is a beast and my new sports/wildlife camera.","Snapbridge can not even support a Samsung S3 using WiFi much less Bluetooth. .  Sony's connect app has no problems with my S3 and A6300.  Not a deal killer, but there is not technology missing in the S3 what would preclude supporting BT and WIFI.  Just lack of testing/support  Was not expecting to need to upgrade phone for years old technology.","Great camera.  I carry it in preference to a D4s, D810, D610.  Wedded to a Nikon 300mm f4 PF lens +2x tele extender, giving 600mm focal length (equivalent to 900mm lens on a full frame camera because of Dx crop sensor effect).  Sport vibration reduction on the lens, the camera's high frame rate ~10 frames/second, about the same as D4s, and great autofocus makes shooting birds in action handheld a reality, even when shooting from my Hobie Pro Angler 12 kayak.  See myfocusonbirds.com for more shots. It has never been on a tripod since I received it.","As everyone knows, this is one great Camera.  My comments here are about the \"battery problem\".  I have noticed that the battery is not lasting nearly as long as in my other Nikon camera bodies.  Today, I think I know why.  The battery went to one bar and I then put it in the battery charger.  Normally the charging takes 3 hours, but in less than one hour the battery charger indicated full charge.  I put the battery back into the D500 and within a few hours, the battery was again at just one bar.<br />I then put the same battery in my D750.  Low and behold, the camera indicated three bars!  I then put the battery in my D800. Again three bars.  The logical conclusion was to then put the battery back into the D500 to confirm a reading of only one bar.<br />Evidently, Nikon has some kind of software problem.  The D500 is incorrectly indicating a discharged batttery when that is obviously, not the case.<br />If you have another Nikon camera that uses the same battery, you can do the same test.<br />This may well be why third party batteries are not working at all.<br /><br />I am confident, Nikon will address this problem in the very near future.","Been shooting with this camera for about 12 days. It's a rugged work-horse like the D300, it's fast - and fast to focus (if it's not focusing fast - check your setting), and excellent in low light conditions, but in bright light conditions, images can be a bit washed out. Also shooting a D810, and I've read reviews that make the claim that the images are just as good as the D810, but I have to disagree here. Tested both cameras against each other, shooting with the same settings, lens & conditions and the D810 is the clear winner when it comes to image quality, with that said, the D500 is close behind. If you are used to looking at D810 images, you will notice the difference in image quality between them. The D500 is a nice compliment to the D810 and it fits my need for shooting birds in low light conditions.  Images shot at ISO 4000, F5.6, speeds between 2500-8000.  Only cropped & brighten.  This is not a noiseless camera, it still produces noise at high ISOs, but much less then the majority of cameras out there, and the details at high ISOs are extremely good.  Watch Tony Northrup's review & comparison of the D500 on YouTube to help put this in perspective.","I bought my D300 back in 2008 and I paid 2k for it. It was a great camera but I had to sell it because the expected replacement ( D400 ) was never made by Nikon, so I decided to go with FX and I bought the D750.<br />When this camera D500 was announced, I decided to buy it right away and I do not regret. I am paying for it the same price I paid for my beloved D300 but this one is way better than my D300.<br />Excellent AF system, excellent frame rate are just some of the positive things about this camera. The most important things for me is the AF system which is superb. Once you lock on your subject, it won't fail as far as you continue keeping your focus point on the subject as it moves. It does not matter if you are using d25, d72, Group or 3D tracking, it will continue focusing at 10fps and it won't fail at all. You will have more keepers than not. It does not matter if something is in front or back of your subject, the camera will continue focusing on your subject rather than being fooled by things around your subject. It is simple amazing and it is very fun to use.<br />You can also use this camera for low light photography. Personally, I will not use it above ISO 6400 but that way above the ISO that you could use with the D300 or any other DX camera in the market today. The camera feels secure in your hand and you have the feeling that you are in control all the time. Even though we are missing the U1 and U2, I still give it a 5 stars review. I do recommend it to whoever want to have the best DX camera out there.","Wow, I'm loving it.  Upgraded from D300s, simply fantastic","I haven't been disappointed a bit by the camera, which joins two D810s and a Sony A6300 in the collection.  I bought the camera FOR the crop to get some extra apparent distance from my longer lenses, got fast moving sports, and for the occasion BIF.  I brought it with me from the US to the UK to put it through its paces.  So far, focus acquit ion has been super fast. Buffer and buffer depth allow me to shoot 30-40 raws without the buffer filling.  While some have reported miscellaneous problems, the QA on ,ine has been superb.  I use Lexar 2933x XQD cards and either Lexar UHSII 2000x or Sandisk 280 Mbit/sec cards.  I don't miss the flash; throw on an nexpensive SB500 and away you go.  I've now shot about 1500 images and, while not all are keepers, the number of potential keepers is high.  Great autofus system.  Highly recommended.  It is NOT full frame, and don't buy it expecting full-frame.  Expect some of this technology to show up in the replacement for the D810.","I have owned several Nikon bodies over the years so I think I have a good basis for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the D500. I currently own a D810 and a D7000 - both of these are very capable cameras, especially the D810 which I have been using primarily for wildlife and landscapes.<br /><br />I have had the D500 for about a week and I think it compares very favourably with the D810 on most measures that photographers care about. It is very similar to the D810 in terms of build quality and overall 'feel' in the hand. Although the D500 is smaller than the D810, the grip is deeper and it feels really good to hold. This is probably the best Nikon I have ever owned in terms of 'comfort in the hand' - small but not too small, robust without feeling heavy. Nikon have modified the button layout, moving the ISO button to the right hand side of the body. This took a bit of getting used to but it now means that you can control all your exposure settings with one hand. Great job Nikon!<br /><br />The articulating touch screen is a new feature - one that I have never used before. I haven't yet encountered a situation where I need my screen to move but it is nice to have that functionality. I can say that the build quality of the screen is impressive. I was expecting something flimsy that would need to be carefully handled. This screen and articulating arm seem very solid and capable of standing up to heavy use. The touch screen is very cool. Great to be able to zoom in and scroll through images direct from the screen. It would have been nice to be able to access the menus through the screen but overall I am very happy with the screen. Its a useful upgrade on the D810's screen.<br /><br />Another notable point of difference between the two cameras is the lack of a pop up flash on the D500. I have mixed feelings about this. It does make the D500 more rugged and I never used the pop up flash for wildlife (I use an externally mounted SB900). However for family events etc it is nice to have the pop up available for a bit of fill flash in the day time. Its also nice to be able to use the pop up as commander for external flashes. Losing the pop up is a bit of trade off but not a big deal to me.<br /><br />What about image quality? I primarily shoot wildlife and from what I've seen the two cameras are again quite similar. The images coming out of the D500 look fantastic, every bit as good as the D810. That said, I haven't had an opportunity yet to really push the D500 into crazy high ISO range. I've gone to iso 3200 and it looks great. At dawn and dusk  I could reliably push my D810 to iso 6400 and still get good quality images. I suspect the D500 is going to be competitive here as well but the jury is still out.<br /><br />The one thing I sometimes struggled with shooting wildlife on the D810 was frame rate. The D810 is a bit of a laggard even when shooting in crop mode which I often did. In contrast the D500 is a speed demon. With 10fps, a big buffer and a lightning fast XQD card it has all the power most wildlife photographers will ever need.<br /><br />Finally, one other area of improvement over the D810 is autofocus. The D810 is very competent in this regard but D500 seems a bit faster to lock on and my hit rate is higher.<br /><br />Overall, I think the D500 is an amazing camera and for certain applications probably better than the superb D810. I can't think of anything I don't like about the camera apart from what seems like a more demanding battery. I haven't done any controlled tests but the battery seems to drain faster on the D500 than the D810. It could be that I am just using the screen a lot more because of the touch screen functionality. It's a minor point though. I expect anyone who has shot Nikon before will be very happy with this camera and it may give pause to some people who have been contemplating switching to a full frame camera. All in all I give the D500 a grade of A+","Lets start off this review by taking a look at the build quality of the Nikon D500.<br /><br />The first thing you feel when you pick up the D500 is just how big it is. But to me that’s not a bad thing at all.<br /><br />It feels incredibly solid and moulds to your hand really quite well. It’s not actually as heavy as you’d think and is on par to something like the 7d mark ii.<br /><br />To me the D500 has some of the best button placement that I’ve seen on on a Nikon body. Everything is where you’d expect to find it, with your record, iso and exposed compensation buttons up the top here near the shutter button.<br /><br />On the side we’ve got a number of different ports, but we’ll talk more about them later on.<br /><br />There isn’t an inbuilt flash on the d500 and a few poepl might miss it, but for me on a pro body like this, it’s not a big deal.<br /><br />As you’d expect for a camera of this calibre, the d500 is weather sealed so you’re going to have no problems taking this out in the rain.<br /><br />So overall in terms of build quality, the d500 is one of the best I’ve seen in a long time.<br /><br />-<br /><br />Let’s turn the camera around now and take a look at the lcd screen on the back.<br /><br />And something new and probably unexpected is that nikon have included an articulating screen on the d500.<br /><br />Now to be fair, it’s not a full articulating screen like you find on cameras such as the canon 80d, but it is pretty useful still.<br /><br />You can flip it up and down which has been really useful for composing my shots.<br /><br />It does feel pretty solid, but i do worry a little bit about the hinge its on. It doesn’t seem pretty thin so it’ll be interesting to see just how well it holds up.<br /><br />Photos from the the 20 megapixel sensor look really great on the back of the screen even in bright daylight.<br /><br />Other than that though the screen is very bright and sharp. I’ve been seeing this trend lately with Nikon producing some really good screens and the d500 continues with it as well.<br /><br />-<br /><br />One feature I love on the Nikon D500 and one that’s a bit of a life saver is not eh side here, that’s it dual card slots.<br /><br />This might not seem like a big feature, but having the ability to back up your photos is huge, especially if you’re shooting important one time events like weddings.<br /><br />To me this should be a given in any pro level body, but it is still nice to see.<br /><br />-<br /><br />The viewfinder on the D500 has 100% coverage as you’d expect as was nice to use.<br /><br />If you’re coming from a lower end nikon body, the shipe of it is a little different, but with it’s 1x magnification, it works very quite well.<br /><br />-<br /><br />Let’s talk quickly about the menus on the D500.<br /><br />If you’ve ever used a Nikon DSLR, you’ll feel right at home using the D500. The menus are pretty feature packed with a lot of different options, especially once you move into full manual mode.<br /><br />Performance was quick though and there was no lag which is good.<br /><br />-<br /><br />So i just wanted to touch on the battery life of the d500.<br /><br />I’ve been incredibly impressed with the battery life of this camera, although I would recommend using a battery grip if you are going to shooting photos all day or shooting 4k video.<br /><br />I got through about 1200 shots before the battery ran out on me.<br /><br />But overall, the battery life was very good on the nikon d500.<br /><br />-<br /><br />So let’s talk about the burst rate of the nikon d500.<br /><br />Now Nikon are touting this camera as being a real winner for sports and i’ve got to say it lives up to the hype.<br /><br />The d500 can shoot at an impressive 10 frames per second, which should be fast enough for most sports and wildlife.<br /><br />Just for reference sake, this is what 10 frames per second sounds like.<br /><br />This puts it on par with it’s biggest rival the Canon 7d mark ii which can also shoot at around 10 frames per second.<br /><br />I also found that the D500’s autofocus was incredible. Nikon have really upped their game and to me, the autofocus on the d500 is some of the best i’ve ever tested.<br /><br />You’ve also got a 200 raw shot buffer which is very nice.<br /><br />I’m going to be making a more in depth video on the autofocus of the d500 so check back soon for that, but overall it’s blisteringly fast.<br /><br />-<br /><br />Now I briefly touch on the ports on the camera earlier on, but i just wanted to show you what you get. Of course you’re getting a usb and an cdmi cable, but also in the middle hear you getting a mic and headphone jack.<br /><br />This to me, shows that nikon are really trying to convince more video shooters over to their side and it’s good to see.<br /><br />Havin gate ability to record good sound and monitor as well is really important, and makes this a pretty impressive little video camera, which we’ll talk about a little bit more now.<br /><br />-<br /><br />So let’s talk more about the Nikon D500 for video.<br /><br />As you probably know if you’re watching this video, the D500 can shoot 4k video. And i’ve got to say it’s incredibly impressive.<br /><br />The colours it reproduces are very nice and the detail is definitely there.<br /><br />Compred to something like the Canon 7d mark ii, the sharpness of the 4k to the 1080p really is night and day.<br /><br />Now one few drawback of the nikon d500 though is that it does crop the video quite a lot when shooting 4k. So if you do know you’re going to be wanting to shoot in 4k, you’ll want to make sure you have a wide enough lens.<br /><br />One other nice thing is that the d500 can shoot a full 30 minutes of video, cpmapred to just 3 minutes on the more expensive nikon d5. To me that’s a pretty big deal and something to consider if you are choosing between the two.<br /><br />One other nice feature is that you can create timelapses in the camera which is a lot of fun, and something that again emphasizes that Nikon is really trying to gain a bit more marketshare in the video market.<br /><br />SO overall, the Nikon d500 is actually a pretty capable video shooting machine, so good job nikon.<br /><br />-<br /><br />So i just quickly wanted to talk about wifi.<br /><br />The d500 comes with wifi and nfc included, which is great if you want to be able to quickly transfer your photos to your phone.<br /><br />This is something that the 7d mark ii misses out on, so again is something to consider.","I bought this camera from a local shop, since it's sold out everywhere.<br />I wanted a DX camera. I have some nice DX lenses and would rather not spend 2k on an fx lens.<br />First thing i did is shooting with ISO 1000 and higher to see if this DX camera has much noise and the results are amazing.<br />Then I tested the 10fps shooting this camera can do and how well the AF system perform. I am astonished with the results.<br />I am in love with this camera. It has everything I need. I mainly need a camera for outdoors shooting and vacations but also would like the camera to perform well in weddings and parties.<br />I do not have a studio and do not shoot portraits for a living, hence a DX camera is a better fit for me.","First of all, I didn't buy this camera on Amazon. I bought it elsewhere because I knew I could get it faster there (proof of purchase in pics). Secondly, all of the negative reviews I read so far should be disregarded, or better yet, deleted. I don't care if it's \"just an opinion.\" If you're misrepresenting the strengths of this camera because it won't connect with your iOS device or because it's not a FX body, than keep it to yourself. People want true reviews, not crybaby reviews over non-issues.<br /><br />Snapbridge is delayed on iOS. There is no false advertising. It was announced at the initial launch that a delay was happening for iOS. This is also Nikon's first DX flagship in almost a decade. A lot of folks who held on to the still relevant D300S have been asking for this and now we have it. Some people rather have a DX body for their type of shooting, if you're complaining that Nikon didn't release another (ANOTHER) FX body, the D500 is obviously not for you.<br /><br />Speaking on the FX/DX debate, true, actual owners of the D500 should already know that the D500 really closed that difference gap. The overall imagery is great. The noise handling is surprisingly on-par with some FX bodies like the D750, and all the nerd tests from DPR show that in some settings, the D500 is beating the D5 in handling ISO and maintaining a clean, sharp image.<br /><br />The D500 (for those not in the know) is aimed at sports and wildlife photographers, and it's impressive in that regard, but I found it equally impressive in FX-related photography like landscape (I shoot LE astrophotography), and portraits. The Auto AF Fine-Tune is invaluable, quick, and easy to use. The new tilt screen (it's a new version from the D750) is rigid and tough. The touchscreen is accurate, and intuitive. The inclusion of an XQD slot makes this wicked fast. I was able to clear the 200 shot  buffer without any slowdown  with the Lexar Pro x2933 at 14-bit RAW, and the photos finished loading the 200 shots to the card anywhere between 7 - 10 seconds. the OVF is 100% coverage and is bright. I was able to tack-sharp focus a star with just the viewfinder. Overall, the images are nice and sharp, BUT at times, they're not as sharp as a D7200 or my D7100. You can thank the 20mp sensor for that (compared to the 24mp sensor in the D7100/7200).<br /><br />EDIT (8/20): Since somebody else had to exclaim that I was wrong about IQ differences between the 71/7200 (7100 mainly) and the D500 in their review, perhaps some clarifying is in order. Yes, the D500 performs in this department well at higher ISOs than the D7100. That doesn't mean that the D500 is the end-all winner. I've compared landscape dusk shots I've taken with my D7100 and then with the D500. I also have a 4k monitor, which is a pixel-peepers dream. As much as I hate pixel peeping, a number of the shots I've taken on the D7100 were overall better than the same shots I took with the D500. I guess I should say that at times and certain conditions, the D500 has better IQ but at other times, it's just not.... imo. In any case, I don't care too much about that because I work with the gear that I got and I hold onto said gear for as long as I can. I make sure my fundamentals are in order, I exercise what I learned The D7100 was an anomaly purchase because some of us have been waiting for a D300S replacement for years.. I mean, I still shoot film with my old F3 and FE and push film. Fundamentals>Gear. Despite that, this whole image deal is really only an issue with people who obsessed with pixel peeping and doesn't embrace imperfections such as noise.<br /><br />Overall, wildlife photos are still sharp and the photos are still good enough for decent sized prints. The 4k is detailed, and the 1080p recording is combo'd with Electronic VR, which works pretty decent.<br /><br />My only two issues with this camera is the additional crop-factor you get when filming in 4K. It is doable, since it's pretty much the same crop as MFT sensors, but I prefer a wide lens for 4k filming. The other issue is battery. It sucks up way more battery life than the D7100/D7200. Even with Airplane Mode on, the camera seems to suck battery life at a faster rate than my previous bodies. Also, for now, if you need an extra battery, you have to buy legit EN-EL15s because none of the 3rd party batteries work.<br /><br />This is a GREAT camera. Well worth the wait. Go with what kind of photography you mostly shoot with and get the gear you think works best for you. Don't play trial and error with your money and then cry and needlessly give a good camera bad reviews.","I have now used the D500 and a 500mm f/4 lens for a week mostly doing bird photography. While shooting the images with the D500, I have found the following:<br />- The maximum frame rate of 10 fps allows me to get better bird-in-flight (BIF) quality and action than I ever got with my D800e<br />- I sometimes use CL and set at it at 5 fps to slow the clicks down and capture fewer images per second to reduce image review later<br />- The 200 frame buffer is a godsend; I ran out of buffer all the time with a D800e while shooting BIF and missed great action sequences<br />- Autofocus is faster and better than the D800e; I use AF-C d25 for bird photography<br />- Dynamic range is excellent and is close to the D800e/D810 (0.5 - 1.0 EV less per ISO setting)<br />- Metering works better for birds than the metering in the D800e (Center-weighted and Matrix); I almost never dial in negative EV to keep white birds from getting blown out and it happened sometimes with the D800e; I have far fewer blowouts now with the D500.<br />- There is a little more image noise above 1000 ISO than in a D800e at the same ISO setting and I had to change my image processing some to reduce the noise<br />- XQD memory cards are FAST while snapping pics and downloading images; I use Sony G Series and Lexar 2933x<br />- Battery life seems shorter than expected because you do more clicks per hour; 2 hrs of intense shooting or 1200 frames; the D800e does about 900 frames on the same battery<br />- External control buttons and dials are better than D800/D800e/D810 for humans<br />- It is 0.5 lb lighter than a D800e and L-bracket making it a bit easier to handhold with my BushHawk than the D800e; I don't need an L-bracket for the body because I never intend to use it for landscape work.","The price gouging on this camera is ridiculous and those peddling such activity should be shot. In a years time it'll be on sale for $1,500 or less.","Hands down the best crop sensor body I've ever owned.  Amazing AF and fantastic ISO performance.  I'm not much on writing detailed reviews.  If you shoot birds and sports then this is a must have in your bag.","Awesome upgrade from my D300. I love that most functions are controlled by buttons and wheels rather than menus. The focus is fast, the focal point adjustment is via a new joystick-type button easily accessed by right thumb, continuous high speed shooting mode is breathtakingly fast, and the slightly roughened surface and familiar body shape feels good in my hands. I have only shot about 125 captures. All were on Auto ISO, and I got peacocks outdoors at 200 followed closely by a tack-sharp image of an embroidered shirt behind glass in a display case lit only by a small incandescent bulb. The camera chose ISO 20,000 (no, not 2,000 - 20,000) for that capture. I think this is going to be fun!<br /><br />UPDATE: As requested, I am adding sample photos. The shirt was in a dimly lit museum case, taken with Auto ISO of 20,000, 1/60 sec @ f20 at 44 mm with Nikon 18-200. The cheetah was taken at the SD Safari Park at ISO 1250, 1/1250 sec @ f 8 at 450 mm with a Nikon 200-500. Both were taken handheld. You can see that both are sharp and well-exposed despite the variance in conditions, and the cheetah photo gives some idea of dynamic range. This is an excellent camera!","I Have two of these.  The guy who said the image q wasnt that much better than a d7100/7200 is simply incorrect.  Its MUCH better, but especially so above iso 800, which is where all the \"advancement\" has taken place.  To get fx iso performance from a dx body, has thusfar been impossible.  This body is there.  The iso performance is easily as good if not a stop better than the d750 (which i also have two of).<br /><br />Build Q is very very good.<br /><br />ONE CAVEAT....well two actually.  THIS CAMERA WILL NOT RECOGNIZE 3RD PARTY BATTERIES.  ALSO SEVERAL NON NIKON LENSES WILL NOT PERFORM AF.  Namely, my Sigma 85 1.4. (and i've heard others) but will speak only of what I have.  It will not even attempt AF.  The lens still works as it should on my d750's, d3s, d810, and d300....so its NOT my lens.  When I asked a Nikon Svc Center, they said, not our problem.  So be advised that some non oem lenses may not work.  I'd suspect that the newer lenses probably do....or can be easily updated w firmware, but the older ones w no usb port to upgrade may require a trip to Sigma (or wherever).  That said....the camera is worth the fuss of those two minor issues.","The D500 exceeded my expectations. (I also own a D810 and a D7200.)","What an awesome camera!! I own both the Nikon 810 and 750. The image quality is on par with a full frame camera. That's some feat for a crop sensor! The focusing kills both my other cameras. High iso does remarkably well for this crop camera. Please ignore reviews from people who don't even own the camera (KC) and trust real photographers who know what they're talking about. Very happy with this purchase.","As an amateur wildlife photographer, so far I'm happy with this camera. I've only had one late afternoon of shooting Ospreys with it (EDIT: see updates below), and it was very impressive. Auto-focus is extremely fast, and the 10 frame-per-second shooting with a massive buffer is unbelievable. I'm using just an SD card (high speed) and I get 26 shots in the buffer (EDIT: in practice I'm getting about a 30 shot burst).<br /><br />My ratio of good shots to bad shots is already significantly higher than it was with my Canon EOS 70D, which is a great camera but not nearly as good at focusing as this one is. I took about 400 images today and there may have been 10 that were too blurry to make use of, and that includes a moment when an Osprey took me by surprise and I had to aim and shoot in about a second. The D500 picked up the bird and focused almost instantly.<br /><br />The shots are a bit softer than I hoped for, but I haven't used the automatic focus fine-tuning yet. I was using my (also new) Sigma 150-600mm Sport, which is a good lens but I haven't used Sigma's USB dock to fine tune it yet. So I (optimistically) suspect that when I use the camera's auto-tune and then use Sigma's dock to push it even further, I'll get razor sharp images almost every time. I'm very impressed so far, this is a big step up from the 70D, where I would get roughly 10 or 15 bad shots for every good one. Not knocking the 70D, I'm not a professional so I'm sure I have room for improvement.<br /><br />I'm also extremely happy with Snapbridge, mainly because it easily connected to my Android phone (NFC didn't work but bluetooth paired easily - I've never had much luck with NFC). Snapbridge is now automatically geotagging every image. That's a big part of why I got this camera - I travel all over the world and geotagging has become a necessity as far as I'm concerned. Here's a knock on Canon - before switching to this Nikon I purchased Canon's latest - the 80D. Not only was the 80D unable to connect to my Android (only worked on Android 5, and I was on 6 which has been out for months), but when connecting to other Android 5 devices, it was unable to automatically geotag images. After speaking to Canon support, they said it was a limitation of the camera, and suggested I grab Canon's GPS add-on unit. Unacceptable when almost everyone has a smartphone that has GPS capabilities these days.<br /><br />Some other quick notes, both pros and cons:<br />- The shutter release button is kind of \"soft\" meaning even when I don't want to, I frequently accidentally get a burst of 10 shots when I meant to take just 1. Not a big deal, I'm getting used to it already.<br />- The touch screen LCD is great, but I was surprised to find that it's not \"always\" touch-sensitive. For example, navigating the settings menus is not touch-enabled at all. Not a big deal, but I was surprised.<br />- The swiveling LCD screen is good, but Canon's fully articulating screen on the 70D and 80D is better. I particularly liked that on those cameras I could turn the LCD around entirely, facing inward, protecting the screen from scratches. I already bought a glass screen protector for the D500 so it's kind of a moot point.<br />- By default, the camera shows the remaining exposure count in the viewfinder and the top-display. If you want to see ISO instead, you can, but it shows up in place of the exposure count. So basically you have to choose between one or the other. For me I went with ISO.<br /><br />That's it for now, I'll continue to update this review as I get more experience with the camera, especially after doing some fine-tuning on both the camera and the lens.<br /><br />UPDATE: 5/1/2016<br />I spent a couple of hours playing with the auto AF-tune option using both the bundled Nikon 16-80mm lens, and my Sigma 150-600 (which is not an easy candidate for tuning). The system works generally OK, but repeated attempts give different results, sometimes with wide variations. The Nikon usually got a -1, 0, or +1, so I left it at 0. The Sigma was a lot tougher due to how large of a zoom range it has, and different distances between myself and the subject. I'll have to use Sigma's USB dock for this, but to speed things up I decided on a +3 (manual) adjustment after getting varying readings from the auto adjustment system (from -5 up to +6). I don't think it's the camera's fault, the lens has so many ranges and subject distances that one value will never be enough.<br /><br />I spent another day shooting, mostly birds, and got some shots I'm very happy with. Success rate is still very high, and mistakes have always been my fault. For example I got some motion blur due to not using a high enough ISO setting (and therefore slower shutter speed) a few times on an egret (photos attached). I went up to 5,000 ISO yesterday and used Lightroom for noise reduction, which I was happy with. This was in bright sunlight, but handheld at long range on subjects in motion so I needed fast shutter speeds. I attached more photos here, with 100% crops as well (although Amazon may shrink those a bit, I'm not sure). More mistakes on my part, I forgot to switch the camera to AF-S for a squirrel and a turtle, both of which weren't moving, and didn't need AF-C / 153. However the pictures came out great anyway.<br /><br />UPDATE: 5/8/2016<br />Took the camera to a farm animal event nearby today for more practice. Still a very good success ratio. I noticed something weird with Snapbridge. After connecting and putting my phone in my pocket, maybe 10 minutes later I would check and it would show no connection, and the camera would say awaiting connection. I would reconnect and put the phone back in my pocket, and 10 minutes later it would seem to be disconnected. I got annoyed and figured geotagging would be lost for many images, but upon importing, all geotagging was there. Not sure what the deal is but I was glad to not lose geotagging.<br /><br />I also made use of the bundled 16-80mm lens paired with a Canon 500D close-up lens today (using a 77mm - 72mm adapter). Everything worked perfectly fine, and I'm happy with the lens.<br /><br />As always, I believe any issues with the pictures are on my end. For example a decent close-up of a fly, using manual focus, was focused on his lower body instead of his eyes. Hard to tell when looking through the viewfinder, I should have taken some test shots and then reviewed them at 100% in the LCD and re-adjusted. All close-ups were taken at f/8, but I should have tried for a better depth of field at maybe f/22 or something.<br /><br />Adding more sample pics, my apologies if you're grossed out by bugs!","Got camera yesterday 4/25/16; nice compliment with my Nikon 600 F4; pics are sharp, focus fast, and this is the camera Nikon should hit the ball out of the park with for wildlife, nature and sports. Dynamic range and iso are very good as well.<br />Focus is quick, and shutter sound is quieter than I thought-<br />Love it!<br />Kevin","As usual my background so you can calibrate what your read.<br />A long time Nikon user, since 70s, currently using a D810, D600 and D7100 to be replaced by the new D500.  I shoot Wildlife both in the wild  and in the streets.<br /><br />Now about this Camera.  I will divide it to 3 parts.  Image quality, Usability and software/wireless connectivity.<br />From the quick few days, I can tell you that It is better than D7100,  I skipped the D7200 since the Rumor was that this was coming.<br />I tested the D500 against D7100 for ISO and general IQ performance.  I would say If you are getting this camera to get improved IQ over D7100 or D7200 then you are not going to be that happy.  You will not get $1000 better IQ from D500.  This Camera is not about the IQ/sensor but it is all about usability, handling and build quality.<br /><br />This Camera is a Handling beast.  It is all about handling and usability not about ISO or IQ.  With 10 FPS, Huge Buffer and an AF system that is much better than D810.  If you had a D700/D800/D810 this camera is similar in layout and but Light years a head in ergonomics and Handling. I hold judgement on Build quality being better than D700/D800/D810.<br />It is lighter and feels like it is smaller than D810.  All the changes are for the better. I thought the grip on D810 was great. But now, I know how much better it could have been.  The Joystick is a joy to use and if you are a back button AF-on user then you will be in heaven.  We get D5 class treatment here.  The Joystick not only moves the AF point around and is much more comfortable to use but it also can activate the AF with a press just like the AF-on button.  Why is that a good thing? Well because you can assign different AF mode to it.  By assigning different AF mode to each button you can go back and forth between 2 different  modes by just picking the button that activates the mode you want.  So If you do Birds in flight and use Group AF or Auto Area AF using your AF-on button.  But like to use single point AF when the birds land to get  sharp eyes. All you have to do is to assign single point AF to the Joystick push button and use it.  No more 2 handed Camera juggling with long lenses to change the AF mode.  There is several improvements like this that has been added.<br /><br />The Articulating display is another welcome addition.  The relocation of the ISO button is great but it seems to me that they have removed the Easy ISO capability (ability to use one of the command wheels to change ISO quickly).  Assuming that since now we can change ISO with one hand you don't need it but why remove it.  It is a mystery to me perhaps above my pay grade.  Fortunately they kept the Easy Exposure Comp capability.<br />The play back of images is so fast that you can take a burst of a 100 or so images and then play them back like a movie by holding the direction button.  Silly to do but fun.<br /><br />All in all, this is one hell of camera and great value at this price.  As I said buy this camera only if you need the handling, usability and build quality.<br />since after all this is a crop sensor body and IQ will never be better than a full sensor body of the same era.<br /><br />Now about the Software and Wireless.  It is there and not very impressive ... enough said.<br />Snap-bridge is not available for iPhone, but fortunately we had an Android phone in the family to use to test it.  Surprisingly it is stable and works. But the APP is lame and will do very little tethering functions.  Otherwise if you are using your D500 to take a snap of your dinner and post it to the face book you are in luck.  Other than that I am sure Nikon has plans but knowing their history with software I am sure it will be discontinued and replace by something else soon.  eh...<br /><br />Now an odd thing.  The first 2 batteries drained quickly.  I was expecting the first one since Nikon uses a builtin battery for internal clock and usually it gets it's charge from your battery the first time you use the camera.  But this thing kept draining the batteries.  So a bit of digging showed that all the wireless capabilities are on.  WiFi, BT, NF etc.  There is a Airplane mode but it is set to off by default. Why? Don't know.  Perhaps again above my pay grade. I turned all that junk off and it seems all is well.  But last time I thought all was well I ended up sending my D800 back to Nikon after 3 weeks of getting it.  I am hopeful for both our's and Nikon's sake.<br /><br />Hope this help some of you like me who were waiting for a D810 with Crop sensor for wildlife and sports shooting and were willing to pay the same price as a D810, as I was.  We got all we wanted and then some for 1/3 less than what we were expecting to pay.<br /><br />Nikon please bring back the Easy ISO... pretty please.<br />Mike<br /><br />Update 4-28-2016:<br />Good news, Bad news,<br />Good news the battery consumption issue is a none issue.  The AF is wicked good, The buffer is limitless for all practical purposes. 60+ shots of large Raw+JPEGs high quality using Sony XQD G cards.  We will be going broke buying hard drives. The AF and the buffer alone is worth the extra $1000 for anyone who needs them.<br /><br />The bad news, I found out during the battery consumption testing that none of the after market batteries will work with this camera.  Do not buy after market batteries with this camera. I tried 3 different brands of high quality batteries that I have been using with my D810/D600/D7100 and all had worked like a charm, but none of them works with D500 at all."]},{"name":"Canon EOS-1D X Mark II","amazon_reviews":["As an event and sports photographer, this tools just works for me.  Having owned and used every 1D since the 1D Mark II professionally, the biggest leap in the series was going from the Mark IV to the 1DX.  The 1DX II is more of an incremental improvement over the 1DX where the 1DX was a huge improvement over the 1D Mark IV.

As with all other improvements in the 1D fps, it gets harder and harder to shoot a single frame when high high frame rate mode. Being able shoot single frames when in high frame rate mode is important to me, so I tend to only use 14fps when I think I really need it to capture the action I'm shooting.

I have notice that the need for post processing has gone way down! Lots of good features. I haven't used it enough yet but so far so good. The battery seems to hold up well.","I was a little hesitating to buy this camera after owning the 5dsr for about a year. The reason I went with the 1dx2 because the 5dsr can't keep up with my 2.5 and 5 y.o. kids - too many missed shots, even with fast AF lenses (200 f/2, 300 f/2.8 II, 70-200 f/2.8 II), plus the 50Mpx resolution is also not very forgiving. The 1dx2 is an outstanding machine for what I need, the AF is incredibly fast and accurate, I'm getting so many keepers now - makes \"the best shot\" selection in PP much harder :) Love the AF point linked metering and multi-point metering options, IMHO Canon should be less greedy and put those features into the 5d series as well. I also find the slightly better distribution of the AF points helpful, less need for the \"focus and recompose\" technique. The ISO is very usable up to 6400-8000 range, 400 is super clean (to my taste of course - yours can be different), 25600 is a colorful mess. On the 5dsr I would never go over 3200 though. The DR improvement at ISO 100 is visible and usable.<br />And now back to my original concern - 20Mpx seems to be enough. Theoretically if you downsample a noisy 50Mpx to 20Mpx the noise levels will be close, but the colors are much duller. With noise reduction applied to a 50 mpx the resolution drops significantly too. 20Mpx is slightly bigger than a resolution of a 5k screen. No problem to print on a 19\"x13\" neither. So it's quite sufficient. The decisive factor for this camera is a number of in-focus shots - it's much better to get 90% 20Mpx in-focus than 90% 50Mpx out-of-focus. The 5dsr is still a king for the still life and studio.<br />My opinion overall - one of the best FF action / all-arounder cameras available now.<br /><br />Edit. I'm not a video shooter, but after trying the 1dx2 @ 4k DCI / 60p I was blown away. Before I tried occasionally to shoot 4k on my A7r2 and it was nice, but far from impressive - like shoot and forget, same as you do on a cell phone. The 1dx2 is a totally different experience. The DPAF is amazing - fast and accurate, the sharpness, video smoothness (due to 60 fps), colors - everything is outstanding. I read online some folks complain about MJPEG @ 4k, but I actually really like it. The quality is top notch, no banding at all compared to h.264 or HVEC. In spite of LOG is not directly available, you can get very similar results by using EOSHD's LOG picture profile. My only wish now is Canon should offer more quality IS STM lenses to work with (DP)AF - the USM lenses are noisy in AF mode, even with a shotgun-type mic.","It's a wonderful gear","Having shot frequently with the original 1DX over several years and owning a 5D Mk III and 5DSR, Canon has really built yet another amazing flagship in the 1DX MkII (1DX2).<br />Certainly this is not a camera for everyone, nor is it intended to be. This is built for the dedicated professional market and avid enthusiast whose style shooting demands the highest possible speed, performance, reliability, and durability available on the market today.<br />If you're a wedding or portrait professional, the brand new 5D Mk IV (or the 5D Mk III at a great discount now) is probably a much better option for you with the extra resolution, quieter shutter, and more compact (yet still very rugged) body.<br />If you shoots sports, fast paced photojournalism, or work in extreme conditions regularly, the 1DX2 is your professional tool.<br /><br />STILLS:<br />I've thus far been extremely impressed with the additional exposure latitude I have in post production over the original 1DX.  A lot has been over dynamic range in recent years, but typically and extra 1-2 stops isn't going to save an image that often.  Even with the extra latitude to pull up shadows more cleanly in post, it's still incumbent upon the photographer to expose the image correctly from the start. Even prior to Canon moving their fabrication process to build the ADC right onto the sensor die itself, I can only recall perhaps a small handful of images where 1-2 extra stops could have saved an image. While it's great to have, it's certainly not the most critical element in most professional's world.<br /><br />The image of the 1DX2 is excellent. In terms of resolution,it's pretty much right on par with my 5D3. Unless you're really pixel peeping, the different between the 22MP of the 5D3 and the 20MP of the DX2 is non-existent in the real world.  Again, if you need more resolve, get a 5D4 or a 5DSR to go along with this.  I'll use my 5DSR when I shoot critical portrait work anyway.<br /><br />The Auto Focus is very, very fast and even more accurate than the 1DX. PLEASE NOTE: You have to LEARN how to operate it though.  There's already some reviews out there lamenting that it doesn't always focus 100% of the time and it doesn't focus on what you want, etc...  There are several menu settings you can dial in to custom tailor the SERVO AF to meet the requirements of the shot, but you have to learn how to use them. The AF settings you use work great with Situation A, but if you don't change them for Situation B, you'll miss shots.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br />I also bought this to expand more into doing light video work. The 4K images Canon produces are just exquisite. The cinematic look and color science of Canon is really only rivaled by the high end makers like ARRI and RED. The 4K 60p Slo-Mo looks beautiful. The 1080p HD is also very nice. The 1080p Slo-Mo (120fps) looks great if you shoot correctly but be advised that the slo-mo at 120fps is pre-baked in the camera. Having touchscreen DPAF Servo while actively shooting video, however, is just a absolute joy only Canon can offer.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The only real cons for this camera come in the video department. Canon pioneered DSLR Video in  the 5D2 and it's very, very frustrating to see them seemingly just abdicating that crown. The 1DX2 also effectively replaced the 1DC, yet we have NO C-Log Gamma and NO 4k output via HDMI.  You can't even output the 1080p 120fps via HDMI.  As Canon has touted the video capability in this camera, I find it wholly inexcusable to deliberately withhold so basic a feature that is critical to the more serious crowd who would want to use this camera as a b-cam compliment to a larger body like a C300 II.  DSLRs that shoot 4k for a fraction of this price all send 4K out.  Canon believes they are \"protecting\" their Cinema EOS line, but I think they are doing more harm to it than good with this thinking. That said, the recording it produces internally to CF and CFast cards is excellent, although recording externally makes workflow nicer with ProRes and much larger (and cheaper) SSD<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent machine that is exceptionally well built for its core audience. Highly recommended.","Canon's 1DX Mark II is a tank of a camera.  If you've never shot with a 1 series body before then you are in for a bit of a surprise.  It is big, heavy and if you throw it at somebody you have a good chance of knocking them out (not that I'd recommend doing that with a $6000 piece of gear).<br /><br />The 1DX2 is Canon's new flagship camera aimed squarely at sports and photo journalists although with the enhancements introduced in this body (especially the sensor) it is what I would consider a good (albeit very expensive) all-rounder.<br /><br />Most people interested in this camera will already know the specs but for those that don't here is the highlights :-<br />20.2MP full frame (36mmx24mm) CMOS sensor<br />14 frames/sec (16 in live view)<br />Dual Digic 6+ image processors<br />4K 60fps video (allowing for 8MP still grabs)<br />61 point (41 cross type) autofocus system supporting f8 across all points and 24% more coverage than previously<br />AI Servo III+ predictive autofocus<br />CF and CFAST 2.0 card slots<br />100-51,200 ISO (50-409,600 expanded)<br />360,000 pixel RGB+IR metering sensor<br />Built in GPS<br />On-Chip ADC converter<br />1.62 million dot touch LCD panel<br />USB 3.0<br />On-Chip Dual Pixel phase detection for live view<br />LP-E19 battery (backward compatible with LP-E4N from original 1DX)<br /><br />As you can see there are a number of enhancements over the original 1DX.  A slight bump in the megapixels from 18 to 20 but that doesn't tell the whole story about the new sensor.  Canon have increased the horizontal and vertical spread of the autofocus system across the sensor.  Added to this all 61 autofocus points are selectable and support autofocus up to f8.  This allows you to still have autofocus across the sensor even if you have an extender attached to your lens (rather than just having the center point autofocus).  On top of this Canon have added dual pixel phase detection to the sensor and the sensor now has onboard ADC (which is significant).  Canon's dual pixel autofocus system is widely considered the best in the business for video work and when shooting live view. It is extremely fast and accurate (thanks also to the 360K RBG+IR metering sensor which is housed in the not insignificant bump on the top of the camera).  The on sensor ADC greatly enhances noise reduction (less length for the signal to travel) which in turn vastly increases the available dynamic range, especially at lower ISO settings.  You can easily shoot this camera at ISO 12,800 with very good results and I've even taken it up to 25,600 and the results are still acceptable.  Above that however and it gets grainy fast. Compared to the original 1DX, the sensor is vastly better and in itself is worthy of the upgrade.<br /><br />For whatever reason Canon have decided to put two different card slots into the 1DX2.  A compact flash slot (which Canon recommends using UDMA 7 cards) and a new CFast 2.0 slot.  I'm sure the CF slot is there to appease those who have a spent a lot of money previously on CF cards although the difference between CF and the new CFast cards is night and day.  Personally I would have preferred Canon to have just bitten the bullet and put in dual CFast slots. As a comparison in the speed of the two slots, if you shoot at the full 14fps using RAW files, you will get roughly 85 shots on the CF card before the camera has to pause to clear its buffer.  Shooting RAW to the CFAST card is essentially unlimited (I got bored holding the camera after a full minute of shooting, over 850 images and it still showed no sign of slowing down).  If you shoot RAW + JPG then it really depends on the speed of your CFAST card as to how many shots you will get.  I have compared two cards, one with a 160Mb write speed (about the slowest CFAST card you can get) and one with a 240Mb write speed (the Sandisk card that came with the camera).  With the slower of the two I can hit Canon's published minimum of 170 shots before the camera starts slowing down (it doesn't completely stop but will slow from 14fps to around 5fps).  With the Sandisk card I'm getting over 250 shots (roughly 18 full seconds of continuous high speed shooting).  The increased buffer on the 1DX2 combined with the increased speed offered by CFAST 2.0 cards allows for an unprecedented shooting capability.  There is of course a downside to CFAST 2.0 cards. They are expensive.  You are looking at around $700 for a single 256Gb CFAST 2.0 card.  Why would you want a card of such high capacity?  Well two reasons.  Firstly you have the ability to shoot an insane amount of continuous burst stills from the camera but secondly are more importantly for some, if you want to shoot the full 29 minutes and 59 seconds of full 60fps 4K video, you use up virtually the whole 256Gb card.<br /><br />Whilst on the subject of video, the 1DX2 can shoot 4K video up to 60fps. To do so you have to use a CFast card and it does it by writing motion JPG files.  This is part of the reason why a 30 minute video will take up basically 256Gb of space.  Motion JPG isn't the best format when it comes to compressing but what it does allow you to do is extract any single frame you wish from the video and save it as a 8MP JPG file.  This effectively turns the 1DX2 from a 14fps medium-res camera into a 60fps lo-res camera.  When replaying the video you have the option to scroll through the video file frame by frame and extract the frame you wish.  This is very easy to do however you have to do it using the scroll wheel or thumb stick.  Even though the 1DX2 features a touch screen LCD, Canon only allows you to use this for focusing in live view.  You cannot change any of the settings after pressing \"Q\" or \"Menu\" buttons, you cannot scroll through videos or photographs by swiping.  You can't even pinch or double tap to zoom in/out of an image.  This leaves the touch screen fairly much crippled and is a huge missed opportunity.  Whether Canon decides to rectify this in a future firmware update is anybody's guess but I wouldn't hold my breath if this is something you are looking for.  The 1DX2 is the first Canon full frame sensor to employ dual-pixel autofocus (first introduced on the EOS 70D) and boy is it fast and accurate.  That in conjunction with its 360K metering and ITR (Intelligent Tracking and Recognition) system works excellently.  Unfortunately you do not have things like C-Log or Zebra striping which would have been really useful.<br /><br />The range of options and sheer amount of customization that the 1DX2 allows you is truly immense.  However it is slightly let down in that cannot you assign every function to every function key. For example, if you want to assign a function key to change from one shot to AI servo modes, you cannot assign that to the multi-function 1 button, only multi-function 2. I'm sure Canon has their reasons for this but I'm baffled by the choice.  If a function is assignable to a button then you should have the choice to assign it to any button you please.  Luckily however the depth of field preview button and the multi-function 2 buttons are interchangeable.  Whatever you assign to one, you can assign to the other.  Chances are these are the two buttons that people will most likely change the functions of.  Another customization (or lack thereof) I found slightly annoyed with is that you cannot actually assign exposure compensation to the exposure compensation button whilst you are in manual mode.  Exposure compensation can only be assigned to the SET button.<br /><br />For those of you who read through the spec sheets, one thing you might be slightly taken aback by is the number of shots figure, especially considering this has an uprated LP-E19 battery. The CIPA rating for viewfinder shooting is only 1210 shots and using live view that figure goes down to only 1020 shots.  I can confirm that you can take these figures with a pinch of salt.  Just this weekend I shot over 4500 images on two different shoots using the same battery and still had the battery indicator was showing I had a fair amount of charge left.  I would say conservatively you can expect around 4000 shots per battery charge.<br /><br />Connectivity wise you have a few options built into the body including gigabit Ethernet, USB 3.0 and HDMI out.  HDMI out however is restricted to 1080p 8 bit 4:2:2 video.  It will not output 4K video for some reason.  Although the camera does have built in GPS it does not have built in wifi.  If you wish to have wifi you will need to shell out a further $800 for a wifi adapter which attaches to the side of the camera (and to be honest looks very ugly).  I've heard people speculate that they couldn't integrate wifi into the body due to the all magnesium alloy frame and weatherproofing but Canon have managed to do it in the upcoming 5D4 so I don't buy this theory.<br /><br />Autofocus as you would expect on the flagship camera from Canon is immediate.  You have the options of single point, expanded plus/cross, expanded 9 point, zone, large zone and full AF array.  All the focus points are now available down to f8 with 41 of the 61 AF points being cross type. Canon has listened to its customers and brought back the red focusing points in the viewfinder making it much easier to see exactly where your focus lies under all lighting conditions. As you would expect, there are a myriad of options available to you in and around focusing in the menu's including 6 built in custom cases ranging from subjects that might accelerate or decelerate quickly on a single plane (e.g. Formula 1 or Indy racing cars) to subjects that are essentially just erratic in nature (e.g. football players).  You can use the defaults the camera comes with (which I've found to be more than adequate) or if you wish you can customize these lending different weights to the likes of tracking sensitivity or whether the camera should give priority to focus or shutter release.  As I mentioned above, the range of options available to you is truly outstanding.<br /><br />There is so much to talk about with this camera and things I haven't even touched on yet like the inclusion of diffraction correction. However this review would end up being a book if I went into every feature and enhancement the 1DX2 offers.<br /><br />So overall should you get one?  I think for the most part people will already know if they need this camera or not. This is truly a pro camera (no there isn't an automatic shooting mode) and given the price it is way out of the range of the casual shooter or even the enthusiastic amateur.  In my opinion the enhancements that the 1DX2 brings especially with the new sensor are worthy of the upgrade in itself, never mind the increase in frames per second shooting.  Is the 1DX2 perfect?  No it is not.  I would have liked to have seen an increase in the amount of functionality present with the touchscreen (a sorely missed opportunity from Canon.  Just take a look at what they already have done with the 70D or 80D touchscreen functionality.  If you don't want it, simply have a menu function that turns it off) etc. Don't get me wrong however, this camera deserves to called the flagship of the Canon line.  It is a truly wonderful camera system.  I wish I could give a 4.5 star rating.  It is not a perfect 5 but is certainly worthy of more than a 4.<br /><br />Final Verdict.<br />4.5 stars.","i have had a 5d mark II before this. this camera is amazing. had problems with the cast card , it quit after a couple of weeks. contacted sandisk and they replaced it.","Awesome camera, have been using Canon since 1D 2 this is by far the best.  Better DR and all around better pic quality.  Be sure to update firmware to cure Cfast problems.","Bad:<br />Obsolete mJPEG codec is certainly not pro solution (as it should be in pro body)... High bitrate codec producing enormous amount of data which not intended to improve the quality, but rather for reducing processors load and potential overheating issue. Even Canon uses AVC codec in Cinema line products. BTW. Promotional Sandisk cfast cards, distributed by Canon, appeared to be faulty. Instead of replacing them, Canon decided to patch the defective cards by camera firmware upgrade. Cards still remain faulty (!) Also two different card slots, where is not possible to backup 4K@60p video is not sensible solution.<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed with a weak battery: about 1600 pictures on charge, is less than half in similar Nikon camera.<br /><br />Advertised touch screen is limited to serve only one function: selecting focus points in Live View.<br />With minor effort from manufacturer it could be used for Quick Menu navigation or for viewing and magnifying images in review mode (like in competitor product).<br /><br />Autofocus in low-light environment is not as effective as advertised :(<br />Also tracking is not as good as in competitor products. Automatic point selection is rather useless.<br /><br />Lack of efficient codec and flat logarithmic video profiles (like in 1DC).<br /><br />Good:<br />I can state: this is the best sensor produced by Canon up to date. Dynamic range has been improved. High ISO, not really.<br />Really snappy operation. Great AI Servo focusing even with older/darker lenses. All packed in pretty robust magnesium cast.<br /><br />Some good looking video spec (on paper), but don't be fooled, those are not pro solutions (like those present in Cinema EOS series).","Just recived 3 days before upgraded 5D mark iii I test camera its outstanding  over all<br />i)fast auto focus for sports<br />Ii) 4 k video professional<br />Iii)lcd display so clear view<br />iv)image quality sharp depends on  suitation on low light environment ,<br />V)if you used expansive lens better result<br />Vi)couple images test no edit raw check it out<br />Vii)6k spending before follow reviews","an incredible camera with every feature you can imagine. ready to shoot in every situation.<br />extremely fast focusing, iso noise none existing up to 12800, great colors.","It's what you expect it to be - fast frame rate, fast focus, big and professional. Everything you need is a button away, except of course WiFi which is annoying to have totally lacking in a $6k purchase. If I wasn't invested in Canon glass...but anyways. If you're considering this purchase, stop. You either already know that you need the video update and frame rate update, or you don't.","When speed counts, there is no better camera body. It's faster than me. One of the unexpected features is its auto focus when in video mode. No more need to measure, plan and pull focus while shooting. Everything is automatic, or selectable with the touch screen. Simply brilliant.","Bought this camera a week ago and let me tell you, it's worth every penny. You will not get super high-resolution photos, but what you will get is a very very accurate auto focusing system. I'm jumping from the Canon 5D Mark III, and boy do I feel the difference.<br /><br />Holding this thing is fantastic. I feel like I'm the best photographer in the world. The way it focuses with my 70-200mm is amazing. Blistering fast shutter and so addicting to shoot with.<br /><br />The shutter is a bit loud in silent mode, but who cares, this is the hardcore of the hardcore...you gotta put your big boy panties on.<br /><br />For me, this is everything that I can ask for in a camera. Amazing quality and dynamic range. Any L glass will really shine with this camera.<br /><br />Highly recommend this camera to a working photographer.","Amazing camera , love everything except click noise","Phenomenal camera with incredible capabilities. This thing does not disappoint and I've yet to find a con!! Worth the money - although, I can say if the 5d Mark IV was announced, or on the horizon, I'm not sure I would have spent the 6k on this baby! But since it's not, and I was ready for an upgrade, here I am. That being said - I'm in love with it and blown away by all it's features.","Absolutely love this camera. Rugged and reliable, the upgrade from my 1dmkii is unbelievable.","I've had mine for about a week. I shoot amateur Mixed Martial Arts, a fast paced sport that happens in bad lighting. For the past 5 years, I have been shooting with the Canon 1dMkIV, which has been a great camera for the purpose. I didn't move to the 1Dx classic, because it just wasn't a big enough step, not with a camera in hand that worked well. The MkII was a bigger step, and I took it.<br /><br /> I am not going to repeat all the stats and figures. Those are great and they are all over the internet. I shot an event saturday night, and I have some images to share, if this site shows them accurately.  The autofocus is accurate and fast, the color is great, and it works like a charm in the dark, through a chain link fence.<br /><br /> These images were shot at ISO 5,000-8,000, 1/500th, f3.2 or f3.5  processed in lightroom, pretty much the same way I always process fight images. There is some noise reduction, but it's not terribly strong. I wasn't making lab test images, these are real production images. This is what a flagship camera does, how it is really used.<br /><br />update: Time has passed, I am still shooting fights with my markII, it's still a fantastic camera. The controls are basically the same as the earlier flagship canon I own, but there are differences. The menus are different and as with any camera, it takes time to learn to get the most out of it. I'm getting there. I have added some new fight images as well as some from a raptor photoshoot.","I bought this camera for 2 weeks and am very satisfied.<br /><br />I am 1dx user for 2 years and mark ii makes a great improvement in video recording.","In use about a week at this point and I am most impressed with it and the photographs I have taken with it. I will be adding to this review as I continue to explore the many possibilities this camera provides.<br /><br />Update after 30,000 images. This is my first camera with a 1 in front of it, but I have a 7D ll, a 5Dlll, and this one and I have shot a fair number of equestrian events using all three of them. I generally shoot with a 300mm prime, or a 70-200 2.8 ll. I get eyelash counting portraits of riders on horses coming over a jump. That is how fast and accurate the autofocus is. This camera rarely misses focus, and for all I know, the camera never does, I do. I am very pleased with these results, and any photo I take will be a candidate for a keeper. Given the number of shots per second, picking a good one is a snap.<br /><br />I am never going to buy another camera without a 1 as the first digit as this thing makes me look good. I have recently added a 200 mm 2.0 L to my arsenal to make even better use of this camera. Absolutely no problems have come to light.","[[VIDEOID:e5eeb1baa2fb7c5a1e4b5dd94b92d66f]] I'm upgrading from a 5D MK III and I'm already addicted to the touch screen video AF - I don't know how I ever lived without it. You can also touch to focus using live view in photos, great for shooting overhead. The screen is also SUPER bright, much improved so you can actually see your images pretty well when out in the sun. I love that it has line in for audio too, a huge improvement over the crappy, crappy, embarrassingly crappy staticky mic level audio using the \"auto\" volume setting. These are just a few of the things that have stood out to me - you can read all the great promo copy and specs, but these are some of the things that have made a big difference for me in the first few days of use. Of course the ISO range is incredible, I've been able to shoot at 2500 ISO and use it like 800, and 20,000 and use it like 2500 on the 5D. It's heavy and big if you're used to the smaller bodies! But who cares. The battery is also pretty incredible compared to the smaller ones. Using the video AF will take some practice as it tracks what's moving in the foreground and that's not always what you want, so I've grown more vigilant about tapping semi-continuously when subjects are moving to keep the focus where I want. But if you're a skeptic about video AF with a DSLR (I was!), it's incredible. Fast, smooth and silent. And of course the still photography and the blazing 14 fps are out of this world.","Overall an excellent improvement on the 1DX.  Features that I find most useful are:<br /><br />1) All 61 focus points (21 X-type) can focus at f8 when one uses series III teleconverters on specific L-lenses.<br />2) Increase spread in AF points across the frame to aid in composition<br />3) Improved dynamic range below ISO 1600 and improved shadow noise.  Below ISO 3200 there is virtually no noise and noise is well controlled up to ISO 12800.<br />4) AF sensors in red rather than black so they are easier to see<br />5) Improved buffer with 170 RAW files (from Canon) although I saw a video with Andy Rouse where he got over 200 RAW files before the buffer slowed down.  WOW!!<br />6) DPAF for quick focusing on sensor (useful for stills and movies) in live view mode<br />7) Ability to view a level in the viewfinder at all times which is very useful for handheld photography.<br />8) Better focus tracking ability<br />9) 1.5% spot metering","I've had it for about 8 hours so far today.  If you already have a 1D X it is surprisingly much of the same.  The transition from 1D iii to 1D iv and 1D iv to 1D X were truly monumental upgrades especially in terms of polish, but here I feel like the 1DX had everything right and this is just a minor tweak.<br /><br />But it's more than a tweak.  I don't own a CFAST card yet, but when I do, I'm certain this camera is going to blow my old 1DX out of the water when it comes to rapid fire sports photography.  The raw files appear to be about twice as big as the raws from my 1D X.  Shooting at the highest iso settings still renders garbage, but its higher iso than the 1D X and so far all the lower iso stuff seems better (but I've only really investigated the highest iso setting to see what it can do).<br /><br />The battery is new, but the old batteries go into the new body and seem to work just fine.  I'm really sad it doesn't have two CF slots.  I really liked having two CF slots on the 1D X.  Eventually I'm sure I'll be sad it doesn't have dual CFAST slots...  I still miss the SD slot of the 1D iv, not because I admit to owning any of those stupid little cards, but because other people did, and I could pop their card into my 1D iv and take their picture for them.<br /><br />The bottom line, of course, is do you really need a $6k full frame camera?  The test is simple: if you have a lens that costs more than the camera, then you need the camera.  Deep down, that $6k is buying you mostly speed and durability.  Fast autofocus, fast shutter clicks, fast card writing.  If I go out and take a thousand pictures of a rugby game I'll come home expecting just about a thousand of those pictures to be perfectly in focus no matter what was happening on the field.<br /><br />Update: I'm closing in on having it an entire day now.<br /><br />The menus still have a couple of items that are just baffling to me.  The location of settable min/max ISO for instance.  Mirror lock up still doesn't have a button, but it is easier to find than when it used to be hidden in a custom function.<br /><br />The polish is looking a little more polished to me.  The information you get from pressing the \"info\" key in particular seems more polished to me.<br /><br />Another Update:  I'm starting to think that this new camera does have a lot more polish to it than I thought it just.  It's just hidden away more.  For instance, my 1D X had a level built in.  It was accessed via the LCD on back.  I went to use the level today, and this new camera has a four access LCD level indicator hidden inside the viewfinder.  It's very nice.<br /><br />I like how quiet and crisp the shutter sounds compared to the older model.  I have yet to try it on full auto though.<br /><br />So, a few days into owership, I'm even happier with it than I was when I first got it."]},{"name":"Fujifilm X-T2","amazon_reviews":["Great camera!  I am moving from Nikon D750 and D500 to this camera.  I needed something lighter to travel with and this is going to work. I'm not pixel psychoanalyzer, but it is light, with fast focus and is doing everything I need it to in terms of nature photography.  I also do a lot of sports photography and this is ALMOST everything I need.  Outside sports, works great, but the only feature it does NOT have is \"flicker reduction\" for indoor sports work.  The D500 has it and it is wonderful for reducing the orange/red that normally goes across pictures at fast shutter speeds under most gym lights.  I think the D5 and D500 are the only cameras that have flicker reduction for photos and if Fuji could add it to the firmware I would be thrilled.  I have sold my D750 and the lenses I used for landscape work but have to keep the D500 and a few lenses so I can continue to do indoor sports work and not lose so many good pics because of the orange/red that shows up in so many frames.","I love this camera, I shoot all time time, landscapes and portraits.  With adapters there are so many interesting lenses to use.  I use all sorts of classic and vintage lenses on it, with focus peaking, manual focus is easier than on the original camera those lenses were made for.  The tilting screen helps me more than I ever thought it would. Fuji struck gold with this one.","I did not buy mine from Amazon but I would like to share my thoughts.  I sold off my Canon 5D Mark III and all of my L glass to get this little beauty.  I had the X-T1 before it and it was an incredible little camera but this is a whole new level, especially with the massive updates in the last firmware release.  Menus?  What menus?  All of your settings are right there at your fingertips, a revelation for those of us who want complete control over our camera settings.  It now supports 9 exposure AEB with up to 3-stop spacing between exposures.  It now supports copyright info in the EXIF data.  The ISO invariance means you can pull blacks up and not have chroma noise, unlike the Canon.  The lenses complement this system so perfectly...the 16-55 f/2.8 lens lives on this body.  High speed continuous autofocus tracking is amazing.  The manual focus is augmented by peaking and by a very handy hyperfocal distance indicator on the EVF.  The EVF view is huge and wonderful and I can still compose perfectly with a 10-stop ND filter in place.  Great refresh rate and very short blackout time.  I import my RAW files through Lightroom and have never had an issue.  The film simulation modes give very clean JPGs but I still prefer to shoot RAW and post-process.  I miss NOTHING about the Canon 5D Mark III and if I never have to look through another floppy-mirrored camera's OVF I'll be just fine with that.  The only downsides are that the included neckstrap sucks (but don't they all) and that battery life is pretty awful.  But you can recharge through USB so just bring a nice Anker backup battery!","GREAT","Best camera I have ever had.

Autofocus is extremely fast and the out of camera images are still top notch. Film simulation modes are going to be something I truly miss because unfortunately I am going to return it since I am doing a lot more video now. The 4K video it produces is great, but I got spoiled using an articulating touch screen which this does not have. I also wish they would update their menu system. Little things like an option to start at the same point in the menu you left off is a really nice feature other cameras have and saving your custom settings does not save everything it should. In camera stabilization would have been nice, but I don't believe the X-system can ever go to it because of the mount design.<br /><br />Because of the change in my style I will end up with the GH5 but I am sure I will miss the image quality Fuji produces.","I love this camera. I used to own a D90 back in the day but then stopped my photography for a while and just got back into it. I am an amature and just do it for fun but this is a great camera with amazing quality and great for travel. I love the WiFi because you can get your pictures on you phone right away and post it on social media. The best thing about this is the size. It is so small that it is easy to take around. Anyways, there are tons of great reviews, and this camera totally deserves it! Plain amazing!","Best mirrorless camera on the market. Better than any DSLR in the same price range and some above!!!","This is a great camera, however, I only can give three stars. While ergonomic and controls are great, the camera is lacking behind competition. Me and other former users of XT-1 were hoping that XT-2 will be so much more than XT-1. For the price I would expect the camera to be at par or superior  the competition not only in sharpness but in other fields as well. What am I talking about? As a photographer I would like to be able to do more, or to have options to do more. There is no IBIS we all were hoping for. There is no official good viable official option for off camera HSS (Two $500 flashes is not a good option) No touch screen in 2016! Camera only can do three exposures bracketing at the time.  Good sharpness, control and ergonomics are simply not enough for the camera to be competitive nowadays. Over the years different people/reviewers on internet said that FUJI listens to their customers. Does it?","I had ordered and was using a Fuji XPro2 for about two months when the XT2 reviews, all of them unequivocally superb, got to me.  I realized that the Pro2 was in many ways the same as the T2 but the additional features the T2 provides move it without question above and beyond those of the Pro2.  I swapped the Pro2 for the T2.  It cost me some money in the exchange, but the dealer I usually buy from (when I'm not ordering from Amazon) happened to have one graphite T2 left, so I snapped it up.  The colors produced by this camera are fantastic, and Fuji glass is incredibly sharp and crisp at all apertures and stays that way right out to the edges.  FNukji glass is easily the equal to Nikon's pro level lenses (such as the 24-70 and 70-200 f2.8s), and, of course, much lighter and smaller. I had been shooting a Nikon D750, which is a beautiful camera.  I still have it but I'll be shooting the Fuji the vast majority of the time now.  It's perfect for street work and will be ideal on travel, nothing at all like hauling around the D750 with a couple lenses for 5-7 hours.  And as I had the XPro2 first, I already had the 18-55 f4 and the 50-140 2.8.  The menus on the Fuji line are different from Sony and Nikon and take some getting used to.  But I had bought the XPro2 book of tips from Amazon and the differences between it and the T2 turn out to be very minor.  This camera is a treasure and as long as you know a little about photography and subscribe to the theory that the photographer behind the device is the key to making good pictures, you won't be able to do better for the money.  There is a reason these cameras are all backordered at the online outlets.","I just got it and so far its amazing. Still learning all the capabilities but it is lightweight and was all the functions I was looking for in a camera!","There is no doubt how great of a camera this is. Paired with the 56mm You don't even miss full frame. Sold my D750 to get the X-T2 knowing full well about the issue with the Fuji X Raw files and Lightroom. Enough was enough, the image quality was appalling. I tried the recommended Raw editing apps but too slow compared to the Lightroom workflow. I don't have the time. I have now shipped my X-T2 back to Amazon and will be repurchasing a D750. I thought it was time to go mirrorless but you don't realize how already perfect something was until it's gone!","Great camera with excellent IQ even in Jpeg format! Google for more reviews!","I've only had a few days with the camera, but it seems to live up to the hype. The graphite color is a darker shade vs. silver Fuji lenses, and lighter than the x-pro2 graphite. Just an FYI. Also, the camera was sold by OneCall, awesome service, fast and responsive. OneCall is an authorized distributor of the Fuji X-series. It doesn't show up on the list of authorized dealers, because it's actually Huppins - which is on fuji's list of ADs.","This camera is amazing.  I have the XE1 and the XT2 has got all the aspects that were missing on the XE1.  I am glad I waited all these years for Fugifilm to come out with the XT2.  I just can't say enough about this camera.  I have the 27mm, 35 1.4, and the 18-55mm. I am trying to decide on another lens.  I know I want WR but I am unsure of the focal length.  This camera does have a learning curve and if you never had a Fugifilm mirrorless then I suggest you read the manual and get everything you can from YouTube.  Although I must say that the layout is very intuitive. I have only had this camera a couple of weeks and have yet to put it through its paces.  I look forward to really putting it to the test.<br />I recommend this XT2 to anyone who wants a top of the line mirrorless that is built like a tank, small enough to be easily handled and should last for years, not to mention the unbelievable selection of incredible lenses.  I do suggest that you purchase a fugifilm battery or two especially while learning the menu functions.  It does eat up power and an extra battery is essential.","Just have it, haven't test it much (mainly setting it), but a few things I can say now (will be updating as I further test it and use it on real work situations) :<br />- Autofocus much improved compared to X-T1, with the 50-140 at f/2.8 could take without hassle cars and motorbikes passing past me... tracking the as they approached and shooting in different distances... no problem whatsoever to track them.<br />- Better autofocus allows continuous focus mode to be usable, not as on the X-T1<br />- GREAT addition to settings to disable half shutter button to focus, now we have REAL BACK BUTTON FOCUS on fuji finally!!! can set a button to AF-ON (not sure yet the difference with AF-L vs AF-ON functionality), so now you can back button focus on the 3 focusing modes (Single, COntinuous and Manual focus! great!) and not only manual as on the X-T1 besides, continuous focusing set for AF-L and AF-C mode never really locked focus on X-T1<br /><br />BAD<br />- Removed the \"Silent Mode\" or latter the \"Flash and sound Off\", awful naming and icons but great and very useful to silent all sounds: system, focus, shutter and flash, for using on churches, museums and such... now you have to change about 4 different settings to have the same functionality and 4 more times to toggle everything back... really bad move backwards Fuji!!! why not thing of a better and less confusing naming \"Discreet mode\" for example and explain the in this mode all sounds and flash, focus assist light will be turned off and operate silently together with the shutter switched to electronic, until disabled the discreet mode. Easy! and no one gets confused trying to fire the flash setting \"flash and sound\" to ON.<br />The name generated confusion, not the feature per se, THE FEATURE IS AWESOME, AND NOT PRESENT ON DSLR and is a great advantage over a DSLR, so take advantage of it!… that's why Fuji smartly included it on the first place. So don't remove it because the naming was bad… just change the name! but please don't use a name used for other setting \"flash, noise, electronic, etc\" use a new word \"Discreet, Stealth, etc\". If in doubt why not give kaisen some love and run a poll for it's reinstatement and name?.<br />- My menu can't select all the options... for example Sound settings is grayed out (to make it a little faster the tedious process to turning off and turning on allllll the sounds settings)<br /><br />MISSING<br />- being able to control ISO with command dial wheels... an equivalent to T mode for shutter speeds. That would be very appealing to every on switching from DSLR<br />- being able to reverse direction of front/rear command dials to change shutter speed and ISO as to match Canon/Nikon... making easier to adjust for DSLR previous or simultaneous users. There is the option of change the direction of focus ring, why not the wheel command dials too?","An Excellent upgrade to my X-T1!  You can read all about the resolutions, etc on the web but the camera is just amazing. It feels so solid, and Fuji took care of some of the little niggles that existed with the X-T1.<br />It's lightweight, solid, water resistant, beautiful camera.","Best Overall Mirrorless Digital Camera !!!<br />Pros<br />- Best looking Mirrorless Camera<br />- Pro Quality<br />- Compact size (even smaller than Olympus E-M1 II and Panasonic GH5 which have smaller sensors)<br />- Superb focusing speed and overall operational speed<br />- Excellent Still and video (4K) quality<br />- Less expensive than Olympus E-M1 II and Panasonic GH5<br />- Superb small and high quality prime lenses<br /><br />CONS<br />- No In Body Image Stabilization","Sometimes I feel silly writing a review. This normally occurs when I want to review a product that already has so many other reviews previously posted, and/or that come to similar conclusions. This is one of those reviews, and on both counts. But I want to write this review, because the Fuji X-T2 is THAT good.<br /><br />I’m not a professional photographer in the strictest set of terms. I recently ran into a man in Paris who was shooting with a Hasselblad camera that he had purchased (body only) for seven thousand euros (about eight years ago; not including the lens). Of course, it’s not the CAMERA that makes him a professional: this is a freelancer who sells photos to newspapers and magazines across Europe, and if you spent time (which I did, some 30 minutes of it, or so) watching how he would size up a shot in his mind, take a long time to think about it, and then whip up the camera and take a shot almost without effort, you can tell you are looking at a professional. We had a nice talk and exchanged stories about cameras. With some Hasselblad backs selling for over 40,000 dollars, he still complimented my camera. What camera was it? A Fuji X-T2.<br /><br />I’m no professional, but I’ve been into photography for about 20 years. I’ve owned many many different cameras over that period, of all types, from diminutive little devices that fit into your front pocket, to DSLR’s that were so heavy you almost yearned for the end of a shoot. Most of them were advanced at the time, sporting one or more technological achievements never before present in a camera, and many of them immensely enjoyable to use. And many brands, too. Nikon. Canon. Sony. Fuji. And on and on.<br /><br />Let’s cut to the chase. The Fuji X-T2 is simply a flat-out amazing camera. It builds on all the advances of the X-T1, and, for the most part, very well, with improvements and tweaks that even people who loved the X-T1 wanted to see in the camera's next incarnation. It FEELS good to shoot with it. It produces REMARKABLE results, particularly when you are shooting with one of their succulent “XF” lenses (sorry, that's the word that comes to mind, and to any that have used the XF 23mm or the XF 56mm, you'll know what I mean). The Fuji X-T2 feels like the camera I’ve been waiting for all these years. It’s comfortable to hold. It’s fast. It’s highly customizable, yet will turn out fantastic shots in full auto mode. It opens you up to a series of Fuji lenses that are endlessly compared to Leica and Zeiss lenses at three times their price (or more). It’s made in Japan, and feels like it. (So are most of the \"XF\" lenses, by the way, with a couple of exceptions.)<br /><br />Why are the results of the X-T2 so good? It’s not because of its 24 mp rating. It’s because of the TYPE of sensor, the MANNER in which the sensor’s data output channel is handled by the camera’s processor, and because of the incredible visual characteristics of the “XF” line of Fujinon lenses. Put another way, it’s the marriage of the sensor, the characteristics of the lenses, and the way the sensor output is handled once the shot is taken that make the X-T2 what it is.<br /><br />You can read all about the details of the camera’s specifications nearly anywhere (and be careful, information overload is a real danger here), but I won’t do that here. What I WILL do is tell you that this is a magnificent camera that can take amazing photos. Is it a full frame or a medium-format camera? No. But for someone like me, that does not matter. What DOES matter is that I can take photos with this camera that were never before possible, and that routinely possess the “wow factor.\" And there is plenty of room to tinker with those photos later on--even if shooting in jpg-- because of the high megapixel sensor, if you choose to do that.<br /><br />The Fuji X-T2 is a “photographer’s camera” because it lets you do just what you want to do: take pictures the way you envision them. It lets you do so smoothly and quickly, and offers so many opportunities for manipulation that it would take far too long to list them here. This camera feels good in the hand. It oozes quality. Is it the “poor man’s Leica?” Maybe so. It’s so pleasant to shoot with and the results are so good—color, saturation, headroom, detail, sharpness, clarity—that I don’t need to worry about saving for a Leica. Yes, I understand I am comparing apples and oranges, and it truly is a subjective view that I’m providing, but it’s a view that is shared by nearly everyone who has used either a Fuji X-T1, X-T2, X-Pro, or X-Pro2. Asked another way: How many NEGATIVE reviews have you seen on any of these cameras by those that have owned or used them? There are a few out there, but so very, very few; that all by itself speaks volumes. And the X-T2 may very well be the best of them all.<br /><br />The fact that it is still relatively light and comfortably small (as compared to a typical DSLR) is just icing on the cake. It’s a camera that nearly anyone can use to take great photos. Give it to a novice on AUTO, slap the kit lens on it (either the 18-55mm or the 18-135mm kit lens, it doesn’t matter) and turn them loose and see what they capture. It’s remarkable to see. And then, if one starts to learn more about photography (aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.), let them interact with the camera’s customizable settings. It’s amazing.<br /><br />I love being able to easily adjust settings with mechanical knobs at the top of the camera, but I just as much love being able to set things to AUTO and let the camera figure things out for me, usually with good result. Quiet operation (even a completely silent electronic shutter, if I want it). Comfortable grip. A truly tremendous set of lenses to select from. Customizable buttons (six of them, actually). A viewfinder that makes you think you are using a glass prism, but also includes all the shooting data I on it. This is what photography is all about.<br /><br />I am aware I’ve not in this review cited any specifications: these are available anywhere. What this review is just simply another person’s response to using this camera over a period of months. I just finished a three-week shoot in Paris with it. It’s obvious this camera is made by a company that understands photography. And understands it well. Just as my acquaintance above with the Hasselblad camera complemented my X-T2—a camera that cost one-tenth as much, or less—Fujifilm is onto something here. If you are a photographer, you owe it to yourself to look into this camera and its entire line of lenses, because if you do not, you’re missing out on what is potentially one of the most amazing line of photographic equipment available for the non-rich. It’s not that the Fuji equipment is cheap, because it most certainly is not. But BY COMPARISON with its true competitors, it really is inexpensive. But all of that can be overlooked: just examine the shots you take with this camera and be amazed. Because that’s exactly what will happen.<br /><br />Note:<br />I've uploaded a few sample shots. As anyone knows, these have been reduced and shrinked so much for use here that they do not show the ACTUAL photos. What they do, however, is provide a general \"feel\" for what can be done with X-T2.","I love it. Might not be for you, but I love it","I come from using Nikon DSLRs, have good glass and love my Sony RX 100II as a carry around and also have carried the Canon G12 as a carry around.  I had never looked at Fuji before.  The Nikon gear is not a casual carry and the Sony served me well [and was an upgrade to the Canon]  on a trip to the UK, but couldn't perform like the Nikon gear.  I looked long and hard at the Sony Alpha and Alpha full frame bodies.  I didn't need another full frame system, but wanted an upgrade to the smaller Sony with more of the DSLR quality AND I wanted to go mirrorless.  The Sony bodies got good photo operation marks, but suffered by their lack of easy access to controls.  Their glass is an embarrassment unless you want to wade into the price range for a lens that costs more than a top of the line body. I did a lot of reading and became impressed with the X line of bodies and with the praise of their glass.  I didn't go with any of their highly rated prime lenses; doesn't fit how I shoot.  The kit zoom [18-55] got great marks for quality and I cannot dispute those claims.  It would be redundant to add to what other users have and are saying about the X-T2 except to say that I've taken some casual pictures that turned out very well and while I am still learning the various functions and menus, I am very comfortable with operating it.  OBTW, not having control dials [ISO, shutter speed, compensation, shooting mode, focus mode] on the Sony bodies was pretty much a deal breaker. The dials on this Fuji are perfect for my style of shooting and I like being able to charge the battery while in the camera. I could list other things I like about this camera, but I would just be repeating what others are saying.  I'll probably be getting the 55-200 before an upcoming trip out west.","First, let me preface this by saying this is not the camera I wanted.  I made the conversion to Fuji when the X-E2 was released in 2013.  Prior to that, I had shot most of the crop sensor bodies that Canon had.  Like many others, I fell in love with Fuji and the X-E2 in particular.  I gained a huge affinity for the smaller body in the rangefinder format.  The IQ and colors were wonderful.  The Fuji lenses and their commitment to firmware improvements are practically legendary.<br /><br />This last year, I watched as the X-Pro 2 was released.  I was excited because I thought surely the X-E3 would be next.  Instead, we got the X-T2 and host of other bodies.  I tried the X-Pro 2 and liked most of it.  My biggest complaint being I didn't need the hybrid OVF (and its expense) and wanted a pure EVF only.  After much debate (and a couple of orders I canceled due to unavailability), I pulled the trigger and got the graphite silver edition of the X-T2.  By some miracle, I was able to get one in hand a couple of days after I ordered it.<br /><br />At this point, I have only had the camera a couple of days so this is more of an early impressions than a complete review.  That said, this camera is a probably the most complete mirrorless camera on the market right now.  I was immediately impressed at how fast the auto focus is.  Compared to my X-E2, the X-T2 locks on and fires like a machine gun.  It still hunts a tad in lower light settings, but that is not something that I personally would complain that much about.<br /><br />If you are a manual shooter, this thing is certainly a dream.  The dials are abundant and easily accessible.  Some may not like the double stacked design of the ISO and shutter speed dials, but for me it hasn't been a problem.  My only complaint is that I would have liked to have a lock on the exposure compensation dial like the aforementioned dials have.  Also, the AE lock bottom is a little clumsy if that is something you use regularly.<br /><br />The EVF is enormous, bright, and doesn't suffer much lag.  If you use the battery grip and boost mode, there is no lag at all.  The rear LCD is likewise big and bright.  The multi-articulating screen is nice, but is the only part of the camera that doesn't feel indestructible.  I personally would have preferred a non-articulating touch screen, but your personal preference may vary.<br /><br />So, why do I love it?  The build quality is top notch.  The design and layout are great.  It shoots and feels very much like a DSLR in many respects.  The IQ and colors are great.  I love the flexibility that the higher resolution sensor offers for cropping.  I feel like if I was hired to shoot  and the shots mattered, this would be a good, reliable camera.<br /><br />Why do I not love it?  It feels very much like a mini DSLR.  For some that is not an problem and may be seen as a benefit.  After shooting the X-E2 for the past 3 years however, I have gotten use to that compact rangefinder body where I could open my left eye to compose a shot without anything in the way.  It was also a camera that would easily fit into just about any bag and was a joy to carry.  Put the pancake 27mm on it and you could fit it in your coat pocket. The EVF hump on the X-T2 makes it less easy to stash in small places and adding the battery grip means it doesn't fit in any of my bags I bought for my X-E2.<br /><br />Speaking of the battery grip, I like the functionality it adds.  However, I don't like feeling that I have to have it.  Boost mode is great, particularly the increase to the refresh rate of the EVF.  I just know there are times I will want to take it off to streamline and lighten my carry, but will have a hard time giving up of the performance benefits.  Maybe I will get over it, time will tell.  Either way, the camera just doesn't feel complete without it.<br /><br />So, why 5 stars?  It is a great mirrorless camera.  If you are a DSLR shooter looking to go slightly smaller and want access to a great line up of lenses on bodies with fabulous color and great IQ, look no further.  If you are an existing Fuji shooter looking for the best camera in the X family, then this is it.  Most of the hype around this camera is real and well-founded.<br /><br />If however, size and cost truly matters or you are committed to a rangefinder body then I would wait.  Yes, you can open your left eye on this camera and still have a relatively unobstructed view and yes the body (without the battery grip) is still smaller and lighter than its DSLR counterparts.  For me though, it just slightly misses the mark.  If Fuji had released (or even hinted at) an X-E3 with the new sensor I doubt that I would have given the X-T2 a second look.  That is just my preference though and shouldn't detract from what a great camera the X-T2 is.","Great Camera! I've been a Canon shooter for sometime and decided to make the switch. Canon is great, but I really wanted something that was lighter, had great image quality, and had great glass. After a butt load of reasearch I decided Fuji may be my answer. I sold my Canon gear and picked up the XT2 and haven't looked back.","Just purchased this kit last week, and so far, so great! The \"kit\" lens is crisp and clear, and barely deserves to be considered along side normal \"kit\" lenses. As a walking around lens, it's pretty much perfect.<br /><br />As you've seen in all the reviews already, the AF is fast and responsive. No problems there. The face/eye tracking functionality? I'm still undecided on that as yet. It's useful, but if I have time to compose the shot, it can actually get in the way a little. However, if you're in a pinch and shooting with everything else on \"auto\" then it might be helpful.<br /><br />This is not a point and shoot by any means. At all. Not even close. Even setting most functions to \"auto\" is an exercise, and I'm not quite sure I trust myself (or the camera?) to follow all my instructions when A is selected for everything. The auto ISO function, for example, seems to default to the higher ISO setting, but that might be because I'm really pushing it to keep a higher shutter speed (my hands aren't super-steady).<br /><br />Having said that, shots at higher ISOs are remarkable. I'm a Canon shooter, and so maybe I'm just used to crapper low-light performance. But shooting at 3000+ ISOs on this camera, especially using the black and white film filters, is an amazing experience. I bet all the Sony shooters are rolling their eyes at this ;-)<br /><br />So, here are a quick few bullet points about what I'm still figuring out. Not camera flaws at all; they are things I need to get used to.<br />- As I mentioned, I'm a Canon guy, but I have been shooting with a Fujfilm X100T for over year. Great camera, but pretty fiddly. The X-T2 amps that up. Almost all the controls you might need are on dials, some of them stacked! This makes for an attractive looking camera for sure, and will eventually give me much greater fine control over everything. Right now, it's a steep learning curve.<br />- It's not as intuitive as other cameras. How do you set it to P mode? I seriously had to look it up the first time. (Answer, you set everything to Automatic).<br />- Film filters are great, but the skin tones off the mark are a bit dubious. This is something I need to refine, but again, fiddly.<br />- Connecting the camera via wireless to the iOS app is not always easy, and you have to remember (if you want to transfer JPEGS) to set the camera to the right storage card first. I learned that the hard way. And that's if it decides to connect at all. There's an issue with the iOS 10 version of the app, apparently, and Fuji doesn't seem to be in a hurry to update it.<br />- Mac owners, if you're up to date with OS X, you're not going to be able to use Fuji's PC Connect app. Not yet, at least.<br /><br />I'm still learning the camera. I think I will be for quite a while. But it has absolutely lit a fire under my jaded butt, and I'm enjoying shooting again.<br /><br />A couple of additional things to consider:<br />- seriously consider picking up something like the K&F Mount Adapter (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LECXO9C/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) : this is amazing and I've already had my Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 attached to my X-T2 and it works like a charm. The range of glass for this camera isn't huge yet, so getting a mount (even if it means you have to do manual focus) is maybe essential.<br />- If you shoot things like weddings/events professionally, I'm not 100% if this camera is quite the right fit. As I said, I'm still learning the ropes, so I might be wrong.<br />- The included tiny flash unit isn't very impressive, but at least it has it as an option. I hate using speedlites anyway.","Im just a hobbyist... but shooting with this system is a pleasure, learning curve was minimal, especially adjusting the \"external exposure triangle\" , start up is quick even from sleep (but I'm in the habit of turning off the camera to conserve batt life, learned this from my A7ii) awesome retro look as well... would have given it the full rack, but I the hype with the EVF that it rivals the Sony A7Rii and the Leicas system is not true.. don't get me wrong it's better than my A7ii but no where near the A7Rii  or Leica system... not unless mine is damaged???  Hey One call, what do you think?","I sold all my Nikon full frame equipment and now own just the X-T2 and the XT-1 for backup. After a few days with this camera I can honestly say it has to be one of the most fun cameras to use. I have a small photography business and I shoot family, senior and individual portraits. I also shoot some commercial work and I think this camera will fit in nicely. I have already shot one job with this camera using the 50-140mm lens and am very happy with the final product. I am in love with the weight factor and the image quality. Not sure about weddings, I would probably turn down a job that did not allow me to use a flash but that is only because I do not know of it's capabilities yet. I would highly recommend this camera to amateurs as well as pros who want to get rid of the weight of there full frame equipment.","Awesome camera can't complain other than I don't know how to use it to its full potential. Great camera for sure. God loves you all thanks","]I started my photography career shooting Canon, I've been a 5d III owner since 2015. I purchased a Fuji X-10T last year as my \"traveling camera\" and LOVED it. The two weaknesses (for me) was the focus system and it generated only 16MP images. Other than that, I thought it was a great camera to have. When I saw the specs for the X-T2, I knew this was my camera. Review after review confirmed for me that I needed to purchase this. I've owned it for a week, and it is simply awesome. It's a great size, Fuji lenses rock, and this thing has every feature I could ask for. The images look great and I'm very, very pleased.","Amazing Camera and Lens, Love it!  Just got it and it's mind boggling.  Selling off my Sony camera and Lenses.<br />I will be purchasing more xt lenses soon. Sorry Sony, but the Sony is like a toy next to this camera.","Love it","I love the XT-1. I was a bit hesitant about making the jump, but after receiving it I'm really happy I did. It feels just a little bit sturdier, a little bit bigger in the hands. It is really silent and snappy. I really like the joystick for focusing. Also the grain feature is awesome. You can make photos look like them came straight outta a 35mm vintage camera, especially the B&W in Acros mode. Really loving the features of this. If you're on the fence, do it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.","Two big problems with Fuji you should know about:<br /><br />1. If you use Lightroom and want to develop Raw files, the conversion of the files from Fuji X system cameras is awful and Fuji won't fix the problem (they have had since 2011 to do so, and have chosen not to). The Fuji choice for Raw conversion is Silkypix, but you loose a lot of functionality/flexibility.<br />2. If you want to use flash/strobe and take advantage of more powerful and portable systems from Godox etc., you will have problems with Fuji. Flash is still a really weak point for Fuji.<br /><br />Other than that, great prime lenses and the cameras have dials and buttons that make them very enjoyable to use (for me, at least). JPEG's are the best I've taken.","I've only been able to use this camera for a short period of time (rental). However, it's a big improvement over the already excellent X-T1. I really want to upgrade to this body, but I just can't justify the price especially since there are no problems with my X-T1. The 2 features I wish Fuji would have added was at least a 5 exposure bracketing and a fully articulating screen. Otherwise, Fuji is so quick to do firmware upgrades (they're still supporting the X-T1) to continually improve their products. If the X-T1 is any indicator, my guess is the X-T2 isn't going anywhere for a couple of years. Also, even though it's an APS-C you'll be able to do everything you want with it... remember the very first DSLRs in the market all had crop sensors and very low pixel density and pros were still printing 8x10 - I've even printed larger images off my D200. So DON'T be afraid of the crop sensor or it being mirrorless because you'll have one of the best (if not the best) camera in your hand.<br /><br />I would suggest buying extra batteries and/or the batter grip though. Like other mirrorless cameras, it's a battery hog because you're always powering an LCD or EVF. But you can change the setting so both are off unless you put your face to the EVF.<br /><br />Like any other product, it's not 100% perfect, but it's close!","Amazon was great. Got this sought after camera in 3 weeks after ordering when it was sold out everywhere. love it!","I went from a Nikon D50 to this bad boy. It was a little jarring to go from one system to another but with a little practice its been great. This camera brought me back to the days of film cameras and its made me so nostalgic. It really is a beast of a camera.","One of the best cameras made, such a great grip, performance, ease of use, ergonomics.","PRO's:<br />1) Picture quality is superb and the jpegs are amazing<br />2) Solid build with good grip<br />3) Quick startup<br />4) Auto focus is significantly better than its predecessor<br /><br />CONS's:<br />1) It overheats with 4k at 30fps. They made an extended power pack for about $294, but it still doesn't do much more than run hot and still overheat. The only way to keep it from overheating is to run it at 24fps with the back open.<br />2) Updated batteries to handle the overheating issue are questionable and expensive. When you make a camera, put it through a battery of tests and beat on it before releasing it to the public. The batteries do not offer much of an improvement. Waste of money.","Wow!!! It's the best!!!","This camera provides outstanding image quality and has all the features I wanted.","I shoot with my Fujifilm much more than I ever did with my previous Canon & Nikon cameras. Really fun to use!","I'm transitioning from a full-frame Canon 5DIII to this camera due to the smaller size and weight of the XT-2. While I love the images that I have taken while traveling and hiking with the full frame camera, it's bulky and very conspicuous in a crowd. However, I was willing to lug it around if that's what it took to get great quality images.<br />I looked at many other options, including the Sony a7r ii, since I mostly shoot landscapes and travel photos. While the Sony looks great, to get the images I'm after I would be buying lenses that are about as large as what I'm using now (L lenses from Canon). The Fuji XT-2 was getting great reviews, despite being a APS-c sensor camera. So, after a lot of research I bought this camera and have been shooting with it for about a month now. I very happy with the image quality, the ISO range, the fantastic high quality lens selections, and the reduced bulk (and cost!). The water resistance of this camera and many of their lenses has been a great bonus as well.<br />So far, I very happy with this purchase and likely will be selling off some Canon gear in the year to come.","Just amazing camera. Have been playing with it for 2 weeks, and it is extremely fun to use.","Incredible camera. This is my first Fuji and I'm blown away by the quality/build of the camera and lenses (I own the 16-55 f2.8, 50-140 f2.8& 24 f1.4). I have a Nikon D7200 and wanted something lighter and less bulky I can use for travel and indoor/low light  photography without having to sacrifice image quality. Pictures are stunnning and the camera works like a dream. It is simply the best aps-c mirrorless out there in my opinion","I’ve been waiting awhile to post a review of the Fuji XT2. I received it from Amazon mid Sept. and have been using it since. I do mostly flowers and travel photo/video and make BluRay videos of them using Apples Final Cut Pro. In Hawaii I did photo comparisons of my Canon 5DIII with all L lenses and the Fuji. The Fuji with its stock 18-55 lens beat the Canon hands down. The images were sharper with better colors (standard setting). In the Vivid mode the colors were remarkable. I think the difference in sharpness is due to the lack of an Optical Low Pass Filter. Traveling with the Fuji system vs. the Canon is so much easier due to size and weight.<br /><br />For the video side of things, I have been using a Canon HF G30 camcorder shooting 1080, 59.9P. I just did a comparison of the cam and the Fuji at 1080P. I shot extremely low light to check the noise level and daylight for color saturation and clarity of image. Again, the Fuji shined, much less noise in low light and sharper images with better colors in daylight. I haven’t tried 4K since all my videos are 1080P BluRay. One drawback to the Fuji is that shooting 1080P, you’re limited to 15 minutes per clip unless you attach the battery grip with extra batteries. I never used the 5DIII for Video since it won’t auto focus as you are shooting. Speaking of auto focusing, the Canon HF G30 does a little better job of staying on focus as the subject moves around. Also, the built in mic is really good on the G30, whereas the built in on the Fuji is “muddy”. You really need a good external mic with the Fuji.<br /><br />All things considered, the Fuji XT2 is a remarkable achievement at a bargain price. I have since purchased the 55-200 and the 10-24. They are also great!<br /><br />Henrik Hansen, DDS","Let me start by saying I have been a Fuji shooter for almost 4 years now.  It started with the X100S which I absolutely loved!  I then bought an X-T1 and a bunch of lenses and ditched my Canon gear.  The X100S was replaced with an X100T, and two months ago the X-T2 was added to the stable.  I still love the X-T1, but it has now been relegated to backup in case there is an issue with the X-T2 when shooting professionally.<br /><br />The good....<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY<br />The X-T1 compared to the X-T2 seems like a beta version of the camera, at least in terms of build quality.  The build quality on the X-T2 is magnificent.  The dials feel much more solid, and the fact that you can lock them down is a big improvement over the dials on the X-T1.  Even the doors on the side for the card reader and the ports are more solid than the X-T1.<br /><br />DUAL CARD SLOT<br />Hooray!  Now I can shoot both RAW/JPEG, Continuous or backup.  I shoot RAW and JPEG but it is nice to know if I wanted to shoot continuous I can fill one card before the camera starts writing to the other card.  If I was only shooting RAW and needed a backup I am covered!  Never had a card fail on me yet...but it is nice to know I am covered if one does fail.<br /><br />JOYSTICK<br />The joystick is the single best feature Fuji has introduced.  It took a while to get used to not hitting the directional pad to change the focus point.  Once I got used to the joystick it has become a pleasure to use.  If the X100F gets the joystick I may have to upgrade from the T.<br /><br />AUTOFOCUS<br />The autofocus runs circles around the X-T1.  The custom settings make shooting action a breeze!  I am still astounded by how well the continuous auto focus performs.<br /><br />5 STOP EXPOSURE COMPENSATION<br />Set the exposure compensation to \"C\" and you can get two more stops than the X-T1.<br /><br />2 STOP EXPOSURE BRACKETING<br />Perfect for my needs.  The X-T1 has 1 stop exposure bracketing which was pretty worthless for me when I shoot real estate.  I prefer to shoot interiors with off camera lights.  Expose for the windows and fill the room with artificial light.  Some assignments there are too many reflective surfaces and exposure bracketing comes into play.  In this scenario, for my needs, 2 stops works fine.<br /><br />MICRO USB CHARGING<br />Love this feature on the X100T and it is welcome on the X-T2.  When traveling I prefer to charge the battery in camera rather than bringing the charger along.  I usually carry a few extra batteries with me...as long as I can charge one battery in camera at night I am good to go.<br /><br />24MP X-Trans CMOS III sensor<br />The new sensor is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />4K video<br />I never shot video with any of my Fuji cameras.  After testing out the 4K video capabilities that has changed.  The video quality is perfect for my needs...quite stunning!<br /><br />The bad...<br />So far my only complaint is the WIFI has been a bit spotty.  I have had some trouble connecting the camera to my iPhone 6.  I have never had a problem with the X-T1.  I am not sure if this is an app issue, or perhaps a firmware fix.  I have managed to connect my camera to phone every time, but more often than not is has taken me multiple attempts.<br /><br />That is really about it in terms of bad.  If you are thinking about this camera, do not hesitate...buy it...it is FANTASTIC!!!!!","The best camera that i ever had..........","- About the same size with a mid-size DSLR (with lenses etc. you should keep the same bag you have now).<br />- High battery consumption, especially since the amazing liveview mode makes you play a lot with it. Carry batteries.<br />- Very pleasant colors (Sony's are a just a tiny bit colder).<br />I took pics with ordinary subjects of a challenging nature (autumn trees in various arrangements, and portraits in nature without much bokeh- because all these are three dimensional, contrary to youtube photographers who use a flat brick wall).<br />Sharpness was amazing, color saturation, micro-contrast etc all excellent, equivalent to more expensive DSLRs or better. I found the raw files of the D750 more workable on lightroom with low-light conditions and shadows, but the Fuji is top-world-class as well. The D750 was a tiny more realistic in color contrast, the Fuji more vibrant.<br />- This Fuji is one of the best cameras in the world in this format. But but don't listen to all those YouTube promoters that this is a \"compact street camera\". It's not. It's just more discreet when you use a small pancake lens. A professional would make the best possible pics for this format with this camera (and the mirrorless Sony), the amateurs will appreciate the WYSIWYG liveview and will not like battery life.","Love the system, sold all my Canon gear! It is a real step up from the X-T1.  The Fujinon glass that goes with this camera is top shelf.","There are so many reviews and they are all true, this is a great camera so I won't go into details on that. One thing I wanted to let you all know is that you see any weirdness (for example moving waves in the video) with the 18-55 mm lens or other lenses make sure to UPGRADE the FIRMWARE on the LENS to the latest available at Fuji site. I would upgrade the Firmware on the lens even if you do not see any problems at the moment as your IS may not work optimally. The camera does not have Firmware upgrade as of the writing of this review. Check all of your lenses!<br />The many great qualities of this camera outweigh  the few things that need improvement. Things I would have liked to see for video is the headphone jack to be on the camera and not on the grip. But maybe they did that because the battery  life is very short for video that you pretty much will have to use the grip. But still.  The shooting switch selector (video-BKT-L-H-S...) is hard to use.","So far it's good, but box I received seems like was already opened many times, and the 18-55 lens has weird sounds when you shake it even lightly, feel like has a small piece loosing inside. I checked some articials one this lens, some people has the same issue, some don't. If possible, I would recommend by the body itself instead of the kit.","Just a dream of a camera. Slightly larger than micro four thirds premium bodies of Olympus or Panasonic and slightly smaller than Sony's A7 series of full frame cameras. The camera feels like a tool that you will want to go out and shoot with. Control layout and its ergonomics are superb while the output of the files are astounding. No more worries about the issues with X Series cameras with poor autofocus, greatly improved continuous autofocus and the speed has vastly improved. Someone that has shot with mirrorless for years trying micro four thirds in many iterations, aps-c mirrorless systems, as well as the Sony mirrorless full frames, Fuji continues to draw me in. The Fuji X-T2 is a versitile piece of grear that will be your go to all purpose camera. I extensively do street and travel photography where it's just a joy to use. Wifi works well for Instagram though the files do take a bit of time to transfer. Instagram: thedharmalife","As a professional photographer, I switched to Fuji gear (From Canon 5D MkIII's) a couple of years ago. The X-T2 is a natural evolution of my previous X-T1 bodies, and provides outstanding performance and image quality in studio and out in the field (usually weddings).<br /><br />In short: A flawless camera that can easily cope with a multitude of purposes/styles.","I am an enthusiast photographer interested in macro and nature photography in general. The first camera I used, was a Nikon D300 with the 18-200mm. After some years, decided to have a new camera and made a lot of internet research, and I mean A LOT. I wanted the best quality images I could get that my wallet could afford. I started to see full frame bodies as an option, but price was a restrictive issue considering the whole package including good glass for a macro, a wide angle and a telephoto. While “surfing”, I started to read about Fujifilm, there were interesting opinions about the great image quality and the amazing color rendering they produce, but not so many about its autofocus. Besides this, everything else was somehow aligned with my requirements. Then the X-T1 was announce and immediately grab my attention for the autofocus speed upgrade they introduced in this model and maybe because of my DSLR background that it is reassembled on this lineup, finally I jumped to the Fujifilm with the X-T1. Really a new hole dimension on image quality and color rendering. Loved the camera, and after a couple of years later saw myself fully committed to this Fuji ecosystem having great glass for all my interests.<br /><br />Then the X-T2 was announced, with a bigger sensor, better autofocus, better ISO, better shutter speed, with a very useful focus stick selector, double memory card slots, grip with 2 additional batteries, and more. I immediately sold the X-T1 in order to have cash and order the X-T2 that I have for a couple of months now. The bigger knobs are also a great addition, such a pleasure to use the dials, and I did not start using film cameras, it just make more sense than Aperture and Shutter priority.<br /><br />The Cons, still waiting for good lighting system, still waiting for a better macro lens (picture of butterfly taken with the Zeiss 50 f/2.8), no touchscreen yet, still pricy, software support still behind canikon, still waiting for tethering support.<br /><br />(Picture of butterfly taken with the Carl Zeiss 50mm f/2.8, the toucan with the XF 100-400).","This camera exceeds my expectations. Recently got introduced to the fuji X system and fell in love with it using the xpro-1. From there I know i had to get the new xt-2 so I sold all my Sony a7 gear and jumped over. I had to wait like forever to get this because it was out of stock.<br /><br />Once received, fuji has some of the best packaging in its premium form. With this I also bought the vertical battery grip and 2 extra batteries, Gariz soft shutter button and peak design summit edition strap. This for me is the best kit one can own especially when coupled with the 90mm f/2, 35 f/1.4 & 55-200 (so far).<br /><br />This camera for me brings a lot of joy and when using and not compromising on performance. I can go on like I'm reading the manual but that wont make much sense about the specs. On the field this camera sings and within about an hour of shooting I got use to the user interface and workflow. Battery use is not as bad as people make it seem and better if you turn of the live view on the main display and use eyes sensor on the viewfinder.<br /><br />Jpegs straight out of the camera is crazy! I mean, you can literally shoot a gig and of course once properly composed and you meter exposures properly, you can just sort out what images you want after and deliver as is. The color reproduction is just that good, for me at least. Focus is tack sharp too especially when using XF lenses.<br /><br />One things worth to mention is that low light af isnt that great. I mean ive used worst, especially when comparing to the sony a7 series.<br /><br />I haven gotten around exploring the raw capabilities with all those highly claimed ISO invariance and out of this work dynamic range that can be brought back from highlights in Lightroom. Same goes for the video in which im really hoping that fuji releases a firmware update what will allow you to record flog internally.<br /><br />Will update on these as I use.","I'm not a professional photographer but have been shooting for a long time. I wanted to make the switch to mirrorless from my Nikon. I found a lack of desire to carry the heavy bulky DSLR and wanted something more compact.<br /><br />I mainly shoot pet photograph and landscape photography and although it's only been just over a week I've loved every moment shooting with it. When you're shooting animals (especially puppies that don't stop moving) you need fast crisp autofocus. The xt2 has stood the test. Continuous Auto Focus with 8fps burst and I can capture my dog running no problem.<br /><br />Aside from the great photos the camera is so fun to use. It forces you to think about the photos you're taking and makes it easy to switch between priority modes while giving live feedback. The camera is beautiful to hold and so fun to shoot with! Everything just makes sense!<br /><br />I bought the X-T2 with the 18-55mm kit since it's basically like getting a discount on the lens. I also bought the 35mm f2 which has been glued to my camera.<br />  - The 18-55mm is a really nice lens and definitely not a standard kit. It's great for landscape and is a versatile lens.<br />  - The 35mm f2 is fast light and crisp. I'm truly in love with this lens.","If you are like me, I enjoy reading a good review before investing in a new camera.  That said, finding a review one can trust or get a sense of performance can sometimes be tricky!<br /><br />What is to follow is not a traditional review.  However, I hope one gets a meaningful feel for this camera and Fuji's strong DNA in their mirrorless line-up.<br /><br />Before we dive too deep, I think it is important to know a little about the reviewers experience and style of photography.  I have been a professional photographer since the mid-90's.  I have photographed on every major system over the years including - Sinar, Hasselblad, Nikon, Canon and Fuji over the years.  I photograph primarily editorial work with a dash of journalistic assignments thrown in the mix.  Canon is still my main professional system.  Canon (and Nikon) has a robust lineup of cameras and lenses that have features not yet available in the mirrorless market in their flagship models.<br /><br />Enough about other cameras, and on to Fuji and the xt-2.  Fuji is a creative beast!  Since the x100s was introduced, I have used Fuji as my only carry around camera for personal use.  The best camera is always the one with you.  Soon after I purchased the x100s I added an x-e2 to my options to choose from.  Fuji's size combined with their amazing design and \"Fuji color\" makes them a triple threat.<br /><br />After receiving one of the first copies available to the masse, the xt-2 is a game changer in my mind.  It puts real AF speed into the equation for a working pro.<br /><br />*** I should insert, I am not paid nor sponsored by any camera company.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with professional quality DSLRs would admit, Fuji wasn't as fast in terms of AF pre- xt-2.  While there are strong arguments that Fuji has more than enough performance for some styles of photography, for the most demanding assignments, it wasn't quite there.  The xt-2 changes this!  I am now carrying around a camera that can meet almost any spontaneous moment thrown at it in the blink of an eye.  This is huge for anyone capturing fleeting moments.<br /><br />With any Fuji mirrorless, one gets the ability to access your aperture, shutter and ISO instantly, without going deep into menus.  The xt-2 amplifies this with a spinning ISO dial.  This gives any artist instant access to the most important creative controls.  The speed and joy one can make creative adjustments is a dream.  As a huge bonus, Fuji does this in such a small form factor with professional quality sensors and lenses.  Also, both the ISO and shutter speed dial lock, making accidentally changing a setting a thing of the past.<br /><br />The xt-2 is light.  It is super stealth compared to full frame counterparts.  This goes for the lenses, too.  You won't feel weighted down even after a full day on your body.  It is the perfect carry around camera.<br /><br />One major exception - paired with the booster grip it does get more DSLR like.  The booster is heavy compared to the body.  It isn't a deal breaker, but it doesn't come along most days.  Being a camera mule takes away from what I am looking for in a street camera.  That said, if I were using it on assignment, the grip is a must.  The grip takes the AF and overall performance one and a half steps up.<br /><br />With a couple of months and thousands of still images in the can, I can say the Fuji x-t2 is a very capable camera in terms of speed and function.  I would rate it close if not on par with the Canon 5Dmk3 in speed.  That is nothing to sneeze at!  I run fast memory cards with oem batteries and have had zero issues with crashes or performance hiccups.  It has been a dream to use and one can see Fuji's mature system in the mirrorless market with this camera.<br /><br />There are tons of customizations.  The menus make sense for anyone familiar with photography vocabulary.  If one is buying the x-t2, they should plan on spending some time reading the manual and playing with the custom settings.  One can setup personal user settings that access your most used functions in literally a second.  The AF system has limitless customization, too.  Make sure to spend some time configuring it to your use, because the customization menu will open up huge performance gains.  There are zero excuses to not create with this camera.  It is a mighty fine tool to carry out one's vision.  One is only limited by their vision with this camera.<br /><br />If you are new to photography, the above could be intimidating or overwhelming.  Be assured thought you have the tools to grow, if you want to take photography to the next level.  If not, I would be honest this camera may not be for you.  Invest in a camera with a smaller feature set and more lenses if you want to spend the money.  The same would go if you primarily photograph still images or landscapes.<br /><br />Hope this helps make your decision on the best camera for you.<br /><br />***  I have not used the video functions, nor feel qualified to review them.<br /><br />I am not equipped to","Coming from an xt1 user...<br />This is a solid upgrade. The xt1 is still a great camera, but the xt2 improves in the following areas.<br />- about a stop better ISO performance<br />- snappier autofocus plus less blackout time equals and overall more responsive shooting experience.<br />- control knobs are slightly taller, allowing easier setting adjustments. Also there are toggle lock buttons in the center of the control knobs. On the xt1 you have to hold the center button to adjust ISO. Not so on the xt2<br />- feels a little more substantial in the hand.<br />- more resolution. This is something that I noticed immediately. extremely deatailed images.","this got to me much quicker than what I was expecting. Thank you so much!","Sell all your other cameras this is a winner!","This is an absolute monster of a camera. The best I've ever owned (of 20 or so). Do your research and if the mirrorless format is for, this camera is strongly recommended.","A real winner. Period.","First off, this is (according to my failing memory), the only Amazon review I've ever felt compelled to write, so that should give you a pretty good idea on just how amazing this camera is.<br /><br />Quick backstory: I've only been shooting for a couple of years. In 2014, I picked up my first DSLR, a Canon T3i. Within a few months I graduated to the Canon 6D, and a year or so later, the 5D Mark III. Canon has served me well over the years, and I've been fortunate enough to make a solid side-income from this hobby-turned-profession. I wouldn't be writing this review right now, let alone know what a mirrorless camera is, if it weren't for my friend, Jahns. We made plans to shoot some street photography one day and he showed up with a small little camera that looked more like a point-and-shoot rather than a DSLR. Turns out, it was neither. It was the Sony a7, and I quickly became enamored with its convenient portability and nifty features, like its electronic viewfinder, focus peaking, and advanced focus system. Suddenly it became clear: mirrorless was the future. I knew I had some research to do.<br /><br />I had my work cut out for me. There are plenty of mirrorless options on the market, so deciding which one I wanted proved to be a difficult task. Initially, I thought my choice was clear: The Sony a7rII. It boasted everything I would ever need in a camera. But the price tag ($3,198) was hefty, and I started to question whether I really needed all those megapixels. Surely, there was a more affordable alternative. Enter the Fuji XT-2. I'm actually not sure how I stumbled upon this marvel of a machine, but I'm so glad I did. After reading glowing review after glowing review about the X-series, it became obvious the XT-2 was for me. So I ordered it.<br /><br />Five Reasons Why I'm in Love with This Camera:<br /><br />1) Portability<br /><br />This camera along with the 35mm f/2 (the only lens I have for it) weighs 1.5 pounds. That's including the battery and lens hood. The Canon 5D Mark III with the 85mm f/1.2 weighs well over three times that much. The difference in weight is not just noticeable, it's dramatic. You can wear it around your neck or slung over your shoulder and you'll barely feel it.<br /><br />2) Superior focus system<br /><br />\"Superior to what?\" you might be asking. While I don't know if the XT-2's focus system beats out other mirrorless cameras (it might, I just haven't done the research), I can say with certainty that it's light years ahead of any DSLR I've shot with. DSLR cameras use what's called phase detection autofocus, while mirrorless systems use what's called contrast detection autofocus. What's the difference? Phase detection is generally a little faster, but it has one huge drawback: it can be pretty inaccurate. With contrast detection, on the other hand, the camera looks at the point on the sensor that's supposed to be in focus and adjusts the lens accordingly until everything looks sharp. Since getting the XT-2, my \"throw-away\" rate has been cut down significantly. So many images are in focus, and if they aren't, it's generally because I'm not shooting at a fast enough shutter speed.<br /><br />3) Articulating Screen<br /><br />If you're a street photographer, you're going to be in absolute heaven. This camera is already discrete with its small form factor, but when you couple that with the ability to pull out the LCD screen, you have the superpower of going around virtually unnoticed. Using live view, I can look down at my camera's LCD screen that's flipped up and focus more on composing my shot rather than worrying about if people are noticing me. This means capturing more real-life moments and less time planning out *how* you're going to capture those moments.<br /><br />4) Film Simulation<br /><br />The film simulations are a big part of what swayed me to Fuji instead of Sony. And they definitely do not disappoint. I'm particularly fond of the \"Classic Chrome\" simulation; its soft and muted tones makes images so pleasing to look at. I generally will color correct images on my own, but I've been surprised at how many images are shareable right out of the camera. Especially for random outings and trips, this is such a welcome feature. No longer do you have to spend hours culling and editing every individual shot.<br /><br />One other thing to note about the film simulations: they can be applied to video too, although I haven't thoroughly tested this yet. It's nice to know that you can choose to forgo color grading if you're happy with what the simulation gives you. (Fuji also has a flat video profile called F-log, though I think that can only be utilized when using an external 4k recorder.)<br /><br />5) Sex Appeal<br /><br />Looks aren't everything, but they sure do help, and the XT-2 is a damn sexy beast. With its three dials on the top of the body, it deceives many into thinking it's a film camera. That is, until they see the LCD screen or hear the sound of its delicious (and silent!) mechanical shutter. The XT-2 is the perfect marriage of nostalgia and technology, and is sure to be a conversation piece among friends and strangers alike.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: No piece of gear will make you a better photographer on its own, but this camera certainly makes shooting hella fun. If you're considering making the leap from a DSLR to mirrorless, this is a fine choice. Get it! You won't regret it. :)<br /><br />I hope you all find this review helpful. Thanks for reading, and happy shooting!<br /><br />Kevin Kleitches<br />Kevin Titus Photo","I have been reading the reviews about some of the mirrorless cameras for quite a while.  I was mildly interested, but I had a great Canon 6D that took wonderful photos and video.  Then I photographed my brother in law's wedding a few weeks ago and felt the weight of my Canon 6D and 24-105mm L lens start to bother me.  I had a small kit with me and left my bag and other lenses in the car, preferring to work light this time.  So much for that...<br /><br />When I returned home, I started looking at smaller DSLRs and read a few reviews on the Fuji X-T2.  The reviews seemed like they were written by the Fujifilm marketing department.  But there were many reviews praising the X-T2 even though it had recently become available.<br /><br />So, I took a chance and ordered the X-T2 with XF 18-55mm lens.  It did take a bit of owner's manual study to get used to the menu layout and the different controls.  But when I started taking photos and examined the sharpness and fantastic color, I became a believer!  Wow! This was the best camera since my film days when I used to shoot Fujichrome Velvia film.<br /><br />Since this is the initial release of this model, there are a few things that I expect to see changed in a firmware release.  But it works as is perfectly for me.  I love shooting it and it doesn't seem to weigh much compared to the old Canon 6D.  To me, this makes vacation and street photography fun again.<br /><br />I also have the XF 10-14 f4, XF 35mm f2 WR, and the Rokinon 12mm F2 lenses.  They are all exceedingly sharp with excellent color.","You've done your homework already.  I'm just confirming it--this camera is everything you've researched and more.  That being said, there is one flaw that I've found with this camera, the max low light ISO for a decent shot is 1600.  Of course the camera can shoot at ISO 12 billion something but for a person who is critical of their images, 1600 is the max.  Sure, you can take care of the noise in Photoshop, but I rather be shooting than Photoshopping.  Regardless of ISO, this camera is still the cat's meow.","I liked the XT1 but the autofocus and the battery life were frustrating even with 4.00 firmware upgrades. Coming from traditional DSLR, I thought the autofocus was satisfactory at best; indoors the autofocus struggled even with what I felt was good lighting.  I would give the XT-1 4.1 stars and I wanted to like that camera more than I did, considered returning it but didn't because I really liked the compact size, the retro interface and Fuji's impressive lens line-up.  Well, Fuji paid attention and really improved on the XT1 with this gem.  I estimate my all-around keeper rate with the XT1 was about 60% (probably slightly higher with outdoor shots).  With the XT2, it's over 90% which is what I get with my Canon 5DMIII. Only had this for about a month and still playing with it but here are few things I immediately noticed compared to the XT1:<br /><br />-- Improved autofocus, especially zone tracking<br />-- Much faster shutter (may also be why this camera's focus is superior to the XT1)<br />-- Noticeably faster and smarter UI; aperture and shutter priority modes work much more reliably compared to XT1<br />-- Taller dials which are easier to adjust<br />-- Dials have a push-in locking button which I like better than the XT1's style push-and-turn style<br />-- No focus assist button, now focus assist is accessed up pushing in the rear dial, very cool<br />-- Focus lever which makes focal point selection quicker<br />-- Improved battery life with the upgraded battery but still not great compared to DSLR; I reset my expectations with mirrorless camera battery life.  I bought the vertical battery grip which has proven to be a necessity for the XT1.<br />-- the aftermarket Lensmate thumbrest for the XT1 fits just fine on the XT2<br /><br />I tried the XT2 with the following lens: 18-55, 18-135, 16-55 F2.8, 16mm F1.4, 35mm F2 and so far it has performed impressively with each.  Very happy I upgraded.","Great pictures, 4K video outstanding also has impressive dynamic range for great shadow recovery. 1.00 firmware glitchy and have to get a replacement.","If you own and like an X-T1 you will love the X-T2.  The controls are upgraded allowing much more customization of the controls.  The joy stick is far easier to use than the buttons on the X-T1.  The resolution is at a sweet spot I think.  What more can I say.  Buy it.","Got the X-T2 on a Saturday and left for a two week vacation to Spain the next morning.  I previously owned the X-T1, so I was fairly comfortable with functions and features, and gave myself a refresher course with the owners manual while sitting on the plane for six hours.  Packed four batteries and three lenses, but once I mounted the 10-24 zoom to the body it stayed put for the entire trip.  Loved the instant-on and super fast focusing.  The new focus select joy stick is a great addition to the camera.  Even found the multi-angle tilt screen to be more useful than I had first imagined.  I've always liked the primary dials on the top of the camera and being able to use the exposure compensation and ISO dials on the fly was really handy.<br />This is one great camera.","The Fugifilm XT2 is an awesome camera! It has exceeded my expectations!","Amazing camera. Makes me want to take it out every day. Love the controls, solid build and superb results out of camera. No need for post processing! Film simulations are magical. I have the 18-55 ois for generalist work and video. OIS is great. I've used ibis on lumix cameras and was affraid about fuji not having it. After a number of walking handled videos I am very impressed. My videos are stable and almost as good as on a ibis system. Buy this camera, it will make you fall in love with photography again!  No Sony can do this for me. Not even the new a6500","A lovely I'm happy, but not worth that much money!","Very impressive camera. Takes excellent photos, and the fuji colors are great.","So far a Great camera in the making!","Pictures say it all.  This camera can do anything my full frame cameras can do and I like it better.  Im a pro wedding photographer who covers about 40-50 weddings at my current rate.  This camera is essential to my workflow.  I can do great shots with much less global editing.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Pro Quality<br />- Lighter than my DSLR<br />- Smaller than my DSLR even with a grip<br />- high fps<br />- AMAZING jpeg files<br />-easiest camera Ive ever owned when it comes to shoot in full manual and not accidentally messing up a shot.<br />- best wifi experience of any pro camera I know of<br />- can print directly from camera with instax eich my brides love<br /><br />CONS<br />- low light focusing can be kinda slow or miss but its the best mirrorless Ive had for low light focusing.<br />- need battery grip to do long events<br /><br />All shots attached are jpegs straight from the camera","The Fuji X100S and T series cameras were my gateway to the Fuji system.  Those little cameras produced incredible images and relegated my beloved Nikon D700 to very limited use.<br /><br />The announcement of the X-T2 really peaked my interested based on all of the buzz regarding its auto focus improvements and next generation image processor.  While I enjoyed my X100T, I really felt like this was a great time to get into the Fuji system and its excellent lenses.  I sold my Nikon gear and pulled the trigger on the X-T2.<br /><br />I haven't had it long, but so far it has been very responsive.  I've not tested its AF Tracking capabilities, but shot to shot focus has met/exceeded my expectations.  *** Edit ***  I can confirm the AF system had no problem tracking my toddler around.  The ability to customize the focus tracking is key here.  I can only imagine the auto focus getting even better with future firmware, but again it is already great and plenty capable in most shooting situations.<br /><br />I own both the 35mm f2 and 56 f1.2 lenses.  The autofocus on the 35mm is as fast as I can recall my old D700 + 50mm f1.8G combos.  The 56 f1.2 isn't as fast, but plenty fast as a portrait lens.<br /><br />I won't repeat what many have said or will say about this camera.  But I think this current generation of Fuji cameras (X-T2 and X-Pro 2) really make a compelling case for DSLR owners on the fence.","For most people this camera will serve them better than a pro-sumer DSLR, with its state of the art features and tech, its ease of use, its superior quality lens lineup, its a fully matured camera system.<br /><br />The XT-2 is a phenomenal camera, and is incredibly intuitive to use. You likely won’t need a manual to figure out how to use most of its features; Everything just works as you'd expect it to.<br /><br />It has a huge, live electronic finder (EVF) and probably the fastest Autofocus in any of the mirrorless cameras on the market as of this writing.  Keep in mind that this is a mirrorless system, so there is no optical viewfinder (OVF), but the EVF has a refresh rate so fast you won’t notice much of a difference from looking at the actual scene through an OVF.<br /><br />Features added / upgraded from the XT-1<br />? Two SD card slots; UHS-II compatible.<br />? Threaded cable release socket.<br />? Electronic shutter to 1/32,000 (the X-T1 also has this as of its newest firmware)<br />?1/8000 mechanical shutter<br />? 1/250 flash sync.<br />? Focus point thumb joystick.<br />? 14 FPS with electronic shutter.<br />? 325 AF points.<br />?24 Megapixel APS-C X-Trans III sensor with phase-detecttion<br />? Brighter OLED finder, otherwise with the same specifications.<br />? 4K video, 100 MBPS internal, 1.17x sensor crop.<br />? Flat F-Log gamma option for video (external recorded required for F-log.<br />? ACROS black and white film simulation<br /><br />Not new to the Fuji line, but worth noting:<br />? The XT-2 is extremely well built by any standards. it is all-metal with engraved markings, and so are its lenses.<br />? Weather sealed.<br />? Amazing auto white balance. even in bad light<br />? Really excellent color and highlight rendition for people, events and portraiture<br />.<br />Many Fuji users shoot RAW files as backup, but the JPGs that come out of the camera are some of the most impressive in the marketplace.<br /><br />While I’ll still use my Heavy-Duty Nikon DSLRs for industrial-grade work; the Fuji X system has quickly become my everyday camera of choice.<br /><br />Attached photos shot with the XT-2","This camera is all around awesome.  I'm switching over from a Nikon D7000 which I've got some great shots out of, but I'm really liking this camera so far and the auto focus is beating the pants off the D7000.  I'm not necessarily talking about the speed, as I haven't shot any sports/fast moving subjects yet, but the accuracy.  I would sometimes have to mess with auto focus fine tuning on the Nikon with different lenses, but this X-T2 is pinpoint accurate on 98% of the 500 shots or so that I've taken so far.<br /><br />This being my first Fujifilm camera, I am greatly appreciating the approach.  They've just set up the buttons and everything really well and intuitively.  You can take 90% of your pictures without reading the manual, but I'd still recommend reading it.  They've included sooo much functionality in this camera that you will have to glean the intricacies from the manual to get that last 10%.  For example, I really like being able to change focus manually once I've held the shutter button halfway down to autofocus, but this option is something you'll have to find in the menu to turn on (at least on the 56mm lens; for push-pull manual focus lenses like the 16mm this wouldn't be necessary).<br /><br />Picture quality is excellent and I'm really digging the jpeg film simulations.  I think I could get away with mostly shooting in jpeg.  However, I will most likely be shooting in RAW+JPEG so I can have more control for the really special shots I might end up getting.  That being said, I seriously need to upgrade to some higher speed memory cards and I'd recommend you invest in these too, especially if you're going to be shooting any video...at all.<br /><br />So far, this camera has been a joy to use and I am excited to pick it up.  I've attached some photos taken with 56mm and 16mm lenses.  They are film sims straight out of the camera with some cropping done prior to uploading.","Stunning camera!.l I've upgraded from the phenomenal XT -1, and this is in effect the XT-1 on multiple steroids! The autofocus is terrific and with the 325/91 autofocus points is a joy to use. The joystick- taken over from the X-Pro 2 makes focusing a pleasure. The image quality  - as to be expected from Fujifilm- is outstanding.  The addition of 8 megapixels was a smart move. 24 MP seems to be the  'sweet spot ' for this new generation X-Trans sensor. The addition of the four Acros film simulation modes was also a smart move. Additionally, the ergonomics that made the XT-1  such a delight to use are present  in the XT-2. Battery life is better, and having the third battery in the grip is a boon. One probably remediable downside is that RAW files seem to lose some  DR quality in Lightroom, depending on the ISO.  I suspect an Adobe problem. However the in-camera JPEG images are frankly awesome  - something that Fujifilm X-mount cameras are remarkable for. Finally, the already brilliant Fujinon lenses  - not least the 100-400mm seem to be even sharper on the XT-2. And yes: fast action captures are now a breeze! Doubtless, there will be glitches  - but Fujifilm are marvellous at regularly improving performance through firmware upgrades. Another 'killer' product from Fujifilm!  And yes: here in South Africa their backup and support are simply unmatched!","Phenomenal camera!","Upgraded from an X-T1 and this camera is definitely an improvement.  It's a joy to use and not as cumbersome as my Nikon D810, which I mainly use for landscapes.  Great little travel camera as I put it to the test on the first day of it's release with a trip to New Zealand.  Love this little camera and the Fuji prime lenses.","First, let me state that so far, the camera has met all of my photographic expectations. Now, having stated that, let me state why I gave a four star rating.<br /><br />My major complaint is with the included owner's manual. Yes, it covers everything and, it needs to because this is a complex piece of electronics. It does not, however, at any time indicate what is the default setting for any option. To verify, the user must access the in-camera menu system. I expect better than that for a product in this price range.<br /><br />One other issue that may be worth mentioning. There is a setting in the shooting menus for Dynamic Range (DR). By default (see above), it is set to 100. I found that resetting it to AUTO gave much better results in common shooting situations.<br /><br /> Since, out of the box, most everything is set to AUTO, I don't know why this was not.","This is a great camera. I've been following Fujifilm for some time and just knew this was the time to make the move (out of respect for the camera systems I've used before I won't mention them and they served me well in the past). Between the reasonably priced lenses, the great picture/image quality and finally the ease of use of this camera is just outstanding. The fact that I've been following photographers on instagram that are fujifilm users just solidified the X-T2 was the one to jump in with. And shooting both RAW and jpeg at the same time on two separate cards gives me some peace of mind that card failure won't lose all my photos (happened to me once and lost some great photos).<br /><br />I did not get the kit lens. I'm either wide angle landscape, street or close up action photography from a distance (think safari in Africa here where I can be easily a kilometer away from the animals I'm photographing).<br /><br />A couple of my notes. I need geo tagging of photographs so got the Fujifilm Camera Remote app for my Android and that seems to be working (update: nope, it only records initial position. Had to get another android app that records GPS and then integrate that into photos in LR. And even that is not accurate, sigh).<br /><br /> The camera even flashes a red icon (had to look it up) that told me the geotagging data was stale (this was after getting home and downloading some photos). I also transferred a few photos to my Android for my wife (she needed some photos for a meeting) which was a total breeze. [edit Oct 18, 2016] I've since converted to using a gps logger app on my Android and marrying the track data to the photos in Lightroom.<br /><br />One annoyance was constantly hunting for the \"wireless communications\" setting (in order to use the Android app for geotagging) which was X-T2 menu button then left down down down then right down down down down down... you get the picture. I replaced the white balance function button to be wireless communication as my kind of photography doesn't mess with the white balance as much as I need geotagging. I put the phone into geotagging mode and I'm set. What I'm still not clear on is if I need to leave the app running on the phone. I do and I put the phone screen to sleep.<br /><br />Speaking of function buttons I love how these interact with the camera and can even override the manual dials (for like the AF setting). The various film modes is also nice and since I also do a lot of B&W the Archos setting is going to be a frequent switch for me. And it is fairly easy to switch button functions so I suspect I may be customizing the buttons as I gain more experience with the X-T2.<br /><br />I started with the 18-135mm lens. I'll probably get a couple of primes for street photography and landscapes then find something for truly long distance photography (definitely before my next safari trip).<br /><br />I'm also going to get the grip. When it comes to action/sports I can see having the extra boost in shots being a potential winner for me getting that one shot I need. And when I'm on an all day shoot it will certainly not hurt having the extra battery power in the grip. [Edit Oct 18, 2016 Got the grip and loving it. It does not come with batteries so order those too. But the grip makes this camera last longer too. I was surprised how quickly the camera ran out of battery juice just in a few hours of shooting].<br /><br />The fact that AF can be locked and override autofocus was also a draw for me. [edit Oct 18, 2016 in AF+MF you can use the manual focus ring to adjust focus which is useful in macro mode if the camera is focusing on the wrong part of the frame. ]<br /><br />Operation wise this camera rocks. I have not noticed any lag in any operation I've played with (wireless seems a little slower than it should be but I don't know if that is the Android app or the X-T2 or the combination of the two). Auto focus is not only fast but the shutter button to photo is near instantaneous. And I love the electronic viewfinder. LCD panels on the back are all nice and fine up until I can't see diddly because the sun is in the wrong spot and no manner of mucking with the screen position helps me see what is in the viewfinder. Being able to put my eye (wearing my glasses) right up there and compose and shoot is priceless.<br /><br />The manual dial locks are great as I am the kind of photographer than spins dials unintentionally because I am clumsy. The one dial that doesn't lock I've already managed to turn from zero.<br /><br />The only thing I'm not thrilled with is the camera neck strap. I may reuse an older, longer strap as I like my camera to hang further down than my midsection. [edit ended up with BlackRapid R-sport strap]","PURE PERFECTION: This camera body reminds me of why I switched to the Fuji mirrorless system in the first place. Fuji is committed to making great products and updating those products through firmware or new versions, and THEY LISTEN TO THEIR CUSTOMERS about what needs improvement! This camera addressed all the misgivings I had about the X-T1 (which was an excellent camera), notably:<br /><br />-- 24 MP: awesome resolution. I couldn't believe the detail on some of my test shots!<br />-- Slightly larger: XT1 felt a bit like a toy. Everything is the right size on this camera and it feels more professional<br />-- Autofocus is excellent and fast. Joystick adjustment is great for choosing focus point quickly.<br />-- Locking adjustment dials<br />-- Fixed the cheap plastic doors for memory card and AV inputs<br /><br />Sell your XT-1 and buy this body. You will not regret. If you are new to Fuji, welcome. In my opinion, this camera is far superior to any DSLR body in this price range.","Unless you have a compelling reason to love the optical viewfinder on the Fuji X-Pro2, this is the best Fuji camera made bar none.  Except maybe the rumored medium format to be announced late 2016...  Alright, best Fuji camera under $5000.  The comparisons with the X-Pro 2 are valid up to a point - I actually have both cameras, and if I had to pick one, between the two I'd keep the X-T2.  It is a better all around camera - it accepts the 100-400 mm without blocking an optical viewfinder and it better balances with all of the lenses.  I love the X-Pro2 - the rangefinder aesthetic, the handling, even the optical viewfinder.  But the glorious EVF, the accessory grip, the tilt screen - all of those just tip the X-T2 into being the best.","Finally got the machine. Really loved this one. It's a big upgrade from XT1. Solid, fast focus and lot of controls. Fuji is getting better and better!","My journey with Fuji starts off familiar to many other photographers.  I've always used and still use a Big Nikon DSLR for work but, wanted something a bit more portable for day to day photos.  I wind up buying the X100 and then moving on to X-T1. From the beginning to the end the X-T1 became a much better camera via Firmware upgrades.  Once the X-T2 was announced I knew I wanted to upgrade.  While originally I thought it would be a minor to mid upgrade it turned outs to be a major upgrade.  The X-T2 improved every aspic of its predecessor.  While I still use my D810 for work, mainly due to CaptureOne Tethering support.  This new Fuji Camera is very capable all while keeping its size much smaller, which is great while Traveling.<br /><br />If you're coming from film Cameras like the Nikon FM3a and Canon AE-1, you're going to fill right at home with all the manual controls. The overall layout of the camera is very intuitive, that coupled with a wide selection of lenses, makes it a great system to buy in to.<br /><br />Initially, I was thinking of buying a Sony a7r but found their lens selection to be abysmal.  Also, Fuji understands photographers, while Sony is just making bigger and bigger lenses all in all while changing their mount again and again.  That does not inspire me to buy into that system.","Ahh - the Fuji X I've been waiting for!","Outstanding image quality from an APS-C sensor that rivals some full frames. The quality supersedes my old 1D Mark IV. The ACROS film simulation is extraordinary. I just want to shoot black and white now. 14 FPS (electronic shutter) and 11 FPS (mechanical) makes me NOT miss my 1Dx at all.  The AF system is vastly improved. I had no problems shooting basketball. Highly recommend adding the booster.","As a professional photographer by trade, and I have been using Fujifilm's X-T1 model daily for over a year now, since switching to mirrorless in 2014.  Fujifilm's X-T1 has proven to be and excellent and reliable camera for nearly everything I shoot from portraiture, landscapes, and architectural interiors.<br />Yesterday, I received the new X-T2 and the Vertical Booster Pack from Amazon and I immediately put Fuji's new flagship thorough it's paces testing every feature I could, and I can enthusiastically report that the X-T2 is a significant improvement over its very capable predecessor.  Fujifilm's excellent management team is known for listening carefully to their customers needs and Fuji has significantly improved and refined this flagship model to the point where it can now \"definitely\" compete with any DSLR or mirrorless camera on the market today.  For producing image quality and autofocus speed and accuracy the X-T2 is exceptional, and it does this for a lot less money than the competition.  If you liked the X-T1 or you've been thinking of switching to the new mirrorless systems then you are going to absolutely love the X-T2, because the X-T2 is a very serious professional instrument and I can see many photo-enthusiasts and professional photographers making the jump to the mirrorless world via the X-T2 in the coming months.  So now with the addition of the X-T2 and Fujifilm's amazing line of outstanding lenses Fuji customers finally have a mature and capable system that they can rely on for any type of photography.  But aside from the beautiful image quality and the renowned Fuji Film colors and sharpness, one thing that really should be included here in this review is something that you will hear over and over again from the people who use and love their Fuji cameras, and that is, that when you first hold one in your hand you'll immediately appreciate the beautiful retro design and the unique feeling of total control that these cameras impart to their user.  These cameras seem to literally pump life and excitement back into your photographic adventures and I honestly don't know of any other camera system out there that does this as well as the Fujifilm X System.  After testing it and seeing the breathless images it produces, I can with confidence say that the new X-T2 is simply a masterpiece and Fujifilm's finest camera to date.<br /><br />Update 1/30/17 - Five month continuous use with my X-T2/Booster and the combo is working flawlessly.  The X-T2 files are superior to my former X-T1 and the X-Trans III sensor in the X-T2 is working much better with Adobe Camera Raw in Photoshop and Lightroom than its predecessor.  Over 90 full day shoots and zero problems to report and the camera's battery performance is still exceptional.  Seriously, this camera is a dream to use and it's great knowing I have reliable tools when I show up for a shoot.  All Fuji lenses working perfectly too.","First of all, I do take photos for living. I use Canon 5Dmkiii and 1dX for studio use. Also had Sony A7 and RX100mk iv for personal use. Sony makes great camera and better specs than Fuji. But they don't last long. Both camera broke down on me within a year. RX100??!!! Broke 3times within a year and recent issue lens isn't closing in for some reason. So I had to service it again...Anyways,this tells me how I am so frustrate it with Sony cameras. With all the high end expansive professional camera gear background, I bought a first Fuji camera just because I need a small and convenient size camera for personal use, plus to replace Sony camera. My first impressions? It feels like a toy to me. I mean it feels pretty solid and nicely designed. But compare to 5d and 1dx, (I know it's unfair comparison) It's a toy in a good way. I tested Fuji X-t2 on wedding ceremony. It was pretty good for mirrorless camera. It handled so well, I think I can use this camera for the next event even though I bought it for personal use. I hope this camera last long like Canon cameras....I am happy right now with Fuji X-T2 so far.","Switching from the X-T1 body to X-T2 there are some interesting things that I have noticed from my first shoot. The camera wakes up fast, nearly instantly, the camera is ready to shoot when turned on. The lag between shots is nearly gone or seems much faster. The focus system is not perfect, but out of 80 shots this time, I found fewer out of focus than expected with the X-T1, though some may be to my not understanding all of the modes well enough to use them correctly. I shot some video also, and the results were very good. The moire and color problems seem fixed. The focus was good.  Each clip came out as expected. For the casual shooter, this makes the camera excellent for an overall camera.  Lightroom users will be happy to here that the larger images still move quickly (USB3) and develop nearly as fast and the new compressed RAW format works flawlessly.  (Although, Fastone downloads faster than Bridge). It was a hot day, in the 90's and dusty and I noticed that the hand grip area of the camera was noticeably warm when shooting continuously or in movie mode.  This could be a problem down the road, but we'll have to wait and see.","Great upgrade from x-t1","Having been amazed with the XT1 for the last two years the XT2 is probably as close to a perfect camera for all around use as you can find. Sold my Nikon equipment after initially buying and using a 100S and then adding the  XT1 and never once have I been sorry for switching.","Short version:<br />-24MP APS-C, weather sealed body, built in Wifi, Tilt screen with three angles. USB 3 direct charging and two UHS-II SD card slots<br />-Excellent ergonomics, buttons and overall mechanical design (significant improvements over original X-T1)<br />-BEST AF System to date in any mirrorless system available as of today. This is as close as it gets to DSLR fast action AF<br />-4K: 30 fps for 10 min and 30 min with booster grip, F-log flat profile and 4k over HDMI<br />-No GPS, No touch screen, No built-in flash in case you are looking for one<br /><br />In short, for those of you aware of how 5D Mark III has been a proven work horse in DSLR world for many many years, XT series is exactly the same thing in mirrorless world. XT1 was just a beginning. XT2 is truly a versatility/quality King much like 5DIII in DSLR world. Will XT2 be as reliable as 5D III ? Time will tell. However based on history of X series cameras I can certainly count on it being reliable for years to come.<br /><br />Long version:<br />Let me begin with some background about Fuji cameras in general for those of you new to Fuji X series cameras. Fuji has a long long history in Film making and photo equipment and not many on consumer side are aware of their prowess in this area. Very recently (last 6 years) Fuji introduced X series and it totally changed the landscape of photography for both enthusiasts and professional photographers. Fuji combined the retro style, ergonomics and features that truly gave a \"liberating\" experience to photographers. It all started with Fuji's introduction of X100 back in year 2010. As I have been following Fuji X system, I observed a few things about Fuji as a manufacturer. It is important to outline these because that is what makes Fuji so much different than any other photo equipment manufacturer.<br />-Fuji listens to photographers and continually improves upon and delivers in the next model/series they come up with<br />-Fuji has been consistent in their approach and strategy in providing quality X series cameras without sacrificing form factor (weight, size) or image quality. I hope Fuji does not go full frame route much like Sony did. That only increases the bulk and weight of lenses produced for mirrorless.<br />-Fuji's focus seems to be in providing both quality equipment and regular firmware updates. These firmware updates are not mere bug fixes or enhancements to support new lenses but many a times they have been major updates to the extent that they actually gave you a brand new camera that they could have sold you as next version of the same series. In fact, Fuji has managed to provide firmware updates to many of their X series cameras that are more than 2-3 year old.<br /><br />Fuji's approach as a software company/technology company than merely a hardware company:<br />What is unique about \"regular firmware updates\" approach is that Fuji knows that is the need of this era. What I mean is that Fuji has been acting as an agile company fulfilling photographer needs rather than being a hardware company that would want to sell you more than ever versions of marginally improved hardware to boost sales. We all know how Nokia was a great hardware company and that is it. It all ended there. Nokia was not agile enough to think like a software company. Fuji is precisely doing that! Anyway, the reason I wanted to bring that up is because that will be a big deciding factor in which of camera companies survive and actually deliver what consumers, enthusiasts and pros want in future. Fuji seems to be on right track in that regard. Please note: I don't work for Fuji nor does Fuji pay me to write this. I just thought that this was truly deserved credit Fuji needed to be given even before anyone even considers any of their X series cameras.<br /><br />Back to X-T2:<br />Who is this camera for? For consumers, enthusiasts and professionals everyone! X-T2 pretty much looks like X-T1. However under the hood there are many improvements. First thing to notice is that X-T2 has been designed to operate in two modes.<br />-It can be a stand alone camera which makes it small, light (relative to DSLRs and other bigger mirrorless bodies) and yet provide enough power for general purpose photography and even fast AF up to 8 fps. It can be paired with primes or even reasonably sized zooms and will balance well.<br />-It can be paired with a grip. In this mode its performance can be boosted. Also with grip it can be paired with heavier lenses and balances well with those. With grip it achieves 11 fps and also 30min 4k video.<br /><br />Some specs worth noting are:<br />-X-T2 boasts 24MP X-Trans III and X Processor Pro (the same sensor and processor used in X-Pro2)<br />-325 AF points (169 of which offer phase detection)<br />-AF point selection joystick (This came out first in X-Pro2)<br />-3\" 1.04M-dot tilt LCD screen that flips up and down for shots from up top or from shooting things up high from hip or from ground. It also flips sideways only on one side but does not flip in reverse unlike some of articulating screens on Canon DSLRs<br />-5 fps continuous shooting with live view updates between capture (8fps without live view and grip, 11 fps without live view and grip, 14 fps with electronic shutter)<br />-Viewfinder is new OLED brighter version and also HUGE. Anyone used to XT1 may not find much difference other than brightness.<br />-Dual SD Card Slots (UHS-II type) that are ideal in pro/wedding type of photography where one card can have backups. You can also shoot raw on one and jpegs on another OR stills one one and video on another.<br />-First XT/Xpro series camera to offer USB charging. You no longer need to remove battery, charge in its charger and put it back in camera. Simply connect camera to a USB slot in your laptop or any charger and it charges<br />-It uses a new NP-W126S lithium-ion battery that is supposed to be resilient to overheating issues. This is mainly designed keeping its 4k capability in mind. You can also use older NP-W126 batteries that work with X-E2, X-T1, X-Pro2.<br />-New battery achieves 340 shots in one charge. When using grip you can add two more batteries in addition to one in camera giving you more than 1000 shots making it ideal for wedding photography.<br />-Mechanical shutter of max 1/8000s and electronic shutter of max 1/32000s, Shutter flash sync speed 1/250s<br />-AF Custom settings much like you find on Canon 7DII. These settings are very handy in order to adjust tracking, speed and<br />zone area when shooting sports/wildlife<br />-Better EVF refresh rate of 100fps (Supposedly X Pro2 is going to get firmware updates in October that will bring it to same refresh rate)<br /><br />X-T2 feels great in hands. Its slightly bigger/heavier than X-T1. It even has improved, thicker grip that is noticeable if you handle X-T1 and X-T2 both at the same time. Rest of it pretty much feels like X-T1. Dials have improved whereby now ISO and shutter dials are lockable. They have toggle button up at the top that can toggle to either lock dial in one position or keep it free to rotate. This comes out of complains from previous model where users found accidentally bumping dials resulting in changed settings. USB charging is a welcome addition. Gone are days of removing battery putting it in charger and then putting it back in the camera. I feel that every camera manufacturer should have USB charging built into the camera. Tilt screen seems a little awkward at first but one gets used to it later on. Awkward because of its slide tilt which is not like Canon's articulating screens. I wish Fuji had articulating screen than the awkward side ways tilt. Hopefully the new tilt screen proves to be weather sealed. That only time will tell as we hear more pros putting this camera to test in wildlife/sports photography in inclement weather. Addition of joystick at the back is another welcome feature. This has been adopted from X Pro2 where it first appeared. Using joystick to pick AF points is so much easier, faster and more intuitive than using the round D-Pad. Talking about AF system. Totally totally improved AF system. One can notice that there is almost no blackout. Per Fuji's spec blackout period has been significantly reduced in high burst shots. This is mainly related to EVF refresh really and nothing to do with camera's ability to do high speed burst. The only downside to notice is fast AF in low light. It is still way improved and even better than X Pro2. However when compared with some of advanced DSLR combos like 7DII with expensive L tele lenses or D500 with Nikon's tele lenses, pros shall notice though marginal difference but only in low light. For most situations in sports and wildlife photography XT2's AF should deliver as promised. What remains to be seen is if Fuji's lens line up can support its latest camera models like this one. At present Fuji has only one tele XF100-400 OIS for sports/wildlife photography. Of course one can use 50-140 but that one does not have enough range especially in wildlife situations. Colors and image quality from X-T2 is totally outstanding. Much like what you would have seen in X-Pro2. The X-Trans III sensor delivers superior images than the previous version. X-T1 was great as well in image quality but there is something about color rendition of X-trans III that makes X-Pro2 and X-T2 images totally pop out!<br /><br />Finally downsides to consider when purchasing this camera:<br />-No GPS, No Touch screen, No built-in flash<br />-Tilt screen is not articulating the side way tilt is little awkward but I guess as many use it in the field its practical uses shall emerge<br />-Little heavier, bigger than X-T1 and even X-Pro2. This is not a downside but can be if some users expected for the next model to be lighter. Plus it can be fair to think of that as you can see the latest 5D Mark IV is also lighter than its predecessor. However, I believe the little more weight and size also has to do with heat sink Fuji had to employ inside this camera to deal with 4K that actually gives you impressive 10 min and 30 min(with grip) recording capability<br /><br />Overall, another winner X series body delivered by Fuji again!","Perfect camera..

The A6300 is an incredibly powerful piece of kit that, beneath it's very easy to use \"auto\" modes, has a plethora of often extremely useful shooting options that require explanation to understand. It also has one of the most complicated & opaque on-board menu systems I've come across and an instruction manual that's close to useless. Gary Friedman's excellent book is, in essence, a detailed and very clear user guide that carefully walks you through every menu option while explaining what it does and why you may (or may not) wish to use it - by the end of it you'll feel that you're in control of your A6300 rather than the other way round.<br /><br />Second, if you're intending to use your A6300 for regular video shooting, to reprogram button \"C1\" that sits next to the shutter release as the video on/off button and to then set the camera up so that this button only works when the camera is in \"Movie\" mode - within a short time of trying to use the camera in its \"out of the box\" configuration you'll understand why these two changes will make shooting video so much easier. Trying to explain how to do this using Sony's labyrinthian menu system would take too long, which, of course, is why you need a guide book like Gary Friedman's.","Video quality is excellent. Low light performance is superb. I've had it for about three months and I'm still discovering new levels of functionality that blow me away! Not so great in the photo (stills) department, though. Still need my 5D MK II for that. But I bought the A6300 specifically for video, so I'm very happy with it.","I love it .","Amazing and small camera. Still getting used to the electronic viewfinder but it's growing on me. It feels solid in my hand even though it's compact.","Wanted to get into pictures and video. Looked at the a6000 but went with this camera for the 4K capabilities and sensor size. Overall a wonderful camera and I enjoy it very much!","This camera meets every single one of my expectations! There are no issues or things I wish the camera had. I love it!","4k recording.  a6500 is out","This is a spectacular camera. Designed well, compact, with today's best tech.","fantastic","great camera to bring everywhere you go i have the a7rII but this is the camera i bring to most places unless I'm shooting professionally","One of the best crop sensor cameras on the market. Huge step up in focusing from the A6000. Only thing to make it any better would be is if it was weather sealed.","Love this camera!  Bought it specifically for the face recognition, and eye-focusing.  Eye focusing has it's limitations (such as if half the face is covered with a scarf or beanie). but other than that, I can finally get sharp images of my son running towards me full speed!","[[VIDEOID:ada1ac6fa2cf5dbbbe5950f27ffbfb21]] The A6300 have excellent high iso performance for such a small form factor camera. The included 16-50mm kit lens is also very useful, just a little fragile so be careful not to bump the lens into anything.<br /><br />4K video quality is amazing, only limited by the overheating issue when camera records more than 10 min of 4k footage it heats up pretty quickly to the point of auto-shutdown. So the camera is good for small clips but not for extended 4k recording.<br /><br />With proper adapters you can put many nice lenses from Nikon or Canon on it. It's even got focus peaking so manual focusing is a breeze. You can also use speedboosters (pricey) to magically increase Aperture size and field of view of many Nikon or Canon optics by 1 stop on the A6300.","I was looking for a camera with 120FPS video and was thrilled to find this. It is an excellent camera all around. I love it! The kit lens is better than I expected (I guess I didn't expect decent Bokeh). Camera is great in low light. Great automatic exposure. Great and fast focusing. Super quality video. Great continuous focus during video. I've been using a Canon 60D, which I like, but I'm really happy with the a6300 as my all purpose still photos camera and my specialty video camera.","Good camera, bought from Russia","Loaded with features.","I just purchased a SONY A6300 for a change of pace. It is a great little camera. I usually buy most of my gear on AMAZON but the prices were too high on here so I purchased it NEW from another big box camera seller for $998 and got $200 in rebates back. Upon unpacking the camera I could not help but notice how small and light weight it was. I have been carrying around Canon pro gear the world with me most of my life for still images and I wanted to give my body a break (pardon the pun) so I opted to try out the SONY system. I have been shooting with SONY BROADCAST CAMERAS for years being a Network Cameraman and the quality has always been great. The build quality is very good and lenses connect with a very secure and tight click. I have read a lot about the limitations in lenses that SONY provides for this camera but who cares when you can add a Metabones adapter and add whatever glass you want to put on the front. I feel the versatility that I had with my OLD CANNON F1 35mm system again. The great thing is I can go back to my old FD lenses I loved that have been sitting in my closet in my old road case for years. The camera affords an extreme amount of versatility. I bought the Sony 18 to 105 F4 PZ to go with it and I am using my Canon 10 to 22mm EF-S Lens on a Metabones MK3 adapter presently. It works OK, but a friend put his Metabones MK4 on it and it was a vast improvement. I will be doing a separate review on the Metabones MK3 as well as the Sony 18 to 105 F4 PZ at a later date. Overall I would advise spending the extra $$ on the Sony 18 to 105 F4 PZ if you are a video guy. It affords you more versatility than the KIT lens and better quality. If you add a good shotgun microphone you have a great production tool. Check back here for updates and you can also visit my YouTube site for more info and a review.","Best sony product I've gotten so far. Bought this brand new from amazon because that is how I like my products and from the first day I got it I have always been able to get what I needed out of this camera, for example. 4k mode is perfect quality purposes along with its capability in shooting in low light compares almost to the A7S camera's. What's great about this is the autofocusing is insanely good! With over 400 dots to automatically autofocus without me having to manually do anything! I always put this puppy on my Ronin-M and never have to touch it or change anything. This camera also shoots in 60 and 120 FPS which is incredible for slow motion use. I definitely recommend this camera.","I bought this camera as a second one to my Canon 5D Mark III.  The screen on the back has an excellent quality, this camera takes amazing pics.  I tested it on a trip with the office and the photos are amazing.  When I ordered mine, 2 weeks later Sony announced the A6500 touch screen.  At first I was upset but then I was like, why do I need a touch screen.  When taking photos, we are behind the lens looking through an eye piece.  If I want a touch screen I should get a point and shoot or use my IPhone.  Touch screens are nice but the only way to become better is to practice, practice, practice.  Back to this A6300.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this camera to someone else to have as a primary first time photographer or as a back up to an SLR camera.  I also purchased the Sony 18-105 lens, overall I am very happy with it.","good body but the 16-50lens is xxxx.","I love all the features of this camera.  Only downside there is no headphone port but it has a direct mic line in and shows two channels recording.  The camera in general picks up good sound.  There are a ton of features on it and a big menu.  The screen is a decent size but could be bigger.  I shot this weekend with it and the picture quality even not on 4k is great.  I am so happy with this camera its actually helping me get more work also.  Another great feature is there is a dual recording mode it can make 4k and 720p at the same time.  Am so glad I got this camera!  I was a little nervous buying this used because of the seller and it coming from the warehouse. I found a scam on a lot of cameras where they write in an email.  This one didn't have that but I had amazon double check it was in the warehouse.  I am so pleased with this!<br />I so so love this camera, had to update my review.  I just had a bad experience with a volunteer boss who tried to say she owned my footage.  For people buying this camera you can make it watermark you're photos with a copyright and even put you're name in and the person you are working for.  Love Love love this feature and its not on every camera!","This is the best camera I have ever had. I take close photos of kittens so I purchased a 30mm fixed lens. With your smartphone you can control the camera's functions to capture. You can also upload pictures wirelessly to your smart phone or computer.","not mac compatable, need stupid conversion programs so I can edit clips in Final cut.<br />Photos are amazing","A 'jack of all trades' camera that is near the 'master' at most of them.  My daily driver.  Really wish that it had in body image stabilization, but overall image and video quality is superb.","Just so you know where this review is coming from.  I'm not a newbee to photography, I've owned an NEX-5N, NEX-6, RX-100, and a few older sony cybershots.  I tried Canon and Nikon.  I swear I really wanted to like one of them but I've found Sony a much easier camera to use.  I've never been let down.  My previous camera being an NEX-6 which I've used for over 2 years and couldn't wait for the next upgrade so I jumped on this one as soon as it came out.  My biggest struggle with the NEX-6 was autofocus.  It wasn't fast enough for me to keep up with my toddlers.  I can't tell you how many pictures I've missed because autofocus wasn't fast enough, so it was well worth it for me to step up and pay the premium for this camera.  Had I the chance to do it over, I would've purchased the a6000 2.5 years ago instead of the NEX-6, and probably wouldn't have upgraded to the a6300.  I say that because I don't shoot video in 4K.  After reading other reviews, that's the biggest upgrade from the a6000 to the a6300.  Either way, I'm fine with it.  I am getting into video, I just don't feel shooting in 4k is necessary just yet.  I don't even own a 4k TV, and from what I hear, editing in 4k is a pain the in butt.<br /><br />Sony makes fantastic cameras.  I was recently looking into the newly released Nikon D500 and finally I can say Nikon is making a decent camera.  However, It's double the cost of this one, and the only advantage I can see is the touchscreen. That's a lie actually, Nikon has cheaper lenses.  I mean, having access to a 16-80mm F2.8-4 is pretty remarkable.  I really wish Sony had lenses that were comparable.  I recently purchased the 18-105mm F4, and it's a great lens.  Very bulky, but it does the job and it helps a ton for video so I'm happy.  I just wish there was an affordable f2.8 option.<br /><br />Back to the camera.  It kinda hit me like a brick when I saw the a6500 was announced.  After all, I had been reading rumors for over a year now talking about how the next \"a6100\" was going to have 5-axis internal stabilization, and was upset that the a6300 didn't include that but I purchased anyway.  I would've waited.  But I can't complain.  I'm happy Sony is making progress and maybe next year I'll purchase the a6500.  I have plenty of lenses with OSS so I should be fine.<br /><br />My camera isn't having any of the over heating issues I've read about. That's probably because I don't record in 4k. The only small issue I've come  across with my camera is a memory card error.  I forgot what it says exactly, something about not reading correctly, but it does read and write just fine.  So no complaints.  I'm guessing I may be using a wrong memory card.<br /><br />My main type of shooting include, tracking my kids and catching their moments.  I enjoy sports photography, especially Volleyball.  Volleyball is tricky because I have to shoot close to 1/2000 shutter speed and preferably at F2.8 or as close to that as possible to get enough light since it's always indoors.  Also I do portraits for friends and family.  I've gotten amazing results with this camera.  I usually do that with my 50mmF1.8.  It may only be a $250 lens but it's spectacular and I love that lens.  I own the sigma 30mm and it's a great second choice for portraits.  My next lens will be the sigma F1.4 that was recently released.  I also love to pair this camera with my 20mm pancake lens.  The camera fits in my pocket when the 20mm is on.  I love it!<br /><br />You seriously can't go wrong with this camera, unless you desperately need touchscreen and internal stabilization, then wait for the a6500. Or save yourself $400, maybe more if they drop the price, and buy this one.  It's worth it.  Plus, What does Canon or Nikon offer that's comparable, in this price range?","Love this camera!","Excellent camera with the 30 mm SELF1.8 lens.  The overheating problem is a real issue.  On firmware 1.0, it would overheat recording 4K at around 15 minutes.  With firmware 1.10, it will give the overheat sign at 25 minutes.  I was able to get it to go 45 minutes (ran out of patience) by doing the following:<br />1. a cage like fortyrig a6300 cage<br />2. copper heatsink plate here:PS3 Fat Slim Copper Pad Shims Shim Heatsink YLOD Repair Kit Fix + Thermal Paste but any 20mm by 20mm copper plate should work.<br />3.Neewer AC Power Supply Adapter AC-PW20 Replacement for Sony Alpha<br />4.Battery Plate for Sony F970 F550 w/ Dc Cable - 752<br />5.Generic Replacement for Sony NP-F550 Digital Camera Battery.<br /><br />The copper plate goes between the cage and the bottom of the camera with the thermal paste to ensure full contact for heat transfer from the camera to the cage.<br />The dummy battery and external battery allows for more cooling as well as longer run time.<br /><br />All this is mounted on a Beholder DS1 which allows for silky smooth cinematic footage.<br /><br />Updated - tested in room filming a movie.

I love how compact it is, and the wifi feature.  So so excited to learn the ins and outs!","Fabulous vacation pictures! Wifi works great with my iPhone...best camera ever!","Best mirrorless camera available.","I don't at all like the higher ISO noise amounts. At 800 and 1600 there is really quite noticeable noise. The photos look EXCELLENT in the camera, but kind of fall apart on PC screens. I was really disappointed in this.<br /><br />The autofocus is pretty good, but often just picks the closest object. The manual focus always seems just a little OFF, I think if you're using the viewfinder or the LCD, it's very easy to think you got the correct focus and it's actually just a little off.<br /><br />Along those lines, the aperture in the camera looks different than on the PC. I think Sony did some excellent work on their screens but overall, I found a lot of my photos that appeared perfect in camera were less than on the PC.<br /><br />It mostly comes down to the noise. I think the camera is EXCELLENT at video! If I wanted a video camera, this would be one of my first choices. But I wanted a good still camera.","I have upgraded to the a6300 from the a6000, love the durability and feel, EVF is night and day better!  Focusing is super fast, video is fantastic!  I primarily shoot photos of my family and primarily use the 20mm f2.8 pancake with flash diffuser....it's all I need for sharp vibrant pics......love the size and portability!  All my other lenses stay in my case 80% of the time......fantastic camera!","Great camera for a good price. A lot of useful settings for professional work. There was a Sony A6500 $ 400 more expensive. It has 5-axis stabilizer, and a touchscreen display. However, the headphone is not added. Today Sony A6300 is probably one of the best solutions in terms of price quality.","Beautiful camera. Thanks.","This is a FANTASTIC camera!!!  I am used to SLR cameras, but decided to try the mirrorless camera in order to have a more compact camera. I was skeptical about the ability of the camera to show an accurate representation with an electronic reproduction. But this camera really exceeded my expectations. The electronic reproduction is very clear, accurate and shows depth of field just like an SLR would. It has all the bells and whistles of my previous Nikon SLR as well, all the automatic and manual settings. I purchased the body only and paired it with an 18-300 f3.5-6.3 zoom lens, which is very versatile. I took over 1,000 photos with this camera on a recent trip to Europe and they came out great. Most of the time I used the auto setting, only using manual when the situation dictated it. I installed the PlayMemories app on my iPad and was able to easy transfer photos from the camera to the iPad. I would highly recommend this camera.","very good camera,sadly, Sony just launched A6500, might be a better option because of its touch screen............","This is an outstanding camera for my needs. I had a Sony RX100-II for the first two years of my daughter's life and I was so disappointed in the slow and uneven autofocus on that camera and I found the image quality to be generally not great. I was thinking of turning back to the clunky DSLR world before a friend encouraged me to check this camera out.<br /><br />First, a quick summary of what I'm using this camera for and how I use it. I am a mom of one, soon to be two, and I wanted a relatively compact camera with excellent autofocus that would take significantly better quality pictures of my kiddos than my iphone. I was particularly interested in something with good low-light capabilities and that had high quality lenses available. I am not a professional photographer but have taken photography classes and am comfortable using a camera in manual and other non-auto modes. I use adobe lightroom to process my photos after taking them. I shoot in JPEG-fine because the version of lightroom that I have doesn't process RAW files for this camera and I didn't feel it was worth paying for the upgrade. I primarily use a 35mm-1.8 lens on this camera but also bought the 20mm 2.8 pancake lens for when I need the camera to be very portable.<br /><br />The autofocus on this camera is sick. It focuses incredibly fast and catches my active toddler while running, jumping, tumbling, etc. The eye-lock focus feature is especially useful when shooting kids because it prioritizes their eyes above all else, giving a high success rate of pictures that are in focus. I shoot with that feature on most of the time and I also shoot in a continuous mode, so that I get several of the same shot in rapid succession. Between the two features, I have had a great success rate. Are they all in focus? No, but most are, and the continuous shooting also helps get a couple different shots of a smile, so you can pick the best one. (There is also a smile shutter feature that I have not tried out yet).<br /><br />The other feature I like is being able to set a minimum shutter speed that kicks in before the ISO starts to bump up. If I take pictures of my kid inside our house in the evening, it's nice to be able to keep the camera at a 1/125 to catch her. I considered getting the a6000 but got the a6300 because it had this feature. It allows me to use the camera on aperture priority mode without worrying that the camera is going to go down to 1/30 and I'll only get blurry photos. Being able to use the camera in a partial manual mode but still kind of forget about it and just take pictures is a huge perk for me and very worth it.<br /><br />The kit lens is a little disappointing and I probably wouldn't buy it if I had to do it over again. I also bought a 35mm 1.8 lens and a 20mm 2.8 pancake lens. Both are great and serve their purpose but the 35mm 1.8 lens takes better quality photos. The 20mm pancake is the one I use when people other than me (my husband, friends) will be using the camera because the focal length is similar to an iphone when used on a sensor of the size this camera has. (So if you pass your camera off to someone who is also taking a picture with an iphone, he/she isn't going to have to step backwards or reframe the photo and you are less likely to have to explain what a prime lens is and why it doesn't zoom.)  The 20mm also makes the camera very compact, which is a nice perk.<br /><br />Between the quality of the lenses you can buy and the autofocus, I'm not sure I can adequately express the joy I get from taking pictures with this camera.","One of the greatest cameras out there, moved on from canon 70D and this thing outperforms it in every possible way<br />Word of advice, buy the a6300 body and Sigma lens converter so that you can reuse your canon lenses.<br />It didn't get all 5 stars from and that's mainly due to image stabilization (which is available in the Sony alpha 6500) and the terrible Sony 16-50 mm lens.","I am an amateur videographer and am still learning about the features of this camera, but can give you some useful feedback.  From my research, it appears to be one of the best buys for 4k recording, image quality, 120fps slow motion, and low light capture.  I record video primarily at night, and the videos looked grainy, so I bought another lense with a wider aperature, the SEL35F18 35mm f/1.8.  This has improved the image quality tremendously.  The SEL50F18 is cheaper than the SEL35 and accomplishes the same in terms of light absorption, but I needed a wider angle lense because when I record 4k the camera crops in and the image is zoomed in more than normal.<br />Even though I am primarily recording video, I bought this camera rather than a dedicated camcorder because I record at night and I wanted more manual controls.  I like that I have more control over aperature and shutter speed and have better options for lenses with wide aperature.<br />For the price range, this camera delivers great features, but it has one major drawback for video recording.  The camera overheats and shuts down sometimes.  Depending on the climate and recording conditions, the shut down time can be between 20 minutes to an hour.  Sometimes it doesn't happen at all, but generally I can expect it to happen after 30 minutes.  The camera is still very useful for me, but since I record shows, the overheating can be very frustrating.  Pulling out the lcd helps provide airflow between the screen and the camera and prevent overheating.  Changing the battery often also helps, as the battery heats up.","Me like. Amazing camera. No need to go in depth because there's plenty of information about this camera online but definitely couldn't go wrong with this one.","First off, when I originally received my package for this camera it was an a6000 rather than an a6300. The box and documentation was for an a6300, but the camera inside was an a6000. As usual Amazon's customer service was fantastic and immediately replaced the order for an a6300 without making me wait to return the camera I received. They sent me a prepaid return label for the wrong camera. Amazon's customer service is second to none.<br /><br />Now for the camera, I was shooting a Nikon DSLR but had become tired of the weight and decided to move to mirrorless. After a lot of research, it came down to Sony and Fujifilm. I finally settled on Sony because it was $600 less and smaller than the Fujifilm XT-2. While I do believe the Fujifilm has better ergonomics, the price was too much to overcome for me. The Sony a6300 is unbelievably small for the quality of the shots you get from it. With some customization, the ergonomics can be helped and now that I have been shooting with it for a week I absolutely love it.","I love this thing. I like the small form factor of<br />mirrorless and this delivers. The firmware update seems to have helped any overheating issues. I only had the temperature warning flash, never shut off on me. Definitely would recommend.","This is a an excellent camera you can film 4K off the bat, it has been the gold to camera for beginners wish to start filming movies Music video or just product review, here I leave my cons and pros , and I will talk a bit about that A6500<br />,<br />Pros;<br />1) it has a mirrorless body and for that reason is lighter and easier to carry around<br />2) as most of the features as high end cameras<br />3) actual video quality is excellent and you cannot go wrong if you're just starting (they're obviously things that can be better)<br />4) still photos of the too (again on higher end cameras you will get better results)<br />5) although not the most popular you can still get wide(sort of) range of lenses<br /><br />cons)<br />1) if you're looking for picture quality this is not a full frame camera , you can get better pictures from less pricey cameras<br />2) it has no touch screen!!!!!!!!<br />3) it could do with a better range of lenses<br />4) is big brother the A 6500 is coming out only eight months after its release!!!!!<br /><br />about the a6500<br /> 1) it has a touchscreen!!!!!!!<br />2) it has inbuilt frame stabilisation (Will work on any lens)<br />3) it costs US$1400","One heck of a little camera!  Perfect for vacation.","Love this camera! So easy and compact. The features on this bad boy are endless. Seeing all these negatives about it doesn't bother me. You get used to it. Menu system gets easier as you explore it. No overheating issue. Fixed from the update. And the tilt screen is totally fine. No selfies. But that's okay!<br /><br />All in all. Excellent camera. Image quality is amazing. And 4k? It's crazy how something so small can do that!<br /><br />Can't wait to get some lenses. Then I'll do work for sure!","great camera.","BEST VIDEO CAMERA BY FAR!<br /><br />As a cinematographer, I have professional experience with dozens of cameras...<br /><br />the a6300 is nothing short of a miracle...<br /><br />-Dynamic range is amazing, far beyond anything I've seen outside of a 10 grand cinema camera (about 14 stops more or less with Slog3)<br /><br />-Detail and sharpness are literally perfect, because it's a 6k signal downscaled to 4K. More detail then a bmcc and even more then Sony's own a7sii... WOW!<br /><br />-Big Sensor! The 1.5 crop factor may not sound huge to a stills professional BUT us video people have been stuck with much smaller sensors for a long time....<br /><br />-Slog3 in two flavors! Yes not only does it have the most advanced flat-profile in the industry, but hey even offer two different color variations to suit your taste! (One is more film-ish the other is more what-your-eyes-see)<br /><br />Rolling shutter is bad, but not bad enough to be an issue if you know what to look out for. Don't pan fast or free-hand otherwise everything looks like jelly.<br /><br />This is an expert's camera.<br /><br />6k down sampling to 4K with a 1.5x crop sensor and 14+ stops dynamic range?<br /><br />That's the stuff of dreams XD","Wow, what a big improvement over the a6000, while good, struggled in low light. It had flash sync problems resulting in blurry portrait shots. Still happens on the a6300 but less frequent. What would it be better, worse, or equal to Fuji XT-2? The a6300 is better overall, and for good reason.<br /><br />A6300 is better for the following reasons:<br /><br />Much cheaper to buy.<br />Internal flash that bounces, tilts, unique to Sony but some lesser CyberShot models do not have it though less likely to fail focus due to sync speed phenomenon.<br />Excellent video quality and more codec options. Overheating issue corrected with latest firmware.<br />HDMI allows external recording to various devices, including TV and computers. AVCHD as found in Panasonic cameras is very clean although does not support 4K resolution yet.<br />Screen tilts up but cannot flip out.<br />Three JPEG quality options where larger file size means less compression where RAW is not needed.<br />Almost every lens made compatible but need proper mount accessory.<br />Only model good for sports even in low light but can sometimes struggle. On a6000 this is impossible to get usable results.<br />Corrects vignetting and aberrations in JPEG and RAW. a6000 does this too.<br />Shows battery life percentage meter almost no camera other than smartphone can display. This is a minor but helpful feature because the battery has a chip that tells the system the mA status. Some camcorders like Panasonic have this too.<br /><br />XT-2 is better for the following reasons:<br /><br />Slightly better JPEG quality at higher ISO settings.<br />Metal body but that is barely better than magnesium alloy. More of a suitable material for retrospective design.<br />Better battery life but the battery grip booster is expensive so this is not really a good option for people more interested in spending money for decent lenses and want compact size in favor. Sony offers this for less money and even without it still a great video powerhouse.<br /><br />The two models have in common and work well or lack features:<br /><br />Microphone input.<br />No headphone output.<br />No touch screen, like most cameras still are today.<br />APS-C sensor and 24 MP.<br />Phase detection and contrast detection autofocus, a6300 has more but contrast only in video recording.<br />No image stabilization, again, very few mirrorless or DSLR cameras have it. Only Sony or Fuji lenses with IS are supported. Sony on Sony and Fuji on Fuji.<br />Good viewfinder, but Fuji a little better in regard of blacking out duration barely even noticeable by the human eye.<br />Menu system is different so it is a matter of getting use to, not bad but could be more intuitive.<br /><br />I could think of more but this is a good start for consideration.  Fuji is better for macro but Sony more suited for landscape shots. a6300 is a better value nonetheless. Thanks for reading.","excellent features; light in hand.","Great little camera. I bought this as a 3rd camera to use with my Sony A7s cameras and it's really been quite a pleasant addition. It's very small and responsive. The low light isn't as good as the A7s which is to be expected. I do wish that there was one more dial on it so that I could control ISO, shutter, and aperture with dedicated wheels.","An absolute joy to use.  Check out all the positive reviews on You Tube.  Coming from a DSLR (heavy, bulky) this is a pleasure to have and use.  Fantastic electronic viewfinder, low light photos are really good.  All photos directly from the camera without any editing are the best I have seen in all the past three DSLR's I have owned.","I like this camera a lot, great image quality, but the controls are pretty goofy. Will have to do some study to get the best out of this camera.","This camera is so sharp. I use it with a Beholder gimbal and it shoots flawless, gorgeous movie quality video. Battery life is a concern. I don't use this as a still camera however because it seems slow to process photos. For that I still use my Nikon D3100.","I'm fighting between rating 2 vs 4 stars because with prime fast lens F2.8 and wider (faster) its great. With the Zeiss Batis 85mm F1.8 its fantastic even in low light conditions. However, under the same low-light, non-flash conditions (literally same shot & conditions) using Sony 18-105mm F4 or Sony 70-200mm F4, the results are out of focus (soft) Not even close to crispness of my Nikon D7000 or D750 with equivalent zoom focal length and aperture.  I have spent thousands of hard earned $$$$ on Sony a6000 and a63000 body, lenses and flash to reduce the size & weight vs my Nikon equipment. I do a lot of low light photography. Sony jpeg processing in low light is very good. The auto white balance is flaky at times - but the auto focus in low light frequently misses without fast HEAVY lens.  It seems like the body closes down the aperture before full focus is achieved. Sony's new FAST versions of 70-200mm F2.8 and other G Master (red backed G) are HEAVY - to the point where for a 1/2 lb difference (camera and lens combo) I have much better results with either Nikon D7000 (also ASP-C format) or D750.  Current reviews of Sony a7Rii seem to reflect the same auto focus = requires Fast Heavy lens as I see with Sony a6300. Great results with a6000 & a6300 in DMF or Manual mode.  Like my old Minolta STR-102 (yes 1970's days of film).","Thanks","I bought this for my friend, he loved it and according to him it's one of the best in it class and according to me it is over priced.","I've been wanting a decent portrait camera for the kids for a while now, when I see other people's pictures of their kids that weren't taken with an iPhone. At the same time, I have no interest in carrying around a DSLR - I was into photography decades ago, and had a film SLR, and just didn't take it anywhere.<br /><br />This camera was just the ticket - and much more. In fact, for my intent, I didn't need half the features on this camera - but contrary to popular opinion, I find most of the features extremely easy to use -  and as a result, have been doing far more shooting with it than just family portraits.<br /><br />I drive through some colorful neighborhoods on the way to work, and have gotten in the habit of setting it for high-speed continuous autofocus and burst shooting, taking pictures out the window on almost every commute and getting amazing results.<br /><br />For my intended purpose - kids portraits - I was extremely happy with the first results using the kit lens - but since I added the Sony 50mm 1.8 prime , I have become completely sold on the importance of quality glass. For better or for worse, having a great prime lens gives you the ability to see the inferiority of photos taken with lesser lenses, and pictures which used to look great now look mediocre.<br /><br />A few things you should know about this camera:<br /><br />1. The sensor crops photos, so a 50mm lens is effectively 75mm. You need to do this math for any lens you are considering. A 50mm is of very limited use indoors. The wide-angle primes available are either very expensive or just ok, but usually both.<br /><br />2. There isn't a relatively massive lens lineup compared to some other brands.<br /><br />3. The rolling shutter *is* a problem with video. Too much camera movement/panning and the video turns to jelly. That said, with a steady hand or better yet a tripod, the video is outstanding. I prefer the 60 FPS 1080p to 30p 4k.<br /><br />4. The low-light performance is fantastic, especially with a fast lens.<br /><br />The pictures I posted were all taken with the kit lens and edited in Photoshop.","Although I'm usually wary of Sony products, this camera is incredible. So fast and solid that it feels like a classic mechanical device rather than an electronic gadget. With a Sigma f/1.4 prime lens, every shot is straight out of National Geographic. In about 2000 photos and videos so far, there have been virtually zero pictures that were not beautiful. Video quality is amazing as well, as is slow motion and even the stereo audio recording. Highly recommended!","Excellent quality, small build, internal 4k, great stills- as many have probably mentioned, suffers from some bad rolling shutter though & *can* run into overheating issues depending on environment, shot length, and how long the camera is running (I've personally never dealt w this though). If you can manage the 'negatives', then this camera provides one of the best images and low-light capabilities of any in this price range though.","great !  love it.","Just love sony camera only now. Good for wedding party quick shoot.","The Sony a6300 is an amazing little camera for the money.  I can easily say that it out performs my Canon 5D Mk-2 in most aspects.  The images are sharper (due to the lack of aliasing filters.) and the sensor on the Sony has less noise than my 5D.  The ability to shoot stunning 4K footage blows away the video quality from any Canon 5D.<br /><br />But there are a few quirks that don't allow me to rate this camera a full 5 stars.  There are a few disappointing limitations that I feel the need to point out:<br /><br />1. While this camera can shoot amazing 4K video...  There are some issues with the various modes and scaling.  While the a6300 can shoot using the full width of the sensor in 24P...  It crops and scales in 30P.  So you will loose some field of view & sharpness in all modes except the 4K 24P mode.  The 1080P modes are a real disappointment!  When the a6300 is set to any 1080 mode the image looks soft and aliased.  In fact... It almost looked like a 720 video scaled UP to 1080.  I believe this poor 1080 image quality is due to the sensor scaling methods used to down sample the 4K to 1080 on the fly.  It's just NOT good.  You CAN shoot 4K and render it out at 1080 in post to achieve stunning footage though.  My recommendation would be to shoot in 4K and down sample in post to get the most out of this camera.  The slo motion setting of 120FPS in 1080 also looks just as soft.  (But hey it does shoot 120FPS!)<br /><br />2. The second biggest disappointment is the a6300's tendency to overheat in video 4K modes.  This is a well documented complaint from many users and is also mentioned in the Sony manual.  You can expect 20-30 minutes of shooting at normal room temperatures before the camera will shut down.  Outdoors in the hot sun many people say the camera can overheat in 8-10 minutes.  Some people have suggested they can get a bit more time out of the camera if they flip the LCD screen out and leave the battery door open to help cool the camera.  This heat issue is really a shame for professional users.  The 4K video mode is absolutely stunning when it's working...  But if you are a professional photographer/videogrpaher who needs dependable operation in all climates... I cannot recommend this a6300.  If you are willing to put up with the quirky overheating issue and only shoot video occasionally this camera can produce outstanding video in 4K.<br /><br />Ultimately for my use...  This camera will serve OK.  It's a fantastic value at under $1,000.  I just wish Sony would improve the 1080 video scaling with a firmware update and perhaps address the overheating issue in future models.","Video overheating fixed with firmware update! Great pictures. Took some time to get used to the settings coming from a Canon, but easy to get used to after a while. Wonderful pictures of the little one.<br /><br />Just wish Sony would come out with affordable e-mount lenses comparable to Canon lenses. If they do, they may take over the aps-c market!","I bought this camera to take the photo's for my upcoming book that will be published soon.  I have to say that there is absolutely no comparing it to my husbands old Nikon D40x.  There's no way I could have gotten the pictures I needed with the older Nikon but it was a good camera in its day.<br /><br />With the 24 Megapixel photos, I can crop in post and the photos are still useable.  I prefer to get the composition right the first time but it's nice having the extra resolution to work with.  I'm stepping up from my husband's old Nikon D40x and this is a HUGE step up even though it's a smaller camera.<br /><br />What I like:<br />--------------<br />• Super fast autofocus that really does live up to the hype.<br /><br />• With the 24 Megapixel photos, I can crop without loosing detail.<br /><br />• My favorite lens is the little 35mm 1.8 prime so I love the small size of this camera.<br /><br />• Don't believe the negative reviews that complain about the Sony menu.  Just take the time learn how to use it and move on to enjoy this great camera!<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />---------------------<br />• I really don't like the location that Sony chose to put the SD card.  I have to take the camera off my tripod to get it out and it's kind of tucked in behind the battery which is sometimes a little tricky to get out.<br /><br />• Okay, everyone knows it's a battery hog and this is a bit of an annoyance but I can live with it.<br /><br />• Don't buy the hype about the auto white balance being good enough.  If you're serious about getting color right, use a color calibration card or other tool to set your own white balance.  I tested the auto white balance in my house by taking several photos.  With each photo, I had a different light turned on and I got a different color cast with each photo so auto white balance may be okay for those who don't really care about accurate colors but I do.","Beautiful footage, great for travel!","pricey, but excellent specs, in a very small body.","This camera is incredible for the price, you cant go wrong.  Even though it may not be as light sensitive as the a7s, a camera that costs 3 times as much, it still handles low light extremely well.<br /><br />See image, 4K/24p video screenshot with full moon and a tiny LED for fill, taken at 1AM using ROKINON 12mm f2.0","First, know that I'm not anything close to a pro photographer. This is a hobby for me and my review will have much more of a \"layperson\" feel than a lot of the great technical reviews you'll find from others. I wanted a nice mirrorless camera, mostly for the compact size, to replace my severely aging Canon Rebel DSLR. I'm very pleased with my choice of the a6300.<br /><br />I'm continually amazed by the low-light capabilities of so many of today's cameras, and this one is a sweet example of that. It will shoot clear pics in light levels so low I find it hard to believe. My particular passion in photography is finding interesting plays of light and color, usually tending toward dimly lit areas with a soft spot light source somewhere in the frame. I've tried so hard in the past to capture photos of a nicely glowing lamp in a dimly lit room, only to strike out. Not any more. I'm very rusty and still getting up to speed, but this camera finally allows me to capture photographs that match the image in my head I'm going for.<br /><br />If you want to shoot great photos with the utmost in simplicity, put this baby on auto and fire away. The quality is simply superb, with gorgeous capture of color and light. Or if you want to get creative, there are any number of ways to get manual, or semi-manual, or anywhere in between to get your photos where you want to be.<br /><br />My only complaints are minor, definitely not important enough for me to drop this great camera below five stars, but I still want to mention them:  The SD card slot is in a terrible location that requires you to open the battery cover and tediously extract the card with the tips of your thumb and index finger. I also find the button that starts and stops video recording to be awkwardly placed and not particularly easy to find and control without looking. And finally, the WiFi feature simply sucks. For some reason, it will transfer photos from itself to a smartphone in short order, but transferring to a computer via WiFi is so slow as to be useless. I hope to see this issue corrected in a firmware update. (Are you listening, Sony?)<br /><br />Bottom line? If this camera is in your price range and you want a smaller camera that takes phenomenal photos and offers an infinite variety of ways to shoot, you'd be hard pressed to do better than the Sony a6300!","This best camera!!!!","I purchased this camera as an upgrade from the NEX-7 which I liked very much. I thought I would miss the tri-navi controls, but I've found the transition to the A6300 to be an easy one. I know many reviewers are critical of the Sony menu system, but I've had no problems learning to use it efficiently. Once the camera's settings are customized to your preferences, there is little need to dive into the full menu system anyhow.  I ordered the camera with the kit 16-50 zoom lens, but find that I seldom use it. The bigger 18-200 zoom is my go-to lens for this camera. I purchased this lens to use with the NEX-7, and I was pleased to learn that Sony had a firmware upgrade for the lens to make it compatible with the a6300 phase-detect autofocus system. The upgrade was easy to install, and the lens works great for me.<br /><br />I recommend the a6300 book by Gary Friedman to help get you started on customizations. You-Tube videos by Gary and Tony Northrup are also very helpful. I'm liking the settings to focus manually by programming one of the customs buttons to set the focus, rather than having the camera do that automatically when the shutter button is depressed half-way.<br /><br />My favorite accessories are the SMDV RF913 Wired&Wireless Shutter Release, the Lowepro Flipside 200 DSLR Camera Backpack, and the Sirui T-005KX 52\" Aluminum Alloy Tripod. See my reviews for these items posted on Amazon.com. I also ordered the Really Right Stuff L-bracket for the a6300 which mates perfectly with the Arca-Swiss quick release plate on the Sirui tripod.<br /><br />The Sony Alpha a6300 is a great platform for someone who loves photography and wants gear that is more portable and easy to handle.","Highly Rec this camera!","This camera out preformed my expectations by a million times.  I had the a6000 and that camera was great.  They didn't need to improve that much on this camera but I do like the metal body and 4K options.  I feels so much better in my hands.  I feel like I'll keep this as my main camera for years to come.","I traded up from the A6000 to the A6300.  Good choice.  More rugged and tighter design.  4K video, better autofocus and several smaller upgrades.<br /><br />This review will be updated from time to time as new information arises during use.<br /><br />Much has been written about the Sony menu layout.  It is confusing and non-intuitive.  Example: to enable silent shutter, the user must go to two separate menu lists.  One to silent the shutter and the other to silent the autofocus beep.  Logically, both should be on one menu item.  There is too much clutter in the menus:  who really uses smile shutter activation?<br /><br />Low light performance is an issue.  I was in an area with a canopy of trees.  Not dark because the meter said F2.5 at ISO 800 and decent shutter speed.  But the pictures were horrible.  A complete grainy mess of nothing compared to the scene.<br /><br />Autofocus at high F stop is not as fast as expected.  The smaller quantity of light falling on the sensor is the culprit.  This did interfere with my shooting.","What can I say? This camera is a dream to use. I bought it as a back up for my a6000 and it is a dream. Love Sony!","This camera takes amazing pictures.  4K video is fantastic. Picture quality top notch. Get a couple lenses and your good to go. Never going back, mirrorless is the way to go.","focus is not much difference when use Sony lenses. But when using Canon lenses through Metabones adapter, focus speed is amazing! The Canon EF70-200 f2.8L II lens uses to hunt a lot on my Sony A6000 body, now focus very fast on this A6300 even I added a 2x teleconveror. Other Canon none L lenses get fast too, like EF 35mm f2, 85mm f1.8, etc., but lost eye focus function which it has on my A6000 when using those Canon lenses. I heard that Metabones had firmware update to solve this issue. Pictures are as sharp as A6000. An other thing I like a lot is: you can connect a power bank via usb cable while you are able to shoot at the same time. That solves the battery problem completely! I haven't try any video function yet.<br />But the most problem is over heating! I used it outdoor in a day about 90 degree by a swimming pool, and only used it for still pictures. It became very hot at the bottom and the viewfinder and handgrip area just less than 30mins shooting. When I used continue high speed shooting, after taken about 3 jpg pictures, it froze. This never happened at my A6000 at the same SD card. Probably because too hot. I tried the high speed shooting indoor later when it cooled down, It was getting better. At the same time, this A6300 still can't focus very well at the swimmer, at the continuing focus mode, a lot of time it got blurry or focused on the water splash. I was disappointed with the over heating problem and think probably not the time for upgrade from A6000 yet.","I purchased this from a blue box store as they have a better warranty and someone I can talk to if I have issues... This camera IS GREAT!!! Just took it to Yosemite and Tahoe and very pleased so far.  I am new to photography but had many years of video experience.  Some of my concerns with this camera were... the battery life: not an issue at all for me.  I picked up a few spares for cheap on amazon and I barely used up one in a day (mostly pictures)  The heat was also concern but not an issue at all for me. Never once did I have an issue at 9k feet and very hot conditions.  I picked up a zeiss 1670 and it was beautiful for all the shots I wanted. Would buy again in a heartbeat.  I have friends who have the a6000 and we were comparing on our trip.  Love the new features of the new a6300!!!  Well worth the extra I spent over the a6000.  Wireless phone transfer is great and I used that a lot to get great pics up on social sites I wanted.  For Travel, this is an all day camera for you and I had this on my hip all day and really felt like I was able to enjoy both my hikes and my photography at the same time.  Rolling shutter is an issue at 4k but I shot everything in 1080 and was very pleased.  (that and I don't intend to use this much for video.)  For travel I picked up from amazon a side shoulder strap (indigo marble).","Recent Sony convert here.  I purchased an a6000 about a year ago and was hoping that the successor would improve on a few things that I disliked about that camera. Well, I now have the a6300 and I can say that it does indeed improve on many things.<br /><br />1. Autofocus.  While I never really felt that the AF was lacking in the a6000, the a6300 takes it to a new level.  Accuracy is improved and I like the new available settings better (expand flexible spot).  I'm getting shots that my a6000 could not and it's due to the improved accuracy and tracking, so that's a win.<br />2. Build quality.  I was always somewhat disappointed with the build quality of the a6000. It felt plasticky, almost P&S-like.  Not anymore! The a6300's full metal build is a very welcome change.  The appearance of the finish is similar to my Nikons and the tightness of the lens mount removes the cheap feel.<br />3. Viewfinder.  The live view in continuous burst shooting further blurs the line between a mirrorless and a dSLR.  It's a great enhancement.  Also the higher rez viewfinder and faster refresh rate is a big improvement over the a6000.  It's also bright, very clear and easy to see.<br />4. Silent Shutter.  Silent shutter was a feature I was curious about, but not sure I'd actually use it in practice.  I was wrong!  Silent shutter rocks! I love stealth mode! I'm no longer drawing attention to myself from either noise (shutter clicks) or size (dSLR).<br />5. Min shutter speed for Auto ISO.  This was missing from the a6000 and I'm glad it's now here.  Being able to set the min. shutter speed in auto ISO allows for better control, especially in action.<br />6. Improved Dynamic Range (DR) and 14 bit raws.  Probably not noticeable by many users, but for power users the ability to do more with the raws (push shadows further without color shift) is a win.  DR is improved which helps with landscapes (bright skies, dark shadows) so any improvement here is welcomed.<br />7. ISO improvements and 4k video are nice to have's as well.<br /><br />Really, the a6300 for me has made me excited about photography again (and that's not because of the new camera honeymoon either!).  The better feel of the camera, the new features and improvements puts this camera in line with my Nikon dSLR. I no longer feel like I'm \"missing something\" or lacking something like I did with the a6000, I'm complete now.  Well done, Sony.","Portability, speed, and focal tracking are simply amazing.  4K video is just a bonus for this little gem.  If you liked the a6000, you will LOVE the a6300.","Better than the A6000 - which was a top-notch camera!","I don't know what else I can add to the official reviews and opinions...<br /><br />I used the A6000 before this one came and had all the Sony apps installed on it. When the A6300 arrived, I installed all those apps on this new camera and everything is working like a charm. I sold the A6000 with all the apps installed on it already.<br /><br />I rarely use it for video... I know I should try. But I enjoy the still photography and the fact that what I see in the EVF is what the final image will look like. Coming from the Nikon D800 tank into this \"toy like\" light weight camera was a change I had to get used to. In the process I've learned that I can't sell the D800. There's a use for both cameras... so I now carry both.","Loved the a6000 and was hesitant to change but my daughter wanted the a6000 so I went for it. Immediately I could feel the stronger body. While the price jump is probably not worth it, I am glad I made the upgrade","This does everything you need it to. Batteries run through fast but just buy a couple spares - are you really that cheap? And the menu system is FINE - don't be put off by having to learn something. It works amazingly well!","So far, so good!  I'd recommend saving the money from the kit lense and buy a highly rated prime or zoom, instead.","Was going to buy a A7 but since i'm not a pro i went with the 6300 instead and saved myself a few hundred bucks! Maybe a Pro can tell the difference but this 6300 works good for me!","GREAT camera.  I updated from a SONY A6000. My only complaint is that of the 6 camera memory features, 4 of them are stored on the SD card.  If you format the card, the 4 stored there are GONE!  They should be stored in the camera, and should have the ability to be labeled.","This is a wonderful camera, very flexible, light, and the quality of images is wonderful. This is a definite yes and I tried most of the mirrorless cameras. Sonys are by far the best - by which I mean most usable.","Small and compact.  Best 4k travel camera.","The a6300 is definitely an upgrade from my previous Sony Nex 5r. The primary upgrades with the a6300 include higher resolution, built in electronic view finder and flash, slog, 4K, additional shutter speeds, and 120 frame rate to name a few. The major negative aspects include rolling shutter in 4K and limited articulating screen.","Good camera. Quick shipping.","Hands down one of the best camera's on the market.  Quality of pictures are beautiful!","I replaced my Sony Nex 5N and it was a great decision.  I can still use all of my e-mount lenses but this camera is truly superior.  It focuses very quickly, I don't have to  attach a viewfinder or a flash because they are both included.  It is a bit larger and heavier but actually feels better with a longer lens.","This is a GREAT camera, however, the lens selection really stunts the possibilities for professionals.<br />It is fantastic for video, especially when used with prime lenses.<br />As Tony Northrup said, \"It's a jack of all trades and a master of none.\"  Really, if you were to buy all the best lenses for it, you still can't specialize with this camera at the moment. Other than that, it's got all the bells and whistles and I find it very easy to use and learn about.<br />For people with large hands, the camera may feel small. The grip is less 'chunky' than that of non-mirrorless cameras.<br /><br />The lack of a screen that can turn around is a total killer for people who film themselves. I screw my framing up all the time. Again, wonderful video, but I may just buy like a t3i just so I can frame myself better when I vlog.<br /><br />Personally, I love the camera and will use it for a long time. If you were to buy all of the best lenses for this camera over a year and try to resell it, no one would buy it because if someone was going to drop 3k on a camera and all of the lenses, they would probably just buy a professional body and fewer lenses instead.","Easy to use and captures amazing photos, definitely worth every buck.","This camera is truly amazing. I bought a like new version for $945. I only bought the base camera so I could save money and adapt lenses. The image quality and 4K video are a big selling point. The low light performance really blew me away, I was shooting my nieces at night and the only source of light was the pool they were swimming in. Also, I had little to no problems with overheating in 4K, just be cautious and try to shoot in shade more. Know when to stop shooting and change batteries. Hopefully this helped if you're looking to buy this camera! Have a great day.","this camera is awesome! bit canon 6d 5d","Inexpensive & works very well","I think people need to spend more time shooting with this camera before they could possibly realize how great this package is for only $1000!<br /><br />You might think that the use of the APSC sensor is some kind of a deal breaker, but it's actually a FEATURE, for more than one reason.<br /><br />This is obviously one of the main issues you will consider if you are thinking of getting into this camera vs. a full frame sensor camera.  I got into an a6000 first, so I know most of the differences between cameras.<br /><br />My main motive buying the a6000 was the 11 shots per second, with it's lock on tracking abilities to shoot backcountry snowsports.  It was a Gary Fong video demonstrating this at a ski resort that sold the a6000 (and henceforth, the entire SONY line-up!  and it has done VERY VERY well for the limited amount of time I've had on it.  I did put it in a backpack with the 70 to 200mm sony G f4, which was definitely a GREAT choice (I'm glad I nailed the correct choice in lens for what I was shooting!  this lens has OSS in the lens, something that the a6000 and a6300 do NOT have, so whenever you can, and you are shooting hand held, you really want to have OSS in your lens, or you are not really going to get many sharp and in<br />focus shots AT ALL--  especially snowsports.  Every single shot until the buffer was full in 11 shots a second (well, ALMOST every shot!) was in PERFECT focus.<br /><br />Small and light did VERY VERY well for my backcountry application (we often are out there touring and traversing for 8 hours or more per day, and there's not a chance anyone can tell me that once you put a larger heavier lens on that it's not worth it to then have the smallest and lightest camera body.  As small and light as it can be, and get you the best results with an emphasis on \"get you the best results\".<br /><br />NOW--  a6300 is here, and does everything the a6000 did, only by FAR better.  The view finder is 10 times better and has the artificial horizon like a fighter jet!  Once you use that, you REALLY miss it when you go back to the a6000.  Especially with snowsports, you can really gauge how steep a mountain is when you know that your shot was perfectly level every single time.<br /><br />What kind of monster camera is this beast that actually is shooting in 6K to be shown in 4K that also does everything else it does?<br /><br />That's amazing!!  BUT----  how good IS the 4K video??  (this is something that people won't really know for a while after getting more experience shooting 4K with it.<br /><br />Actually shooting 4K video is an undertaking that is easy to underestimate (big time, actually!)  4K is a BEAST.<br /><br />I just shot an important concert in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil last night, and the results even on a 1080 TV is VERY VERY VERY impressive!<br /><br />ROLLING SHUTTER:  Yeah, it's one of the biggest problems, BUT-- this camera is NOT unusable because of it AT ALL, which I was concerned about when I first tested this, and found the reviews to be accurate how it does have a VERY significant rolling shutter problem when panning quickly.<br /><br />BUT---  the image quality is absolutely amazing!!  It probably IS sharper than the A7sii like I have seen in videos (I will do a review about that, as I just bought an a7sii also).<br /><br />For shooting concerts, it works GREAT, so--  MUSICIANS--  This camera on a tripod or stable gimbal will do WONDERS for only $1000!!<br /><br />The microphones are also MUCH better than  the a6000, and give you audio levels on the LCD screen.<br /><br />There are at least 3 different sizes of the APSC sensor that the a6300 uses, APSC for stills, a smaller version of that for 1080 and 4K at 24 FPS, and then when you shoot 30 FPS, it actually uses an even SMALLER version of the sensor.<br /><br />It so happens, (probably by design) that when using the SIGMA 18 to 35mm with the metabones focal reducer (which turns the f1.8 into an f1.3!! low-light MONSTER!)  is PERFECT for the smallest version of the APSC sensor that the a6300 uses when shooting 30 FPS in 4K.<br /><br />You can't use the entire range of the lens/metabones focal reducer with the larger APSC or even the 24 FPS 4K mode without vignetting with the<br />SIGMA 18 to 35mm.  If you use the laea3 adapter (My SIGMA is for Sony A mount, and I'd like to discuss that more in a minute, and ask some important questions I'm sure a LOT of folks would like to know the answers to…), then the auto focus CAN work, but it doesn't REALLY work hardly at all.  Mostly it just tries unsuccessfully to focus back and forth, and then \"BEEPS\" when it locks on to BLURR finally, but with the right contrast, it does work slowly---  This is VERY disappointing.<br /><br />I got the SIGMA for Sony A mount, although it seems that I should have purchased the SIGMA for CANON and then got the Sigma MC-11 adapter, which they are saying has native auto focus performance on SONY with it.  The METABONES focal reducer adapter for Canon to E mount is $679!  the metabones focal reducer adapter for Sony A mount to E mount is some $200 less, BUT---  then there seems to be the reason for that.<br /><br />It works great, but only manual focus, which for video works for me, but it's so shorted not having it.  There a lot of video applications that would need it or benefit from it, of course.  That MC-11 seems to be the answer.  I bought the laea3 and the metabones focal reducer, both A mount to E mount instead.  Great pair to have with this lens, and it makes me wonder how the laea4 would do, but costing a half an f stop after spending $400 bucks to have it be f1.3 instead of f1.8 (which is huge) because of putting the translucent mirror seems to be a bummer.<br /><br />How very confusing!  BUT-- It seems that the focus as far as adapters for Sony E mount go, has been on CANON to E mount, not any improvements on A mount to E mount (which would explain why the metabones A mount to E mount focal reducer is $200 less than the metabones Canon to E mount.  If you get this, you will want another non- focal reducer adapter so you can have your auto focus performance with the same lens, different adapter, which is actually pretty cool, since then you are very versatile and can use a lot of Canon lenses that can't take a focal reducer, as well as Canon lenses that can, and the wide variety of other makes of lenses for Canon as well.<br /><br />THE ONLY reason I went with the Sigma A mount to E mount is because I was trying to keep it all SONY with the laea3, and only one other make (metabones) using the focal reducer, hoping that would mean the auto focus would be the best it can be, but that unfortunately does not seem to be the case  DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY INPUT ON THAT SUBJECT??  This is so very important to know before investing in specialized gear that can only be used with other specialized lenses, and then winding up not performing up to par.<br /><br />It's already a mental obstacle course trying to figure out the confusing (and apparently intentionally misleading) terms for their \"A MOUNT\" line of cameras, which is NOT in fact anything to do with the \"Sony a\" line up (A6000, a6300, a7rii, A7sii) and there's even a Sony A mount camera, the a77ii, which seems like a type-o error of A7ii, which is an E mount camera!  How the heck is the common buyer going to understand any of this of not be confused or make a mistake in purchasing?<br /><br />I guess you are part of the club once you finally figure it out.  Maybe it keeps pro photographers in work that they have finally figured it out (or maybe they never did?)<br /><br />ANYWAY--  shooting 4K video IS quite possible with the a6300, is extremely well suited to shoot concerts (and in low light as well).<br /><br />You really only want very slow and smooth panning anyway, especially for concerts, so it's not anywhere near as much of a problem as I have seen in reviews on youtube.<br /><br />ANOTHER THING-- we seemed to use such a small amount of file space for the time that was recorded in 30 FPS 4K.  Is this the case??  ANYONE?  Another photographer used an entire terra byte drive shooting Nikon full frame 4K.  OUCH!!  That's insane file space!<br /><br />If the a6300 is using as small of space as I think, THAT is such an under-rated, understated feature of the a6300  ANYONE??<br /><br />I did not have my atomos shogun in time (I have not used it yet), but this forced me to make do with a battery grip, and 128gb card.<br /><br />I put my assistant on the a6300 on a tripod, and I went running around with an a6000 on a DS-1 gimbal, which is cool, but don't expect to get great results (like it can give you) right at first.  Like they say, it has a lengthy learning curve, and balancing it properly is the first trick.<br /><br />It seems that the battery grip I used for the a6300 did it's job preventing any over heating at all what-so-ever, and that the 128GB card outlasted 2 batteries.  I'm not sure how much footage it got (some stills were also shot), but this was all surprising to me how well it did do recording internally compared to reviews complaining about overheating issues, etc.<br /><br />I know that Atomos Shogun will vastly improve shooting 4K with the a6300, and one major thing is FOCUSING, especially with a wide lens like the Sigma 18 to 35---  if you are forced to manual focus (or would like to), that is almost impossible with the view finder or 3 inch monitor.  I am looking forward to using the 7 inch monitor.  ALSO that Shogun has the XLR inputs so you can wind up with top notch audio from any phantom powered mic already mixed in with your video so that everyone can review it immediately after the show, and right on the 7 inch monitor--  a MAJOR selling point of your work, and very very useful to musicians who would like to review the night's play with the other players, much like a football team would do reviewing key plays of the night's game.<br /><br />SO--  in particular light of the apparent fact that the a6300 is using a lot smaller file space to wind up at the end of the day giving you the INCREDIBLE quality and colors that it does shooting 30 FPS 4K, you definitely could never go wrong at only $1000.<br /><br />Almost makes you forget, it also is a \"MUST GET THE SHOT\" stills camera at 11 shots a second, great for a LOT of things more than you can think of off hand until you use it, and the A7rii and A7sii don't have that.<br /><br />It' a bit of a drag that there is not a touch screen, but then it probably would have worse overheating, size and weight, AND  the ATOMOS assassin and shogun (now there's the \"flame\" and the \"inferno\" coming soon), and THOSE from what I understand, give you that touch screen, and allow you to get better focus by far than the 3 inch screen using a 7 inch screen.<br /><br />Kind of kills the small size, but it gives you the full capability to focus properly.  Plus, the auto focus sure can be great when the light and contrast are good (snowsports work VERY well with the definite contrast), so it's doing great in that department to make up for lack of a touch screen for that, although of course, it would be great to have to use the lock on auto focus quickly and accurately.  it would make it SO awesome if it did have it, though, to the point where everyone has called Sony out on that issue (that that darn little a5100 HAS, but then only gives you 5 shots per second!.  That screen also flips forward for selfies, and it only seems ridiculous that the a6300 DOES NOT even do that for some reason.<br /><br />Could it be that if it HAD touch screen and full articulation that it would then compete all too well with Canon and Nikon (CANIKON!)  There's so much mutual backscratching going on in ALL the companies, it makes one wonder---  Mr. Burns owns the bank that owns ALL these camera companies, doesn't he?  Of course!  excellent!<br /><br />BUT-- they did give us something that is an amazing leap in technology, and truly there is nothing else like the a6300.  Thanks to Sony for being SO much fun to shoot with instead of seeming like work!","Wow.  Be prepared to take time to learn a LOT about this camera, even if you are an experienced digital photographer.  The options and programmability on the a6300 is impressive.<br />First annoying bit: cannot quickly switch from single shot to multiple shot - have to go into menu.  Although it may be programmable into one of the free slots on a button - haven't learned that yet!<br />If you're serious, invest in a Zeiss zoom lens for an equivalent amount to camera and you're good to go.  (f4 lenses are perfect as the a6300 has a top ISO of 52,000!  Shoots with f4 lens in the DARK. I tried it.)","October 2016 Update<br /><br />Have used the a6300 in field research several times now, with great success.<br /><br />Key video findings:<br />*  ECMW1M wireless mic produces EXCELLENT audio results!<br />*  No problem recording 3+ hours at AVCHD + MP4 using the dual record setting.<br />*  The MP4 file from dual record recordings seems to be about half the data rate of the lowest MP4-only recording setting, meaning you can get almost twice the time in a 4GB MP4 file before it starts up the next file.  Kinda handy, so I'm using dual record most of the time.<br />*  Excellent ambient light performance and the image stabilization works well during walking shots.<br />***********************************************<br />There are many informative reviews of the a6300 already, so I'll focus on the video use and recording time limits.<br /><br />The use case here is for up to 2.5 hours of ethnographic research in context (i.e., in the location where the person uses whatever product or does whatever task that is the subject of the research).<br /><br />The interest in using mirrorless cameras vs. camcorders is the large sensor and low light capabilities, as lighting conditions are by definition both ambient and highly variable, including many lower light situations.  Further, camcorders are a dying breed so far as I can see, and we actually expect a bit more stability in the higher end mirrorless range, which is helpful for keeping a standard kit defined for a bit longer time.<br /><br />Years of experience with this type of research have taught me that a few key features are essential to meet the documentation quality required for further analysis and driving action with stakeholders:<br />•Video recording time limit - Hitting the start-record button over and over in the midst of research is just not an option.  The built-in 29m:59s time limit out of the box his is nicely overcome with the OpenMemories: Tweak app.  I've been able to get 90+ minutes in 720p/.mp4 (seems to still be limited to a 4GB file size for .mp4, even though the a6300 card is formatted exFAT), and tested over 2.5 hours at1080p/25 fps.  Still testing, but this is looking good, no overheating yet at these settings.<br />•Video quality - generally 720p is sufficient, though 1080i/p is great if file sizes don't become too much of an issue.  4K is not necessary at this point in time for this purpose.  Here the a6300 does a nice job bracketing these resolutions with 720p available on the low end in .mp4 and plenty of 1080 options in the middle.<br />•Audio quality - external microphones are essential.  Here the a6300 excels by providing two external mic options, one through the 3.5mm mic jack, the other using the intelligent hot shoe and Sony's own Bluetooth mic/receiver, the ECMW1M.  We've had great success using Sony's other BT mic, the ECMAW3 in the field, and the ECMW1M will actually simplify things further by having the receiver mounted on and powered by the hot shoe vs. having yet another thing to have to wire up and keep track of battery usage/replacement.<br /><br />Net, preliminary testing looks good, with field testing coming next.<br /><br />Thought this might be of interest to those who do pursue video and have specific requirements outside the \"ad hoc short clip\" use case, and hearing about other's experience along these lines would be great.","This is my first mirrorless camera. I can say that I am highly impressed with it. I was irritated at first with no touchscreen, but the long list of other great features it has outweighs that major con. Definitely recommend!","Compact","Yeah, this camera was supposed to be an open box but it looks and works like the previous buyer literally just opened and closed the box. The camera arrived as new as they come out of the box. Very good price. THis is my 2nd 6300. I also have a 6000. I had bought the 1st 6300 with the kit lens which I didn't need (sold it right away). Body only was not an option. I needed to even out my investment so paying $870 for this open box camera was a great find for me. If you come to the 6300 from the 6000 you'll be blown away even more than if you didn't. Great camera, low light performance is just right (up to about 6400). Focus is insanely fast, but I expected that. The silent shutter option is sick. Video quality is great, altho I don't shoot a ton of video. 120fps is great. Battery life is average (carry extras). Great tool.","i love it","Lives up to it's excellent ratings.  I also have an a6000 and find this upgrade was well worth the money.","Nice small camera that takes nice sharp pictures with the kit 16 to 50mm lens. The menus and buttons takes some time to figure out. This will be my vacation travel camera.","For the price I think the Nikon 7200 is a better work horse.  The cost is relatively close.","The best camera of the year!! Upgraded from Nex6 and it is much better in every aspect.Highly recommended!","Outstanding APS-C camera!  The best out there.","Arrived fast. The pictures are great. But I think I will get a prime lens","Excellent camera with impressive image quality. Auto focus is amazing and very capable. Build quality is high, buttons and dials are easy to use.<br /><br />I gave only 3 stars because it's impossible for me to connect the camera to my smartphone (also Sony). Surprisingly Sony PlayMemories mobile application is not available in all countries.","Best combo: APC size sills and Movie camera.  Small and light.  Must use high quality lenses for highest resolution. I use the FE full lenses as I will also get a full frame eventually.<br /><br />Cons:  overheats on movies at 4k setting. Movie button is useless, must re-purpose a function key for this. No touch screen!  Very poor battery life. Menu system in convoluted. Live view during  multi-frame mode is choppy (unlike a true DSLR) and multi-frame is at reduced bit depth of pixels. Silent mode is also at reduced bit depth. Fast horizontal moving subjects cause distortion (does not have a global shutter). No loss-less compression in raw mode.<br /><br />If you need extended movie recording or all day camera shooting I use a portable USB battery pack and USB cable. There may be a bootleg  firmware patch coming out that you can use to get around the ridiculous 30 minute video limit implemented to avoid the stupid  nanny-state European tax.","Hi,<br />I'm a Nikon user who switched for Sony. This is my first Sony and I pre-order it online.<br />What bring me to choose that camera was that I was looking for a lighter camera who can record video in 4K. Since it was the new Sony and the A6000 had a lot of good review, I say \"let's try and go for it\".<br />To start, my first copy wasn't working properly. the MENU button and the screen was not working...<br /><br />The image quality is nice but so far I found more stuff that I don't like that things that make me say that the camera is awesome.<br /><br />-The body seem to be less strong than Nikon body. Most of the button are very close next to each other and make me confuse. ( I will get to it at some point.)<br />- When shooting outside not in a full sunny day, I cannot read the screen... I need to put the camera under my shirt to see the picture or to see what is in the screen.... if you want to use the viewer as a mirror, its pretty good!<br />- Battery... Around 400 pictures with one battery, compare to Nikon battery where you go over 1000. So you need 3 battery compare to 1 battery for the Nikon. In that case the gain of weight and space is not such a great point...<br />- After recording 20 mn inside the house the body and the lens start to heat a little... That's weird. and I record on Ultra HD not 4K...<br />- I spend less than 1 hour on the beach, not a hot day, but kind of sunny, and it feel like the body heat even more quickly. ( Never happen with Nikon)<br />I believe that when the camera heat quick like that, that make me ask how the component will last on a long run.<br />- No charger with the camera, so you need to ad and extra $40.<br />- No lens caps and body caps, so you need to buy some if you plan to have other lens.<br /><br />So, body and lens heat, short life battery, unreadable viewer when outdoor shoots are a pretty major things that Sony should work on it. I'm disappointed about that camera. Unfortunately, I realize a lot of that just at almost the end of the 30 days, so I wasn't able to send it back. In that case I would have order a newer Nikon.<br /><br />So, Battery,viewer screen and camera getting hot are some major things for a \"semi professional camera\" and Sony should work on that. I think for a $1200 camera its not acceptable. Batteries + charger + screen protection, plus lens caps, you can ad an other $300.","outstanding little camera - truly does it all","So much fun shooting. It is quite a difference from a6000 in a positive way. Low light performance is amazing.","Beautiful pictures. Very crisp.","The size is perfect, the image quality outstanding and handling extremely easy! What else can you expect from a state of the art small but fully featured camera?","Lives up to its billing as Sony's best (and best in class) in this format.  Just wish lenses weren't so expensive (and large) for this E lens APS-C format camera.  Great pictures, fast, though I've had a few out of focus on off-center subject at high-frame rate mode.","I am so in love with this camera.  I am so glad I bought it.  Anyone who is thinking about buying it just dive in you won't have no regrets.","The camera is great, but Sony's uploading system is horrible and Photoshop CC to process the images. Sony's Play Memories Home app would not allow any editing except for rotating the image.","It takes time to get used to this camera and its settings. Great pics, quality + connection with your smartphone. When filming, the auto focus is great, but can also be disturbing. I think the biggest challenge is that the camera does not seem to record audio properly. I've tried it with a Rode microphone on top, but still it is not as great as I wish it would be.","I was looking for an upgrade to my NEX-6 and read it retained features I needed like the 2.4 Megadot OLED and the electronic horizon I use to keep my photos from tilting to counter the 170 degree axis of my right eye's astigmatism. These and other features made me decide to upgrade.","Want to do filmmaking? This is your chance.<br /><br />This Mirrorless Camera does EVERYTHING you need to get your foot in the door.","I'm switching from a Canon 70D. I'm a photographer first and foremost, but also an avid video creator. I shoot videos for my YouTube channel, and upgrading to 4K was an important upgrade. The fact that a camera this small can provide this kind of quality at the same price at which I bought my 70D's body in December 2014, is absolutely insane. The quality is great, the 6k, downscaled to 4k image is absolutely beautiful. Lowlight performance is great. I use this with the Sigma MC-11 adapter for my Canon Mount Sigma 18-35 f/1.8 and the autofocus is stupendous! Absolutely faster and more accurate than my 70D, and this is with an adapter! Takes in a ton of light, my only gripe is that there wasn't an external battery charger included in the package, only a micro USB cable and wall plug to charge the battery inside of the Camera. The battery life is admittedly pretty bad, and thus I would have liked an external charger included so I could buy more batteries and charge them, then just keep swapping them out. This is possible, it just costs extra. For the quality, both physical build quality, and the performance, I can't really complain. Definitely a recommended buy!","Good little camera so far so good fast focus and tracking Sony has another winner.","Great work! Love it Definitely worth the Buy!!","This is a beautiful camera. The focus in video mode is super fast. The view finder is much sharper and not so grainy.","I go the camera a week ago have played with it a little bit. I am primary a Nikon shooter and have D600 and D300. Compared to these two, the A6300 is incredibly fast in autofocus and burst speed. the image quality is comparable (with 18-105 F4 sony and 50mm f1.8 on Nikon). 4k video is stunning and smooth. the body feels rugged (as good as D300). Looks like its a good buy","Since many reviewers already went through why they like the camera, I am focusing on explaining my take on some of cons discussed and some tips to make this camera even more useful.<br /><br />Everyone seems to complain A6300 has very long list of menu that are not well organized and hard to find what you want when you want it. After using the camera a while, I found that it is not a show stopper at all. Rather I now even appreciate amount of customization it offers with its custom buttons and function menu and features it offer with long list of menu.<br /><br />First, you can modify menus shown for [Fn] button to list what you care and most of time I found I don't need to access menu at all for actual shooting. And with custom buttons, you have even less reason to deal with menu once you are done with customization.<br /><br />Here are some button mapping I am using along with reasoning behind:<br />I've changed wheel to do exposure compensation. This allows me quickly adjust exposure without having to first press down [+/-] to do compensation. It also means it frees [+/-] button to do other things like selecting focus area.<br /><br />I've also changed [AEL] button to do FEL lock and AEL toggle. This way I can ask external flash to emit pre-flash to set proper light level before taking the shot and also allow me to take multiple shots with the same exposures when flash is not attached.<br /><br />My AF/MF button is mapped to Eye AF. With continuous focusing, this is very useful feature to take shots for portrait especially when subject is moving. You will get better chance to have focus on eye of the subject than any other mechanism and center button makes it easier to access the feature. AF/MF button is perfect choice because it is easier to hold the button while holding focus button. Eye AF only works when you hold the button dedicated for Eye AF.<br /><br />I don't recommend to change other directional buttons than down button because they have icons/labels that matches original setting and modifying this will make you need to remember more and also will make it hard for someone else to use those settings. I personally would attempt to adjust exposure compensation / ISO when I take shots for strangers who is using a proper camera before I take shot for them. :-)<br /><br />I've changed [C1] button to select focus. This way I can choose DMF there if I want manual focusing at all. I also enabled Peaking so that MF is even more accurate. Peaking enables focused area to be highlighted with selected color and make manual focusing much more confident.<br /><br />And also I enabled guide for shooting mode dial. At first I thought it was a stupid idea to enable guide as I already know what each shooting mode does. I was wrong. Enabling guide allow me to select sub menu of each shooting menu easily rather than going to [Fn] menu. For example, when you select Movie mode, it gives you sub menu to select regular movie mode or high frame movie mode. And enabling this allow you to get rid of Shooting Mode menu from [Fn] because you can access it from mode dial.<br /><br />Random note:<br />* Use Capture One Express for Sony if you want a free RAW conversion software. This offers automatic lens distortion correction by reading lens profile directly off the RAW image so you don't even need to do anything other than importing images. However the correction is slightly different from what camera does for its JPEG and you may notice some difference at wide angle image for your 16-50mm bundle lens.<br /><br />* Purchase Lightroom 6.5 if you want to use LR. You can purchase LR 6 and there is a free update to 6.5. Older versions of Lightroom does not support A6300 sadly and Adobe has no plan to support it.<br /><br />* Download Sony Catalyst Browse for video (free). This wasn't mentioned anywhere in the camera package.<br /><br />* 128 GB SDXC card works on it and report about 3K+ images can be stored if I shoot RAW+JPEG.","Since others have written extensive reviews of the camera, I'll stick to two things that someone deciding between an a6000 and the a6300 might want to consider. I own both (along with two Canon bodies and lots of expensive Canon lenses). First, the new EVF is so good it seems like an optical viewfinder--it's really that good.<br /><br />Two, if you plan to use non-Sony lenses the a6300 should be your choice. A friend bought a Commlite adapter for his a6000 a few months ago. I tried it on my lenses with my a6000 and found it pretty useless--lots of hunting focus etc. Manual focus was fine.<br /><br />On a whim, I borrowed it again and tested it on the a6300 and the difference is night and day. It works great with my 70-200mm f/4 even with the 1.4 extender. With my pancake 40mm STM lens, the focus is astonishingly quick. What really mattered to me was my 17-40mm f/4--that's where I really wanted coverage, and it works great.<br /><br />The Commlite adapter costs $72 (versus $400 for Metabones).<br /><br />No, the adapter doesn't allow all of the a6300's focusing tricks, like motion tracking etc. I doubt any legacy lens will do that. Here's the thing: I like the Sony because it's small and easy to take anywhere. I don't need a backpack. So I won't be packing many Canon lenses. But the pancake lens is light and small and the 17-40 is manageable.<br /><br />Back to the camera itself. The silent shooting feature is just that, pure silence. I will be using this when shooting in small spaces such as conference rooms. It will be great for street photography, too. Some have complained about the interface. Yeah, but you can program the custom modes for quick changes in shooting situations. I don't find it to be an issue.","Put in a UHS3 card for the best quality 4K video for the money. The fact this is under a grand is shocking: Canon's similar 4k camera costs $2000 and has much worse video quality at 4k. It really is a huge leap forward in tech.<br />I've used it over the weekend on a vacation to the beach, where the camera's ability to do video bitrate is put to the absolute limit compressing the ocean into 100mbps. The results are really excellent. I will just say this: Every still camera I have ever used that has taken video has always disappointing me under my scrutinizing eyes, but this camera has exceeded expectations.<br />Pros: With a compatible lens, AF is unbeatable. Video quality is superb at 4k (You MUST use a UHS 3 card for best quality or you're limiting your camera). Very good low noise. It's light, it has no mirror to break down, the EVF turns on and off automatically which I liked, the menus are extremely easy and the learning curve for operation is VERY low for me at least. I have not actually seen ANY rolling shutter.<br />Cons: The kit lens supplied is good but not great. It's not particularly bright so will make amateurs think low light is not as good as it can be with faster lens. It has no hood for blocking glare, and it does flare up badly at angles to the sun. We do need more compatible, wide and fast lenses. I have been using my old Nikon lenses on adapters as a stopgap.","If we're just talking about performance, this camera delivers on all of its promises. In studio, indoor, and outdoor performance is fantastic. Insanely fast, crisp photos, high ISO capability. I've used it up to 6400 indoors without such minimal noise that it's barely worth mentioning. That's huge for me.<br /><br />I use this for my business, and it has been great for portraits, dance photography, sports photography, etc<br /><br />The built-in wifi is really great, especially with community event season approaching!<br /><br />All that said, I have a couple things I don't love. The mount is stiff (you have to get used to the idea that you will not break your lens attaching it). The strap connectors - idk if that's the right word - so tiny! And dangly! It feels like they could fall off any moment, and I'm struggling to find a comfortable neck strap for all day wear that fits.","Amazing auto adjustments for low light conditions. Wifi feature is awesome- I send to my phone and share with friends immediately!","I love the camera","complementary to the a7r","I loved this camera so much I bought the upgrade (a6300) the minute I saw the announcement.  Be aware that the learning curve is steep - this camera has massive amounts of features and compute power and to use it well is a big project.  And there are a whole bunch of annoyances - I have to be very careful not to change the ISO setting in using the rear control wheel for shutter speed, for example.  And yes the viewfinder shade falls off easily, and there are a bunch of other irritations.  For me they are all overmatched by 1) the lightness of the camera and 2) its *awesome* power to take fantastic pictures. It really is.  Especially in low light. Lastly the wi-fi implementation to upload to smartphone OR laptop works great and greatly facilitates posting to social media.  Now that it's cheaper its and even better deal.","I love this camera! If you shoot action photos get THIS & if your getting into filming GET THIS!<br /><br />Cons: 1 SD SLOT, 1 Battery , No image stabilization(but can be worked around)<br /><br />YOUR WONT REGRET THIS CAMERA! SONY shits on Canon right now.<br /><br />Keep pushing hard sony!","I was happy using NEX-6 for almost 4 years but many times I was frustrated by the autofocus inaccuracy and the sensor started showing its age compared to newer sensors in low light area. I didn't want to upgrade to A6000 because of its lower build quality, lower viewfinder resolution and still slow AF in low light (you notice all of these pretty quickly if you are used to NEX-6). The A6300 improves all these features and adds a couple more that I really like. This is the upgrade I needed. After using this camera for almost a month, I'm convinced it delivers where I needed to.<br /><br />AF:<br />AF is blazingly fast and accurate, especially with the SEL 35mm f/1.8 and SEL 10-18mm f/4. Even my non native lenses (Zeiss 32mm, Sigma 60mm) focus faster on A6300. Low light AF is a struggle for these two as well as SEL 55-210mm but the SEL 35mm keeps the accuracy at the expense of speed (but still fast per mirrorless standard).<br />Continuous AF (AF-C) is very performant  to keep up with my constantly moving kids, especially when face detection is turned off and zone AF or expandable flexible AF are used. Eye-detection AF is also good, but not for moving people.<br /><br />Viewfinder: slightly better than NEX-6 even though I was worrying about the smaller size. The 120 fps refresh rate is helpful when shooting action scenes, as well as the real time preview. I just noticed that 120 fps is pixelated and I just use the lower rate (60 fps) most of the time.<br /><br />Interface: button personalization and the additional AF/AEL lever are very welcome addition. Menus are obviously easier to navigate if we compare to the messy NEX interface, but it's still all over the place. It's hard to remember where settings are. Fortunately the Fn menu with 12 settings reduces the need to delve into camera menus to a minimum. It's very unfortunate that Sony didn't make the customization of buttons dependent on memory modes. I wanted to have different button function for different memory mode but this is not possible for now.<br /><br />Image quality:<br />A significant upgrade from NEX-6 at all levels: lower noise at high ISO, better JPEGs (I like the new extra fine  JPEG setting), better dynamic range and most notably I get better results when I post process RAWs to reduce noise or lift up shadows.<br /><br />Video:<br />I don't use video that much, but I like the opportunity to capture 4K clips. I'm not a video expert so I didn't notice the rolling shutter effects until I read about it in reviews. So far it's not really annoying for what I'm doing. Sound capture with built-in mic is ok. Stabilized and silent lens is a must for video. I recommend SEL35/1.8, SEL50/1.8, SEL10-18 F/4  and SEL 18-105/4 (probably my next lens) to shoot acceptable videos handheld.<br /><br />Other welcomed futures: - silent shutter works as expected, but I don't know why the flash is disabled when it's activated? Other brands don't have that limitation.<br />- The full magnesium, bigger body gives the impression of a very solid camera. Time will tell how much solid. I didn't have any complaint with NEX-6 but I didn't like the plastic feel of A6000.<br /><br />What could have been improved:<br />- Obviously a touch screen would have been very convenient to select AF points efficiently. I don't get why Sony insists on not adding this feature.<br />- Better flash sync speed (why only 1/160s?, every other brand is doing better now)<br />- Not related to camera, but more APS-C compact lenses are really needed. How about more stabilized primes to complete the 35mm/50mm offering?<br /><br />Final word: although the price is steep for what it does (for now), especially when compared to A6000, this is still one the best priced interchangeable lens camera for what it offers. If you can find the lenses you need in the current Sony offering, this is a highly recommended camera system.","Review from videography perspective.<br /><br />Amazing 4K Image Quality with a Rather Annoying Problem:<br />Impressed beyond belief by the a6000 video image quality, I was one of the first in line (with thousands of others of course ;-) for an a6300. I think it's an amazing camera at its price point, with many cool features, and the 4k image is astounding. However, practically speaking, I can't use it because it suffers from a terrible rolling shutter issue making it practically unusable in any environment with camera or subject movement.<br /><br />There are plenty of YouTube videos demonstrating the rolling shutter issue, which is not just apparent with \"whip pans\" and the like, it's apparent in almost any situation where the camera or subject moves at all. The jello effect is so bad, that I can't use any lens over 35mm if I am handholding the camera. Built in OSS helps, but not enough to mitigate the problem. I appreciate we're talking about a $1k camera here, so perhaps this is a small sacrifice to pay for such a beautiful image at this price point. The 4K image conformed to HD is also beautiful, preserving much of the detail.<br /><br />Autofocus<br />The Autofocus system is amazing. Aside from not being able to take over your mind and work out where you want to focus, the a6300 does a really impressive job with autofocus. It's fast and accurate with smooth transitions. It's also highly configurable for many different scenarios. It' not perfect, but it's not far from it and it's better than any other system on any other camera and it's probably more reliable and accurate than your typical 1st AC.<br /><br />It tracks moving subjects really well, locking on them and staying with them in all but extreme situations. The AF system is a major feature on this camera and is something to rave about. It makes using the camera on a gimbal an absolute breeze.<br /><br />Video features<br />Adjustable zebras, focus peaking, zoom-in manual focus, mostly reliable AWB (if that's your safety net), slog2, slog3 and a variety of picture profiles, you have more video features on this camera than anything other camera at its price point. At least for now.<br /><br />Electronic View Finder (EVF)<br />Wow. Shooting in bright sunlight and don't have an external monitor? Stick your eye to this thing and prepare to be amazed. It's amazing - clear, crisp and bright and so much better than the a6000.<br /><br />HD Image<br />The HD image quality is nowhere near as good as the a6000. (Comparison: Both cameras in same conditions, using same lenses, with N -3 -3 -3 DRO+5 picture profile to maximize DR for post-grading). It isn't as cinematic, it's occasionally muggy, color rendition is all over the place and in post, the codec holds up about as well as the footage from a Canon T3i, as in \"barely at all.\" My a6000 in HD grades beautifully and looks stunning. The best HD footage I've seen from an aps-c camera in an 8 bit color space, period.<br /><br />Even the variety of new picture profiles (E.g. Cine) do not compensate for what is a very unremarkable HD image. It's not unusable (like a lot of the 4K footage), but it's very \"consumer.\"  If you're shooting videos of the kids in the back yard, you'll probably be very satisfied with the balance of features, usability, quality and price. However, if you have more of a discerning eye and expect the best out of your footage for post grading, despite its cool features, usability and price, like me, you might still be disappointed with its image quality.<br /><br />[UPDATE APRIL 20, 2016]: After much trail and error working with several shooters from a Sony users group, I have been able to find a non-slog gamma that I am happy with which is producing good base images with beautiful results after grading.  Here' a before and after:<br /><br />Battery Life<br />Please. This camera can practically fit in your pocket. Just buy several of them and your problem is solved. With the a6300, you can also use an external battery source, such as those that power and charge a smartphone. So, battery life complainers, just get over it, would you?<br /><br />No Touchscreen.<br />Whatever. If you need one, buy down to an a5100 or get a Canon 70D/80D. You have choices. Would a touchscreen be nice? Sure. Is it a matter of life and death? No.<br /><br />In Conclusion<br />A really impressive 4K image (downsampled from a 6K image with full sensor readout and no pixel binning), an array of video features, great build quality, fantastic EVF and autofocus system. Can't go wrong? All that counts in the end is the final image and what I find incredible, taking everything into consideration, is that the 4K mode, in some conditions, is unusable because of an inherent rolling shutter issue. Also, the HD image requires a lot of trial and error and adjustment of gamma settings to get a good, gradable base image.<br /><br />The a6300 is an interesting little beast. Don't forget, we're only talking about a $1,200 camera here (with kit lens). Paired with the Sony 35mm f1.8 OSS and Sony E PZ 18-105mm G OSS, for $2,200, you have quite an astonishing and very capable video camera. Just be prepared to work with it if you're trying to get something really impressive out of it.<br /><br />HD cinematic grading example video (ungraded vs. graded): [...]","Coming from using a few Canon Dslr's, this Sony is quite a change. Size, specs and price were evaluated and the A6300 kept coming out on top.<br />Originally purchased the A6000 and the same day the A6300 was announced...so I took it for a test drive and returned it.<br />3 things I miss from the Canon: Battery life, ergonomics and menus. Portability was very important and this camera with the kit lens is ideal. The Sony A6300 shines with killer specs. This camera is more refined than the A6000, better build quality and better specs. I also wanted to future proof my purchase, and this camera packs a punch that should keep it relevant for many years to come! Don't listen to people complaining about the lack of touchscreen, it isn't necessary.","Wow this camera is simply amazing. But take it from me, you cannot judge its capabilities with only the kit lens.<br /><br />Image and video quality are crazy good. At first I was disappointed because many of my first shots were soft and blurry. I took a chance and purchased the Sone E18-200mm F3.5-6.3 OSS LE lens and I was so blown away at the difference. My advice on buying this camera would be to purchase the body only and a separate lens. The included 16-50mm isn't horrible but it holds the camera back...its like placing 100$ tired on a Ferrari. I paid $745.00 for the 18-200mm as Best Buy is having a sale (sorry amazon). Replay I don't think you could go wrong with any of the E-Mount lenses... other than the one it comes with.<br /><br />4k video is out of this world. But the real star of this camera is the autofocus system. Sony says its the fastest on earth and I totally believe them. Stills and video both are crystal clear.<br /><br />If your debating on buying this camera, I would say take the plunge and get it before amazon runs our again. Just make sure you get another lens thank the kit one if you really want to see what the incredible sensor in the a6300 can do.<br /><br />Sony 18-200mm F3.5-6.3 E-Mount Lens This is the lens I bought and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Hope thats helpful. I know if you really work the a6300 to its fullest potential you won't be disappointed.","Tried it with high expectations, very disappointed!<br />Let me say, I had purchased the kit, which comes with the 16-50pz. It's not sharp. I am used to the A99 with Zeiss lenses, so this was a major let down. But, no high expectations from the kit lens. Get some good quality E mount lenses, image will be much better.<br />Reading all the things Sony said about A mount lenses being compatible, I purchased the LA-EA3, so I could use some of the A mount lenses. This is the reason I'm rating it lower.<br />Here the problems started. Many of the modes that are available with the native E mount lenses are not available for A mount!<br />So, the only autofocus modes available are Shot and Continuous. No, eye af!<br />The focus areas available are Wide, Center and movable spot.<br />If you want the other modes, you have to switch to contrast detect af, which is ridiculously slow, totally unusable.<br />I can't believe Sony touts features that are not really working as expected!<br />On the A99, when I choose center af, I can always count on it to be in focus. Not so much on this. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. Focus is not very fast with Sony Sal 16-50 2.8, nor with the 70-400g. The fact that there is no stabilization shows sometimes with pictures that are not clear.<br />One thing I liked was the fact that the high iso was better than the one on A99. Images are much cleaner. I have not tried the movie mode, but even during photos, I felt the camera getting warm. It didn't stop on me, but I haven't used it for 30 min continuously either.","This is not just a camera but more my loved one which I stalked for almost an year. I got a news \"Hey Inder, Sony is planning to release a successor of their 2014's Camera of the Year, the Alpha 6000.\" Then I ditched the idea of getting hands on the a6000 and planned forward to seek for its successor.<br />This is amazing camera. It's sensor, it's image quality, it's speed, it's Auto Focus and it's speed. I mean everything is great about this camera.<br />I never liked the heavy DSLRs which were outdated because they had mirror. These mirrorless cameras have ridiculous Auto Focus points and doesn't lose focus even in fast moving objects like a dog or a car at 60KMPH whereas DSLRs with low FPS lose focus. The low FPS missed shots and slow autofocus did another bad job.<br />If you have enough money, just go for this camera and buy a good quality lens instead of going with the lens which comes in lens kit. I'd suggest you to get one Carl Zeiss which improved picture quality a lot.<br />Just go for this camera. It is really amazing and reliable. After getting it in your hands, you'll be having the Sony's best camera in your hands.<br />Being a VFX Artist, I am very fond of this camera. The 120FPS Video with slow motion and the 4K quality video. IT IS AMAZING. I am surprised with the video quality and sharpness. I got detail. WOW.","It beats my GH4 and NX1 in 4K video by a bunch because of the fast AF , high resolution and natural colors. I tested it with my  Sony FE 70-200mm f/4.0 G OSS Lens and it has amazingly fast AF. I am using a low cost 64GB Transcend UHS-1 U3 SDXC card to record 4K UHD 24p 100Mb video since it does not support my much faster 2000x Lexar UHS-II SDXC cards that I use in my GH4 and NX1 that does have UHS-II support.","Why buy an A7SII when this camera is a streamlined version of it. I'm not a low light shooter, and I need good auto-focus in movie mode which this camera has! Same S-log3 & S-log2 as the A7SII. I would go to say that this thing is a bit sharper the A7SII shooting 24P S35 Mode which uses a 1 - 1 pixel readout from the sensor. No crazy crop like the micro 4/3rds camera. I guess it could use 5-axis IS, but then again, with the right body movements and holding the camera properly in conjunction with the strap, you can get some footage that looks like it's on a slider or tripod... esp. when going wide. B+W 0.9 ND filter works well with this... anymore and you'll start to introduce a stronger color cast. Just goofing around with it the first day here ... but I had no ND, so the settings were not optimal.<br /><br />[...]","love this camera!","Pros:High Quality Mirrorless Camera that takes outstanding Photos and videos. I've been using it for a week took some indoors and outdoors from plants/Trees. The pictures have great detail and Camera focus is very precise. The Sony 16-50mm lens is decent for everyday photography but it lacks Image stabilization and has limited zoom. I bought The A6300 with Sony 55-210mm Lens and it revealed its strong capabilities even more. 4K Super 35mm, 24p, 100Mbs video quality is Superb but the buyer must have Fast SDXC Memory Card E.g Sandisk Extreme or Lexar 1000X to make sure recording occurs without errors. Also the space 4k video requires is intense 29:50min occupied about 21GB. I recorded 29:50 Minutes, the maximum allowed by cameras, in California around 72F. The camera did get a bit warm but recorded the entire clip without even showing the temperature warning sign. The warming up is normal since it drains battery fast but its intensity is nowhere near what the other reviewers claim it to be. They must be intentionally overheating the camera, e.g laying camera under sun for an hour then trying to take video!<br />Cons: Price. Buyers must be ready to pay at least $1350 for the body+55-210mm lens. But the buyers do get best in class 4K video, best Autofocus in the Mirrorless and other functions present in A7 series for a third of the price. Battery is another disadvantage since it drain fast, especially when recording 4K video, but there are options for extra batteries and charger for A6300/A6000. Lack of Touchscreen but the controls are easy to use.<br />Overall, i do recommend this camera for anyone that needs a superb camera for photography or taking 30min 4K videos and doesn't bother paying the premium for the high tech/quality.","I don't want to write up a full review of this camera yet.  There is so much to cover and it comes from a very amateur photographer.  I want to take my time and live with the camera for a bit before I write any conclusive feelings on such an investment.<br /><br />I came from shooting with a NEX-5T and have never used a 6000.  This was a big leap for me but I have been very impressed.  I haven't done much work in video recording yet but shooting pictures in RAW with my 18105 and 35f1.8 lenses has been fantastic and a large improvement from my old entry level mirrorless.  I won't go into all of the positives yet but I will say that I have gotten great sharp images from this camera so far and I expect them to get better as I learn more.<br /><br />I do want to go over a few things that aren't the best.  First off I was initially kind of turned off by the fact that the screen does not flip around completely.  It tilts which is great and useful but without some modifications or an app, this might not be the best bet for vloggers or seflie cams.  Anyways, I don't see this as a major drawback anymore because I don't typically use it in these ways.  It would have been nice but I didn't see it as enough of a drawback to deduct a star yet.<br /><br />Second, my NEX-5T had a touchscreen so I was hoping this would too.  I knew when I purchased the camera that it didn't have a touchscreen so there was no surprise when I got it, but I did actually appreciate the ability to use the touchscreen considering the Sony menu systems can be a bit clunky at times.  Also, choosing a focus point by simply touching the area on the screen was a nice touch and I had expected that to be on the much more expensive 6300.  Now that I have it and shoot through the EVF, there is no real need for the touchscreen and in reality, the touchscreen on the NEX-5T wasn't all that great.  If they added a smartphone style capacitive touch screen instead of the squishy inaccurate screen that the 5T had, I might have been more interested.  As it stands, I'd still like a nice touch screen but I think they would charge a significant amount more for a good one and considering how I am using the camera, it is easy to live without.<br /><br />Third and currently finally, the battery.  It uses the same FW-NP50 battery that Sony has been using for sometime now.  It's not bad but it's not great.  In one sense I'm glad they used it because I already owned a few that I could use but I would have preferred a new larger capacity battery.  If there was one thing that I could change about the camera and one thing that brought me close to deducting a star for this review, it would be the battery life.  If you're traveling and plan to take a lot of pictures with this camera, I would say you need at the very least 3 batteries fully charged for the day to be safe.  Again, the battery life isn't horrible but it could have been better.<br /><br />That will be it for my initial impressions.  After I can put more time into all of the different features of this camera I will update with a full review and include pictures.  I can also answer some of the more nontechnical questions.  For the ~$1000 I paid for the base model it is difficult to recommend.  For the people that don't care about the cost, then pick this up, it is a great camera.  If the cost does bother you, I would probably wait it out a little longer and see how much you need this specific camera.  More to come later.","Great little camera. Works well so far! Now I need lenses.","The camera is excellent,but Sony still in the ancient era and do not respect their customers. Refuses to include a touch screen!<br />Overall, it has great focus, great customization, beautiful JPEG, nice flash, and amazing video.","I was waiting for over a year for this camera but I am now a bit disappointed.<br />While still and generally 4k video are really good in terms of picture quality, even with the kit lens, the camera/sensor overheats in about 12-15 minutes indoors (4k 24p). You can get to about 20 minutes if you unfold the LCD display to give it more room to cool, but overall recording is limited to 29:50 minutes; The recording will just stop without any warning, so you could miss shots.<br />Unfortunately I record build V-Logs over a extended time period like 30-45 minutes and my old GH4 had no issues whatsoever, but that comes to the cost of image quality, looking at my attachment for example. To get best of both worlds, people need to add a external 4K recorder like Atomos Ninja Assassin to do multiple hour long sessions if they want. But then you're damn close to the A7S II which had the overheating fixed via firmware. (still 29:50 minutes time limit though)<br /><br />The GH4 is probably on of the best options still, especially if you couple it with a strong lens and possibly even a Metabones adapter to get one stop back. Currently I would say the APS-C sensor of the A6300 is about 1-2 stops better in low noise than GH4.<br />The GH4 would give you the benefit of a touch screen, which I am dearly missing right now.<br /><br />Update per 4/6/2016:<br /><br />When using a external power source like the Sony ACPW20 AC Adapter I was able to record about 40 Minutes of 4k 24p Super35 video.<br /><br />Using the external Atomos Ninja recorder I was able to record about 70 Minutes of 4k video using the clean HDMI output when using battery power.<br />Using the same setup and a external power source should extend the 4k recording time to about 2 hours.<br /><br />I was not able to observe any overheating while in standard live mode.<br /><br />All these times depend on your ambient temperature, I was using 76F without AC. In an AC controlled environment, especially around 70F should reduce, if not eliminate, the overheating issue.<br /><br />Knowing these limitations I decided to keep the camera and hope that a firmware will alleviate some of the issues, until then I will bridge the gap with the Atomos Ninja which I really like.<br /><br />The autofocus, larger sensor and the possibility that I can use Sony FE lenses without any adapter are just convincing. Just in case I can't resist and move up to the Sony A7R II. To be honest who can't..","Coming from a Canon 70D this is pretty phenomenal in a small package.  The auto-focus is amazingly fast and spot on.  The kit lens is surprisingly good.  I expected to be disappointed by the EVF but find myself using it most of the time.  Exceeds my expectations.","I am a prosumer level photographer/videographer and have grown up from the film world to the current world of DSLR's, mirrorless cameras, and most everything digital.  This camera is nearly the best I've ever owned for the price (I also have the Sony a7Rii, which is #1 in my book but also quite pricey). I am still learning the features it has but that hasn't stopped me from just taking it out and shooting.  Wonderful pictures and video.  Here are a couple of tips that may help someone out there:<br />The Adobe RAW converter is now in Lightroom CC (Release 2015.5; RAW 9.5).  Make sure you have these updates in Photoshop too.  I use the high speed Lexar Professional 128GB 1000x level 10, SD XC II UH3 card which I got on Amazon and which takes advantage of all of the incredible features of this camera. It's important that your SD card is UH3 rated to shoot 4K videos and that your camera's video format is set to XAVC S 4K. I had the a6000 also and both cameras are great shooters. I haven't had the a6300 long enough to evaluate all it's functionality and do appreciate the tips that reviewers post on Amazon.  Just take this camera out and shoot away.  Hope these tips help. P.S. bring along and extra battery or two or three.  As many have mentioned on these reviews, these mirrorless cameras seem to use a lot of battery power.  Enjoy.","I wish the ergonomics were a bit different but it's comfy and small.  The slo-mo video isn't very good so don't buy for that reason - the GH4 is better.<br />I also bought those 4k PNY U3 cards but they won't record 100mb with this camera.","Retiring my DSLR and moving to the Sony mirrorless system has been the most liberating event in my decades of photography since digital and autofocus before that. Same (now better) quality and performance with half the weight. Traveller's dream! I currently shoot with an A6000 with a NEX-3C as a backup/second body in the travel kit. Many comments are based on comparing the A6300 to its older sibling.<br /><br />So. Here I sit looking at my recently arrived Sony A6300. At first glance, it’s nearly indistinguishable from the A6000 sitting next to it. At second glance, the slightly textured finish of the magnesium alloy body and the return of the AF/MF switch just under the mode dial do supply some visual cues. Looking at the top plate seals it since there is a distinct A63000 label. So, if it is virtually the same camera, why did I buy it?<br /><br />Turning it on, spending 20-30 minutes in the menu and playing with autofocus provided at least half of the answer. This is not a technical leap like the A6000 was when it first appeared but it has solid improvements that based on personal needs or preferences, may or may not justify the $400 difference between it and the still-available A6000. The justification depends a lot on how and what you shoot. If you use your camera for video at all, it could be a done deal since the improvements in that department make it one of the most capable part-time video cameras in its price range. If not, your decision may be a bit more difficult. Not because the A6300 is in any way lame, but because the A6000 is still to be considered a fantastic camera.<br /><br />After a few  days, I’ve compiled a list of the changes (so far) that justify my choice for getting an A6300 and moving the A6000 to the second body position in my travel kit.<br /><br />Two small things right off the bat:<br /><br />\"USB Power Supply = On\" Allows the use of a USB battery pack to extend battery life almost indefinitely. It allows the camera to operate while charging and with a 15,000 MAH device charger pack connected, it should power the camera for hours.<br /><br />\"Release w/o Card = Disable\" No more puttering around in the garden snapping random flowers only to find the card was left in the reader when inspiration hit.<br /><br />The significant things:<br /><br />1. Focus : Autofocus is incredible. 425 phase-detect focus points on the sensor cover most of the frame and allow for vastly improved focus tracking. Face recognition is fast and accurate. Improved eye-AF tracks focus on a subject’s eyes so the face is always in focus. Huge value for weddings and such. Did I mention fast? The A6000 and the 55-210 kit lens wan't bad for outdoor action shooting but the A6300 makes me want to pop for the 70-200 f/4 and go find some flying birds or something. One feature I hadn’t heard mentioned but stumbled across in the menu was “AF In Focus Mag.” It allows you to magnify the focus point while in DMF mode as you would in manual focus and a half-press on the shutter activates autofocus while remaining zoomed, allowing for a critical focus check. Another pleasant surprise is that the on-sensor phase-detect is now available to lenses like my A-mount 16-50 f/2.8 SSM via the LA-EA3 adapter. Focus speed seems little different, if at all, from native lenses. AF-A is disabled, as is DMF and the specific MF setting but manual focus is always available.<br /><br />2. Viewfinder: The A6300 has nearly double the number of pixels as the one in the A6000 and while the difference is noticeable, it isn’t an oh-my-God difference. What is very noticeable is the 120hz refresh on the viewfinder which eliminates image tearing and lag. I’m also happy to see the return of the electronic level as a viewfinder and LCD overlay. Unlike its predecessors that display the last image shot in a rapid (but lagging) slide show during burst shooting, the A6300 offers a real-time live viewfinder display at 8 frames per second with full auto-exposure and focus tracking that makes action shooting much easier. It really brings EVF tech one step closer to eliminating the need for any optical component to the viewfinder beyond letting light in through the lens.<br /><br />3. Silent Shutter Mode: It is truly silent. Its potential for use in a solemn situations like wedding ceremonies is pretty awesome. I did some research on the tech behind it and found an interesting article related to the A7x series cameras that warn of the time it takes to read out the image once the electronic second shutter is triggered. If panning aggressively or if a subject were to move suddenly an effect similar to the “jell-o legs” in CMOS video may manifest. Concerned, I went out and did some testing and found that though setting the shutter to silent limits burst shooting to “Low”, even aggressive panning didn’t distort vertical lines in any of the situations I tried. My guess is that the electronic second curtain terminates the exposure very quickly and the 1/20 sec. or so for readout and reset for a single frame, while taking a little extra time, is done after the exposure is recorded and the distortion doesn’t come into play as it does in video.<br /><br />4. Build: Not a tank but definitely, at least, an IED-resistant Humvee. Reminiscent of the NEX-7, actually. The magnesium alloy feels solid (but so does the A6000’s polycarbonate) and its pebbled texture feels “comfortable”. The grip now has a slight indentation at the bottom on the lens side right where your middle and ring fingers rest. The indentation on the grip sharpens the ridge a bit and makes it slightly easier for my medium-sized hand to hold (IMHO). The body is 4mm thicker front to back than the A6000 and along with the extra 2 ounces of heft makes the camera feel a little more substantial but unless you have a body in each hand, the additional weight isn’t really noticeable. Except for the aforementioned AF/MF switch, the controls are identical. The added weather sealing just ices the cake.<br /><br />5. Sensor: Another evolutionary rather than revolutionary list of improvements. The shallower photosites made possible by using copper rather than aluminum in the sensor circuitry improve compatibility with wide-angle lenses (theoretically) as well as light gathering. 10x better in low light than the A6000? Sadly, no. However, the changes in the sensor and processor have made about a one-stop improvement IMHO. I can set the auto-ISO to 6400 now with little to fear where the A6000's ISO6400 shots were hit and miss as far as usability. Copper wire is a better conductor than aluminum which may contribute to the significantly faster readout that enables 120fps in 1080p recording. The big thing is the phase-detect autofocus array and associated image analysis for tracking and overall speed. There is still hunting in low-contrast, dim environments but the ability to find and lock focus is much improved. Of all the improvements, this could be the One Big Thing when looking for a reason to choose the A6300 over its older sibling.<br /><br />6. Customization: The buttons and Fn menu can now be customized to host almost any shooting or playback function. After I finished fiddling with button customization I have settled on Focus Assist for C1 by the shutter release and Silent Shutter for C2 on the back. I then turned to the Fn menu and found that the Drive, ISO and Exposure Compensation access on the four-way nav had redundant entries in the grid as did the top-dial-adjustable Shooting Mode. I replaced them with a few items left out in button customization that I would I still have to dig in the main menu to get to. Now Auto ISO Minimum Shutter Speed (another neat new feature), Face/Smile Detect, Image Quality and Finder Refresh Rate are easily accessed.<br /><br />***Update*** Not sure how I missed the Fn settings feature in the A6000 menu but now I have set my A6000 to match the A6300. Live and learn! (And RTFM!)<br /><br />7. Video: Except for occasional short clips of no more than 5 minutes, I don't do video. If I did and wanted to shoot important video of a wedding or something, I'd buy an actual video camera that doesn't legally have to legally terminate shooting at 29 minutes and 59 seconds to avoid import taxes. The A6300 is a stills camera with remarkable video capability, not a dedicated video camera. I may play with some of the video features simply because they are there but I bought this camera for the solid still image feature set.<br /><br />I've only had the camera for a week so far but my initial impression pretty much confirms the research I did before ordering it. I have taken it out for a spin at Disneyland and despite the poor light and 16-50 kit lens (jacket pocket camera), I came back with some very nice images. So far, it's a definite keeper for me!<br /><br />I will update if I come across anything new. The 18-105 f/4 G arrived a couple of days ago and I'm eager to see what it can do.<br /><br />***Update - six months in***<br /><br />Since the first review I've shot about 10K images and my first good impression has only gotten better. The choice of the 18-105 f/4 G was a good one too. Despite its size, it spends more time on the A6300 than any other lens. The improved live-view and extra stop of clean ISO really came in handy shooting a wedding in June and even though it was about 102° and humid for an outdoor wedding (yeah, I know...), I had no overheating issue for stills or bursts (no video). Eye AF is pretty amazing when trying to keep someone in focus on a dance floor and tracking AF is actually useful now.  It doesn't feel any different from the A6000 until I shoot with the A6000. As good as the A6000 is (and that is quite good), the A6300 is an obvious upgrade if you use both alternately.<br /><br />Bottom line: I feel my money was well spent. I don't find myself wishing for the next upgrade or feel the need to jump to full-frame right now. The image quality is excellent and being able to carry two cameras and an assortment of lenses in a day pack makes this photographer smile.","This is not a full-frame camera like the Sony A7R2 but it can use the same lenses.  My Sony A7R2 lenses are FE lenses but will work well with the Sony a6300 (they just look more zoomed).  This camera, like the A7R2, are limited to the approximate 29 minute 4K video recording duration per clip.  That's plenty of time for most all of my videos.  If I need to film longer-duration clips, I use a camcorder.  The build quality of the a6300 is exceptional!  Although it doesn't feel \"as professional\" as the A7R2 it's definitely well-made.  I love having the Sony multi-interface shoe for my Sony external stereo mic!  I wish that the LCD screen would flip forward for face-on-video but an external HDMI display can be used in the field for that purpose.  Also, the Sony Playmemories app paired with the a6300 via WiFi can function as a field display for those face-on-video filming scenarios.  I've found the still photo quality to be excellent (see attached photos).  It uses the same Sony battery as the A7R2, so it's nice not having to carry around multiple battery types.  Travel size/weight with this camera is minimal.  I really love the compact, yet well-made camera body!  Although the video is not full-frame, I have captured some INCREDIBLY SHARP 4K video with this camera.  The built-in microphone is decent quality but I recommend using the Sony stereo mic that attaches to the shoe for optimal results!  The Sony a6300 and Sony a7R2 are currently the only two cameras that I now travel with.  I love how the menu system of each is very similar.  also worth mentioning is that the LCD display IS NOT a touch screen.  I personally like that because I don't inadvertently change camera settings with my nose.  Many people dislike not having a touch screen though.  I have not encountered any overheating issues with the Sony a6300 but have not filmed multiple 29 minute clips back-to-back.  This camera seems to become less warm than the A7R2, while filming video.  This is a great camera and since it can use the same Sony E Mount or Sony FE Mount lenses that the \"more professional\" Sony models use, it's easy to invest in quality glass and use it for future Sony cameras too!  This would be a great starter interchangeable-lens camera for someone that may wish to purchase an even more professional Sony camera body in the future.","I love this camera beyond words. I have no issues with settings or buttons and when I pre-ordered it I also ordered an extra battery as well... so no issues there either. UPDATE: As of June 10 2016 I am still unable to set this camera down!","This is a fantastic \"jack of all trades\" camera.  In some respects, it may be the best camera under $1,000, but it is far from perfect.<br /><br />In general, it is a nice compact size, but feels well built in the hand.  It is fast and responsive, with an amazing autofocus system.  Just a few years ago, mirrorless cameras had the true reputation of being significantly behind dSLRs in auto focus systems.  That day is over.  The autofocus system, in most respects, surpasses most dSLR autofocus systems.  Being mirrorless, the camera has an exceptional live view/LCD for videos and stills.  It has an EVF instead of Optical viewfinder.  It may be one of the best EVFs on the market, and is superior to an OVF in most respects.  The image quality is very very good.  I shoot primarily full frame with the Nikon D750.  This is an APS-C camera.  No, it's not as good as full frame, but it seems to be as good as any other APS-C camera out there.  But there is an important caveat --  Sony's jpeg processing leaves a lot to be desired.  While they may be good enough for a casual shooter, an enthusiast will want to process RAW files to maximize the image quality.  There are lots of other nice features you don't necessarily see in most dSLRs -- A tilting LCD, well-implemented wifi, very good in-camera HDR and Panorama modes.<br /><br />Anyway, let's get into specific pros and cons, starting with the negatives:<br /><br />Ergonomic/design negatives:<br />- The hard eyecup over the EVF.  It makes it nearly impossible to use the EVF while wearing glasses.  Yes, it's a spectacular EVF, but I need to lift up my glasses to use it.<br />- The memory card slot, located in the battery compartment, flush and parallel to the battery compartment door.  I feel like I am performing surgery every time I need to remove the memory card.  It is not easy to slide in and out due to this positioning.<br />- Continued lack of an easy way to move the AF point.  It's not a touch screen.  There is no good thumb stick to move the AF point.  You need to use the control dial, and I found myself often accidentally pushing it to the side, to the ISO or drive function, when I was trying to move the AF point.  For an enthusiast level camera, there should be simpler and faster methods to move the AF point.<br />- Cramped buttons and lack of some direct controls in general.  This is largely a tradeoff of being a small camera.  But in this price range, when compared to other dSLRs in this price range, you get dual control dials, you get more direct function buttons.  While the camera has many assignable customizable buttons, still not enough for all the functions I need.  I shouldn't have to dive into the menu system, for example, to change the focus point mode.<br />- Horrible battery life.  But this is to be expected for mirrorless, and Sony has given it a small battery to keep the size and weight down.<br />- Placement of the movie record button.  It is in a very unnatural position, and it forces me to shift the camera just as I start to take video.  (but I rarely use video and will not be commenting much on it, in this review).<br />- Menu system.  Poorly organized, difficult to find necessary functions at times. (But there is a good customizable FN menu, see below).<br /><br />Image quality negatives:<br />- Poor jpeg compression.  I'm not sure if it's the noise reduction (which I reduced to low), the default sharpening, or the jpeg compression scheme, but even at moderate level ISO, my jpegs were looking pretty ugly when examined closely.<br />- Inconsistent indoor artificial light AWB.  Often in artificial light, my portraits take on very unnatural yellow colors.  Be ready to fix white balance in post processing.<br /><br />Operations/AF negatives:<br />- Difficulty moving AF point, see above.<br />- Mediocre buffer in continuous shooting.<br />- Very slow write speed, locking up the buffer.  Unable to view images while they are being written to the memory card.<br /><br />Now the long list of strengths and pros:<br />Design/Ergonomics:<br />- Lots of customizable buttons and a good FN menu.  Instead of digging through the entire menu  system, it is helpful to assign your most common functions to the FN menu.<br />- With a prime lens or kit lens, the entire camera is very compact.  Won't fit in a pocket, but won't weigh you down at all.<br />- Feels solid, some weather sealing.<br />- Except for the difficulty in viewing with glasses, exceptional EVF.<br />- A true level display in EVF and LCD.  A huge benefit for keeping your image horizon straight.<br />- A fairly versatile tilting LCD.  Live view on my Nikon dSLR is so slow, that if I want to take a picture low to the ground, I need to get low to the ground and look through the viewfinder.  With the A6300, I can just tilt the LCD and lower the camera, while looking at it from above.<br />-Dedicated memory recall functions.<br />- Greatly improved auto-ISO implementation.  Not only can you select minimum and maximum ISO, you can also set a minimum shutter speed, or set whether you want the camera to default to slower or faster shutter speeds.  This allows the shooter to use Aperture or P priority modes, without fearing that the camera will set the shutter speed too low.<br />- Wifi is well implemented, including the ability to add apps to the camera functions.<br /><br />Operations/AF positives:<br />- The autofocus system is the biggest selling point of this camera.  It is simply fantastic.  AF points are densely packed over the whole frame.  Many different AF modes to choose from, but they all seem to work very well.  Even more than great lenses, getting sharp photos is about getting proper focus.  This system focuses fast and accurately, anywhere on the screen.  If you need to AF on a very small point, you can even change the size of your AF point.  I haven't done much with the lock-on tracking offered by the camera, but I have followed birds in flight with zone-AF and with expanded flexible spot AF, and they work very well.<br />- Continuing the AF, a HUGE feature for portraits is eye-AF.  (slight negative that you need to program it into a customizable button, and you need to hold down the button for it to operate).  Traditionally, photographers will lock onto the nearest eye with the center AF point, and then re-compose the image.  With the A6300, compose the image, press the eye-AF button, and the camera will reliably focus on the nearest eye at a very high percentage hit rate.  It makes taking portraits easier, and more accurate than a traditional dSLR.  (and even without eye-AF, the face detect system is excellent, better than most dSLRs).<br />- Fast 8/11 fps.  The A6300, like the A6000, is capable of 11 fps.  This is basically faster than any other dSLR for $1,000 or less.  But, this 11 fps was rather limited.  When using the 11 fps, and looking through the viewfinder or LCD, you didn't have a live feed of the image.  Instead, the camera repeatedly displayed the last image taken.  Thus, you didn't really have a live view, and it was difficult to track a moving object, which is the entire point of a fast burst speed.  So the bad news, I won't be using 11 fps on the A6300.  But the great news, the camera can provide a truly live stream at 8 fps, which is still faster than almost any comparable dSLR.  Older Sony mirrorless cameras could only provide a live stream at around 3 fps.  So 8 fps is a huge step up, and it makes it much much easier to follow action when continuously shooting.<br />- Video.  I don't use video much, so I won't say much.  But it does offer 4k.  Even better for me, it has HFR -- high frame rate -- video modes.  It is fun and simple to capture super slow motion video.  I look forward to my kids' next Tae Kwon Do board breaking, it will be fun to watch them splinter those boards in slow motion.<br /><br />Image quality:<br />- For casual shooters, the jpegs will be very good.  The great AF system will insure a high number of keeper pics.<br />- For more serious shooters, use RAW.  The files have very good dynamic range.  The noise quality is very good for APS-C files.  I suspect I can print 8x10's from ISO 6400 and 12,800 in most cases.  And I can get web quality images even at ISO 25,600.  It won't replace full frame for the most critical low light work, but it will produce excellent results.  (with the caveat that you may need to fine tune the AWB.  And as a further footnote, it is actually very easy to set customizable AWB, which you may want to do anytime you are shooting in artificial light).<br /><br />Some thoughts on the Sony system:<br />Sony's mirrorless system has been advancing rapidly.  They finally have a decent selection of lenses, but remain behind Canon and Nikon.  For most types of shooting, Sony has what you will need.  But the thing is, why do people buy a top level APS-C camera, like the Canon 7dii or the Nikon D500?  They buy it largely for sports and wildlife.  Sports and wildlife require a great AF system, and long telephoto lenses.  The A6300 has a great AF system.  But Sony doesn't have ANY long telephoto lenses.  The longest native lenses are the 70-200/2.8 (not yet released), the 70-200/4 (a very good lens), and the 24-240 (an ok full frame superzoom).  If the A6300 wants to be taken seriously for sports and wildlife, Sony needs longer lenses.<br /><br />(Addendum: Sony has announced a 70-300 lens.  So Sony is quickly addressing the lens deficiency I noted.  The 70-300 should be a natural fit for sports and wildlife on the a6300)<br /><br />Some price/value thoughts:<br /><br />If the camera body was priced around $750, I would probably say it was the best value on the market.  Overall, it feels superior in build, quality and performance to most entry and mid-level dSLRs.  But the camera is priced at $1,000.  Similar in pricing to the enthusiast level Nikon D7200, Sony A77ii (a dSLR), Canon 70d/80d.  Does the camera belong at this price level?  I'm not sure.  It definitely has advantages over those cameras, like 4k video, 8/11 fps.  But those cameras and systems have key features for enthusiast photographers.  They have more lens options including telephoto.  Their bodies have better button layouts for better direct controls of functions.  If you are shooting wildlife, you may need to change AF points very quickly, which is harder to do on the A6300.  So when comparing this camera to the more traditional options in the price range, there is no clear cut winner.  But the A6300 will be more compact than those other cameras, it will pack a huge punch in a small body, with great image quality, super fast AF, and fast performance.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the camera.  And the A6000 remains an even better value.  Half the price, but far more than half the value.<br /><br />In quick summary, what's this camera very good at:<br />As a jack of all trades:<br />- Great candids.<br />- Very good image quality and flexibility of using the LCD makes it great for landscapes.<br />- Fast AF and 8/11 fps is very good for sports/wildlife, but not at extreme distances due to lack of telephoto lenses.<br />- Eye-AF is a great feature enabling excellent portraits, though I would invest in a prime lens like the 50/1.8, if you want to shoot portraits.<br />- The size makes it a great travel camera.","So far, I'm happy with this Camera A6300. I love it. Very nice camera.<br />Checkout my photos at @mirrorless101 / instagram<br />Pros:<br />- Auto Focus with Canon Lens ( Techart III & Metabones )<br />- Phase focus with LA-EA3 and some cheap Canon EF Adapter<br />- Eye AF works even with AF-C , muaaah :D<br />- Super Fast Focus<br />- EVF very very nice, and shoot high speed is good now, no more black out, good like Nikon & Canon 7DmII<br />- Fully 425 AF-C with Tamron 150-600mm A mount + LA-EA3<br />- Lightweight<br />- 4K<br />- Small factor<br />- Noise OK, almost like Full Frame.<br />- Easy upgrade to Full Frame by put Metabones T Ultra on it.<br />- Manual Focus Lens become Auto Focus with Techart Pro Adapter<br /><br />P/S: Most Canon EF & EF-S STM works, Sigma Art for Canon EF work, LA-EA3 work with Phase, and all USM Lens L after 2006.<br />This lens won't work: Canon 50mm 1.4 USM, don't ever try it, just waste ur time, because that 50mm 1.4 USM Canon always got problem with motor focusing. If you are a pro, you know it already.<br />** Also, when you use Silent Shutter, try to shoot at 1/60 or 1/125, or you will get lighting effect, happened for electronic shutter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- uhm uhm.. almost nothing. Just old menu of Sony.<br />- I dont' want to say about battery life, we're all know. And I am ok with Sony 3rd battery, cheap.<br />- No BSIS, but I really don't care, since I shoot the bird at 1/3000 anyway, IS only need when u handle shutter under 1/50. Long shoot use tripod anyway. And most Canon EF / EF-S / Sigma / Tamron have IS Built-in, adapter use IS Lens work good already.<br />- Some stupid people say about \"out of stock\" ... Cmon, pre-order on Janurary here, you pre-order on March 1st, and you want get it on Match 10th ? No WAY. When Sony A7RII come out, many people have to pre-ordered 6-9 months and still not get it. You know how popular is it already.","Edit 7/2/2016: I recently purchased Sigma's new contemporary 30mm f/1.4 lens for E Mount, and let me say this lens is a thing of beauty. For the price it is absolutely unbeatable, and according to DxOMark it surpasses its more expensive peers (Zeiss 32mm f/1.8 and Sony 35mm f/1.8). It is slightly faster than either of those, and cheaper than both of them. I would highly recommend picking up this prime if you purchase the a6300. Additionally, I continue to be disappointed by the 18-105mm f/4. Although it is plenty sharp and fast, the distortion is ridiculous. If you save JPEG or have photo editing software like lightroom its not a huge deal since you can adjust for the distortion after the fact, but its just a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />The Sony Alpha a6300 is a great evolutionary leap over the Alpha a6000. The picture quality is outstanding, and the body is almost exactly the same size as the a6000. However, the body quality is far superior with the a6300. All the familiar menu options are available including MF Assist and Focus Peaking. From my experience, the a6300 focus peaking is far superior to the a6000. The AF is great with the new PDAF, and works through adapters now as well. The EVF is outstanding and can support a frame rate of 120fps, but is set to 60fps out of the box. The advantage to an EVF over OVF is the ability to view exactly what the sensor is including exposure and you have the ability to view some of your settings at the same time.<br /><br />LA-EA3 Adapted: Sigma 50mm f/1.4 & 35mm f/1.8 SAM: Sony AF is leaps ahead of older Sony Mirrorless systems. The speed is outstanding, but unfortunately will not be as fast as native lenses and will not match the speed of these lenses on Sony DSLR bodies. AF on older Sony lenses used to be better on LA-EA1 & LA-EA4, but since the newer bodies provide PDAF through the adapter the focus is much better. MF is great on these lenses as well with focus peaking. It allows you to take quick shots in MF to give you great DoF options.<br /><br />Native Lenses: Sony 18-105 f/4 G OSS, Sony 16mm Wide Angle, & Sony 55-210mm OSS: The largest advantage of these lenses is the OSS and AF speed. The further you zoom the tougher it is to take steady shots, and without OSS you would probably require a tripod. Additionally, the AF speed is fantastic and you're still able to switch to MF and use focus peaking. This came in handy taking pictures of Tigers through fencing. In my opinion, the best reasonably priced lens for Sony Mirrorless APS-C systems is the 18-105 f/4 since it gives great range and fixed aperture. Most photos will be taken at f/4+ anyway.<br /><br />Video: The 4k video is outstanding, but the AF can be questionable. If your subject is moving a lot the focus doesn't track perfectly, meaning sometimes it takes an extra second to find the correct focus which can be unfortunate. However, if you plan on using this for serious film making I would recommend getting de-clicked Rokinon lenses. There is no AF with those, but manual control allows great constant focus. Also, the lighting drops when you begin to film so make sure you're in a well lit area!<br /><br />The most comparable cameras are the Sony a6000 and a7RII. Both are great cameras, but the a6000 is a little outdated, and the a7RII is a tad pricey. The a6300 is a great compromise of cutting edge Mirrorless technology at an affordable price.<br /><br />Pros: best AF currently (2016), great size and weight, focus peaking, improved zebra, great with AF adapters<br />Cons: more expensive than the a6000 (still very much worth the difference)<br /><br />Recommended settings to change:<br />Quality: RAW or Extra Fine (Extra Fine unless you know how to edit and save ARW files)<br />File Format: XAVC S 4K<br />Grid Line: Rule of 3rds Grid<br />DISP Button: Monitor: For Viewfinder (ONLY)<br />DISP Button: Finder: Level & No Disp. Info (ONLY)<br />Peaking Level: Mid<br />Peaking Color: Red<br />Finder Frame Rate: 120fps<br />Release w/o Card: Disable (makes sure I don't forget the card)<br />Custom Key (Shoot.):<br />- Custom Button 1: Eye AF<br />- Custom Button 2: Focus Magnifier<br />- Center Button: Focus Mode<br />Delete Confirm: \"Delete\" first<br /><br />These are the only settings I changed, and most are personal preference. Hope they help you, but keep in mind your preferences and use for your camera may differ from mine.<br /><br />Edit: Added some pictures I took with the 18-105mm including one in Panoramic mode (settings set to wide not standard).","I am a professional video production artist at a four diamond resort; we regularly use RED dragons, a7s2's, and other high ends cameras. I have a very good eye for image quality, and I have to say: for the price this camera is AMAZING!<br /><br />This is by far the best medium size mirrorless camera at the $1000 price point. The image quality in both photo and video is superb! This camera is so light and small but packs a punch! The autofocus system is state of the art; the tracking and continuous auto focus makes sure you never miss that perfect moment. Burst mode is screaming fast with the autofocus system. The image quality for stills is amazing, cant ask for much more in a aps-c sensor. The 4k super 35mm video looks amazing; almost as good as video cameras ten times the price! The 1080 is really good, the 120fps looks a bit soft, but much better than the GH4. I wish it could shoot beautiful 120/240fps like my sony rx10ii, but that's all the more reason to keep that camera now!<br /><br />The menu is solid, stills are beautiful, and the video quality blew me away. All in a camera that is SUPER small and super light. I am extremely happy with this purchase, a great addition to my RX10ii! The kit lens is fair, but passable. Still cannot open the raw files in photoshop, but I'm sure that update is coming soon!<br /><br />I'm so happy with this purchase, cant wait to get more lenses on this puppy!","Absolutely amazing in nearly every regard. Miles above the competition at this price point, and the color science is fantastic. I HIGHLY recommend this camera from beginners to pros for both and/or video. It truly is one step closer to an engineering marvel. Works very well, and I am absolutely in love with this camera. Doing a full review on my YouTube channel soon... Just search Sully Cortez on YouTube since amazon wont let me direct link.","Never been regretful when switching to Sony from Canon! Very satisfied.","So the camera came today. I popped on a lens and threw in an SD card. All I got was an error. Turns out I needed to format the SD card but the format button way greyed out. After a bit I figured out that I needed to switch out the battery in order to format the camera. In other words, the camera shipped with the battery life at about 15%. Anyway, got that working now...<br /><br />I sold my Samsung NX1 so I could purchase this camera and for those who don't know, this NX1 can do as much and even more than this sony a6300 can. Frankly, so far I've been a bit disappointed. The SD card I had(Samsung 64GB Pro) wouldn't let me record in 4K so I still have no idea what that looks like. It kept telling me \"Cannot record in this recording setting. Either switch to a UHS-1 U3 compatible memory card or change the record setting.\" So now I have to spend another $100+ on top of the $2500 I've forked out on lenses for this little beast. It does however, work fine for 1080 video at 24p and shooting pictures.<br /><br />Well how do these self-made errors correlate with my review?<br /><br />Well, the menu. Holy crap. Are we still in the stone age? Coming from this NX1 to this was like I was going back to the 90's. No touch screen means you have to figure out their unintuitive scroll wheels, dials and buttons. Now, I've been a photographer for over 8 years and been doing video for over 4 years now. I've owned 3 Canon's, two fujifilm's the Samsung NX1, and this is my first Sony. I'm no expert but I seriously think Sony could step it up a bit with the menu. It's like pulling teeth trying to find a specific setting. There is NO logical sense in the menu! You really just have to memorize where specific items in the menu and sub menu are located. It's really kind of a nightmare. I just want to pick up the camera and shoot! The video menu options... my gosh, I've never seen so many unexplanitory, random options before. We just need 4 options: Video resolutions, video frame rate, video bit rate, and video S-Log. Instead, we get this crazy mixture of both photo and video settings on the same menu screen.<br /><br />Next up, I'm using the Metabones Speed Booster Ultra on this camera. Now to be fair, it was unclear whether it would actually work or not since it hasn't been tested by Metabones, however, it did work on the a6000 so I figured why wouldn't it work on the a6300.<br />These are the lenses I'm testing:<br />Sigma 150-600 5-6.3 Contemporary<br />Canon 50mm 1.4<br />Rokinon 10mm(Sony E mount)<br /><br />So far, the Sigma does ok. The focusing is slow past 250mm. Luckily it doesn't do much focus hunting but rather just takes its own sweet time.<br />The Canon is better. It finds focus much faster, and while it works great, it's still not perfect while it does do some hunting sometimes at lower apertures.<br />The Rokinon is manual focus and aperture. It works just like it should.<br />One of the biggest downsides of this particular camera/ lens config is that I can't get focus peaking to work with any of the lenses. I'm hoping it's just setting burried somewhere in the black menu abyss but it could also be the Metabones Speed booster adapter.<br /><br />To wrap this up...<br /><br />Pro's:<br />-Image quality in photos and video.<br />-Auto focus, when it worked for me<br />-EVF looks better than the NX1's<br />-Travel size<br /><br />Con's:<br />-Stupid stone age menu<br />-Support for Metabones Speed Booster Ultra (Sony E to Canon EF) ??<br />-Tiny video Rec button<br />-No H.265 (yes, it is supported in all Adobe applications as well as Windows 10 and works extremely well)<br />-RAW AND JPG files are not supported in Adobe Lightroom?? I couldn't get anything to import- can someone explain this?<br />-Continuous Auto Focus only worked when holding the shutter button half way down and only with the Canon lens. I never got it to work in video mode.<br /><br />All in all, I'm sure it's a great camera when paired with the right glass. I kind of wanted to give this camera a 3 star review but it really is better than that. The camera has its quirks but image quality is amazing as well as its capabilities.<br /><br />I will be posting video reviews on my YouTube channel, Big Iris Productions, so stay tuned and feel free to ask questions.","I love it! The speed, the portability, the compactness, the sleekness..<br /><br />My last Sony product was the Sony NEX5 (the very first one), so this was a huge upgrade from that. I typically shoot on the D7000, and the ISO on this surpasses the D7k by miles. Buttons and menu options are user friendly, however due to the size of the camera body itself, those with larger hands/longer fingers might feel their hands cramp a bit after long usage.<br /><br />I'm planning on getting the metabones adapter for Canon lenses for extra lens options. (That was not an advertisement scheme. I'm legitimately planning on getting it.)<br /><br />The only downside that I see with this camera so far is the battery life and the hotshoe.<br /><br />With the amount of power this camera packs, the battery is still the same as the previous cameras -- and there's just not enough juice in one battery for completing a shoot.<br /><br />Shutter speed is very fast and focusing speed is very fast as well. The sensor is pretty good at picking up what you want in focus.<br />4k videos!! Make sure you have a computer that can process 4K videos or else buying this camera for its 4K capabilities is like buying a Cal King bed for a twin sized frame.. (won't work).<br /><br />Camera body build is very strong and you can definitely feel the difference between the a6300 with its predecessors.<br /><br />All in all, great camera for the mid-level pros who want a camera that packs the punch but will still be small enough to not kill your neck or wrist. I think the biggest issue people will run into is with how powerful the a6300 is, many people will not have the tech to keep it running. In other words, you need large and fast memory cards, tons of backup batteries (Sony brand only apparently), and a computer fast enough to process the video and picture files.<br /><br />I'll update this when I have a chance to play with the camera more.","- Check out my photos below of size comparisons with the Sony A6000/Canon 80d & Sony RX100 m4 -<br /><br />- BUILD QUALITY -<br />So let’s first take a look at the build quality and design of the new A6300.  Now if you’re coming from a DSLR background, the first thing you’ll notice with this camera is just how small it is. Sure it’s not the size of an RX100 or Gx7, but it’s a welcome size decrease especially knowing that it’s packing an APSC sized sensor.<br />The A6300 is actually very similar in size from the A6000, but that’s not to say it’s not changed it’s body. It’s now got an upgrade magnesium alloy body which should mean it’s dust and moisture resistant. That’s a subtle change but something that’s reassuring to me.  We’ve also got 9 customisable buttons now in comparison to the 7 on the old A6000 which is nice if you, like me, like to really customisee you're layout.<br /><br />- MENUS -<br />The menus on the Sony A6300 have stayed mostly the same from the A6000 and I think thats a good thing. If you’re coming from a Canon background it can be a little bit confusing at first, but after a while I really found that I liked the menu system.  One thing that was a little different though and something I missed was the lack of the touch screen to access the menus, which is something we’ll talk about next.<br /><br />- LCD SCREEN -<br />After using the A6300 for a while now, one feature which I must admit I was a little bit dissapointed with, was the LCD Screen on the back.<br />To be fair it is a lovely display and quite bright even in a lot of light, but it’s missing two things that I’ve become accustomed to. A fully articulating screen and a touch screen.  Before I had used both of these on my Canon 70 &80d, I wouldn’t really have thought them to be a necessity but after using them, they’re something I feel that the Sony would be great to have.<br />The screen does flip up a bit, but not even 180 degrees which means seeing yourself when filming like I do, was something that I couldn’t do.<br /><br />- AUTOFOCUS -<br />But after a little negative on the lcd screen, I’m going throw back some positive on the Sony A6300 and talk about it’s af system. It is incredible and could be one of the best I’ve ever tested. With over 400 AF points, which is crazy just to say, I found that the Autofocus was incredible fast and nippy. In stills mode it was almost instantenous, even while just using the kit lens.<br />The great thing is that the AF works using the EVF or the lcd screen on the back just as well, which is something that a lot of DSLR’s cant do as well. Overall I was very very impressed with the AF on the new Sony.<br /><br />- VIDEO -<br />The Sony A6000 was one of the most popular new cameras for video last year and I’m going to put my money on the A6300 being again one of the most popular, if not the most popular.<br />You can now film in 4k which I found to be really great. It’s incredibly detailed, even when using a relatively cheap lens like the 16-50 and colors are reproduced well. One thing that surprised me was just how easy it was to edit the 4k footage as well. I’m just using a Macbook air and was easily able to scrub through the footage without any transcoding. The Autofocus worked great in video as well as you’d expect, but it was slightly different to how I had expected it to be.<br />Compared to the Canon 80d, it’s a lot snappier and quicker, but sometimes I found it was a little too quick whereas on the 80d it was a little slower and little bit more cinematic. But this can be changed in the settings so its not a problem. Overall the video quality is incredible.<br /><br />- AUDIO -<br />Another new addition which i feel really makes this one of the best video cameras for under $1200 is the inclusion of a mic jack.<br />The A6000 didn’t have a headphone jack so most users had to dual sync their audio. Now with the mic jack, everything gets a lot easier which is very pleasing.<br /><br />- BATTERY LIFE -<br />The Sony A6300 performed ok in battery life, but not great. It is still using relatively small batteries with low mAh, which is one of the reasons for this. I still also find it a little bit of a pity that the A6300 isn’t packaged with a charger, just a usb cable.<br />But on that note one of the great things about the camera is that you can charge it with a USB cable or an external battery pack. Something that I’d love to see other cameras do a lot more."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ2500 (Lumix DMC-FZ2000)","amazon_reviews":["Still images and video look very clear.

No thank you!<br /><br />The picture quality with the FZ2500 is amazing! 4K video looks super good and best of all there is no time limit to shooting video! The touch screen is super to use and quite frankly I don't know why this wasn't added earlier as touching what you want to set is so much easier than clicking buttons!<br /><br />I'll append this review this weekend with some photos so everyone can see the amazing quality!<br /><br />Saving the best for last is... the price! You can almost buy two of these for the price of just 1 Sony RX10 III. And I actually did buy 2!<br /><br />The only downside so far seems to be a lack of accessories other than the standard stuff Panasonic sells. For example I purchased Movo Photo HSG-2 DualStrap Padded Wrist and Grip Strap for DSLR Cameras - Prevents droppage and stabilizes video to help with stabilization and provide some protection from dropping it, but it simply didn't fit. The base of the wrist grip (most have this it seems) has a raised nub to help keep from unwanted rotation of the grip, but once installed this nub prevents the viewfinder from being able to be opened. I finally gave up after trying a few other wrist grips and just filed the nub off. It works, but I would have liked to have had that feature to help prevent the bottom from turning.<br /><br />I'm 100% satisified with this camera and would whole heartedly reccomend this camer for family use as well as semi-pro use.<br /><br />***NOTE***<br /><br />I'm copy/pasting this review on the other seller's listing (told ya I bought 2!) just in case you see this twice.","I've only had this camera for a couple of days.  So far I love it. It is so much lighter than my Canon 7D, especially when you add the lenses I need to equal the variety in the one lens on the Panasonic.  It's early in my love affair, so I'll have to update later.","I researched the Panasonic FZ2000/25000 and the Sony RX10M3 knowledgeably and exhaustively and bought the latter instead. Here is the thrust of what I learned.  It is the reviews of the FZ2000 and Rx10iii which seriously concern me. Some are terrible. Only Photoreview out of Australia even bothered to provide standardized Imatest resolution and noise test results for both cameras. There, it was no contest. The RX10M3 won hands down on both, although the reviewer's conclusions were a bit odd. Then, read the comparatively lackluster reviews on IQ of the FZ2000 on the B&H Photo site and on the CameraLabs site which compared the two cameras with identical shots at various focal lengths and found the RX10iii consistently better. Also, my own experience with Panasonic optics has been lackluster IQ with the FZ70/72 and the FZ200, as well as many smaller zooms. Finally, it must be observed that many of reviewers of the two cameras spend most of their time describing the cameras' features and saying too little about IQ in a way they back up. Many complain about the Sony's menu system which, contrary to them, is not a mess, but makes many features of the camera accessible by the push of a button if you have the intelligence to figure out how to so set it up. Worse, many if not most reviewers don't test for IQ at many different focal lengths, to say nothing of at different f/ stops and at the center and edge.  Many clearly do not even have a handle on how to operate the two cameras well. Conclusion: beware of some reviews, but read them all. Be careful here. A mistake can be expensive.","There is a focusing issue on the Panasonic Lumix FZ2500. When you are on a self timer and stand or sit in front of the camera you are out of focus while the background is not. Face recognition does not help and neither does changing the focus settings or using the touch screen in advance. The video is good and the camera is easier to operate and feels better in the hands than the Sony RX10 M3. But if you can't take a clear picture of yourself then what is the point in spending 1200 bucks?","[[VIDEOID:be91622254eeeaf60af73f000bbdcb97]]The new Panasonic DMC-FZ2500 is expensive, but it may quickly contend with the Sony RX10 III for the crown of the best super zoom camera. Why? Because it takes nearly all the video-capturing prowess of Panasonic's superb interchangeable lens cameras and puts it in a body that is weather-sealed, fully-featured, and has an amazing lens. It's like a high-end camera and a high-end camcorder in one body.<br /><br />I purchased this new camera a few weeks ago, and came away very impressed. Since I also own the lower end Panasonic FZ1000, the FZ2500 should be perfect for anyone who wants a do-it-all camera in a single package,  which all my gear fits in one pack back, great for travel.  With all the bonus features this has, it's proven to be an outstanding competitor to other cameras in this field. I've taken it to Aruba for a test run and new ND fifter were a plus. Great Camera! I have posted some samples on Youtube.","Bought this through Amazon (Cameta Camera) and am extremely pleased with the purchase.  I had a FZ70 previously, so this is quite a step up.  The build quality is excellent and feels very solid in my hands.  Image quality is excellent, and as others have mentioned, the integration of the touch screen, the programmability, the reach of the zoom, the advanced 4K video capabilities and excellent image stabilization all add up to a camera that I'm enjoying greatly and likely to keep for many years to come.  Slightly on the pricey side, but great value.","Just got it so this is an early set of impressions. Easy to use in auto mode, and a ton of extras that take hours to learn. I am coming back to fine cameras after leaving them for years and so I am amazed at what these high-end hybrids can do now. I assume you've read the photo site reviews and heard all the good things about this particular model (you should). So here are my thoughts: I know this model is mostly about video, but there are a ton of improvements for stills too (my main thing)... What I like: 480 mm eqiv zoom is amazing; dual rings on lens useful; neutral density switch (good for stills too); touch screen works well... not a gimmick, very useful. There are lots of function buttons on the body of the camera, so you will use menus less, just reach for a button. Still getting used to the fully extended lens all the time power is on; I think I am okay with it. There is so much to learn on this camera. My strategy has been to start with full auto, and then slowly try out the more manual settings a little at a time (reading the manual at each new level).. So far so good.","This is a preliminary review since it I I've had it for only 1 day. I moved up from the FZ1000 for the Touch Screen and ND Filter (and other features also). It focuses very quickly as expected. The Touch Screen makes it very convenient for adjusting the focus point as well as adding 5 extra Soft Function Buttons. To save you the trouble of looking it up, the filter size is 67mm. I had an FZ300 but the noise at ISO 800 and up was very noticeable. The FZ2500 has much lower noise due to the 1-inch sensor. I've looked at all of the competition with 1-inch sensors and IMHO this wins hands down."]},{"name":"Nikon Coolpix B700","amazon_reviews":["first tried B500....a 1/2 star<br />can add that 1/2 star to B700","Nikon Coolpix B700 camera is a very useful camera for both professionals & nonprofessionals photographers.

It is o.k. but nothing special.","Love this camera","This review is for the Nikon B700.<br />I bought this camera to replace my Nikon CoolPix P530.<br />I was originally going to buy the P900 until I saw the B700 had 20mp, 4K video and shot in RAW format. I'm a wildlife photographer and I always like to have a light, yet versatile point-n-shoot with me.<br />The B700 met and exceeded my expectations. I do, however, wish it too burst shots of more than just 5 fps.<br />Once you get used to the camera AND HAVE READ THE MANUAL, it is very easy to navigate. I've read reviews where people give this camera a one or two star rating because THEY can't figure out how to connect their phone via SnapBridge. Again, after reading the the manual thoroughly, it was literally a \"snap\"!<br />The AF is very nice and takes wonderful BIF (birds in flight) shots; though it does have trouble sometimes auto-focusing in low light situations. It will do it, but you will have to adjust some settings.<br />It has a nice \"snap-back\" feature for when you are zoomed way out (with optical zoom) and loose your subject. Just press the button on the side of the lens and the lens retracts enough to allow you to find your subject and zoom back in on it! Manual focusing is easy as well.<br />For the price, for the ability to shoot in RAW and for the functionality (once you get used to it), you just can't beat this camera.<br />Attached are examples of an Osprey in flight, a Roseate Spoonbill preening and a moon rise shot to let you see the versatility of this camera.","Love this camera.","I love mine. I think any negative reviews are either expecting a full frame quality for point and shoot price or received a defective product. I ordered the red version which is only sold overseas and it's awesome. I had the b500 previously and I actually enjoyed that quite a bit aswell for just a point and shoot.This takes it the next step up with RAW support and full manual controls while still having the full auto option if you're learning. Though it's not very fast, you have a great piece of glass up front. Also you can still get some great bokeh ( backround blur) on your shots and for most everybody I think this will work perfect.","Great little walk around camera which is what I bought it for. Got tired of lugging all my gear just so I would have a camera in the car for those times when I would say \"I wish I had my camera\". I normally shoot with a Nikon D7200. Obviously the quality of the B700 is not the same but for the money and convenience it's a nice camera.I especially like the fact that it shoots in RAW format. Great for first time photographers as you can shoot in manual, ( which is the best way to learn, in my opinion) or just put it on Auto. There's also shutter and aperture priority. Or good for people like myself who just want something to always have with me without having to spend a fortune. I added a couple sample photos to show the quality. Both were shot in manual mode but I'm sure you can get just as good shots shooting in Auto, Priority, etc.","first tried B500....a 1/2 star<br />can add that 1/2 star to B700","Nikon Coolpix B700 camera is a very useful camera for both professionals & nonprofessionals photographers.

It is a snap bridge supported camera, that's why it has both WiFi & Bluetooth so you can remotely control it from any distance.(within 33 ft.) & in the case of Bluetooth, it can make constant connection with android & tablets wirelessly The price ranges of these cameras  is easily affordable to anybody .<br /><br />Shutter speed & battery quality is good.<br /><br />Mini SD card is required in this camera.<br /><br />according to me its a good camera but, focus strength is not as good as expected. that means you can focus a particular object from a particular distance, beyond this the object can not be captured properly as wanted.( its my own experience, though I am not a professional)","LOVE this camera!!","I think this camera was over rated at first. It is o.k. but nothing special.","Love this camera","This review is for the Nikon B700.<br />I bought this camera to replace my Nikon CoolPix P530.<br />I was originally going to buy the P900 until I saw the B700 had 20mp, 4K video and shot in RAW format. I'm a wildlife photographer and I always like to have a light, yet versatile point-n-shoot with me.<br />The B700 met and exceeded my expectations. I do, however, wish it too burst shots of more than just 5 fps.<br />Once you get used to the camera AND HAVE READ THE MANUAL, it is very easy to navigate. I've read reviews where people give this camera a one or two star rating because THEY can't figure out how to connect their phone via SnapBridge. Again, after reading the the manual thoroughly, it was literally a \"snap\"!<br />The AF is very nice and takes wonderful BIF (birds in flight) shots; though it does have trouble sometimes auto-focusing in low light situations. It will do it, but you will have to adjust some settings.<br />It has a nice \"snap-back\" feature for when you are zoomed way out (with optical zoom) and loose your subject. Just press the button on the side of the lens and the lens retracts enough to allow you to find your subject and zoom back in on it! Manual focusing is easy as well.<br />For the price, for the ability to shoot in RAW and for the functionality (once you get used to it), you just can't beat this camera.<br />Attached are examples of an Osprey in flight, a Roseate Spoonbill preening and a moon rise shot to let you see the versatility of this camera.","Love this camera.","I love mine. I think any negative reviews are either expecting a full frame quality for point and shoot price or received a defective product. I ordered the red version which is only sold overseas and it's awesome. I had the b500 previously and I actually enjoyed that quite a bit aswell for just a point and shoot.This takes it the next step up with RAW support and full manual controls while still having the full auto option if you're learning. Though it's not very fast, you have a great piece of glass up front. Also you can still get some great bokeh ( backround blur) on your shots and for most everybody I think this will work perfect.","Great little walk around camera which is what I bought it for. Got tired of lugging all my gear just so I would have a camera in the car for those times when I would say \"I wish I had my camera\". I normally shoot with a Nikon D7200. Obviously the quality of the B700 is not the same but for the money and convenience it's a nice camera.I especially like the fact that it shoots in RAW format. Great for first time photographers as you can shoot in manual, ( which is the best way to learn, in my opinion) or just put it on Auto. There's also shutter and aperture priority. Or good for people like myself who just want something to always have with me without having to spend a fortune. I added a couple sample photos to show the quality. Both were shot in manual mode but I'm sure you can get just as good shots shooting in Auto, Priority, etc.","This is a very good camera and I'm very happy with it. The main reason I purchased this was that it has a view finder and the zoom lens. The photos it produces are great and need little in the way of processing.","This camera in every sense delivers what is expected.  The camera is light weight with easy setup and start up.  The zoom is truly remarkable and allows clear image.  The smartbridge access allows pictures to transfer to your mobile device with minimal interaction.  The Smartbridge application is free and requires an email and personal data to setup.  The Wifi and Bluetooth functions work well to connect your camera with mobile devices. I love to take pictures and own several cameras from the very professional to using cell phone.  Overall I would recommend the purchase of this camera.","This is the mother of a digital camera...","We can't get a good link with the app (Snap Bridge) but the camera works fine.","This camera is versatile and reasonably easy to handle. It took me a while to get it adjusted for taking movies into the light as automatic features may underexpose the shadows and sometimes focus on the vegetation behind the backlit subject/animal. The minimum focus distance varies as you move to higher zoom magnification and occasionally caused a shot to be missed or discarded as a small bird moved close to me. This may be overcome with the continuous focus setting (which doesn't always stay with the subject). These are not problems with this camera but rather with using superzooms in general on smaller wildlife. After a month in Africa I should have a better idea how well the stabilizing system works out the window of a hot, running vehicle! I have no doubt that all fixed (non-video) shots will be fine.","Bought this specifically to be able to share photos using my iPhone.<br />Haven't been able to get the software to work yet.","Shooting with this camera has been an absolute joy.","OK","Definitely smarter than I am, but it is kind enough to let me take really great photos.  One day I may figure it all out.  The instruction book is terribly unhelpful in many instances, but it does give most of the basics.  I may figure out some of the bells and whistles before too long.  Small enough that I don't mind carrying it on hikes.","I like this camera because it has what I want. 60x zoom, 4K video, manual focus option, 20 Megapixels, high quality .jpg and raw photos. No other camera had all of these features.","I like the camera , it is great for me being a novice who is into the fitness industry. With that being said I am very disappointing with the shipper who sent me the camera with a better charger that does not work! Very annoying ...","The Nikon COOLPIX B700 camera, after alot of research, is exactly what is was looking for. The zoom at 70x an the 20.1 pixels is better than my previous Nikon cookpix P520 but everything else is close to the same and that is what I was wanting.<br />My recommendation is to get the external NIKON battery charger to charge your battery, due to the fact that over time the battery getting charged in the camera will eventually over heat and explode in the camera and then you will have and $500.00 paperweight. This has happened to me with 2 previous Nikons, but besides this fault the camera is better than the Nikon cameras that have different change out lenses that cost more money.<br />RESEARCH anything before you buy!","waited a long time for this camera to be delivered.  only because of tsunami in Japan.  Touted as amazing and wifi enabled with blue-tooth and with the downloading of the app Snapbridge photos can be transfered from camera to smart device. What they DO NOT tell you that it is not compatible with an iphone or an ipad.  Only by delving into the blogs can you find a list of compatible devices.  Iphone and ipad are absent. I like the camera, but now I have to remove the card and insert it into my desktop. Added features that serve a purpose only if you have a device on their list.","Absolutely love this camera. The quality of the images is fantastic. Snap Bridge is a great feature that was fairly easy to set up (took a couple tries but finally understood what to do), now when I turn on the app it will automatically sync the photos to my phone or I can remotely control the camera using my phone. I do wish it allowed for video recording control using the app but for what it is it works well. I also really love the swivel display which allows me to see what I'm shooting without needing to be looking straight at the camera. One of the things that impressed me the most though was the zoom. I was in between this model and the P900, but ended up deciding that a 60x zoom was good enough for me and I absolutely do not regret my decision.<br /><br />Zoom Test:<br />[...]","First let me say that the B700 has some really nice glass. The zoom is incredible. However, the Nikon menus leave much to be desired. They are a bit confusing with a lot of modes and settings being buried in odd locations. Part of my frustration has to do with the fact I'm coming off the Nikon D5100 where most camera modes/functions are a LOT more \"convenient\" and intuitive. Another frustration and one that Nikon should be ashamed of is the viewfinder. It desperately needs a rubber eye-cup. The viewfinder currently sits behind a flat HARD piece of plastic and there is a cheesy square cut out to look through (COME ON NIKON!!!). If it's bright outside the sun is gonna blind you because you can't seal it out on the flat plastic, plus it's just plain uncomfortable.....a bit of thought regarding comfort and usability would have been nice. Nevertheless, this camera is lighter than any of the pro body cameras and that is what I wanted. It's easy to grip and use the zoom. The flash is adequate in close pictures but a hot-shoe would have been great........or even a Bluetooth function to control an external flash. A cheap software fix that was ignored. Of course, many of the speed-lights today will trigger off the camera flash or can be controlled manually............but that's a pain. One other thing that is missing is a lens hood..........Nikon............you know it needs it! Now I have to go by a cheesy rubber one.<br /><br />Let's talk focus! There are several focus modes and most are spot on especially the single point focus. Nevertheless, personally I would have preferred the \"manual focus\" to be usable in all modes.....not an option but you can use it in M mode.. You can assign some functions (such as manual focus) to buttons on the camera which is helpful. I made the zoom on the lens act as manual focus. Which works perfectly......in M mode.<br /><br />The zoom truly is extraordinary! The pictures below (pic 1 - horses are in the distance over the hill) were taken at dusk and the subjects were almost 3/4 of a mile away. I did not have a tripod and due to the low light (and my shaky hands) there was a small amount of digital noise. As you can see the camera can take acceptable pics at great distances. I did not use RAW mode in this instance but if you have a EXTREME PRO memory card (at least a Class 10 SDXC UHS-I Memory Card or you're gonna have some REAL problems with this camera in video and RAW modes) then I HIGHLY recommend using the RAW + F mode. Yes, the files are large but the quality is astounding and batch editing is a dream! If you can't afford Adobe products then check out Coral PaintShop Pro and AfterShot Pro.........for less than $50 bucks each you can do almost anything Adobe Lightroom can do with RAW or JPEG files.<br /><br />As a disabled amateur photographer I have enjoyed being free from  carrying 25lbs of lenses, speedlights, filters, batteries, and converters with me, but If your looking for studio quality pics out of the box with this camera then you might be better off with something else.  Every camera takes time to get the feel of so I expect my pics (and the frustration with the wonky menus) to get better. For the money you can't beat this camera!","This is an amazing camera!  I have a Nikon D5200  but I didn't want to carry it on vacation.  I agree with the previous comment about using the full telephoto for great shots.  They weren't very clear but then again, I was on a boat trying to pan birds.  I bought this to use as my go-to camera  to carry in my purse.  It is really larger than I had expected.  I now use a  camera/purse bag with removable padded inserts.<br /><br />Pros:  Pics are clear and true to color.  This camera does just about everything a dslr does.  It is easy to use but you should allow yourself time to get familiar with it before vacations or events.  I didn't have this luxury as they were all sold out and I received it right before I left.<br /><br />Cons:  As I anticipated, it does use more battery juice so plan ahead and take extra batteries.  I also found that when using the flip out viewer, the pictures don't have true color while viewing but will show on playback.  A stranger and I were taking sunset pics and he was bragging how much better his iphone pics were than mine.  When reviewed, mine were much better.  I have to raise the flash manually which may take some getting use to.  It may be better than having it pop up when you don't need it.","Received this camera 10/18/2016.  I have used it in different situations and it has taken excellent photos.  Checked the battery and it was fully charged so I was able to experiment as soon as I got it out of the box.  Will update later.","I just received mine and it's great. I love it. I wanted to have a backup camera for a short trip to Europe the next month. So, I will retire my Nikon P610, which I will use as a backup, and will start using this one. The photo quality is outstanding, I'm including a couple of pics using Macro function. In addition to that, its zoom capacities are amazing, no complaints about it, I'm attaching three pics that prove it. I do need to do more video recording tests, the UHD 4K feature is brilliant!, but the 7 minutes restriction is ridiculous, makes no sense at all. About SnapBridge, it works perfectly with my S7 Edge. It downloads pics automatically, no issues to report on this matter. As a summary, it is highly recommendable, affordable, compact-size and great quality, all at the same time.","I got my B700 3 days ago. So far I'm extremely impressed. I bought this camera (to replace my Canon powershot sx50 hs) with 2 criteria in mind: Ergonomics and raw/high res. pics. The ergonomics work perfect for me. I can hold the camera with one hand, when using the viewfinder, without inadvertently activating various functions which invariably happened with the Canon.<br />Shooting raw produces 30 MB files and when converted are about 10 MB jpg with the Nikon  progs, or 15-18 MB with Photoshop. The detail and clarity is amazing!<br />Couple of other points which might be useful for some: The lens thread is 52 mm for mounting filters/hood and pinpoint focus can be found in the scene/bird-watching mode","Have been waiting for this camera to arrive!  Everything was in the box as stated in the description.  Setting up the camera was a breeze and connecting to Snapbridge was very simple.  Pictures are beautiful, the zoom is excellent!  Love it!","Just received mine 3 days ago.  A few omissions.  Nowhere on the camera or in the instructions that were included does it tell you the lens mm. Had to call Nikon to find out it is 52mm. It took them 10 minutes to find that out.  It should have been on the barrel of the camera.  Also, could not find the in-depth instructions anywhere on the web.  Again, called Nikon and after about 15 minutes they were able to locate a link and send it to me.  That's the negatives, which seem to be outweighed by the positives:  ability to shoot RAW as well as JPEG; easy transfer of photos to phone or other device; lightweight;  and several other enhancements.  Haven't had a chance to use it much, so am not sure about reliability or other features, but so far, so good.","Boy oh boy have I been waiting for this camera! As a previous owner and lover of the Nikon Coolpix P610 and a current owner of a Canon SX60 HS, I was dying for Nikon to remedy the main flaw of the P610 by adding RAW file capture to its successor. That's really what the P610 was missing and almost the only reason I sold my P610 and got an SX60 HS instead. So the day Nikon announced the B700, my order went in at Amazon and I got to wait around for about half a year... :(<br /><br />I must put my review into perspective so people know exactly where I'm coming from. I have a lot of cameras that do all kinds of things. PNS (Point-And-Shoot), to waterproof, all kinds of DSLRs, pro bodies and glass, etc. I am NOT buying this camera to do a little bit of everything nor did I get it as a travel camera. I got this camera, as many others have/will, solely to shoot wildlife/nature at full telephoto, wide open aperture, preferably at base ISO of 100, with VR on, in full sunlight, shooting in RAW with the intent of post-processing later. Sure, I'll shoot other things with it and not all my shots will be at the above settings. But that is why I bought it and that's the primary aim of this review. I’ll start with a Novice Review followed by Pros & Cons assuming Advanced photographic knowledge, then Summary, then descriptions of my sample photos.<br /><br />NOVICE REVIEW:<br /><br />The main reason to consider this camera is because of its mega-telephoto lens! It certainly has a lot of reach! Unfortunately, I’m going to have to be a bit of a buzzkill here. At/near full telephoto, the VR (Vibration Reduction) simply is not good enough to truly eliminate camera shake. Make no mistake, this is a superb lens capable of razor sharp photos, even at full tele. But in real life, pointing and shooting (automatic modes) at full tele is going to yield somewhat sharp to straight-up blurry results. Ironically, this PNS camera requires advanced technique to actually harness the capability that is its main selling point; mega-telephoto.<br /><br />From full wideangle (24mm equiv.) to around 500mm-ish equiv. it will routinely capture super-sharp beautiful colorful images. JPEG compression (even JPEG FINE) is quite aggressive so pixel-peeping at 100% will be less than spectacular. But for making prints 18”x24”, JPEG Fine should easily work well enough.<br /><br />If 4K video is a main reason you’re getting this camera, think carefully about that decision. The B700’s 4K video, like its JPEGs, is overly compressed and sound is very hissy. So, watching on a Samsung SUHD TV wasn’t very inspiring. Quality 1080p video upscaled to a 4K TV will easily look better.<br /><br />There is a plethora of special modes. Star Trails should be a fun one and Selective Color is something I’ve always enjoyed playing around with. HDR is now buried in a Menu called “Backlighting.” Once you find and enable HDR, it works pretty well.<br /><br />This camera commands such a price because of its really really long lens and its ability to capture images in RAW format. If you don’t intend to shoot RAW (only good for post-processing in Lightroom or similar), then this camera’s predecessor (Nikon P610) is much better as it is very nearly identical, has built-in GPS and far superior VR and costs less. And if you’re buying this camera for the mega-telephoto, don’t. The VR just is not good enough to freeze at full tele. If you NEED this much telephoto AND RAW, consider the Canon SX60 HS. Or consider waiting until Canon releases the SX60 HS’ successor or until Nikon releases the P900’s successor. Otherwise, consider a much less expensive, and smaller(!) camera with fewer megapixels. 20MP is too many for such a tiny sensor and low-light/high-ISO performance suffers too much because of those unnecessary extra Megapixels.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1) This lens really does have truly exceptional glass in it. Given proper disciplined technique, razor sharp (in the center) results are obtainable all the way through the zoom range.<br />2) Bokeh is very pleasing. A very nice bonus at this price point.<br />3) RAW files! I was pleasantly shocked to see that a 3-stop push from ISO 100 is virtually indistinguishable from proper exposure at ISO 800! Pushed 100 is just as grainy and noisy as properly-exposed 800, but not more, and color doesn’t shift at all. Very respectable usable latitude here.<br />4) Continuous High frame advance seems REALLY fast! Seems much faster than the claimed 5fps.<br />5) Having the EVF (Electronic Viewfinder) automatically turn on and off when something approaches the EVF is very convenient. Though, the EVF sensor is too sensitive and activates at around 3 inches. ½ inch to 1 inch would be ideal.<br />6) The grip is very well-shaped and textured. It’s as secure a grip as I’ve come across and DSLRs could learn from it.<br />7) Very small and lightweight considering the extreme zoom range!<br />8) The articulating screen will come in handy every now and then.<br />9) Snapbridge makes instant GPS data transfer from phone to camera as simple as turning your phone’s GPS on. Far better than Nikon’s old Wireless Mobile Utility, but still not nearly as good as built-in GPS.<br />10) Though tiny, the EN-EL23 battery has good capacity. I shot over 200 pictures, about 2/3 RAW-only and about 1/3 RAW+JPEG Norm with about 30 flash pops and and a fair amount of photo reviewing and the battery still indicated full. Of course, it wasn’t truly full but even with true 1/3 remaining capacity, that’s solid. If you need more battery capacity than that, carrying a spare battery barely takes any space in your pocket or bag.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1) VR is simply inadequate for full tele. Even with VR on, full tele is going to require shutter speeds of about 1/1000 to achieve feather, fur or eye detail. Even on stationary subjects. Or flash will need to be used to eliminate blur. Unfortunately, flash is too weak to illuminate beyond about 6 feet or so at full tele at ISO 100, and that is just about minimum focus distance. VR will get you quite sharp results down to about 1/125 but prevents perfection. Turning VR off and tripod-mounting is the way to let this lens impress you at full tele, but that’s not practical for birds or any wildlife.<br />2) ISO performance is poor at/above ISO 400 depending on your tolerance. Lightroom +10 Color Noise Reduction takes care of the color noise but luminance noise can take a good deal more work.<br />3) While potentially extremely sharp and bright in the center, the edges and corners in particular are quite soft and the light falloff is noticeable.<br />4) RAW file size is unnecessarily large. Each and every B700 .NRW file will be 32,283KB (32MB). Seems like uncompressed RAW. Even my 24MP D610's .NEF files are generally only around 25MB and they have more processing latitude.<br />5) 1/4000 shutter speed is not available at longer focal lengths. At full tele wide open at F6.5 the fastest shutter speed is 1/2000.<br />6) OMG, no dynamic Auto Minimum Shutter Speed for Auto ISO that factors focal length??? Even worse is that the Minimum Shutter Speed you manually enter cannot be faster than 1/125! This means that Aperture Priority mode is unusable at full tele unless you’re well-braced and shooting stationary subjects with bright sunlight or flash at 6'.<br />7) Reviewing photos is unbelievably inconvenient as zooming the image across the full screen is not possible from the one Display that shows EXIF data. So, after viewing the EXIF data, you must press Display twice in order to get to the right Display to properly zoom the review image. Then 2 more presses of Display to get back to EXIF. And there is about a second of lag each time you press Display. Repeat this process for every image you wish to review. Infuriating…<br />8) The menu system is maddening! There is no Custom Menu nor is there a Quick Menu like Canon has for its Powershot cameras. When Nikon falls behind Canon in menus, there’s a huge problem…<br />9) Changing Shooting Modes results in a graphic that takes up 1/3 of the screen and stays on for about 4 seconds and there is nothing that can be done about that.<br />10) Focus points positioned on smaller distant objects tend to focus not on what they should. I use AF Area Mode “Manual Spot.” I put that spot on a face about 60 feet away at 500mm equiv. and it will focus on the background. Doesn’t matter where the spot is in the frame, it will miss very regularly.<br />11) No AF-C (Continuous Focus). I cannot tell the difference between and AF-F and PRE-AF. They do the same thing as far as I’m concerned. But regardless of whether you choose AF-S, AF-F or PRE-AF, focusing will lock and stop when the release button is pressed halfway. Therefore, you will always have to either stab the release button (if you weren’t touching it) or release and then stab (if you were holding it halfway) when you wish to shoot. Then the camera will re-focus and then shoot. This is at best a ¼ second lag and that is an eternity at 1,440mm equiv. shooting wildlife. The workaround is to shoot in Continuous High release mode and routinely fire 5 shots in a “spray and pray” method. That’s about 161MB per burst and there will be tons of wasted shots and still very many missed shots.<br />12) Phantom aperture closures. I don’t know how this happens but I often find that I’m shooting at F7.2 or some other F-Stop that is closed down often by more than a full Stop from wide open. I almost exclusively shoot in Aperture Priority and make it a point to stay wide open with this camera but somehow aperture keeps on stopping down. It is not like me, ever, to accidentally turn a dial. I suppose it’s possible that’s what’s happening here, but it doesn’t seem very likely at all. With ISO needing to be as low as possible, this is a big problem.<br />13) No real filter threads. A 52mm filter can be mounted but the threads are barely biting and the filter is easily knocked off.<br />14) JPEG compression is too high. But you should be getting this camera strictly for RAW (otherwise get the P610 for JPEG), so…<br />15) On the first day I used the B700 I was trying to shoot something in Macro and the lens hunted back and forth and finally made a bad plasticky grinding sound (gears?) for a few seconds and then stopped. I power cycled and to date that has not happened again.<br />16) No built-in GPS.<br />17) No battery charger??? OMG! Charging via Micro USB plugged into the B700 (like you would a phone) and it is a painfully slow charging process. Nikon wants $45 for the MH-67P battery charger but you can get an aftermarket generic one for around $10 and you’ll need one.<br />18) No hot shoe to use a real flash. The Canon SX60 HS has a hot shoe...<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />Breaks my heart to say, but I like using my Canon SX60 HS far more due to the vastly superior menus/accessibility and image review process. The SX60 HS also has better low-light performance/shadow detail and is about the same in terms of real life full tele RAW performance. If tripod-mounted with Stabilization off, the B700’s lens blows away the SX60 HS’, but nobody will ever shoot either of these cameras in this fashion. I have many gripes with the SX60 HS. Unfortunately even more with the B700. If the B700’s VR was as good as the P610’s, I would be willing to tolerate the many shortcomings of the B700, which in all fairness, are carryovers from the P610. Alas, this 6ish-month delay for the B700 wasn’t worth it to me and I’ll be returning mine to Amazon for a refund. I’m waiting for the Nikon P900’s and Canon SX60 HS’ successors. :(<br /><br />SAMPLE PHOTOS:<br /><br />Photo 1 & 2) Okay, so below you'll see a full-face photo of my kitten and the eye photo is a tight crop taken from the same photo. It was shot handheld with VR on indoors about 10-feet (3m) from the subject, in RAW (.NRW), full telephoto 258mm (1,440mm equiv.), ISO 100, wide open at F6.5, 1/500, flash on, with -1/3 stop exposure compensation pre-dialed-in. The full-face photo is only slightly cropped as it was not quite centered. Both photos were downsized to 1440x1080 pixels for upload to Amazon. In Lightroom 6 my workflow was: Exposure +1.00 (It was totally underexposed to start with), Contrast +25, Highlights -20, Whites +10, Vibrance +20, Saturation +10, Orange Saturation +5, Green Saturation +30. Sharpening stayed at default value of 25, no image straightening, lens correction, vignette correction, noise reduction or chromatic aberration correction. I did a little extra work specifically to the eyes.<br /><br />Photo 3 & 4) Kahlua bottle was shot at full telephoto at 1/5 second, ISO 100, tripod mounted with VR off, and converted from RAW to 1440x1080 JPEG with no editing whatsoever, and then a tight crop from the center of the frame. I think focus was slightly off and that's why it's not sharper. Still, pretty good.<br /><br />Photo 5, 6 & 7) Contrary to my \"wildlife in sunlight\" style, the bedding photo is a test of Macro and high ISO. This was RAW, zoomed full wide at minimum focus in Macro Mode at ISO 3200, 1/200, wide open at F3.3. There have been no lens corrections or noise reduction actions. The inside of my 52mm filter can be seen sharply vignetting the corners. As the close-ups show, there is a fair amount of color noise in the brighter areas and a lot of color noise in the shadows. +10 Color Noise Reduction in Lightroom removes all color noise (I haven't provided that sample).<br /><br />Photo 8) This \"daisy\" was shot through a window screen, hence the echoed image and soft dreaminess. It is very cropped down and represents only about 1/3 of the full frame. RAW, full tele, handheld with VR on, ISO 100, 1/1000 F6.5, edited in Lightroom.<br /><br />Photos 9 & 10) Lazy cat... ISO 800 straight RAW conversion to JPEG; no editing at all. Highlights are clipping. The eye close-up is a straight crop from this frame.<br /><br />Photo 11) This lens suffers from flare and ghosting a little too often.<br /><br />Photos 12 & 13) Full frame of a tiare (Tahitian gardenia) and stamen/pollen close-up cropped from it. RAW, ISO 100, handheld VR on, F6.5, 1/2000, full tele 1,440mm equiv. This is about as sharp as this lens can get at full tele with wide open aperture, handheld with VR on and no flash. As the tight crop shows, individual pollen grains are discernible though not super-well defined. Still, as I'm even critiquing it the way I would professional gear is great praise for this lens indeed! It's just that it takes too much work to coax the best out of this lens at/near full tele and suitable real-life subjects will be rare and it will be luck that is the real reason for razor sharp shots at full tele.<br /><br />Photos 14 & 15) The green box with books behind it was shot at F5.3, 1/8 second in both photos and they are both tight crops representing about 10% of the full original size. The first shot was at ISO 100 and was 3 stops underexposed and then 3 stops were added back in Lightroom. The second shot was properly exposed at ISO 800 with no editing at all.<br /><br />Photo 16) Here is an example of the B700's bokeh (the *character* of out-of-focus blur). This image is not cropped at all. 800mm equivalent (143.3mm actual), 1/320, F5.6, ISO 640, VR on I think. It's really hard to shoot moving subjects with the B700 so I just spray and pray. This was my favorite of a 5-shot burst over the course of 1 second. The rooster isn't super-sharp but that's probably more the lack of fast enough shutter speed than poor focus or lens sharpness. This lens is very sharp when properly focused but this shot does reveal the softening at the edges and particularly in the corners. Remember, VR doesn't freeze action, just reduces your own motion blur. And at 800mm, a moving rooster a couple yards away is a tough subject to lock. Anyhow... this shot is about the background, not the subject. The background fades away nicely, while leaving faithful texture. A Nikkor 85mm F1.4G would have just turned the background into what would look like light brown construction paper. I like the B700's bokeh, but bokeh is a very subjective thing...","I got my Nikon Coolpix B 700 a few hours ago so my comments do not involve prolonged use; this is my first impressions about the camera. First, if you are an anxious user… relax, the camera is not ready for use out-of-the-box it comes without a memory card so you need to buy one before you can use it. Second, charging the battery is an in-camera operation, which renders the camera useless while charging or if you are outdoors; it’s a good idea to buy a separate charger and extra battery (camera comes with only one battery) so you have your batteries ready when need it. The 60X lens is very nice, really powerful and combined with the 20.3 Megapixels sensor makes this camera a “little giant”, perfect for light traveling which is why I bought it. I got a few shots and the auto-focus feels good and responsive. Next I’ll work the SnapBridge to connect the camera with my cell phone. I’ll update later but so far this camera is a keeper.","Best camera, I tried buying on amazon but this was not available. I bought it from Crutch field. It has an amazing zoom and produces perfect pictures . The processor is intelligent, gives you the control on the pictures. The best feature is its simply superb when shooting in low light.The flash is wide compared to camera's in this class. 4K videos are not tested, as all my TV's have max resolution of 1080p.<br />If you are looking for super zoom camera 60X , with 20MP and 4k Videos for the future . This is it folks Go for it you will never be disappointed.","I seriously considered getting a Nikon 3400 DSLR kit with a zoom lens.  Bigger sensor, better glass but missing key features like stabilization.  I decided I simply did not want to carry a tripod around with me.  And that pretty much is the issue with cameras.  You have point and shoot cameras that go out of their way to compensate for lack of skill in the photographer, of which, this is the best one currently.  And you have cameras that can't do that but have better equipment.  But that better equipment takes worse photos, not better if you are not highly skilled.  If you want both these things, you really need to pony up $3k and get a Sony alpha mirrorless kit.  And then be prepared that 90% of the time you can't tell the difference.<br /><br />And that really is the issue here.  This camera is amazing in its versatility.  A jack of all trades yet master of none.  In a relatively small package.  Need to take professional quality wedding photos?  Don't use this camera.  Go rent a much more expensive camera or better yet hire a professional photographer.  You will be much happier.  But the average person would be very happy with the personal photos they took at a friends wedding using this.<br /><br />Need a cam corder?  Go buy one.  They are cheap.  But when you run into a situation where you wish you could record the next five minutes, you will be happy you have this camera.<br /><br />Shoot professional images you routinely photoshop?  Don't get this camera.  You want that $3 Sony alpha.  However, when you occasionally want a RAW photo, you will be happy you have this camera instead of say, its big brother the P900.<br /><br />Want a purse camera?  Not this one.  You want the ultra slim little brother or its not as good clone made by Canon.  However, neither is this so big its a burden to carry around.<br /><br />This camera replaces my Sony R1....something I paid twice as much for in its day.  It's better.  Takes better pictures, especially in low light despite the smaller sensor.  Much more to the point it is smarter.  Better at focusing. Better at choosing color and exposure settings.  Has a lot better effects.  Just better.  The technology took a huge leap forward in a short period of time.","I have shot thousands of photos w/ the Coolpix P600 over the years. I got this camera for the RAW feature and the added Megapixels.<br />This is the same P600 body but in a Matte Finish and so a bit grippier.<br />Uses the same battery, EN-EL23, and the same cards so I was good to go.<br />After setting to RAW + F (fine), Image Size to 20 M and turning off the digital zoom I took it for a test spin.<br />I'll be using this primarily for birding so I started there.<br />First impressions are Viewfinder is FAR better than the P600, Zoom is smoother and Auto Focus (you probably will not want to us Manual Focus as it's a pain) is faster, VR (image stabilization) is KILLER!<br />Single point Focus is dead on as you can see from the shot of a Sparrow buried in the rose bush.<br />Full Zoom (not digital) is dead on crisp. The Cardinal was shot on a windy cloudy dark day in AP Mode (lighter Cardinal shots) and Bird Mode at about 50'. Hand held and braced. Cardinals at full optical zoom.<br />So far I am VERY Impressed!<br />If you are a Birder and Nature shooter you will LOVE this Camera!<br />P600/610 on steroids.<br />Haven't used the Wi-Fi Snap Feature or Video yet so I can't speak to that.","I have now had my B700 for around 2 weeks. My observations:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. Setting up Snapbridge was quite a breeze, contrary to other user reports. It happened on the first try without any hiccups. Snapbridge can operate zoom as well as operate the shutter to take photos. The app does not start or stop video recording, only pictures. You can set the app to auto-download small-size jpg files from the B700, and it also shows how much battery you have left on the camera.<br /><br />2. The zoom feature is excellent and in good light you can get amazing photos even at great distance. I've added some examples of full zoom (the parrots), and the quality has come out quite nice considering they were taken handheld. The VR (Vibration Reduction) for long-zoom handheld shots is quite effective.<br /><br />3. The startup time, and the time taken from powering on to clicking your first photo, is very quick.<br /><br />4. Jpegs on normal setting have a size of 4.5 MB, while raw files are more than 32 MB! But the difference in quality, and the amount of post-processing you can do is astonishing. You can use Photoshop, Lightroom, or Nikon's own View NX-i and Capture NX-D to edit the raw files, which in the B700's case come with an .nrw extension. You can download Adobe's latest camera raw plugin (ver 9.7) to make Photoshop or Photoshop elements read this camera's files. Nikon also provides a free plugin file to enable you to view the .nrw files in Windows Explorer on Windows, and File Explorer on Mac. This also enables you to view the files in the inbuilt Windows and Mac Photos applications.<br /><br />5. I was able to get some nice bokeh shots with this camera, which I did not really expect. (See pic where the Eiffel Tower replica is in sharp focus in foreground, and the background is completely blurred.)<br /><br />6. Upon close observation, you can easily tell the difference between the 4k video and HD video recorded on the camera, even on a non-4k monitor. Also, the still images extracted from the 4k video can be used for normal-sized prints or for sharing on the internet, which is an excellent option to have.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. I wish they had at least 720p slow motion video but only 640x480 slow motion is included. When viewed on a full HD screen these videos leave a lot to be desired. Having non HD slow motion on a bridge camera when even cellphones have HD slow motion is inexcusable. Also you cannot take usable slow-motion videos in low light.<br /><br />2. At normal mode the photos I took at night (without flash, moving objects) are very blurry. I had to shift to S mode (shutter priority) on the dial to get photos that were usable. But long exposure, the light trails and other special features are quite good. See the attached photos of fireworks with the 'light trails' effect.<br /><br />3. I've come across a software glitch: The battery indicator in the camera keeps showing full 100% charge, and so does the Snapbridge app on my phone, right up until the camera has only half or a little less battery left. It will then show the battery as low. This has only happened a couple of times, and I have not come across anyone else who has had this happen, so this might be isolated to my unit. Hopefully this problem can be fixed in a firmware update.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />This is a very good camera for the money, especially when you consider that there is no other camera that offers 4k, raw and 60x zoom in under $500. There is only one, AFAIK, that comes close, the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ300 but that has only 25x zoom, and does not really qualify as a superzoom camera. It also costs a $100 more. Then there are the bigger sensor cameras which offer better picture quality but much lesser optical zoom, but these start at double the price of this one.<br /><br />I'll leave the professionals and advanced photography hobbyists to talk about things like chromatic aberrations and light falloff. Serious bird enthusiasts will be better off with the Nikon COOLPIX P900 which has more zoom but no 4k or raw. But if  looking for a bridge camera with long zoom and 4k video recording, and you also like to do some post-processing with your pictures on a computer after you take them, you really have no choice other than the Nikon B700."]},{"name":"Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 III","amazon_reviews":["Yes its heavy, and indoors in low light its average at best.<br />Ok, got that out of the way for you.<br />Other then that, IQ is excellent wide open or zoomed out.<br />Its Macro is unmatched for a Fixed Lens Zoom.<br />I bought this camera because of its stellar Macro ability.<br />AF is quick, and the camera, despite its weight & size, handles well.<br />is it overpriced?.....Well, not if you are looking at the RX100s or anything else with a 1\" Sensor and a 600mm High End Lens.<br />Its a much better camera then the recent Canon G3X......no comparison.<br />The reality is,  other then low light indoors where it struggle like all other 1\" sensor (and smaller) cameras, this Sony RX10-III camera will satisfy you whereas the Nex series and the Alpha's and the RX100s and the A6000s, probably wont.<br />Lets say you see upon a tree some hanging purple flowers, and the purple buds in bloom are each the size of a dime and you want to get  a Macro shot of one.<br />Well, go ahead and sell your A6500, your Fuji X cameras, and your Iphone.<br />Point this RX10 III instead at the bud, put the lens .25 of an Inch away and you'l get an excellent Macro shot every single time, easily, unless its getting dark...and then you'l have to work it a little bit.<br />Then, back away and get the entire flower, all 50 small hanging buds,........ keep backing up.....10 yards, ... open the Zoom, fill the frame, \"snap\",  and you have now in seconds taken a perfect Photo, again.<br />What other camera does that?<br />Macro and Long Zoom, crystal Clear IQ, every time in decent or better light?<br />So, that is why its $1500, and that is why Ken Rockwell flipped over this camera......go read his review.<br />He does not like Sony, but he loves this camera, and i know why.<br />I gave it 4 Stars, only because its a lot of money for a 1\" sensor, but its a lot of camera for the money.<br />Its both.","Excellent build quality. Focuses instantly and pictures are sharp and excellent.  I have a Sony 7R11& alpha 850 and both are excellent.  Having the RX10-111 is great to carry around with just (1) one great lens covering 24mm to 200mm.","This is a great camera for nature photography, particularly if you are travelling or hiking where weight and size are important. The Zeiss lens is superb and delivers sharp and detailed images for most purposes. Whilst it is easy to get caught up comparing the technical capabilities of different brands and items of equipment, success in nature photography often depends on seizing the moment. That means having the camera with you, being ready and not having the wrong lens on the camera when the moment arrives.<br /><br />In practice, it is easy to miss opportunities because subjects are inconsiderate enough to be either too close or too far away for a particular fixed focal length lens. Worse still, certain situations such as watering points, fruiting or flowering trees and animal carcases offer multiple subjects at varying distances all doing interesting things. It is really up to the photographer to 'see the image' as the scene unfolds and be ready!<br /><br />The 24-600mm equivalent lens allows you to switch from situational and group shots to close in behavioral and portrait shots at will. Whilst some will claim that the actual focal length of the 8.8-220mm zoom doesn't allow sufficient telephoto effect i.e. isolation of the subject, in practice the extra depth of focus often contributes to a perception of sharpness because more of the subject is in focus. This is particularly noticeable when photographing small subjects at close distances, where the extremely shallow depth of focus of an actual 600mm would make focusing accuracy critical.<br /><br />As someone who has lugged interchangeable lens cameras and super telephoto lenses on many trips and treks I can really appreciate the possibilities and convenience that the Sony RX10iii offers. As another reviewer commented, this camera this camera is all about the lens. He was right, and that is what nature photography is about. I have already taken it on one lengthy trip as my main camera (albeit with a backup). Next time it will probably be travelling solo so that I can travel with backpack only.<br /><br />It is a nature photographers dream! I love it ..... well done Sony!","Great camera, takes great pics and have a major zoom range","I had the Nikon DL on order since last October and the same day that Nikon announced that it was cancelling the camera I ordered this Sony RX-10/III. My four stars are a bit misleading because, so far, the only real negative is the size and weight, two factors that I knew about in advance of buying the camera. Still, you do need to be aware that this is a big, heavy camera.<br /><br />On the positive side, you can switch from auto to fully manual focus with the press of a programmable function button and you can elect to have the in-focus objects outlined in red. That way, as you turn the focus ring you can watch the focus plane shift from point to point until only the specific object you want to capture is exactly in focus.<br /><br />The color balance and auto exposure levels seem excellent and I haven't had to make many adjustments in Photoshop to get the results I want. An additional benefit is the easily-accessible exposure compensation dial so that if I'm shooting on a rainy day I can brighten the image in the viewfinder in real time to the level I want before actually taking the shot.<br /><br />Another nice feature that many but not all cameras have is that I can set a minimum shutter speed in Program Mode. I've had occasions with other cameras where I went from sunlight to shadow and lost a series of pictures because the Auto mode lowered the shutter speed too far. Yes, I should have been paying better attention but it's nice to have the ability to set up the camera so that it will protect me from my own mistakes.<br /><br />Since I take a lot of flower pictures I like the camera's ability to focus down to about 30 inches from the subject at full telephoto.<br /><br />I will be taking this camera on a week-long trip to Arizona in April for the desert wild flowers and I will update these comments after I review the hundreds of photos I take on that trip.<br /><br />So far, other than the weight, the only negative is that there is no way to fasten the lens cap to the camera. If you don't fasten it you'll likely lose the lens cap in the first six months of ownership.","This is a fantastic camera. The 24-600 lens is sharp and fast. You don't often need 600 mm but when you do, this one really delivers. But the cameras most fantastic feature is it software.  The text incredible pictures in any environment. And in any backlit situation, the flash delivers stunning results.  I really get a charge out of seeing other photographers when I travel with their 300 mm cannon and Nikon fixed or  zoom lenses which are twice as big as this. They always gape and wonder when they see this camera and what it can do.","Like it so far, from some points of view even love it. Autofocus painfully slow in video, especially at the long end, and that would be my main complain. For the rest, a very good Jack of all Trades","Fantastic camera. Was a little worried about the fixed lens but Sony figured out how to give you everything you need without needing anything else. Takes incredible 4k video with all the spots for accessories built in. The viewing screen tilts up and down, not side to side though. Wasn't a problem for me.

My usual carry-around rig as a nature photographer is a Canon 7D Mark II with a Canon 100-400 mm L lens (first generation).  I love the setup.  When I am traveling light, my camera of choice is a Panasonic DMC ZS40 which has given me award winning shots in a very small package.  I was looking for something in between - an excellent bridge camera as a travel camera.<br /><br />While out on a recent shoot, I ran into a serious photographer with a Sony RX-10 M3 and he just loved the camera.  After watching and reading numerous reviews on this camera, I decided to purchase one.  I absolutely love the camera, and it has endless features.  As an aside, if you get this camera, I highly recommend the book  \"Photographer's Guide to the RX10 III\" by Alexander White for sale here on Amazon.<br /><br />I love the fact that the camera goes from 24-600 mm.  For macro shooting, heretofore I have used a Canon 100mm L macro prime lens, but this beauty does just as good a job and I actually find it easier to focus.  I have attached an example of a flower shot at 600mm.  You can literally touch a subject and focus on it, or take it all the way to 600mm with excellent detail.  It compares favorably with my 100-400mm L lens in results.<br /><br />The video is excellent offering 4K video.  As an aside, if I began to list the amazing features of this camera, this review would take too long to write.  I suggest googling some of the in-depth YouTube videos dealing with this fantastic camera.  You pay more for this beauty, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Although the price might be high for a bridge camera, I paid more for just my 100-400 Canon lens and I find myself leaving it home in favor of taking this camera.","with 1,500 it is very very prefect... very sharp, very  clear image.","Exquisitely designed machine, a joy to use and hold","I have used this camera for months under a variety of circumstances.  By now I leave my Nikon D7100 at home and have sold my big Nikon lenses.  I have found that for me, this is the perfect camera and the quality of the photos is outstanding for a relatively compact camera.  Victor G Zilinskas","I've had it almost a month and really like it, but it is a full size and weight camera so keep that in mind","What an amazing camera! I borrowed the DSC RX10 1 from a friend for two international trips, before purchasing the DSCC-RX10 3. The camera is lightweight, perfect for low light settings and the zoom is great. I'm not sure what I will do with my expensive Canon camera and interchangeable lens, but the new Sony is my new go to camera.<br /><br />I did buy the book by Alexander White on how to use the many features of the camera and even thought I am skilled photographer the book just helps you better use this camera.","This is one of the best cameras I have ever owned. I do a lot of photography for computer art and graphic design and up until now I have been using a DSLR. The quality of the pictures and the video is absolutely fantastic.I have had several cameras including other Sony's and Cannon's. This by far is a great point and shoot for anybody to use.  You will probaly read some negative things about this camera but there's always people who complain about everything.  If your a professional or an amature, you will love this camera. The only complaint about this camera is the price.<br />As far as I'm concerned, I would purchase this camera again for any price.","I have been using this camera for about six months.  It is my second long lens camera with a big sensor, the first being a Panasonic LUMIX.  This camera takes great photographs and the long lens can capture is sharp and true.<br /><br />The wifi function works well.<br /><br />The negatives:  focusing on the ultra slow motion is almost impossible--I have never been able to figure that out.  The lens cap is really horrible.  It was always falling off with any impact, even brushing against my leg.","I never thought I would buy a point-and-shoot camera, especially one in this price range.  I've been a fan of SLR and DSLR cameras for almost fifty years and I love the flexibility of being able to get a lens that is ideal for every situation I might encounter, and even use it without a lens on microscopes and telescopes.  What attracted me to this camera was its high frame rate- up to 1000 frames a second for slow motion videos.<br /><br />Somewhat to my surprise it is also a great general purpose camera, and I find myself using it in place of my DSLR a lot of the time.  The astonishing range of the zoom lens surpasses my DSLR lenses and the picture quality is just as good.  The image stabilization is also excellent- again better than my DSLR.  I couldn't imagine being able to hand hold a camera at equivalent 600mm FL yet this camera does it with ease.<br /><br />This camera is also smarter than any camera I have owned, which is both good and bad.  If you snatch it up to capture a fleeting event it usually does a good job, but when I want something specific it often seems to think it knows better- not always correctly.<br /><br />I had been warned that this camera has poor documentation and user interface, but I was still surprised at how bad it was.  If you want to use the enormous range of capabilities that the camera provides be prepared to spend lots of time experimenting, searching and learning.  I got the Kindle edition \"Photographer's Guide to the Sony RX10 III: Getting the Most from Sony's Advanced Digital Camera\" by Alexander White and it does a good job of getting you started.<br /><br />The camera is big and heavy, which makes it easy to hold and keep it steady.  It also provides space for the numerous dials and controls- some of which can even be customized- when you have spent the requisite hours learning how to do so.<br /><br />This definitely isn't the ideal camera for everyone, but I am finding that I like it more and more.","I researched this camera and the Panasonic FZ2000/2500 thoroughly before I bought this one in an open box sale from Best Buy which forgot to include the AC charger and cord but is working on it. I have only had the camera for a day and on it for now will only say 1) the few photos I have taken under adverse conditions have excellent IQ (much better than I expected) and 2) it is heavy so how you hold it must change as the zoom lens extends. I am learning. It is the reviews of the FZ2000 and Rx10iii which concern me. Only Photoreview out of Australia bothered to provide standardized Imatest resolution and noise test results for it and the FZ2000. There, it was no contest. The RX10iii won hands down on both, notwithstanding the reviewer's rather biased conclusions on IQ. Then, read the comparatively lackluster reviews on IQ of the FZ2000 on the B&H Photo site and the CameraLabs site. Also, my own experience with Panasonic optics has been lackluster IQ with the FZ70/72 and the FZ200, as well as many smaller zooms. Finally, the reviewers of the two cameras spend most of their time describing the cameras' features and saying too little about IQ in a way they back up. Many complain about the Sony's menu system which, contrary to them, is not a mess, but makes most features of the camera accessible by the push of a button if you have the intelligence to figure out how to so set it up. In that regard, I found Alexander White's book on the RX10iii cheap in the Kindle version and truly excellent. Other reviewers test for noise but not IQ at many focal lengths. Many clearly do not have a handle on how to operate the camera well. Conclusion: beware of the reviews, but read them all. I will comment more on the camera and my use of it later.<br /><br />Follow up: Much better than I expected<br /><br />IQ is better than Nikon D5300 and D7100 with upgraded lenses on JPEG's. Still haven't tried RAW yet. Smaller than expected, but not small. About same size as bulky lensed D7200. But really heavier than expected. Far fewer focusing problems than expected; essentially none. Easy and simple to use; hard and complex to set up correctly. Must learn the manual. Alexander White's book on Amazon is excellent help. Stabilization is much better than on Nikon VR and VRII lenses. Product is pricey.  Highly recommended for all in one camera. The Zeiss lens is a masterpiece of optical engineering. Moon shots taken below were hand held at 1680mm (optical + smart zoom), with 70% enlargements. Unbelieveable for a 24 to 600 optical zoom lens that is excellent throughout its range","other than the price - I love it!","Excellent stuff. First class service","This is a Great Camera! It's capabilities and quality are amazing!","I'm not a professional but I absolutely love this camera!  Can't give any technical reasons but that's the point.  You don't have to be a pro to appreciate how easy it is to use, all its features, and the great results.  It makes me feel like a pro!","Glad to carry only one unit for general photog activities. I m still learning about it's capabilities only had a few days ! I can share immediately that it is fairly intuitive for general use to photograph and video. I am very pleased that it allows for an external mike for video audio. The deeper capabilities I ll have to study the manual to become adept. . . Which leads to this: there is no hard copy manual. I called SONY.<br /><br />Do plan on putting additional cash and effort for the manual, as SONY has a 'use your own ink' policy and provides PDF of manual and quick start guide info online. The manual alone is 247 pages so that's at least $24.70 at a printing service site at ten cents a page. Have it printed 1/2 size and make your own book I guess... If I'm working outdoors on assignment, I dont want to have to carry my laptop or read a pdf off my 3 x 5  cell phone screen to check out an icon or setting: in real life I need a hard-copy-cheap-paper manual to reference leaning on a rock in the wind.  I suggest to SONY they give the consumer a break by providing manuals. Is a printed manual  too much to ask for after spending @ 1600 for a devise? (Probably less than one dollar to print on cheap paper) The \"paperless policy\" talking point sounds vaguely green but doesn't stand here - it's clearly use your own ink and own paper.<br /><br />To their credit, I found the phone reps at Sony very helpful with warranty registration and available for phone support. Perhaps a SONY project manager or CEO was in a tight mood for the printing budget and they might re-assess.","Great camera, good for video. Only think I don't like is it picks up zoom motor noise when I use an external mic when recording audio. Also a little loud when turning on, but I'm filming wildlife so its typically not an issue unless you are close to the animal.","Best carera I have ever owned. Easy for beginners and the semi pro as well. A little heavy but lighter than a DSLR with lens.","GREAT camera!","Perhaps the single best camera I own.  As a companion for my Sony RX100M4 it is stunning.  Possibly if I had purchased it before my Nikon D810 the Nikon would still be at the store.  It's that good.","Camera is amazing.  Took it on Safari in Africa.  It was exceptionally easy to use.  The long built in zoom worked well.  The clarity of photos is great.  I love this camera.<br /><br />But...  it stopped working after 2 mos. won't turn on.  I changed 3 batteries, tried to charge directly... nothing.  Called Sony...  they asked me to ship it to an authorized repair shop - who want to charge$360 to repair it.  Not sure how long this will take.<br /><br />I miss the camera as it was a perfect combination of features I wanted without having to change lenses.","This camera works better than expected.  Every photo I've taken has been perfect!","I loved the original RX10 when it came several years ago. It's only limitation was limited zoom. The Mark iii has addressed that and is well worth the trade off of no longer having the fixed 2.8 aperture. I only wonder why the neutral density filter was lost vs the original, but can add an ND filter when needed. This camera has caused the retirement of my DSLR. I hated lugging around multiple lenses. I acquired an RX100 M1 before the RX10 and loved it at the time. But now it has been largely retired from pocketability perspective due to the amazing photos my Samsung S7 takes.","Glad I purchased this camera.","I have had a number of ridge cameras including the Canon SX30 IS.  It was a wonderful camera and their new models are vastly improved.  But I have never had a camera of this quality, While serving as a bridge camera, the DSC-RX10 lll delivers professional quality shots.  The zoom lens is fantastic as well as all the features Sony packed into this camera.","I ended up having to buy from a different vendor as it was out of stock on Amazon.  This camera is awesome for photographing my son in his sports of swimming and football.  I can sit in the stands and the 600mm reach easily gets to the action.  If I need further reach I can use in camera digital zoom to 1200mm.  If most all your photo sharing is done digitally (vs. print) this camera produces the results you want.  As long as there is good lighting the results are outstanding.","amazing camera!! Excellent for travelers. I recommend having extra batteries, if you travel","This camera is truly awesome.  It fully lives up to it's reviews.  My only complaint is that it's a beast. If you buy one, and you should if you travel a lot and want a one camera solution for all your needs, make certain that you also purchase a comfortable camera strap, i.e., fully padded.  We just returned from Europe and I regretted not having such a strap.  After a full day of sightseeing, my neck was pretty sore from the weight of the camera.  However, the outstanding photos rendered by this camera made up for that temporary discomfort.","A powerful Sony high end P&S camera which provides equivalent capabilities of most all \"bridge-level\" DSLR/DSLT products.  I also own/use Canon and Nikon DSLR's, and have numerous Sony products including their DSLT Alpha's and newer ILCE A6000/6300 types. I have personally gravitated towards Sony products - perhaps because their Camera's Controls, in-Camera Menu systems, etc. seem to work the way I personally think, and I've had very good photo, and sharp video success with Sony products.  I'm NOT taking anything away from Canon or Nikon they too have excellent products - I also frequently utilize a pair of my (now) older Canon EOS 60D and Nikon \"D\" Series DSLR's.  But all the nice \"stuff\" being said about Sony products is dramatically overshadowed by a couple major concerns/issues:<br /><br />(1) Documentation for detailed usage (you know, the 250+ page stuff) especially for their higher-end P&S, and Bridge level products is terrible!  Or simply stated another way their \"On-Line Detailed User Manuals\" are poorly done at best, and they still DO NOT enable continuous hardcopy printing of multiple pages, or whole sections, in a traditional \"Table Of Contents\" manner to have information (as in a traditional book) that you could place in a 3-ring binder or similar containment if electronic means are not accessible.  Sony utilizes on-line electronic Cascading Sheets Formatting methodology only!<br /><br />(2) Sony \"still\" DOES NOT have fully operational PMH (Play Memories Home) Browser Software for APPLE iMac PC's with OS X operating system (i.e. EL Capitan) - their PMH is a free Photo & Video Browser system which has enhanced editing and printing functionality and is \"actually quite nice\". However, even with the appropriate PMH for Apple iMac systems installed you ARE NOT even able to select \"Print Orientation\" (Portrait or Landscape) only limited Portrait usage!  Whereas you DO have full functionality using a Windows-based PC.  I and others have advised Sony Support numerous times - the Answer is always...\"We have submitted your input to additional sources\"! Hmmm?<br /><br />Simply stated about the camera itself: The original Sony RX10, RX10 II, and now the RX10 III are a family of truly top shelf, high-end Point and Shoot products that are very fast, with excellent fidelity of photo, video, and image color capturing, with numerous user functional choices of \"how\" you want your images taken, or to appear - or just leave it in Auto Mode.  Their all-Metal Magnesium Frame makes them a physically strong camera product  and User Controls are placed in easy access positions.  Sony's pricing for the RX10's family of products has always been \"higher\" than other competitors offerings (such as the successful Panasonic FZ1000 - or potential FZ2000 at some future point), but undeniably the Sony RX10 products, and now the RX10 III are still the best built, most powerful P&S you can easily utilize for ALL purposes.  Just wish Sony would get it together regarding their poorly done \"detailed usage\" documentation - even just 5yrs. years ago, Sony had very good documentation.  Do not be afraid to own the Sony RX10 III or even their prior RX10's now at very competitive pricing.","The camera has been out of stock at Amazon so I purchased it elsewhere. I own Nikon and Canon DSLRs and I find the Sony RX 10 iii to be an outstanding camera with many marvelous features. The problem is the lack of documentation. The doc that comes with the camera is bare bones and wholly inadequate as a source of learning how to use this amazing instrument. So I just received (from Amazon, of course) the \"Photographer's Guide to the Sony DSC-RX10 II\" by Alexander White. With the exception of the incredible 24-600 Zoom lens, Sony made very little changes to the camera when it introduced the RX10 III.<br /><br />If you love digital photography, you are gonna love the RX10 III!!!!","Pretty damn amazing for an all-in-one camera.  Very capable.  But it's bigger and heavier than I thought it would be, and it's not what I was looking for.  So I ended up returning it.<br /><br />But if you don't mind the size -- about the same as a small DSLR or larger mirrorless camera -- it's quite good.","Tack sharp photographs.  Exactly what I was looking for and I did a great deal of research before making a choice that I am truly happy with.  Yo can see my photos, taken with the RX10 III on Flickr.  Fantastic camera.  It is a bit heavy but after some time you get used to the heft.  It's a great camera.","exactly what I expected","Awesome! Needs waterproof housing soon!","I've bought and used practically every super-zoom \"bridge\" camera that's come on the market in the past 10 years, looking for a \"grab and go\" option to my DSLRs and assorted lenses.<br />The list includes Nikon, Canon, Panasonic (Lumix), Fuji, etc.<br />Although I have questions about the mental health of the persons who designed the internal menus...and wish it had phase detection focusing...the new SONY is hands-down  the winner in overall quality and utility.<br />That Zeiss lens is simply amazing! At comparable resolutions, the image quality is nearly indistinguishable from my Nikon D810 with pro glass!","First, if you are buying this camera, purchase with it an external battery charger and download the full users/help manual from the Sony website.  It comes with neither.  As purchased, you can only charge the battery in the camera tethered to a short cable plugged into the wall.  This puts your camera out of action and an opportunity to step on it in a hotel room.  The manual that comes with the camera is like knowing all the bones in the body without any idea how they go together.  The full manual is far more informative.<br /><br />This obviously is not a pocket size travel camera.  But if you've given up carrying a full size DSLR camera and lenses on travel, this camera is a happy compromise.  The new 1 inch sensors take remarkably good pictures and the reach of a 600mm lens gives you the shots you might otherwise miss or be too small to be useful.  Yes, the pros tell you to move closer to your subjects to get the shot.  Try doing that in a country where people don't like having their pictures taken.  With the reach of a 600mm lens you can shoot across the town square and if your subject notices and isn't happy at least you'll have a good head start. Likewise, this camera does reasonably well with wildlife, if sometimes a little slow in focusing. Video is excellent, although I have not used it for more that a few minutes at a time.<br /><br />You can use this camera in point and shoot mode but presumably if you're looking at this camera you know about all the other DSLR-like functions it has, all of which work very well.  Many reviews cite this camera's \"confusing\" menus.  I found the logic of the menus fairly straight- forward and easy to navigate.  The two function buttons can also be easily customized allowing immediate call up covering almost all travel situations. The panorama mode on this camera actually works, but takes some practice to get right.<br /><br />For travel, this camera is pretty easy to live with.  Weather sealing is a huge plus, especially in dusty or damp environments.  Because it is a relatively heavy camera that you mostly carry around your neck, I'd also suggest getting a padded strap to replace the the fairly narrow nylon strap that comes with the camera.  The body and lens are reasonably sturdy and will take the occasional hit without damage. But it is certainly not a ruggedized camera.  I found I get close to the advertised 420 shots before replacing the battery.  Buying a second carry-along battery is strongly suggested.<br /><br />In sum, this camera won't fit in your pocket but does a good job of replacing a DSLR camera for lighter travel.","Absolutely best zoom I've ever had. Picture quality is amazing. Haven't really taken it for a long test drive, but so far very, very pleased.","I sold my DSLR with all the lenses for this , an all in one perfect camera that also gives you unmatched zoom capabilities especially for Slowmotion. A perfect product from all aspects. Highly recommended. Check the quality of Slowmotion I was able to to with it.<br />[...]","A gift for my husband for his Birthday and Father's Day.  He loves this camera after having a Sony RX10 regular.  Love Sony and their customer service when needed is fantastic.","I wanted this to be my magic bullet my do all one camera system.  Images were spectacular, zoom range was incredible, albeit slow electronic zoom to get from wide to tele.  The 4K video was sharp and smooth best I have ever used, the slow motion capabilities were mind blowing although I was not a skilled user it could prove a great tool.<br />My only complaint was AF speed and shutter response, it is painfully slow compared to my Micro four thirds system I was hoping to replace.  And even slower compared to a DSLR from the the past few years.  If you are coming from a bridge camera or a smaller point and shoot this may be an improvement for you, but this will not replace a MILC or DSLR for any moving subjects or active wildlife uses.","When you look at this camera, you must refrain from the apples-to-oranges comparisons.  That is, this is a \"bridge camera\" with a 1\" sensor and<br />a \"honkin'\" 24-600 mm lens.  Experience tells us not to expect too much from an arguably niche camera like this.  But preconceived notions can be wrong.<br />This camera, for what it is, captures quite good (sometimes surprisingly good) images.  The Zeiss lens seems to be at its sharpest somewhere around f/4 to f/5.6 and is even sharp wide open ... to my eye it is subject to some diffraction effect above maybe f/8.  You want nice slo-mo (best at 120)? CHECK.  You want GOOD OIS? CHECK. You want 4K video? CHECK.  This camera is a tech marvel and is a joy to shoot.<br />No camera is perfect.  This unit weighs around 2.5 pounds - not light, not heavy - get a decent strap like the op/TECH uni and it feels fine.<br />Contrast detect rather that phase detect might make AF a bit less snappy, but it usually is OK.<br />Don't expect to make gallery-ready 24\" by 36\" prints (you need a Sony A7R2 for that) or you may be disappointed (you could use \"Blow Up\" though).<br />And don't leave the lens objective unprotected since a big scratch on this lens would be a bummer.<br />Verdict:  This is a great \"travel\" camera, a great everyday/grab-and-go camera, a great backup camera for your main 42MP camera,<br />a 600mm (that you can push to 1200mm!) birding camera, and IS FUN to use.  If you think that a phone camera can do what this can do,<br />you are terribly mistaken.","Ok","Great travel camera! This is the best \"all in one\" camera on the market right now. The improved image sensor in this model provides stunning image quality and excellent 4K video clips. I had the original RX10 and really liked that camera. However this latest model blows the original away in mage quality and lens performance. The 24 - 600 zoom has an incredible focal length range that allows for detailed close ups from quite a distance. The images have excellent color, dynamic range and contrast straight out of the camera. The camera is pretty easy to set up. The price is on the high side but the image quality is almost equal to my 4 year old full frame Canon DSLR. The only downside is that you can not make deep crops of the photos you take, the picture quality goes down in a hurry. But if you don't crop your images the quality is awesome.<br />I highly recommend this camera for all forms of general photography, especially if you need extreme telephoto coverage. This would make a great wildlife and birding camera without getting into the expense of a DSLR. I recently returned from an awesome trip out of the country and came back with photographs of a quality that previously would only be available hauling a full frame DSLR around.","Great bridge camera. Love the reach of the lenses. Wish the focusing was faster.","Left the world of Canon to try my first Sony camera. The quality of this camera is great, and all of the YouTube reviews and so on are correct about the shooting quality.<br /><br />However, the full user experiences trying to learn the camera is worthless. Where Canon have an entire community with content helping you to get the most out of their product. Sony leaves you with a small booklet that is about as inspiring as doing your taxes. No examples or index for using the functions and key features only described with a few lines of text.<br /><br />They did get my hopes up by referring to an online manual, but the same thing there. The site looks like is produced in 1998 compared to what they have spent money on trying to sell the camera. Sony should learn from brands like Apple, Canon, and Tesla. It's not just about getting someone to buy your boxes; you have to turn your customers into happy users as well.","I went through a bit of a journey to get to this camera.  Earlier last year, I had a Canon SX50, which has the wonderful 50x optical zoom, but the small sensor left a bit to be desired.  I bought a DSLR over Christmas (Nikon D3300), but I hated switching lenses and carrying around all that gear (including a monster Sigma 150-600 lens).  At this point, I had pretty much narrowed down my criteria for a camera:<br />--Simplicity and convenience (so no interchangeable lens cameras)<br />--A good amount of zoom (I like going to zoos, and I want the ability to zoom in on a tiger one moment and take a picture of some trees the next)<br />--A good-sized sensor:  that is, bigger than a smartphone/cheaper point-and-shoot<br />--An electronic level/digital horizon--I also like going hiking, and I don't want to worry about crooked mountains<br />--A panorama mode<br />--An electronic viewfinder<br />--Fast autofocus<br />I almost always shoot in Auto, but it's nice to have manual options.  I never shoot video, so 4k and ultra slow motion are nice, but not that important.<br />I sold the Nikon in favor of the Panasonic FZ1000, which is a fantastic camera, one I recommend almost without reservations.  At some point during this I also tried the Canon G3 X, which is another 24-600mm range 1\" sensor camera, but it didn't have an attached viewfinder, and autofocus was pretty slow.  The only thing that I wanted that the Panasonic didn't have was a little more range.  Enter the Sony RX 10 Mark III, which has the huge range I wanted.  I took it to the Jacksonville Zoo and took more than 500 pictures.  Let me first say that the range is fantastic.  It barely broke a sweat getting up close and personal with a lot of animals.  However, I did notice some issues.  I think that compared to the FZ1000, the Sony's autofocus is not quite as fast.  Additionally, its low light performance is not great.  I had some issues in the darker reptile house, and I don't remember having issues like that with the Panasonic.  Furthermore, I prefer the Panasonic's fully articulating screen, and of course, it's less than half the price.  In sum, the RX 10 III is a good camera, but if you don't absolutely need the increased range, I'd say go with the FZ1000.  I'll keep my eye out for the FZ2000:).","I did not buy this camera at Amazon but at a local camera store but it's amazing!  I can't tell you how many bridge cameras I've bought over just the last two years!  The closest I ever came was the Lumiz FZ1000 but 400mm lens was too much of a limitation.  This is the bridge camera I've been waiting for... I could not be happier with the camera in every possible way.  Sure, it's overpriced but it's still worth it..!!!  :)","[[VIDEOID:5994386225bc559538104f6dc275deee]]I have not bought the camera on Amazon but I wanted to share a few notes for those whom are interested. I own various DSLRs and mirrorless systems and do occasional professional work. This is a bridge camera that would do 70-80% of what a fully kitted pro system with multiple lenses can do with a zoom reach hard to beat without a decent money spent. I also own FZ1000, used and liked it extensively but was not fully pleased with the image quality (mostly noise and sharpness) either in RAW or JPEG formats. I found the images shot on RX10 iii much clear and sharp without post processing.  On video quality, please note HFR (High Frame Rate) modes up to 1000fps does NOT shoot in 4k, it shoots 1080p but very with very pleasing results. One key difference from RX10 ii is that RX10 iii does NOT have internal ND filters; in case it is a must for the user it has to be bought separately (72mm thread). I personally found the zoom reach in excess of 400mm to 600mm very useful. For some reason at or near 400mm FZ1000 was lacking contrast deeply, this one does not. Menu system is an acquired taste as any Sony system but with some patience, the camera may be personalised extensively.  Focus tracking works fine (not a workhorse for sports shoots but does the trick most of the time) and at high frame rate it works great. Attaching some pictures and a 250fps video. I have added a Hoya CPL to the lens otherwise images and the video are untouched. If you'd like to have any questions, please ask along as I am very pleased with this purchase and at this price point it should answer many needs as a great bridge camera or the 2nd unit for a pro shooter.","I like it.  Many dials make it easy to change most settings without diving into menus.  F4 is pretty fast, 600mm is pretty long.  Frame rate allows capture of action, like BIFs.  1200mm Clear Zoom seems to work well.","This is a somewhat revised review based on an additional month or more of experience with this camera. This is my seventh Sony digital camera (Sony Alpha 55/65/99/77ii) and my third RX model (after owning and loving both the RX1 & RX100III). So you could say I’m biased, or alternatively, pretty comfortable with Sony products and operating systems. There is little question that Sony is at the head of the class in designing sensors for digital cameras, and they lead if not dominate the sensor market, all the way from cell phones to medium format and virtually everything in between. On the other hand, there have been times when users might readily question whether they have clearly moved past simply making great sensors to creating great cameras and great camera systems.  The latter takes a very different set of technical skills from the former.<br /><br />Opinions on this vary of course, but I believe that their recent products suggest that Sony continues to learn, evolve, and improve their grasp of what it takes to create a great camera (and system) beyond simply a great sensor. This latest effort is overall most impressive, with only a few caveats and minor problems. Indeed, if you could carry only one camera with one lens with you on a long trip and were not constrained to carry something that would fit just in your pocket, I cannot imagine a better choice for an enormous variety of shooting situations, for both video and stills. It’s the digital photography equivalent of a brilliantly balanced decathlete, who can’t really challenge the best in the world at the glamour events of sprinting (analogously, not as good as FF professional equipment in stills photography where their DR and low light S/N performance is clearly way better), but whose overall excellence and versatility is very tough to equal.  And in good light, it’s capable of taking excellent still images, and simply stunning video. Its video is leagues better than virtually any professional full frame stills camera, excepting the Sony A7Rii/ASii (two models that can equal it in the HD and 4k video department). It offers very high quality video in both more traditional 1080p as well as newer 4K modes, and excellent still photography image quality, as long as you stay under ISO 800 (and frankly ISO 400 is a reasonable limit if you’re shooting JPEGs and want fairly clean images). The lens provides an enormous range of view angles from wide-angle to super telephoto plus a macro ability at 600mm, and with generally excellent optical quality.  The lens itself a technological tour de force, and recent formal testing suggests that it is sharper at least most of the time than the lens on the competing Panasonic FZ 1000 as well as perhaps slightly sharper than the fine lens on the RX10 Mark 2. The lens alone might be almost worth the purchase price, as there’s nothing like it available on larger APS-C or full frame sensors.  Its optical quality easily exceeds the nearest APS-C competition, the recently released 16-300 Tamron, which has only ¾ the reach, and is not nearly as fast, and that lens is not remotely as sharp all the way out (at a 450mm equivalent view) as this lens is at 600mm equiv. view.  Of course, it’s not a fair comparison, as smaller sensors allow the construction of lenses that would simply be huge (and hugely expensive), on larger sensors. Still, with all these qualifications, it’s a very impressive lens.  I would argue based on recent testing (see the DPR and IR reviews) that it’s the best 24-600 anyone has built up to this point in time (and it’s in another league from the only other 24-600 on a 1” sensor, the lens on the Canon G3x).<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the RX10 line, some history might be useful. The original Sony RX 10 Mark 1 came out with basically the same operating system and sensor as the hugely successful, much more compact Sony RX100, but with a significantly larger and faster and more versatile 24-200 2.8 lens, and a correspondingly larger form factor. Features on that groundbreaking first model included:<br /><br />20.9 MP 1”-type Exmor R CMOS sensor with BSI construction<br />24-200mm equivalent F2.8 lens with optical image stabilization<br />Up to 10 FPS continuous shooting<br />ISO 125 - 12800 (expandable to ISO 80)<br />3” tiltable LCD with 1,228,000 dots<br />Built-in 1.44M dot electronic viewfinder<br />1080 60p/24p HD video with full exposure control (MPEG-4/AVCHD)<br />Raw/JPEG/ Raw+JPEG<br />Built-in flash and expandable Smart Accessory Shoe for system accessories<br />Eye AF function detects and focuses on a subject’s eye<br />Built-in Wi-Fi and NFC for sharing and remote camera control<br />Bright F2.8 Zeiss Vario Sonnar T* Lens (24-200mm)<br />Fast AF thanks to new “BIONZ X” processing engine (but using CDAF instead of on-sensor PDAF).<br /><br />It easily garnered a Gold Award from DP Review, but it was rather expensive on release, at $1300, although it has now dropped significantly to only $800, less than two thirds that price. It was fairly successful commercially, although its high price made it less attractive than its closest large sensor compact rival the Panasonic FZ 1000 (which used the same Sony sensor as the RX10), but which sported a lens that went twice as long to 400 mm, even if not a constant f2.8 – and it offered in body 4K, two very significant advantages, all for a $300 lower price. It generally looked like clearly the better value, and was rated slightly higher on DPR, also easily garnering a Gold Award.<br /><br />Sony was clearly not content to rest on this first benchmark, and knew that they needed to up their game in view of Panasonic’s impressive offering in the FZ 1000. That original model RX10, released in early 2014, was updated early last year in the RX10 Mark 2, which provided all of the previously mentioned features plus some very significant upgrades, centered around a ‘stacked’ sensor, with very fast data readout enabled by the layered sensor construction, allowing extremely high frame rates, up to 960 FPS in slightly down-rezed HD, along with now being able to do in-body 4K recording (finally!), and gaining a useful bump in continuous shooting from 10 frames per second to 14 frames per second (but with AF locked from the first frame). Sony has chosen (at least so far) not to sell this new sensor to the competition, so there are no directly competing compact larger sensor compacts from Canon, Nikon, or Panasonic (unclear what the sensor is in the new Nikon DL 24-500 which is late arriving to market due to production problems in Japan but it’s not likely a Sony sensor). In any case, this seems to parallel their new-found reluctance to sell their state-of-the-art full frame 42 megapixel BSI sensor to Nikon. Perhaps they’ve decided that when they have a technological advantage, they’re no longer going to give it away, even at a premium cost, to the competition. Perhaps long overdue?<br /><br />Both of those predecessor RX 10 (I/II) models are still available, so the RX 10 Mark 3 is intended to be their ‘big brother’, taking all of the advances in the Mark 2 and adding the impressive 24-600 f 2.4-4.0 Zeiss lens. The weight penalty from the 3x longer telephoto reach increases only modestly from 849g to 1095g (both weights w/batteries). This creates essentially a super-zoom ‘bridge camera’, but with a significantly larger sensor than that class of camera has traditionally contained. And while it can’t compete with the truly ridiculous 83x optical zoom of the Nikon P900, its 24x zoom exceeds anything currently available on the 1” Sony sensor. Given that the newest version of this exceptional sensor is still only available currently in Sony products, this means that these cameras are without real peers – although there is now more competition with several more compact travel zooms from both Canon and Panasonic using an earlier version of the 1 inch Sony sensor in addition to the aforementioned Panasonic FZ 1000 – but nothing remotely as fast as this lens.  Additionally, initial testing suggests that this lens is significantly sharper than the lens on the Panasonic FZ 1000.<br /><br />So . . . . how does it function? Overall, I’d have to say exceptionally well, although it’s not perfect, and its autofocus system is still a LARGE step down from the best PDAF systems, particularly in low light, and, like its predecessors, the price of admission is steep. Then again, there’s nothing quite like it, and although it will clearly not take the place of full frame or even APS-C equipment, in low light, or for shooting wildlife or sports at the highest possible image quality with long telephoto primes, it offers a set of functional competencies in a single package that are extraordinary, even when you have to take into consideration its rather steep price. You get what you pay for here.  I would say that if you weigh still image and video image quality equally, it’s the best camera I’ve ever had, and the best on the market for under $3k – and only bested by the likes of the Sony A7Rii and A7Sii, but not on the video side, only on the still image side.<br /><br />The photographs at the end of the review show the RX10iii compared to an APS-C semipro a77ii body with a Sony 70-400 G2 lens offering comparable telephoto reach.  Although that big and heavy combination (costing nearly $3000 or twice the cost of the Sony RX 10iii) clearly takes better pictures as ISO drifts past 800, or when autofocus demands are particularly challenging, in bright light and when the target is not challenging the CDAF, there is little to separate this camera from an expensive APS-C rig costing twice as much and weighing almost three times as much.  Additionally, when I’m using the RX10iii and taking advantage of the ~ one stop faster lens aperture, and the two stops better OIS, I can undercut the ISO of a larger ILC by two stops at least, where the 1” sensor is now less noisy than the sensor in the A77ii.  To be clear, I’m not suggesting that this camera can replace APS-C let alone full frame equipment for taking the best possible picture, particularly in challenging light, but I am impressed with how close it can get in good light and where the autofocus system is not unduly challenged. And the 4k video is so good, when displayed on a 4k set that has been properly adjusted and calibrated, that it will take your breath away.  It’s like looking through a window onto the subject matter.  And the audio is excellent to boot.  If you love video, don’t mind getting bigger hard drives, and like a ‘single solution’ that avoids all lens switching hassles (and lots of other hassles too associated with that big bag of gear you’ve been toting for years), buy one.  If you’re not sure, rent one.  It will likely win you over in short order.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) Extraordinary ‘stacked’ BSI 1 inch sensor with exceptional versatility, capable of 4K video in body, high resolution 20 megapixel stills, variable high frame rate video up to 960 FPS, an overall package of capabilities currently unmatched by any single system in the digital photography world.<br />2) Customizable menu and operating system, with high degree of menu organization overlap with other Sony cameras (but see cons).  You can customize this to the moon, in terms of several custom buttons, and multiple settings, such as whether aperture ring has click stops or smooth action.<br />3) Overall very good photo IQ quality, with decent lowlight ability.  Good JPEGs to ISO 400-800, and usable RAW to 1600, and perhaps even to 3200 for smaller prints and web postings – losing ~ 1.5 stops in low light ability compared to the Sony A6300 which is competitive with the best APS-C bodies, and about 2.5-3 stops compared to full frame.<br />4) Remarkable 24-600 f2.4-4 lens that has very few weaknesses (but see cons). Sharp, contrasty, and with variable speed zooming action. Capable of minimal focusing distance of 2.3 feet, essentially making it a .4x macro lens at 600 mm.<br />5) Exceptional video, rivaling professional 4K equipment, and excellent sharpness and definition with minimal moiré at both 4K and 1080p. Many advanced video features including various S log profiles, focus peaking, flat picture profile, etc. Possibly an even better video cam than still cam?<br />6) Decent autofocus – certainly a step down from the A77II, but not nearly as bad as several reviews have suggested (but see cons). In good light, AF is reasonably fast and accurate. And given the CDAF on-sensor, no endless fiddling with MFA (I dislike dealing with MFA on cameras with traditional separate dedicated PDAF arrays).<br />7) Excellent EVF, fully the equal of the unit on the A77ii, bright, contrasty, fast, and very sharp. Image stabilized (even more so than the A77ii which also sports this feature, given virtue #8).  You get to see exactly what the picture is going to look like before you shoot it.  After you’ve used a first rate EVF, OVFs seem quite primitive and confining.<br />8) Highly effective IS worth ~ 4-5 stops.  This is significantly improved from the previous model.  I have taken many shots at 1/10 sec (!) exposure (on non-moving subjects) at 600mm equiv. view and had many of them be quite sharp.  Significantly mitigates noisier 1 inch sensor, and allows you to shoot at lower ISOs (can typically beat ISO of a Sony A77ii which has a less effective IBIS by two stops).<br />9) Both zoom and focus rings are now on the lens barrel, and can be customized in terms of placement (either ring can be assigned to zoom or focus) and lens zoom speed is nicely variable – but see cons.<br />10) Video IS has options for modes that offer very impressive stabilization, at least in 1080p (if not in 4k).<br />11) Excellent, if not remarkable, remote control software, in form of numerous apps.  Apps can be activated easily from a custom button, allowing, for example, total smart phone remote control, time lapse, star trails, or special portrait face processing, among the many useful Sony app store apps.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) Weight and balance. Not only is this significantly heavier than the RX 10II, but it’s a bit front heavy with the lens.<br />2) Menu system – many have commented on the top heavy and cumbersome nature of the Sony operating system where you often have to do a lot of menu diving. Somewhat offset by the highly accessible Function menu, which gives you easy access to your most frequently changed settings, and by the highly customizable buttons.<br />3) Not the camera for sports action junkies. Continuous autofocus is disappointing if you’re coming from dedicated PDAF arrays and it’s a large step down from the Sony A77II, and other large bodied cameras with excellent PDAF.<br />4) Clearly struggles a bit with autofocus in low light - one suspects the next generation will have PDAF or perhaps hybrid PDAF-CDAF. Takes significantly longer to achieve AF lock in dimly lit indoor scenes, and you often times have to hunt for a high contrast edge.  PDAF is likely in line for the RX10M4?<br />5) Lack of a touchscreen is a deficit for some, although not for this user.  However this is a consistent complaint in reviews (including no doubt in the upcoming DPR review).<br />6) As a minor ergonomic gripe, the back control buttons are virtually flat with the surface instead of more raised up, making simple tactile location and control more challenging and requiring more focused attention.<br />7) The focus and zoom ring control systems are both fly-by-wire systems, and lack any version of tactile feedback or immediacy.<br />8) Video IS during 4k is limited to the least effective (but still decent) base IS mode (presumably limited to prevent overheating).<br />9) As minor gripe, deleting images on smartphone not allowed from smartphone.<br />10) As another minor gripe, lens retraction is automatic after a minute or so of inactivity (configurable as a menu item?).<br /><br />Pros and Cons Relative to the Panasonic FZ 1000<br /><br />Pros (Relative to the Sony)<br /><br />Way cheaper (basically half the cost)<br />Faster Autofocus (DFD is excellent)<br />Less turgid menu structure?<br /><br />Cons (Relative to the Sony)<br /><br />Not nearly as much reach (400mm vs. 600mm)<br />Lens not a sharp or as fast (Sony is f4 at long end)<br />Sony has better build quality and is weather resistant<br />Sony may have 4k IQ advantage<br />Sony may have a JPEG engine advantage<br /><br />The well-informed reader will note that both the Panasonic FZ 2500 and the Nikon DL 24-500 are conspicuous by their absence, as these are both still unavailable, and the Nikon is looking like it's not going to be available any time soon, whereas the FZ 2500 is supposedly shipping in November.  It's likely that the new Panasonic model will continue to autofocus faster than the RX10iii, with Panasonic's excellent Depth-from-Defocus algorithms.  However it's unlikely that the lens, even though they've extended it to 480mm, will be fully the equal of the 24-600 F2.4-4 in terms of sharpness, and it certainly isn't as fast at the long end, but getting within half a stop of the Sony at 480 (f4.5 vs.f4).  The FZ 2500 however it does have a very video-centric operating system, and it's possible that with all the upgrades that it equals or perhaps even slightly exceeds the RX10iii in the 4k video department - and most regard the current 4K video coming from the FZ 1000 as perhaps not quite fully the equal of the 4K coming from the Sony RX10M3.  The Nikon DL 24-500 has the advantage of a hybrid autofocus system phase detection on chip which is likely to offer faster autofocus than the simpler contrast detection method on the Sony, but nobody's actually seen one of these cameras, or tested one, so who knows.  The DL is also supposed to offer high frame rate video, but the lens is neither as long nor as fast as the Sony's.  On the other hand, both the new Panasonic FZ 2500 ($1200) and the Nikon DL ($1000) are going to significantly undercut the price of the Sony RX10M3, which should put some downward price pressure on the Sony model.  Competition is after all good for the consumer and prices.  Right now, as of the first week in October, this camera still doesn't really have any true competition as neither the Nikon DL 24-500 or the new Panasonic FZ 2000/2500 have even been tested by the digital photography press – And right now they're both unavailable. For those with smaller budgets, both the Panasonic FZ1000 and the Sony RX10M2 remain the most attractive options.<br /><br />In any case, I’m finding far more to like than dislike as I get to know the camera and its systems - I'm now in my fourth month of ownership. As a neat bonus for those with other Sony cams, you can simply drop your SD card from an RX100 or other Sony product into this and go, and your photos and videos across different bodies appear in a neat chronological order when reviewing, and in their normal folder (as long as you don’t stray from the default folder assignments). I’m finding this a big plus and highly convenient, as I can rotate the SD card from body to body, depending on what I’m shooting. While I can’t review or magnify photos from an A77ii or RX1 (due to the larger image dimensions?), I can still see them in the viewfinder, and all RX100 photos can be conventionally magnified and manipulated. As another neat bonus, there are a huge number of useful apps, although not cheap, with many of them $10, at Sony app store (but some are $5 and some are free). Some are potentially very useful for specialized shooting situations: Star Trails and Time Lapse apps, a super-bracketing app, a Sky ultra-high HDR app, and both sync to smartphone and smart remote control apps (both free). While some of these may strike some users as gimmicky, the results so far suggest the apps are quite effective at what they do.  In fact, the remote control app that works both for this model and various RX 100 iterations is possibly the best in its class, and allows you to control many shooting parameters from a smartphone remotely.  When shooting on a tripod, it's really quite useful. It allows super-stealthy shutter activations (as far as 30 ft. away from the camera) without any chance of moving the camera when you press the shutter button.  Don’t leave home without it.  I have gotten some amazing wildlife picture using the smartphone remote app from inside the house, while the camera and tripod are outside.<br /><br />I’m impressed with the fundamental truth of the old aphorism – “it’s all trade-offs”. While this camera comes close to excelling at everything, there are still important compromises that you must appreciate: this camera trades off some weight and slightly more compact size against its smaller brother RX-10II, trades off any version of ‘pocketability’ to the RX 100 series, trades off photo (but not video) image quality against bigger APS-C, let alone FF, equipment, and trades off cost against the slightly less capable Panasonic FZ1000 and the minimally less capable RX-10II. You’ll have to decide for yourself what your optimum balance points might be, and how you might trade your favorite virtue against other functional competencies, particularly how much ‘pocketability’ trumps excellence in other areas. Certainly there is little difference in picture quality – if you are shooting at 24-70 mm – between this camera and the much more compact RX-100IV. So for shooting where I simply can’t stand to carry anything even moderately sized, this will not displace the Sony RX100 (I have the M3 version). However, for a ‘single solution,’ encompassing high degrees of competence in relationship to both still photography and videos, and offering an enormous range of focal lengths, it’s hard to find a more balanced athlete than the Sony RX 10 III. There is a reason why is camera is sold out virtually everywhere and often backordered all the way to November . . . demand for this kind of exceptional flexibility and versatility has been running very high ever since its introduction in May.  And Sony concedes that they have grossly underestimated the enormous demand for this camera, and they are scrambling to catch up.","I was skeptical at first because there were no actual user reviews to go by. I did a lot of research on this camera. I knew that if I did not like it I could return with refund.<br /><br />I preordered this camera and I have had it since it first came out several days now.<br /><br />I have been doing a lot of testing with this camera.<br /><br />I never needed the manual because everything was self explanatory.<br /><br />I have not had any problems with reading the menu or making any adjustments whatsoever. I found the menu to be very intuitive and very simple to use. If I could I would give this camera a 10 just because it is so simple to use and because of the exceptional image quality I am getting out of it. I have been getting just as good if not better pictures from this camera as my Nikon Dslrs and my Nikon pro lenses. Even in full auto mode in bright and dark contrasting lighting situations I am getting beautiful shots. Same thing in low light with and without a flash.<br /><br />I went to Amazon and picked up a wall charger for $4.98 + $2.98 shipping.<br /><br />I am very happy with this camera and I am glad to be able to take this one camera with me and get all the focal lengths I need without carrying the extra lens's and changing out lens's.<br /><br />This camera is a game changer and a revolution.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera....<br /><br />Go here for a more detailed review of this camera by Ken Rockwelll.<br />[...]<br />Really is amazing image quality...","This is a great camera and I would give it four or more stars IF I could set it up correctly to be able to USE the bloody thing!!  ??  I am a \"recovering\" and former pro photog.  I have a Sony RX 100 (first version), so I am familiar with Sony cameras in general.  ALL Sony \"manuals\" are pathetic and insult one's intelligence!!!  And they are tiny and the type size is too small to comfortably read.  You need a huge magnifying glass to see their type size!!  So with that in mind, I bought Alex White's huge guide to the RX 10 version II. The version III book is not out yet.  But there is very little difference feature wise.  Even so, this camera is a beast to try and set up!!!!! ??????????  I spent one day just trying to find out how to turn off the virtual horizon!!  Only to find out the next morning that it had mysteriously come back, again obscuring the viewfinder!!  WTF???!!!  This just one example.  My tiny Sony RX -100 was so much easier to set up and tweak!!!  At this rate, it will take me a bloody month to learn how to operate the darn thing!  Not good Sony!  Not everybody has an engineer's thought process or savy!!<br />Sony instruction manuals are nortorius for their difficulty to use (worthless really) and their camera's occult menus and sub menus!  It is a simple fix, Sony!!  Wake the heck up!!!  That is why in general there is a huge business in \"after market\" comprehensive instruction books!!  The engineers write the instruction books on their level of knowledge of the camera!  Now that is stupid!!  Half the micro-sized instruction booklets just talk about safety topics, etc.  you know what I mean....<br /><br />So be prepared to buy Alex White's superb book or you will probably miss out on how and why and when to use the zillions of its fieatures!","Just want to put up some observations and samples from my Sony DSC RX10 III.<br />First off, I was really put off that a standalone battery charger and a decent manual isn’t included. I rented a Panasonic FZ1000 for two weeks while I was vacationing, so I had a lot of experience with it. I mention this just to quantify any remarks that I make relating to the two cameras.<br /> You can see a gallery of pics that I shot with the RX10 III here.<br /> http://franksphotos.smugmug.com/Sony-DSC-RX10-III-sample<br /><br />All pictures are JPGs straight out of the camera. Additional duplicate pictures have file numbers that end with either a -1 and are processed from the RAW files with Adobe Camera RAW and the file numbers ending with a -2 are JPGs that I made simple adjustments to from the Photo App in Windows 10. They will still be accompanied by the original JPGs. Most everything was shot with Auto White balance and Auto ISO. Camera info is available with each photo. Download the whole gallery if you want. Sorry no RAW files as my subscription tier with Smugmug does not support RAW files. There has been no correction for vignetting so what you see is what it does. There is a shot of a backlit tree against a blue sky. Chromatic aberrations seem to be well controlled. When you look at the pictures of the car ferry that were processed in ACR, those are the right color. This is the Saint Clair River at Marine City, Michigan and the water is actually that color blue. That is why Michigan is called the Blue Water State. That was one of the things that I found with the RX10 III is that the color fidelity of the blues were off with AWB whereas I found the FZ1000 to be really close.<br /><br /> I own 3 Canon DSLRs so I have no partiality to either of the cameras.<br />My main interest in these bridge cameras is that I am tired of carrying all the equipment, but I shoot a lot of baseball and I hoped that the RX10 III with its reach would work and I could sell my 7D and 70-300 L. The RX10 III falls short on being a good action camera as it fails miserably in picking up focus on a fast moving object. If you are focused on a batter and follow him toward 1st base you will get some good shots, but if you are watching the game and pull up and shoot the action when the ball is hit forget it. The FZ1000 shines at catching focus instantly. Also you have to shoot continuously through the whole sequence to get your shot. Because once you stop, even if you only shot three frames, the buffer has to clear before you can even see through the viewfinder, and it takes almost as long to clear a short burst as it does a long one. Surprisingly shooting RAW didn’t take much longer to clear and shooting only med size JPGs wasn’t really faster to clear that large JPGs. Note: I am using a good 90 MB/sec SD card. Also you can’t zoom and shoot at the same time and if you try and zoom anticipating your next shot before the image on the screen clears, the zoom will activate the image view zoom functions and you will have to half press the shutter to clear the screen. One other thing to consider is that in the twilight ballgame I used it on the pictures from 1600 ISO on were in my opinion unusable and shutter speed is a necessity so don’t expect good results on cloudy days either if you need both high shutter speeds and at least f/5.6 to maintain some depth of field.<br /> Okay, this isn’t a bashing  session, I just want to make sure that those who are considering it as a serious sport shooting camera, don’t.<br /> It is well built. It is sharp at any zoom length. It does focus quickly and accurately on stationary or slow moving subjects and will keep that focus locked.<br /> The bokeh is quite good at F/5.6 at full telephoto and better at F/4, so those who like to shoot birds, bees and flowers should love it. I found that the pop up flash worked really well as a fill flash when photographing tree blossoms that were backlit by the sun, even at full telephoto, so the flash does clear the barrel even with the hood on.<br /> I am not a video expert so I will only state that what I shot with it was really good. I did attempt to capture some still frames from video thinking that that would be a good way to get action stills, but they were soft. They just didn’t appear to be sharply focused.<br /> In my opinion you want this camera if you need the 600mm reach, you need better dust and water protection, tougher construction,  and if you need to shoot serious video. I think the RX10 III may produce a slight improvement in dynamic range over the FZ1000 and I think it may handle the transitions in the highlight areas a tad better. I felt that its RAW files were more responsive in Photoshop than the Panasonic FZ1000s RAW files were and again this was when confronting highlight problems although this is not a glaring difference.<br /> Again, in my opinion, if 400mm is enough and you are not shooting pro video, the Panasonic FZ1000 produces accurate colors, has a blazing fast auto focus, has a smoother bokeh, and has the folding display which is not only versatile it can be folded in when you are shooting with the viewfinder so it doesn’t get oily from your face or get scratched when carrying it or throwing it in a bag. So again in my opinion if good pictures and good everyday video while still having 4K is all you need there is no reason to pay 1500 dollars when you can get what you need for 630 dollars and have a battery charger.","This is a superb camera the capabilities of which seem to be lost on people who would just judge it as a casual camera. Starting with video: The cameras shoots in UHD 4K video at 100 mbs. The files are sampled at 6K and down sampled to 4K making it very, very sharp. The files are not binned or line skipped; you get a full sensor read for every frame which means, again, sharpness and high image quality. The camera features cinematic profiles, including S-Log-2 and every one of the video profiles can be customized with a wide range of parameters which will be familiar to professional videographers (gamma, black level, knee, etc.). The camera also includes a microphone input and an audio circuit unhampered by AGC (automatic gain control) so you can actually set microphone levels to your taste or set a single point that's be calibrated in conjunction with an off camera mixer or digital audio recorder and then you can use physical control knobs on the mixer to even more effectively set levels.<br /><br />I have tested the video from the camera I bought (locally) and found it to be superb. I underexposed a little bit (my fault) and I could see some shadow noise start to creep in at ISO 800 but exposed correctly I would feel comfortable shooting up to 1600 for interviews and up to 3200 for images with lots of detail that might hide noise.<br /><br />Speaking of interviews, the camera also features a headphone jack which will help you get better sound by monitoring. Also included is professional caliber time code and the ability to \"mark\" your screens with \"safe zones\"  center marks and other guides to composition. In my mind this is a full on, professional video camera and one I will use in conjunction with the previous model to do work with for paying clients.<br /><br />Now, add to this a full 29.99 minute record time with no over heating and you have the makings of a perfect hybrid camera.<br /><br />But there's more. The lens is amazing and it delivers everything Sony promises. I have samples on my blog site which show amazing sharpness, handheld, at the 600mm equivalent. Some less well educated reviewers have said that the camera does not really have an f4.0 or f2.4 (at wide) aperture but, of course, they are dead wrong. What they are trying to say is that one does not get the same depth of field flexibility with smaller sensor cameras. That part is true but, rest assured, you are not getting a \"slower\" lens. f4.0 is f4.0 because it always describes a geometric relationship.<br /><br />Moving on. The still portion of the camera is on par with the still capabilities of its immediate predecessor; which is to say, Pretty darn good. While it is not a low light monster like a Nikon D750 it does very well with shooting situations that go all the way down to ISO 3200. Is there noise? Of course! But it's not obnoxious unless you underexpose.<br /><br />There is always negativity about the small Sony battery but I've gotten an hour and ten minutes from a freshly charged battery while shooting video (worst case scenario) and that's just a little shy of what I was getting from a Nikon D810 battery when shooting video with that camera.<br /><br />Do not buy this camera if you are imagining that it is small and light. It is not. The physics of the lens preclude that. But it feels good in my hands and the extra space on the grip and the overall surface of the camera is welcome.<br /><br />The still images, especially raws processed in Adobe Camera Raw software are great. At ISOs like 80 and 100 they are amazing. Rich color and great sharpness. This is a camera that WILL require reading the manual but it will repay your time with great photo and video files. If you are looking for a tiny and simple snapshooting camera you have definitely landed on the wrong page.<br /><br />The camera is a solid value and something I wanted the minute I read the first press releases about it. If you want to read more about my early experiences with the camera please look for my author's page here on Amazon under my user name. There is a feed from my blog and the entries from May 4th and 5th are the ones cogent to this camera.<br /><br />The images above are handheld and shot from exactly the same location. The first wide shot is the widest focal length while the second image is a shot at the longest end. The image quality delivered at the long end reaffirms the Zeiss reputation. It's a great overall system.","This is the best superzoom camera on the planet today. It has a fast 24-600mm F2.4-F4 eqiv lens that has a Super ED APO objective that shows zero Chromatic Aberration at all FL from 24-600mm. It has 50x clear zoom that is up to 1200mm eqiv that works very well. The 4K UHD videos look equal in quality to my Sony a6300 and FE 70-200mm F4 G lens. Photo taken with 50x clear zoom that is 1200mm eqiv.","So you see Sony has released this new camera.<br />24-600mm zoom (35mm equivalent) and think, OH, MY GOD. Then you look at the lens and see... 2.4-4?!?!?!<br />And your mind gets blown all over the kitchen. (This review will seem more negative than positive because it's the harsh truth)<br /><br />Then you receive your camera. Nice package. MISSING the battery, whatever, I'll deal with Sony later. I borrowed one from work.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I very much dislike that the camera itself is the charger. (I'm used to my Nikon and Canons with external chargers)<br />Then I try the full manual modes. It's cute that the camera has clicking on the F/stop ring, but it's also fake, Then the truth starts to set in, all of the settings are a bit fake... The \"zoom\" ring is a digital ring, the focus ring is a complete lie. The camera gets you within the focusing distance, and then you can kind of control what happens next. I will say that it's nice that when you look through the viewfinder it zooms more for ultra fine focusing, but it just doesn't let you focus that well. It REALLY tries to keep it focused on what IT thinks should be in focus. Very irritating. They also say that at 600mm it will focus at .97M or whatever. It might, when it feels like it, it usually passes focus, a few times then remains out of focus, then again, you try to manual focus, but again, that's a lie...<br /><br />The image stabilization is very good, better than expected to be honest, that's about all I can say about it.<br /><br />There is a cute feature that turns the screen off when you put your face to the viewfinder. Unfortunately I find that to be a bit too sensitive. The RX10 has a screen that moves, so when I try to use the camera like my Hasselblads, the screen turns off, not the worst, because when I want to take waist level shots I take them blind anyways.<br /><br />Going back to the lies about the specs... F/2.4-4, Definitely a lie, more like F/4-11 throughout the range in 35mm equivalent. Which when you look at it, all of a sudden makes the specs of the camera, not so great. 25x zoom is a hell of a thing, but camcorders have had that for years... Point and shoots have had decent magnification too throughout the years.<br /><br />If you're used to a full size SLR (Canon 5D, etc) this camera will be small to you, when using it, my pinky is floating and I find it a bit uncomfortable, I hope Sony makes a base grip for the camera. Also, if you're used to Canon/Nikon menus, Sony's will take a lot of getting used to. A lot of the items I'm finding unnecessary.<br /><br />That said, good all around camera if you're maybe not the professional you think you are. And with the specs, 14FPS 960FPS at 4K video, you'll be all the rage in your group of friends, for me... It's just a cool toy."]},{"name":"Fujifilm X70","amazon_reviews":["I enjoy shooting with this small solidly built camera and the quality of the jpegs is just great. What really sold me on this camera as opposed to all of the competitors is the film simulations and the articulating screen. The colors in the Velvia and Classic Chrome simulations are beautiful. I carry this with me all the time and have gotten some shots that have really impressed me. A lot of fun to shoot with and I highly recommend it.","If you like manual controls, Fuji colors, and a wide angle fixed lens, then this camera is for you. Lens is sharp, and camera is small enough to carry everywhere. Camera is not perfect. One of the issues I have is button layout on camera is not so great. Buttons are also very small. All in all a great little camera that might make you forget about your big bulky DSLR.","Camera has been discontinued by Fuji with really no explanation.","this is a great camera, the pictures are ultra sharp and the colors are perfect!  Great retro look and feel in the hands","I've tried a handful of different compact cameras before trying out the x70 and honestly, I feel like I've finally found the perfect little compact camera. I recently went on a trip to London with this thing was legit my buddy the entire trip. First of all, I just can't be bothered when it comes to traveling. Unless it's for work, I really don't want to spend my time lugging around a big camera. I had my Samsung NX1 on me for when I wanted a particular photograph or went to an event, but for the majority of the time I was just walking around Central London with my little X70 and it was fantastic! I'll highlight a few key things that make me love this camera so much.<br /><br />- Low light is actually quite good! I attached some examples to show you the quality of night photographs.<br />- I love the selfie / swivel screen, which is great if you're traveling alone and don't feel like asking people to take a photograph for you every 5 mins.<br />- It's super light and super compact and guaranteed you'll ALWAYS have it in your bag. Honestly, no other compact camera has been light enough for me to want to put it in my pocket or in my bag as I walk for hours around the city. This camera was in my pocket most of the time and I didn't think twice about its weight.<br />- The fixed length (28mm) is perfect for landscape shots and city shots in general. I think this is particularly why I feel this makes a great travel camera. Most people like to take photographs of monuments, buildings, landscapes when traveling to a different country, and this focal length makes it ideal.<br />- Although 2.8 isn't the most impressive aperture, it's still quite a bright lens. Honestly, even my close up shots of food and objects came out quite crisp with a decent depth of field. So maybe macro shots aren't the most impressive, but I think it still does decent macro / close up shots considering.<br />- Look. Let's be real, this thing LOOKS awesome/cute/cool. I got the Silver/Black edition because it has that vintage camera look and people will always ask you what camera you're using. Always.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed taking this little guy with me everywhere. London isn't the first place I've taken this camera. I've taken this camera with me everywhere, even taking shots for my work at a convention. And the image quality is good enough that it can be a fantastic main camera.<br /><br />The only con for me is video quality. I never expected to use this camera as a recording device anyway, but the video quality isn't all that great. It's not the worst, it's just sub par compared to the stills.","This is a fantastic camera for travel and I have absolutely no complaints. I bought it to tour Europe for a month, so I needed something small that would fit into my khackis. This worked extremely well and produced beautiful, stunning photos with ease.<br /><br />I wanted my precious memories of once-in-a-lifetime landmarks to be high quality. When you are standing in front of Big Ben, you don't want a crummy little smartphone that will take grainy images.

It's painful.<br /><br />I see people make photo books with the same quality cameras, and that is even more painful.<br /><br />I needed the smallest, most quality camera that I could get and this was it.

It's an APS-C sensor which takes extremely high quality images. I feel that people overlook the sensor size of cameras, and get obsessed with silly features like zoom lenses.<br /><br />I LOVE the fact that the camera has no zoom. Yes, it has NO ZOOM. A zoom lens is a senseless feature in point and shoot cameras. We have, as consumers, been sold on this little bell & whistle as if it is essential. The camera lens is 18.5mm, or 27mm equivalent. This means that it will capture about the same size as your iPhone will. You do not need a zoom. This camera is not for bird watching!<br /><br />You can simply crop the images down to size later.

When you need to get a picture of yourself in front of something, it becomes invaluable. Couple it with a selfie-stick and you may never have to ask somebody to take your picture again. They usually frame it poorly, anyway.<br /><br />If you are traveling, buy this camera. You'll be really happy when you get home and have beautiful images. You can set the thing to Auto and shoot, but if you know the basics of photography like F-stop, shutter speed, and ISO, this camera will give you incredible and easy flexibility.","A great, pocketable, take me everywhere camera. If you enjoy the effective 28mm focal length like I do, it's a jewel. As good if not better than the underrated XF18. I've read a lot of comparisons to the Ricoh GR/GRII and it's a toss up as far as reviews are concerned. The one thing that kept me from the Ricoh were the many many complaints of sensor dust; that was a killer for me. No dust issues with the Fuji.","I enjoy shooting with this small solidly built camera and the quality of the jpegs is just great. What really sold me on this camera as opposed to all of the competitors is the film simulations and the articulating screen. The colors in the Velvia and Classic Chrome simulations are beautiful. I carry this with me all the time and have gotten some shots that have really impressed me. A lot of fun to shoot with and I highly recommend it.","If you like manual controls, Fuji colors, and a wide angle fixed lens, then this camera is for you. Lens is sharp, and camera is small enough to carry everywhere. Camera is not perfect. One of the issues I have is button layout on camera is not so great. Buttons are also very small. All in all a great little camera that might make you forget about your big bulky DSLR.","Camera has been discontinued by Fuji with really no explanation.","this is a great camera, the pictures are ultra sharp and the colors are perfect!  Great retro look and feel in the hands","I've tried a handful of different compact cameras before trying out the x70 and honestly, I feel like I've finally found the perfect little compact camera. I recently went on a trip to London with this thing was legit my buddy the entire trip. First of all, I just can't be bothered when it comes to traveling. Unless it's for work, I really don't want to spend my time lugging around a big camera. I had my Samsung NX1 on me for when I wanted a particular photograph or went to an event, but for the majority of the time I was just walking around Central London with my little X70 and it was fantastic! I'll highlight a few key things that make me love this camera so much.<br /><br />- Low light is actually quite good! I attached some examples to show you the quality of night photographs.<br />- I love the selfie / swivel screen, which is great if you're traveling alone and don't feel like asking people to take a photograph for you every 5 mins.<br />- It's super light and super compact and guaranteed you'll ALWAYS have it in your bag. Honestly, no other compact camera has been light enough for me to want to put it in my pocket or in my bag as I walk for hours around the city. This camera was in my pocket most of the time and I didn't think twice about its weight.<br />- The fixed length (28mm) is perfect for landscape shots and city shots in general. I think this is particularly why I feel this makes a great travel camera. Most people like to take photographs of monuments, buildings, landscapes when traveling to a different country, and this focal length makes it ideal.<br />- Although 2.8 isn't the most impressive aperture, it's still quite a bright lens. Honestly, even my close up shots of food and objects came out quite crisp with a decent depth of field. So maybe macro shots aren't the most impressive, but I think it still does decent macro / close up shots considering.<br />- Look. Let's be real, this thing LOOKS awesome/cute/cool. I got the Silver/Black edition because it has that vintage camera look and people will always ask you what camera you're using. Always.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed taking this little guy with me everywhere. London isn't the first place I've taken this camera.

I satisfied abot this X70.","Great camera, a tad larger than the GRII but still fits the pocket. Pictures have terrific  tone and color, easy to learn.","A great travel and street camera.  My Nikon SLR was being serviced, so I brought this on a trip.  Loved the Fuji and didn't miss the Nikon. Fuji needs to make a few improvements (better AF, auto detecting wide angle lens,better battery life, etc), but no major issues.  In bright sun, lcd can occasionally be difficult to use -- this didn't cause any major problems.  I don't use the video feature.","The camera is new, but no lens cap and protectice cover.","I loved this camara so much! It is a great camera","My everyday pocket camera. Grabs great photos, and I actually don't mind carrying it. Low light capabilities are great.","Great Camera but way too expensive for the what you get. THERE IS NO ZOOM ON THIS CAMERA!!! PLEASE BE AWARE!!! Photos were great but unfortunately you would need another camera for zoom photos.","As a longtime user of the Ricoh GR, I bought an X70 to do a side-by-side test. My plan: to figure out which one to keep, and which to sell. I'd always wanted a Fuji camera, and I absolutely adore this genre of enthusiast point-and-shoots. Ultimately, my affinity for the GR won out, but there's no doubt that the X70 is a spectacular camera.<br /><br />WHY I LIKE THE GR BETTER:<br /><br />1. I like the GR's JPEGs and even its \"film simulations\" better.<br /><br />When I was primarily shooting my Pentax and Nikon DSLRs, I always shot RAW. Always. But the GR changed that for me. I fell in love with the Positive Film JPEG preset and I've shot pretty much exclusively with it (with occasional detours to High-Contrast B&W) since. The X-Pro1 is the only Fuji I've used extensively before this (I wrote the review for Adam's other site, camera-enthusiast.com), and I liked its film simulations well enough back then. But I've played with the X70's simulations pretty extensively and I don't like any of them as well as Positive Film (not even Classic Chrome!). Then there's the actual quality of the JPEGs. I guess I just don't like the X-Trans look, but the JPEGs out of this camera look a little muddy to me at 100% and just generally aren't as crisp as my GR shots. There's also a surprising amount of NR at relatively low ISOs. I'm sure that can be tweaked, but I've never been one to do that. The GR just works for me out of the box and that's what I want. Obviously, this is very personal.<br /><br />2. I like the GR's controls better.<br /><br />It may be that I've just been shooting the GR for too long, but the X70's manual controls (while undeniably cool) just tend to get in the way for me. They're also not laid out as well. The left button on the d-pad, for instance, is right up against the edge of the tilt screen, which makes it really hard to hit. The playback and trash buttons are way too small and finnicky. The X70's touchscreen is nice for tap-to-focus, but I'm a center point/focus and recompose guy 95% of the time, so I don't get much use out of it.<br /><br />3. The X70 feels too nice.<br /><br />This is probably dumb, but I handle the X70 really carefully because it's so beautifully made that I'm afraid of damaging it/scratching the paint/etc. I hate the lens cap—never thought I'd say that, but I love that I don't have to worry about stashing one when I use the GR. The GR (strangely) feels more rugged and reliable, like I can just throw it in my bag and not worry.<br /><br />4. I really love the GR's horizon level.<br /><br />Again, minor and maybe dumb, but I love the fact that the GR's level does both roll and pitch. The X70's, in contrast, only does roll.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE X70:<br /><br />1. The screen. I think the GR actually has the better display, but the articulation of the X70's screen is a real godsend for off-angle shots.<br /><br />2. It's beautiful. Going back to #3 on the dislikes, this thing is gorgeous.<br /><br />3. Like the GR, it's very customizable. You can customize a total of 8 function buttons, plus the control ring around front. Pretty impressive.<br /><br />4. The AF is indeed faster. This isn't a huge deal for me (see above comments about being a center point/recompose shooter), but there's no denying that the X70 has an edge here.<br /><br />5. The electronic shutter is a big plus. The GR's built-in ND filter more or less does the same thing w/r/t wide-aperture bright light shooting, but being able to shoot completely silently is pretty awesome.","YES. I have a Canon DSLR and a small collection of lenses I adore, however I still found myself reaching for my iPhone to capture many important images. Let me note that I am not a professional photographer, I'm an advanced hobbits who loves taking pictures of the people I love and the places I go as I way to remember. I am addicted to image quality and love to share and print my images. I love my Canon, but I noticed there were times I did not reach for it or bring it along because of its size. The Fuji x70 is the best of both worlds. I carry this camera with me everywhere. It's small enough to fit in a clutch to bring to weddings or pack for a hike and light enough to wear around my neck all day without weighing me down. So many of the reviews talk about a lack of viewfinder being a major drawback, I don't miss it. If you can take pictures with an iPhone you can use this camera, I don't miss or need a viewfinder on this camera. I love that I just can touch the screen to focus and take the picture. Be careful to turn off the screen though so you don't snap away by mistake, its easy to do both :) This camera is FUN and easy to use. The dials and controls are perfection. The wifi feature works well and makes image transfers to your phone quick and painless.<br /><br />Lastly, (and most importantly) the image quality is AMAZING. I am having such conflicting thoughts about my beloved Canon set-up. Prior to purchasing this camera I was planning on moving to a full frame Canon system, this camera stopped me in my tracks. One month with my new Fuji and I haven't reached for my Canon once. Worth noting that this camera has a prime lens, if you are unfamiliar it might take some getting use to. I found that I can crop the images after I take them to \"zoom\" without sacrificing image quality if I'm not able to \"zoom with my feet\" when taking the picture.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you want a fun, beautiful constructed, easy to use camera that you can bring with you everywhere, buy this camera. If you want a camera that makes sharing images a breeze and is a major step up from an iPhone, buy this camera. If you are interesting in seeing what all the fuss over Fuji is all about, buy this camera.","I'll try to sum up some of the key points of this camera, the X70.  For the short version, I'm just sending it back.  The ergonomics are odd, the feels seem cheap, and the AF indoors is awful.<br /><br />IQ: That little lens does quite a job resolving details.  It is probably the star of all of this.  And the camera is small, very small.  So, you get a nice large sensor, and great lens.  Noise is always an issue as fuji refuses to up their sensor size (they would never sell another Xt1 I'm pretty sure), and the sensor in this is quite old now.  You have to go all the way up to an Xpro2 to get a better sensor from Fuji, and that's about 3 times what this camera cost, body only.<br /><br />Ergonomics:  It's small, very small.  Small enough in fact that some of the button placements are just terrible.  Now, hear me out, I don't have gigantic hands.  I would say average. Yet, the left button on the \"d-pad\" on the back is almost unusuable.  It is crammed in SO CLOSE to the pop-up screen that you actually can't get to it.  You can pop the screen out, and it's better but then I have to pop that silly screen out EVERY TIME I have to access something.  Some argue \"well, it has a touch screen, use that\".  NO, you have a touchscreen for select focusing.  You don't have it for menus.  So, when you're running and running, be ready to be jamming your finger into a pea-size space to access a fairly important button.<br /><br />The playback button is on the screen.  I'm surprised no one has mentioned this.  Every other camera on this planet puts it at the right side somewhere, so you can access it with your right hand after you've taken the photo.  Nope, this one is on the screen.  So you flip the screen out, and want to review your photo? You have to use one hand, brace the screen, and press it.<br /><br />On a plus side, the thumb and front grip combo is nice, and I have no problem one handing this thing.  These may seem nit-picky, but believe me after hours of dragging this thing around you'll start twitching when you know you have to scroll left through a menu.<br /><br />Performance:  I usually don't bother with this category, but as this is a newer camera I think I should mention it.  It's fine, never had an issue with scrolling through menus.  The back screen lags really bad in low light, I don't know if that's a firmware thing or what.<br /><br />Which brings me to----<br />Auto Focus:  This thing just can't focus.  Even standing still, saying \"cheese\" I had a difficult time locking on to my kids, and even then it seemed fuzzy.  It wasn't due to using F2.8, or too slow of a shutter speed.  It just, focused wrong.  When shooting objects, I THINK I've locked on to what I want, and then review the photo and it has taken something literally right next to it and lost what I wanted.  It seems fast, but missing so many shots just isn't forgivable on a newer point and shoot style camera...<br /><br />Conclusion:  I can see where this is going towards.  Those who love the X line, or are just diehard about FUJI color sims (I personally wasn't as impressed as what some rave about, just shoot RAW and spend 2 min processing, BAM you have FUJI provia, BW, or any other they have).  It doesn't feel like an old school rangefinder, the screen just knocks the shooter out of the \"experience\".  The buttons are wonky, and placed in ways that inhibit usage, which is just unforgivable.  And remember, at the time of this writing, this is a 700$ camera!  You can buy a T6I with lens for less, you can buy an Rx100Miii, you can ALMOST buy an A7 body (don't).  It's bigger brother, the X100T is only 100 more. So, you have so many options (let alone the A6300, which is currently 1000 body only, but MUCH MUCH better specs wise).  I think, in the end I just expected more.  It fills a small niche, and I think FUJI knows this.  They just don't care.  They appeal to their diehard customers, and don't worry whether someone who has owned everything else under the planet likes their choices.","This camera is not really on par with other Fuji X cameras. Although it has the same sensor as the X100T and XT1 the image quality does not seem as good. The accuracy of autofocus seems to be hit or miss. Maybe I had a bad copy.","This camera met all my expectations - very sharp pictures and color resolution - this is a very small camera - I have a X-Pro-1, XT-1 and X100T - I was looking for a smaller travel street camera and stayed with Fuji family of products for their high quality and reliability. The manual focus ring is a challenge which is small and buffered right next to the F-stop ring - my only real complaint - most manual functions work well and the auto switch comes in handy when I want to go the auto mode fast.","After a decade of loving photography and then getting frustrated by storing and archiving all my digital photos, I gave up and started taking pictures with my iPhone. It's been the pinnacle of convenience. But I wanted something more. I wanted the art back. I wanted a beautiful, sharp image even in challenging situations. I wanted more control over my images. I craved the luster of a shallow depth of field.<br />This camera satisfies nearly everything I was looking for. It's plenty fast, plenty elegant, has all the controls I want, feels solid in the hand, has the best film simulation filters available, and plenty of battery life, and takes photos on par with just about any SLR even in low light. It's a rock star camera.<br />Unfortunately it's the part after taking pictures that still bums me out. While Sony and Canon in particular, and for this particular review Ricoh, have made great strides in wireless connectivity for easy photo export (including live updating in some cases) Fujifilm's firmware and software feel a generation behind.<br />That's almost to be expected on a camera with so much retro styling and so many manual features. And those features are really well curated. But man was it a bummer the first time I tried to set up auto downloading on my Mac. It's terrible.<br />If above all else you want an amazing small camera that's super travel ready as your go-to capture companion, and you like the constraints and benefits of a fixed lens, this is for you. If you hate dealing with SD cards and want a more modern experience you might want to consider the Ricoh or a Sony.","I am very happy with this camera.  That being said, I knew what to expect.  If you do not have experience limiting yourself to one fixed focal length lens, or are not familiar with the 28mm equivalent focal length, this camera might make you miserable.  On the other hand, if you get wicked excited about the thought of a fixed wide prime lens on a large sensor compact, then look no further.  The 28mm equivalent focal length is very versatile.  If you are concerned about not having a viewfinder, throw any 28mm OVF on there.  I use an old 28mm Voigtlander OVF, and it is a lot of fun. I wish I could turn off the LCD though.  Maybe this will be addressed in firmware. The close minimum focus distance of the lens and wide aperture of f2.8 allows for adequate and pleasant separation of subject and background.  The facial recognition works well.  Don't be fooled, this camera will not produce traditional portraits.  I however like environmental portraits, and putting unique perspectives on my portraits.  Get close in for dramatic portraits, but know that there will be some distortion.  The distortion however is not that bad really.  Lines appear pretty straight considering.  The touch screen with tilt makes operations a breeze.  I choose to use the touch for selecting focus area.  The film simulations have changed my shooting habits.  I formerly shot only in RAW and spent a lot of time in Lightroom.  Now I am loving just shooting JPEG/RAW and using the in camera processing to make any necessary tweaks before sending the Jpeg to my phone via the built in wifi.  Honestly, I love the film simulations.  Going back to use other camera systems the results look very digital or synthetic by comparison.  I have had some issues with the camera though.  The camera one day just would not turn on until i pulled the battery out for a while, and then put it back in.  I missed a lot of great shots because of this.  No issues with that since though.  Also, I get fairly frequent card reader errors (maybe once a week.) This can be fixed just by cycling power and taking a shot. Now, if this were any other camera company, i would be worried about this.  However, this is Fuji.  If you follow camera news at all, you know Fuji releases an insane amount of firmware updates for their cameras.  These are also based a lot off of user experience.  They actual listen to what people say on forums.  I am confident if these issues persist, they will be addressed via firmware updates.  The manual controls are the real draw to Fuji.  I shoot a lot of film, both 35mm and 120.  I like being able to see my settings on knobs and dials.  Fuji really delivers here, and using the control dials is a nice experience.  You can even adjust the front lens dial (focus) to select ISO, FIlm Simulation, whatever.  Nice touch.  If you are an experienced shooter that wants a fun, stealthy, capable, take anywhere camera that spawns your creativity and delivers pleasing files with beautiful tones, go for it!","If your a full Auto mode shooter this may be overkill but if you like having more control at your fingertips with a light and nimble camera, you would surely enjoy the X70. I've owned the X10 for four years so I was familiar with the quality construction of Fujifilm cameras. My three favorite features: 1.Controls at my fingertips 2.The tilt screen. It's more useful than I expected. 3.wifi. I can send photo to my phone or tablet easily. My X10 has an optical viewfinder but I rarely used it so the lack of one on the X70 was not an issue for me. The tilt screen has been very useful. The X70 is worth a look if you're considering a high end compact and you like the hardware interface if dials for the most commonly used settings.","This is my first Fuji and I'm loving it! Was contemplating between this and the X100T, but finally decided on this due to the pocketability. Easily fits in my pants/jacket pocket (slight bulge, but only because I added some lens accessories). Indeed, \"the best camera is the one you have with you\". Coming from a DSLR shooter, I bring the X70 on all my trips now. Especially with an infant, really don't prefer lugging a 2lb camera around.<br /><br />The APS-C sensor does not disappoint. Usable images up to ISO6400 with minimal noise. This has been hailed as a great street shooter, but I find myself using it a lot for landscape as well, especially with the 28mm equivalent range. In love with how solid and well built the camera is, as well as manual controls available right at your fingertips. 8 customizable buttons really allows you to set it to fit whatever your shooting style is. The Classic Chrome simulation is glorious, I think I shoot almost 90% of it in that now. Lens is tack sharp even at wide open. I use Lightroom6 and it renders the RAW images really well, did not notice any smudging or \"waxy skin\" problems reported in some of the previous Lightroom versions rendering XTrans files. Then again, I'm not really a pixel-peeper. The touchscreen really helps with setting quick focus points, especially if you are the type that likes to focus subjects off-center. I thought I might miss the viewfinder of my DLSR, but the touchscreen really allows me to shoot at creative angles (e.g. getting really low to get puddle reflection shots). The Auto ISO feature is also one that I really enjoy using, just set your Aperture/Shutter Speed, set the min/max ISO that you can tolerate and let the camera figure out the rest. That way I spend more time shooting and less time fiddling with controls.<br /><br />If I had to nitpick, I would probably have preferred a f2.0 lens to get more subject isolation, but that would have probably put it and a higher price range and larger form factor. Also wished Fuji would have created a tele adapter for it to put it at 35mm/50mm equivalent for some portrait work (similar to what they had for the X100T/S). Focus is accurate most of the time, but could be a little faster.<br /><br />Overall, a top notch premium compact that has replaced the DSLR for most of my use cases. Stunning image quality and great dynamic range. Really nice JPEG SOOC if you don't like to process RAW. Great work Fuji!","Right off the bat once I received my Fuji X70 i had managed to drop the camara onto the kitchen counter top so not looking to do this again I went and purchased this metal lens hood ring here: http://amzn.to/25IMAwD which can take most of the force in the event you get butterfingers.<br /><br />The camara itself is a great shooter with lots of elements adding towards getting a great shot. I live near a beach so it's actually fun sitting down and playing around with the exposure control and adjusting the shutter speed to get the light bouncing off the water just right. A good camara if you like some to tinker around with not to mention the great display that pops out.","Meets all my expectations and more.  Have been searching for a small camera that I can carry with me conveniently and yet matches the image quality of my high end Nikon DSLR.  Found it!  Easy to carry it in a belt case just like I do my cell phone.  Low light performance is amazing.  Focusing is quick and accurate.  No complaints.","Got this after both our Nikon point and shoots bit the dust at the same time (coincidence or conspiracy? not sure). This baby is amazing. We've taken it through central and south america and it's now my go to for travel. The multitude of settings and functions that compare to a traditional SLR or DSLR are legit. The fold out screen is cheesy but useful. The touch screen is very easy to use and responsive. The resulting photos are amazing. Only downside to this camera is that there is currently not a good leather case for it. Also, when adding a clear filter to protect the lens, the cover that came with this camera no longer fits. So I'm forced to choose from using the hard cover and then no clear filter, or the clear filter and no hard cover.","I’ve had the X70 for a month now, and I’ve been using it every day for my Instagram food pix. I had my concerns when researching this camera, especially about the build and focusing ability. But, really, those quickly became unfounded concerns once I took this camera for a test drive.<br /><br />Build: This is one solid, hefty camera. No loose buttons or plasticky anything anywhere. I have smaller Asian hands, so it fits my palms very well. Those with larger hands might want to consider an even more burly camera. However, this camera is so compact and unobtrusive that it would be a shame to go bigger and bulkier.<br /><br />Lens/Focusing: Sharp as a tack. Sometimes I look at my photos and see details I never even noticed before! The autofocus is fast and relatively quiet (yes, there’s some noise, but it’s not like grandpa grinding his teeth!). It takes an adjustment (to the focus zone and sharpness) to make sure the camera focuses on where you want it to focus on. But other than that, it’s just set and go. And I've been getting tons of compliments on how sharp my photos are now (even when posted/downgraded on Instagram), compared to the iPhone 6 camera that I've been using.<br /><br />Color: I rarely have to adjust saturation or color anymore. This camera gets it right all the time. Especially the more subtle hues, like the soft pink in yellowtail sushi. I haven't even started using the film filters yet!<br /><br />Flash: The onboard flash is amazing. It fills in the shadows just so, under the Forced Flash setting. It’s so natural that you can’t even tell a flash was used.<br /><br />Wifi Output to iPhone: I almost never upload my pix directly to my computer, only to my iPhone. Get the phone app first before you do anything else! Basically, you (1) hit the Fn/Wi-Fi button on the camera, (2) select your camera in your list of available Wifi Networks on your phone and then (3) open the Fujifilm app (FUJIFILM Camera Remote from the App Store). Then (4) hit the Receive option on the app and (5) hit OK on the camera for every photo you want to download to your phone. The process is fast and the photos are downloaded within 1-2 seconds of you hitting the OK button. The camera gives you the option of selecting the downloaded file size, which I have at 3MB for the iPhone. No need for anything larger for Instagram.<br /><br />My only gripe: The battery. It does drain on a schedule of its own. And it jumps from 3/4 to 1/4 full while skipping the middle part! (You can still get a few good shots in when on 1/4 battery.) Make sure you buy an extra battery and external charger. The onboard charger takes 3 hours to charge a battery!<br /><br />Hope this review helps you in your decision-making. It's my first Fujifilm camera, and I'm so in love with it! I've pretty much stopped using my iPhone camera.<br /><br />P.S. I found that I haven't needed a lens filter or a hood. The glass area of the lens is sunken in a little and no wider than a dime, so there's little risk of damaging the lens from regular use. And the lens cap pretty much does the trick to keep the camera lens from getting scratched up in your purse.","One of the best compacts i have ever owned. Super fast AF speed, second to Sony's. I prefer this one over Ricoh GR due to its AF speed and photos per minute.","I have had this camera for about two months and have been using it extensively with great results. At the same time, I am rating it for what it is. It is a surprisingly compact, solidly built camera that is easy to carry and which gives you the same spectacular aps-c image quality you would get with one of Fuji's larger ILC's (excluding the new 24mp x-pro2). It is not an ILC, however, and has the limitations of any fixed focal length camera. It does not have a viewfinder, and if you absolutely have to put your eye up to the back of your camera, give this one a miss. However, if you can live without a viewfinder and have used Fuji cameras in the past, you will learn this one in about 30 seconds. There are some touch-screen functions, which come in handy, and the screen tilts, which allows you take photos discretely from waist level. This makes up for the lack of a viewfinder as far as I am concerned. The fixed lens is a 28mm equivalent f2.8, rather than the 35mm equivalent f2.0 of the X100T. However, you can use an electronic cropping mechanism to take photos at 35mm and 50mm equivalent focal lengths at full resolution. This obviates the need for a teleconverter such as you can buy for the X100T, and does not, as far as I can see -- and I have looked pretty closely -- degrade the image quality. There are other choices out there, of course, but if, like me, you appreciate the way Fuji cameras handle, and the look of the photos they produce, you should take a look at this one. I couldn't be happier with mine.","Image quality. Image quality. Image quality. Not a lot left to say, really. But I will… This is a gem. But you have to be someone to knows how to enjoy a fixed 28mm lens. The touch/tilt screen has changed the way I take photos. It reminds me of how unobtrusive you can be with old twin lens reflex cameras at waist level. If you turn off all the sounds, you can be so discreet, it's amazing. It just looks like you're scrolling through some old pics. Beautiful to look at, too. A real quality item. Highly recommended!","Buy a memory card, buy a memory card, buy a memory card!","Great travel camera. Really shines when you start using raw. 16MP is perfect for low light! I would have been happy for 12 or 10 megapixels but obviously I'm obsessed with low-light handheld shooting so I know that would never happen. I also own an A6000 and Nikon D750, all with expensive prime glass and the X70 doesn't make me miss either when on the road (well, maybe I miss my Sigma 50mm 1.4 a little). Video is good if used on a tripod or stabilizing system. Quick hint, set your NR to -2 and sharpening to +1 for some really crispy JPEGs. I think the noise reduction is a little too aggressive and it actually made me think I received a defective lens when I first started shooting. But now that I have that dialed in I'm actually using JPEGs about 50% of the time which is very unusual for me (I still resize to 2048px for Facebook to avoid further compression) .<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />-Control layout: after shooting extensively with an A6000 it's SO nice to stay out of the software for making most adjustments. Some really ingenious little touches like the control wheel also being a button used to zoom to 100% quickly when in manual mode or reviewing shots, Q button, and dedicated S/C/M focus mode wheel. I'm still learning to make use of all the physical controls. Oh and I have to mention the Auto mode switch. It's genius. No matter what crazy settings you have it on for a specific shot, you just switch that sucker over when an unexpected picture opportunity comes along or to let a friend shoot and it will negate all manual settings and film simulation modes. HOWEVER, you lose raw functionality and well... your film simulation so it's a double edged sword. Definitely handy for travel photography and parties. Just wish it retained RAW+JPEG mode.<br />-Touchscreen: I love the pinch zoom when reviewing and touch for setting focus.<br />-Build quality/ergos: Feels great and sturdy in my medium sized hands. I already dropped it from one meter in a shopping mall and no damage.<br />-Size: Size to picture quality ratio is one of the best I've ever seen. Jacket or cargo pants pocket friendly. Low profile lens design means it doesn't tilt forward on the neck strap.<br />-Lens/Sensor combo: Lens is a nice compromise between FOV and ability to produce nice bokeh. Very crop-able. So glad that the MP count is relatively low for a consumer camera. There are so many great new cameras that are crippled in low-light because of an unneeded high MP count (looking at you rx100/A6000). I have to admit, I REALLY wish the lens was F/2 wide open but I understand that would have made the lens and camera a little bigger.<br /><br />Final thoughts: You're last camera?? No. Will you love it? Maybe. I can highly recommend it as a travel camera for people who like to shoot with manual settings and RAW. Also, if you've never owned a nice prime lens you'll be pleasantly surprised at the sharpness you'll get from this. If I didn't already own a Nikon D750 I'd be considering one of interchangeable lens Fuji's for my main kit.","The image quality of this little thing is amazing. I hardly take my DSLR's out anymore. I had my eye on the GRII and the LX100; but I really wanted the film simulations Fuji are known for. I don't want to process RAW for every shot I take, the JPG engine on this thing is the best I've ever used/seen. I shoot RAW on this thing maybe 2% of the time (vs.100% of the time with my DSLR's).","So far, so good. Really like this camera! The lens width (18.5mm) equals about what I see on my iPhone. The large sensor (APS-C) renders really sharp and detailed results. The many manual options, filters & effects make for a creative effort. Overall, a GREAT point and shoot. I'm enjoying it more than my old RX100! The retro look is cool too!","I like it, but the menu stinks. I've had to reset it three times so far. Image quality is great for what it is.","Focusing is an issue, I really haven't used it enough.  Still reading the manuel.","I really wanted to like this camera, but I just wasn't overly thrilled by it.  First the Pros:  Excellent image quality, as is expected from the X-series.  I used a popular website to compare the IQ extensively against other cameras in this category and the X70 came out ahead every time.  In person it did not let me down in this regard.  The camera's manual controls were very intuitive, and are much preferred over cycling through menus as you can be forced to do with other cameras.  There's also no denying that the styling of this camera is beautiful.<br /><br />Now the Cons: For a $700 camera, the build quality just didn't seem on point even though many others have said they like it.  This camera is made in China, while the X100 series is made in Japan, and the materials used on the X70 just don't quite measure up.  I realize the X70 is cheaper but you can spend maybe $150-200 more for an open box X100T at this point so it's not like there's that big a gap.  Another con to this camera was that I found its size to be a bit awkward.  It's admittedly quite small, but by no means will it fit in your pocket unless you wear big baggy cargo pants.  Yet at the same time, it is small enough where if you have hands of any real size the controls will be a bit difficult and overly precise to manage.  So in essence you are getting a bit of difficulty in control without the payoff of it actually being pocketable.  Again, if it isn't going to fit in your pocket, and you're going to have it around your neck/on your hip/in a bag, you might as well just get an X100T.  Finally, after using the hybrid viewfinder on the X100T i can honestly say it's worth every bit of the extra money.  Even at its brightest setting, using the X70's screen as the only means of previewing your photo is less than ideal in bright sunlight, and manual focus just isn't as easy as it is with the blow-up you get inside the T's viewfinder.<br /><br />I realize this camera wasn't built to compete with the X100T, but with a used X100T being so close in price to this, I can't help but think that a lot of people interested in buying a Fuji camera would be better served by just buying one of those instead.","The image quality is amazing and so easy to use.  Best of all its small and discreet, ideal for street shooting. I've had an XE-1 previously and really never took to Fuji. I'm glad that I gave it one more chance.","I love Fuji Cameras. I have just about all of them. This is a nice camera. I only give it 3 stars because the lens is essentially a landscape lens. When used for the street, you need to want the \"whole\" street. When used for portraits, you introduce significant distortion. Aside from its convenient pancake nature, I find it very limiting. I have a favorite Fuji. The X30. I have gone back to it. The Lens is perfect and the camera although 12 mp is sharp as a tack. I will not return the X70 but I will never favor it. I had hoped to see an X40 with an upgraded sensor but that did not happen. All in all, the Sony Rx100 series has a better lens then the X70 and a better sensor and the M3 has a VF. For the price difference this X70 was an unfortunate choice by Fuji and by me.","This camera is built for street photography. It's so small that I can carry it everywhere. The quality is simply amazing!","Great Camera...perfect for me...large camera IQ in an incredibly small package.","I am a Nikon DSLR shooter ( D90, D7200 and P900 )but I heard a lot about Fujifilm X series and wanted to see what all the hoopla was about. I checked out the X100T but did not like the viewfinder so when the X70 was announced I pulled the trigger. First off the camera is small enough to fit in my pocket and it handles like a precision instrument. I have not shot in RAW yet because the JPEGS are just insane. Low light performance is awesome and after a little while the controls are very intuitive. Here are 2 unedited JPEG shots with the Classic Chrome film simulation. Highly recommended.","Since the release of the Fujifilm X70 there has been a lot of uncritical, gushing praise. It has been held up as an almost perfect travel camera, with its optical sharpness, its portability, and the versatility of its 28mm equivalent lens. I'm offering this review as a bit of a corrective to all that excess.<br />The X70 is a fine camera for still photos. The lens is every bit as sharp as its billing, and the film simulation that it offers is a very cool feature. That said, for reasons that aren't clear to me, the video mode of the camera is so lacking, it seems to have been almost an afterthought by Fuji. Here are some of the problems:<br /><br />1) During video, the camera simply makes too much noise! Right off the bat while shooting video, I could hear the camera making odd clicks and pops that would become part of the soundtrack. At first, I thought I had bought a defective model, but after googling the issue, it seems to be a characteristic of the Fuji X series in general. Even the manual warns that during video the mic may pick up noise from the camera: \"The microphone may pick up lens noise and other sounds made by the camera during recording.\" (p36) Really? That's the best they could do? Obviously there are many cameras that produce focusing and zooming noise, but this is odder, more random, and more annoying than most. Given these noises, the standard audio track during video recording was for my purposes, unusable.<br /><br />2) I do sit-down, video blogs on YouTube, and one of the tasks I had for the X70 was as a video recorder for those efforts. Not to be defeated that easily, I took my Tascam TM-ST1 microphone, put on the 3.5 to 2,5mm adapter that I also use with my Panasonic Gx8, and plugged it into the X70's mic jack. To get as far away from the camera as possible, I put the mic on a table in front of me, not on the hot shoe. Suddenly, the audio was excellent, and I was satisfied that I could get usable audio from the camera, as long as I used an external mic or lavalier. This, however, brings me to the next problem:<br /><br />3) The camera was very poor at face detection and face tracking. In a setting that is a piece of cake for my Panny Gx8, or my Sony Rx 100 iii, the X70, with screen flipped up in selfie mode, had a devil of a time keeping me in focus. Worse, it misled me into thinking I was in focus, because the green framing square (that normally indicates you are in focus) would show around my face, even while the camera was focusing on something in the background! This creates the terrifying possibility of shooting a ten minute video, and discovering after the fact, that you were out of focus for much of the video. Terrible. As a last resort, I put the camera in complete auto mode to see if it would do any better. While it immediately went into \"Intelligent Face Detection\", and seemed to be tracking my movement, for the most part, I was still out of focus. I should also mention that even when I was in focus, if I shifted position, the X70 would be very slow to catch up and shift the focus point. And yes, the camera was set for \"continuous\" autofocus.<br /><br />To sum up, if you are buying the X70 as a still camera, and want to take advantage of its great features, its APS-C sensor. and its portability, it may still be the camera for you. If however, you want a camera that does it all, quality stills AND video, both the Sony Rx100 3 and 4 surpass this camera, even with only a one inch sensor. I am keeping the camera, basically because I have other cameras for shooting video. However, I hope that the folks from Fuji see this review and are embarrassed; they should be. I am generously giving the camera 4 stars. If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars.","Ergonomics:<br />With the smaller body, the controls are not spectacular. I find it harder to maintain a comfortable grip while manipulating the control ring, and the dpad buttons are so close to the protruding, articulating screen that it get's in the way of the left button. I always found the X100/s a joy to use, but find the X70 more like a conventional camera.<br /><br />Features:<br />The touch screen adds nothing, so I turned that off. WiFi works better than most other camera systems I've used, but that's not saying much. It's still slow and clunky, so would only use in a pinch.<br /><br />Shooting Experience:<br />Optics are what you expect from the Fuji X series. AF is way better than than X100S. Much faster, and accurate.<br /><br />Side by side, practical startup time (from cold to first shot) compared to my Sony RX100 M2 is dead on, although the extending lens is more distracting to the subjects (i.e. less discreet). The RX100 is definitely more pockatable though. The X70 fits in my jeans pocket, but you won't get it out sitting down.","Take very good photo. Balanced color and light. Love the feature that transfer smaller size of images to the mobile device.","\"The best camera is the one you have with you.\" This simply cannot be overstated. In the past, I have typically shot with a variety of lenses ranging from 16mm to 300mm with apertures from 1.4 and above. I use both full frame and crop sensors on a canon body. However this amounts to a heavy bag of gear and often I simply find it too difficult to lug around the city/hikes/vacation. I end up with many instances where the cell phone camera is all I've got.<br /><br />Fortunately fuji's new x70 has helped me fill the gap. I now carry this little guy everywhere as it fits nicely in a jacket pocket and can even fit in a pair of jeans. The lens is incredibly sharp at f2.8 and the colors are rich and beautiful. Even though this is relatively slow for a prime lens, the xtrans sensor is able to keep enough noise out at iso 1600 -3200 for my purposes in poorly lit areas. The fold out lcd screen also makes for a nice tripod for composition in low light.<br /><br />The 28mm fixed focal length makes it great for landscapes but often you'll feel like you need to be closer to you subject and there's no great option in terms of telecoverters like for the x100T. The digital telecoverter loses a lot of detail and I would simply recommend cropping it yourself in post.<br /><br />Overall, this camera is made for the enthusiast who wants a 2nd or 3rd camera to carry around at all times without having to lug 10 lbs of gear around.  I love this camera and it has really changed the way I can take photos. The picture quality on the Fuji is better than the cropped sensor cannons in my opinion. The lens image quality is what you would expect for a prime. If you are tired of always having a crappy phone camera with you or feel awkward pulling out the 5D3 or D810 in social situations, buy the x70 and you won't be disappointed. It's small, discreet, has great image quality and can always be with you.","I was shopping for a versatile (and more importantly, competent) camera. In my line of work, I get to travel quite a bit, but those trips are usually 2-days (including long working days). So, I needed a camera that I could just toss in my bag and not have to worry about lenses, weight and size. After much research, I had it narrowed to either the Ricoh or Fuji X100T (both of which have great reviews and lab tests). However, neither was a substantial improvement over my other cameras, in terms of sensor size, weight and image quality over my other cameras. So I was very reluctant to fork $1200 for the X100T. After searching some more, I bumped into this camera (X70) and was immediately drawn to it. The right size and weight. Full APS-C sensor and a nice wide prime tacked into it. Given I already owned other fujifilm cameras, I felt right at home with the menus, settings, etc. The camera is \"semi-pocketable\" that is, you could fit it in your pocket if you wear cargo pants with ample space. To be clear if what you want is something you can put in your shirt pocket or normal pants pocket, this camera would not be a good fit.<br /><br />But ultimately, the measure of a good camera is in the image quality, all other specs don't matter. And in this respect this camera delivers *way* more that I expected. I'd say the image quality is excellent for every single shot I cared about: street, landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, candid portraits, etc. I'd say some are better than my other fujifilm camera with a Zeiss prime on it. Really incredible.<br /><br />So why 4 stars? Build quality. While not bad at all, I have reservations about its sturdiness. Some nobs seem a bit lose (but aren't). The shutter button doesn't have a good tactile feel to it. Also important to note: this unit is made in China, not Japan (like most fujifilm products are).<br /><br />Overall, though, at ~ 1/2 the price of an X100T, this camera is a great deal so long as you are a good fit for its intended use.","The camera is light, takes needle sharp pictures and is small enough to be carried in a pocket or purse. It's more intuitive to use than the XE-2. It has a fixed focal lens, but you can still take a huge variety of really outstanding pictures.<br /><br />My gripe isn't with the camera, my gripe is with the user manual. Modern cameras can be complex and Fuji's lousy manuals make learning the nuances of this camera a chore. You should buy the camera from Amazon, but if you then struggle with using it, trot down to your local camera club or local camera store and ask for help. I will confess, I didn't buy it from Amazon just because I needed to trade in some stuff and you can't do that with Amazon.<br /><br />If you like a handsome camera that takes great pictures, go ahead and pull the trigger. Be prepared for a bit of a learning curve but once you've got it, you are going to take some really fine pictures.","I had a X100S before buying the X70. I sold my X100S because I wanted a smaller APS-C camera, and the X70 fit the bill. I miss the EVF, built in ND filter, but the X70's articulating touch screen and newer AF makes easier to use. The iPhone app works well so far. It allows me to transfer photos and use my phone as a camera remote. The transferred photos are at a lower resolution, but they're still acceptable for social media. As for IQ, the photos seem comparable to the X100S, but the newer AF makes it easier to take decent photos, especially \"macro\" photos. I can't hold it as still as the X100S because it's smaller, but I can still get reasonably sharp photos at 1/15s and even 1/8 if I use a 2s timer. The X70 is a great camera for people who are new to photography because it's super user-friendly, and it's also great for DSLR users who want something compact and don't want to pay more for the RX1 or Leicas. The X200 is rumored to be released in the near future, so that might be worth waiting for if you can't live without a viewfinder.","Wonderful little camera.  This is my third Fuji.  I have an X-T1, The X70 is replacing an X100S.  I was a bit worried about not having a viewfinder.  Not a problem.<br /><br />Solidly build with superb image quality!","In many ways this is exactly the walk-around camera I have always wanted. The Ricoh GR really is unsurpassed for one-handed shooting, but I have two hands, and I strongly prefer the Fuji's controls. Based on two hours of shooting, I would say that the Fuji's image quality is comparable or not far behind the GR. Good enough for any normal person, at any rate. If you want to shoot jpegs, the Fuji is miles better.<br /><br />That is, it would be better if it worked. After only two hours, the on/off switch came loose. Now it wobbles and turns freely, with no resistance between the on and off positions. It is impossible to use or carry the camera without turning it on and off accidentally. I could probably unscrew the case and fix this myself, but good lord, it's a $700 camera. I'm returning it. Undecided yet about taking a chance on another one.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did choose to get another one. Usually Fuji cameras are very well built, and I liked the thing, so I thought I'd take a chance on the first one being a fluke. Not a fluke. My second X70 has a loose power switch/shutter assembly AND the grip is already coming unglued. After four days. The switch works, unlike my first copy, but it wobbles and has a ton of play. Re-gluing the grip would be trivial, but gluing it on correctly in the first place also would have been trivial. Come on, Fuji.<br /><br />SECOND UPDATE: I am now on my third copy of this camera in three weeks. That's how much I like it! I ordered the most recent copy from a different source, hoping the last two were from a bad batch. This one seems good. The on/off switch is installed properly, with none of the play or vertical wobble of the previous two copies. The difference is night and day.<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars so that people will be aware of the problem and check their cameras for defects. It's a great camera, though. If, like me, you've always wanted the bastard child of a GR and an X100, this is your camera.","Update: I returned the X70 to get the X-E2S. I loved this little camera and its every bit as good as the X-E2S. However, I couldn't get over the nagging feeling that I wanted to collect lenses and get a more traditional (and larger) compact body with a viewfinder. I felt a bit like a tourist with the X70 and missed feeling i got from old film bodies. Also 28mm felt too \"flat\" for me and I missed higher focal lengths (yes, you can crop but it's not the same). If that sounds like you, definitely take a look at the X-E2S which I now love and I'm blown away by the fujinon lenses, of which the 35mm f/2 feels like a huge improvement for me over the X70's.<br /><br />Old review:<br />Before I jump into the details of the camera, I want to talk a bit about why I picked this one to begin with, because it certainly was not on my short list when I started researching. I own a Canon T5 Rebel DSLR which my wife and I bought a year ago for a trip. It was affordable, and with the right non-kit lenses has created some incredible photos. The only major issue with it is that I only used it when we planned a big trip or I went on a photo \"expedition.\" I was using my iPhone 6s for 90% of my other photos since the T5 is a pain to lug around, and it just wasn't doing the random moments of life justice. Also, I travel a decent amount for work and love taking photos of my journeys, so the T5 wasn't really a workable option for that.<br /><br />I spent a month looking at cameras before buying the X70. I was drawn to Fujifilm because a friend had the XE1 and I was blown away by the photos he took (and I realized mirrorless was the future). The more I researched the more I realized that Fuji quality fit a lot of what I wanted: solid design, timeless style, and amazing JPEG quality SOOC without tons of work in Lightroom. Of course, I really wanted the Leica Q but you know how that goes.<br /><br />Initially, I thought I wanted an interchangeable lens camera and was eying the X-E2S and some mirrorless full frames, but I realized that what was holding my photography back wasn't my choice of lens or going full frame: it was that I wasn't taking enough photos of enough things during the day. 9 times out of 10 all I had was an iPhone because I either wasn't bringing the T5 or I didn't feel comfortable using it (too intrusive, terribly loud shutter, etc.)<br /><br />I heard that the X100 line was incredibly popular with street and travel photographers, and I had that thing sitting in my Amazon cart for a week. I compared the X70 with it constantly, and had such a hard time getting over the lack of viewfinder. What kind of camera doesn't have a viewfinder, right? Eventually, I convinced myself that if I really wanted a portable, high quality camera, I might as well go small as possible (and I really wanted a tilt LCD!). I can confidently say that was a good decision and so far I haven't missed the viewfinder once (I'm an iPhone addict, I haven't used a viewfinder for most of my photos in years!) Also, considering the price is half of the X100T, I think this camera is a great value.<br /><br />Anyways, so far I'm blown away by this little work of art. The image quality is incredible, definitely beats my canon and the photos have a sense of magic that even my friend's fancy Canon and Nikon full frame setups lack. The dials all feel well made and the camera feels solid if heavier than expected. I have smaller hands and find that it fits well, but if you have huge hands it might feel too small (did I mention it's small?).<br /><br />Also, I'm addicted to WIFI mode. It works so well (even if the Fujifilm app is terrible). Basically, the camera creates its own wifi network that you connect your phone to, then you choose on the camera which photos to send to the phone. Photos take about a second to transfer for each photo, and go straight into your photos app. Already it has dramatically cut down on both my worry about losing photos, and my turnaround time for posting on instagram, etc.<br /><br />The film simulation modes are fun, and I find myself sitting in Classic Chrome most often. If you do Fine + Raw you don't have to worry about applying the wrong film style and can tweak the originals as you see fit.<br /><br />Did I mention this thing is quiet? We just got a Sony A7R ii at work which is the top of the line mirrorless right now, and the X70 is 10x quieter. Already my wife is 10x less annoyed by the random photos I take of her (yes, I can tend to be a shutterbug). And, if you turn on the electronic shutter it's silent (though there are drawbacks to that mode).<br /><br />Haven't really tried the video mode, that's not why I got this and the iPhone makes for an incredible video camera so I don't know if I really will use it much.<br /><br />Auto focus is really fast, and the touch screen makes it easy to kind of \"mash\" the auto focus if you're doing things like taking selfies or trying to focus on something quickly. The only issue I have with the focus system in \"S\" mode (single shot auto focus) is that it's just that: single shot. It needs to do a full re-focus after each shot which is foreign to me because my Canon does not need to do that (this slows down the time between shots quite a bit). The \"solution\" here seems to be to use manual focus mode and then the AE-L/AF-L button to focus which will then hold the focus between shots. I would have rathered the focus stay put while I still have the shutter release half-way depressed. Maybe I'm doing it wrong?<br /><br />As for the touch screen, I haven't used it much and don't know if I'll use the touch to shoot often. If anything, I'll use the touch to focus mode like I do on the iPhone when the auto focus won't do. Also, I do find myself using the tilt of the LCD, and the selfie mode is actually really fun (yea, I'm that guy).<br /><br />I also love the exposure compensation dial. Makes it so easy to get decent photos out of really sunny or bright situations. I'm comparing this to the iPhone camera app which is just awful at making it easy to adjust exposure manually. I've used this dial far more than I expected.<br /><br />The 2.8 aperature lens gives me plently of creamy bokeh and low light performance feels better than my T5 (I know that's not saying much). I really wanted the f/2 of the x100t but now that I have the 2.8 I don't mind it at all.<br /><br />Anyways, I love this thing and I'm taking it everywhere I go. I don't know if I'll be touching my DSLR apart from portraits or situations where I want to have a zoom lens. Will try to post some pictures later.","Fuji X70 Review<br /><br />Bought this camera as a walk around street shooting companion that I always have on me in case I come across a moment I want to capture. Already a Fujifilm shooter (I have the X-T1, X-T10, and a number of lenses), the X70 is every bit as good as the other two Fuji cameras I have, in terms of IQ (quality), speed of the autofocus system, and the amazing colors straight out of camera without having to do much post.<br /><br />The articulated viewfinder is incredibly useful, I find myself using it as a waist level viewfinder. Plus the ability to use the screen to set focus points, or tap to focus and shoot is great when trying to document situations when you don't want to make it seem obvious that you're shooting photos. I honestly don't find the lack of a viewfinder all that bad, considering my style of shooting. Even in broad day light the viewfinder is quite usable.<br /><br />The camera is nice and compact compared to my X-10, and slips into a coat or jacket pocket easily; the fixed 18.5mm (28mm) pancake lens hardly moves when powered on. I also like how quickly the camera wakes up from sleep to take a shot, it is very responsive.<br /><br />A very useful feature is that the camera can create a wifi network for your smartphone or tablet to connect to using a very user friendly app, to view download images, control the camera remotely, and in the case of your smartphone, use its GPS to tag location data to your photos. This is awesome! I don't have to remember where I took the shots, as its embedded in the photos! It keeps the connection to the camera for an hour. During this time, you can power off your camera, and when you power it back on, it will reconnect by itself!<br /><br />I find the battery life to be okay, on par with the other Fuji X-series cameras, I always carry 2-3 around just in case. One feature that I like on the X70 that I wish Fuji had on the X-T1 / X-T10 is being able to charge the battery in camera with a micro USB cable.<br /><br />Some things that be improved upon would include the ability to manually turn of the screen to conserve battery between shots. You can set the auto-shutoff to 2 minutes, which isn't bad, but it be nice for more options. Also there is no included cover plate for the hot shoe, I found it a bit uncomfortable, but fortunately I had the plate from my X-T1 that I wasn't using since I bought a thumb grip for it.","[[VIDEOID:234fd6d1159f5a260f18e97e0717b1ba]] Check out my video review!","While I have no frame of reference for small mirrorless Fuji's (this is my first, although I have played with my brother's X100(s) around his house), cameras in general, this one delivers.  I usually shoot (for-hire) with a Canon 5D3, but wanted something more portable to carry on me (versus my 5D3 + 2-3 lenses in a shoulder bag....all day...walking around) while I'm not on a set or photoshoot, was looking at the x100, but saw this one was coming out, so I pre-ordered it (from BH).<br /><br />While I've only had it for a week now, it has delivered some surprising results (I admit, I had lowered my expectations, since the x70 is only a little larger than other P&S cameras I've had in the past).  That said, like most cameras, you're going to want to ensure you still follow photography common sense (good light quantity/quality/direction, etc) - don't expect miracles, if the light is bad, chances are your photo will be...less than great.  The articulating touchscreen has been extremely useful, the focus point and touch photo features on it have already proved useful - I have not found myself missing a dedicated viewfinder (yet).<br /><br />Some things I didn't find so great was the need to mount a 49mm filter backwards (after removing the front ring), when you tightened it all the way down, the lens would hit the filter when focusing and error out - easily solved by either loosening up the filter OR ordering a hood & filter adapter kit which allows for the filter to be elevated enough to clear the lens.  The hood/filter also allowed me to use the lens cap again (which would not stay on when it was just the reverse mounted filter).  If you want to keep this camera as compact as you can, forego the filter completely, I put one on for protection (like I do with all my lenses).  Another issue I've found is holding the camera securely, I have fairly large hands, so not really the camera's fault, but I think the hotshoe mounted \"thumbs up\" grip I ordered should solve that issue (don't get a grip that protrudes below the top of the camera, it will probably cover the deleted and play button, as well as limit the articulating screens ability to articulate).  But, perhaps my biggest qualm isn't exactly with the camera itself (at least I don't think its the camera), is with the wireless feature and its operation on my phone (HTC M9 on ViperRom - Android 6.0), the issue is that connectivity to any of the 3 Fuji apps is spotty at best for me, when my phone & camera do connect, its fine, but its getting them both to connect every time I try is the issue (it's pretty inconsistent for me),  I'll usually get a timeout from either the app or from the camera or both - but when they do [finally] connect, they seem to work pretty well (although the UI on the Fuji apps is a bit...um...\"cartoon-y\"/spartan), I've only really used the wireless image transfer feature so far, but the other available app features (like remote camera control) do seem like they could be useful (assuming I can get them to connect).<br /><br />Ultimately, given its size, its truly a great camera for what I wanted it for (APS-C sensor in a small package).  Of course, I would have preferred a faster lens (its a f/2.8), maybe a little better connectivity with the Android app (at least in my case, could be my phone, who knows) and maybe an external charger for secondary batteries (you charge it like a phone, on a micro-usb cord connected to the camera, so 1 battery at a time, but the battery is removable/swappable). There is seldom a \"perfect\" product (\"perfect\" is such a relative term anyway),but considering the size and all the things it DOES have going for it (which is a lot, more than I mentioned here), I can easily overlook it's shortcomings and give it 5 stars."]},{"name":"Pentax K-70","amazon_reviews":["Love it and it's new features.","I have used Pentax cameras since the I had a Pentax ME in 1978 I have also had Pentax K30 which this was a replacement for.

Had previously went to one of the local electronics store and played with the two top brands glad I picked this.","Did you ever wonder about the outrageously high prices of mid-range cameras when we see a price tag of $1,999 for a body only?. Well, when I came across the Pentax k-70 and what it offers at this price I couldn't help it but giving it 5 stars. I declined the kit lens due to the distortion issue and lack of Macro capabilities but treated myself to the 16-85mm. The camera offers excellent image quality with lots of details, excellent dynamic range, very low noise levels in all across ISOs, and limitless tweeking options to help getting the best images possible. RAW images at DNG format are easy to use and gets the best out of this camera. Very few minor downfalls like any other camera at any price range but the quality of images is a treat especially when paired with a good lens such as the Pentax 16-85mm that is able to get the best out of a good sensor.","The camera is great, but the zoom creep that happens with the lens is ridiculous. Had I known it was this bad I would have just purchased the body and got a better lens that hopefully wouldn't have his problem.","Great camera. The more I use it the more I like it. Way ahead of the Canon Rebels my classmates use. Takes great pics and the lens is very versatile.","Fantastic camera--especially for the price. Great performance, specs and the kit lens is worth it.","Amazing value from Pentax and the phone app left me amazed. I'd buy this camera again if I needed to because of the image quality, ease of use, and features at a fair price.","This is mostly in comparison to my K-30, which died on me way too soon (but I really wanted an excuse to buy new camera anyway ;-) ) The 70 is a noticeable upgrade. For the price, it is very hard to beat.<br /><br />What 70 has the 30 doesn't, that I like:<br />1) Wi-Fi - It only transfers to a phone app, but it works and I like the idea I can take a high quality picture to post right away to social media instead of just using just my phone camera<br />2) External mic input. My daughter acts and we do a lot of self taping for auditions and rehearsals. The 30's built in mic is tinny. The ability to add an external, high quality mic makes the sound quality so much better, and easier than mixing in a separate audio channel<br />3) External HDMI out. Another thing that goes great with taping auditions because I can now just play back to a large monitor instead of using the small camera screen or having to remove the card and inserting in my computer<br />4) Picture quality. As good as ever, with even better color correctness. With the additional menu options of Clarity and Pixel Shifting, you have even more options to experiment with<br />5) Better video capabilities, usability. Pentax has always given low priority to video, and even though the 70 pays more attention to it, other cameras are better if video is your main concern. Still, shooting video on a DSLR, with the ability to use various lenses, is much better than using a separate, single lens video camera. I am much happier with the improvements Pentax has made with their video capabilities, including a better performing Live View function and better ability to adjust to different light levels. While they offer a continuous video auto focus function, it only works with a couple of new lenses. I can live without it, though<br />6) Articulating screen. Not a huge benefit, but I find myself using it more than I thought.<br /><br />I've had it a month and haven't used all the other, additional features. Generally speaking, it has everything the 30 did but with more variations and options. For example, the HDR options are expanded with 2 more settings and the ability to adjust exposure, and there are some additional options for setting the focal point that are interesting.<br /><br />Overall, the controls and menu are very familiar and I have not found anything I do not like. Though, one thing I really wish it had was an external headphone jack so I could hear the audio better. Another thing is, at first it did not seem to focus very quickly, but once I linked the exposure to the focal point (a settings option), it began focusing quickly.<br /><br />For those of you who own a 30, I can definitely say the 70 is a worthy step up, especially if you want to shoot video.","Camera delivered as advertised!","The first six months of ownership were fine.  Then the monitor began to randomly turn off a couple of days before a two-day photo shoot.  Upon arriving at the photo shoot in February (temp 25 - well within the camera's operating range), the camera would not operate.  The only thing that worked was the green light around the shutter.  The shutter would not depress, nor would the back button and the monitor would not come on.  Fortunately I took a backup camera with me.  I called Amazon but because it was provided by Adorama, I had to deal with them.  I was astounded to discover that because I had the camera for more than *30 days* I could not return it to them.  I sent the camera to Precision Camera to be repaired.  They cleaned it and calibrated it but the note at the end of the repair summary leaves me in doubt that they really found the problem.  It said something like \"problem could have been caused by battery or lens\".  It was not the battery and I don't see how it could have been the lens (the 18-135mm that came with the camera).  It seems to be working fine now but I may have to wait til next winter to find out if it will still operate in winter conditions.  Fortunately I bought a protection policy.  So, despite rave reviews for this camera on Amazon and Pentax Forums, I guess I just ended up with a lemon.  I am probably being generous giving this camera 3 stars.<br /><br />Original review:  This is my first serious digital camera (I have two other digital point-and-shoot cameras). I took a basic photography course shortly after buying the camera. My teacher said \"This is a *very* nice camera!.  I am very pleased with it.","i'm not a professional.  i love photography and have had many cameras.  started with nikon, switched to canon.  last 2 cameras are pentax.  buying a camera is a big deal to me, i do not have money to burn.  decided on the k70 and i could not be happier.  the camera is pretty intuitive, first time out of the box, it felt like an old friend in my hands.  i will not get into features, you can read that for yourself.  but i will say if you want to put it on auto, or play around with the settings, there are enough bells and whistles to keep you happy. feels like quality in your hands. only negatives, and it's not really that big of a deal, no usb cord, full manual is on pdf form on line.","Everything I wanted and more.","had to replace my old pentax of  10 years. love this one. new settings. very quiet and quick to take pictures. Pentax never lets me down. Reveived very quickly. Will always by pentax","Excellent lens,easy to understand menu,strong build,feels perfect in medium size hands,excellent results with high speed SD card,great looking.Had it in the rain the other day,the camera is definitely weather proof. I have had 4 Pentax cameras over the years as well as Canons,Nikons,Sony,etc.,and without a doubt,this is my favorite.","Initial Preview:<br />Upgraded from a 5 year old Pentax K-5.  Realized I was stepping down from flag ship series to high end enthusiast camera.  But I was looking to using some new features, save money, and keep the K-5 for backup.<br /><br />On arrival I immediately upgraded Firmware to 1.10.  At first glance the image quality seems similar to the K-5, but I haven't gotten around to looking closely at images in comparison.  Also I look forward to trying the new features.<br /><br />Likes:<br />* Looks like it will work fine in place of my old K-5 for all my normal shooting.<br />* The articulating back display<br />* larger ISO range<br />* more settings are saved in user settings (compared to k-5 which had some big limitations - such as could not be used with interval shooting)<br />* fast charge - from depleted to mostly charged in an hour<br /><br />Miss:<br />* larger battery capacity of K-5 (bought two Wasabi batteries since I have had good look with them in the past).  Also ordering AC power supply for use in remote shooting<br />* focus confirmation in viewfinder when doing manual focus<br /><br />Dislike:<br />* WI-FI - when it works, it's nice but limited.  The remote control is very flaky.  Have used the remote \"Image Sync\" app with both iPhone and Android tablet with similar results.  It will hang at times.  And sometimes after a long delay will report that it has lost communication with camera.  Sometimes killing the \"Image Sync\" app and restarting it will start it working again.  Other times need to switch the camera off and on again (not very convenient with remote shooting). It seems to work better for me if I switch off live view (save battery life) or use it for short intervals, set raw+ (instead of raw) or JPEG, and change focus to manual.  At least get fewer hangs with this setup, and most of the time can recover by just killing the \"Image Sync\" app and restarting.  Hope that this will be improved over time with updates to camera firmware or fixes to mobile app, but from past experience it may take a long time or may never happen.  Also the app is limited.  It only works in single shot mode and doesn't allow you to change shooting mode.  Might be nice to have bracketing support, as well as video and interval shooting.<br /><br />Note:<br />* Lightroom is not recognizing the PEF raw format, but after switching to DNG it works.<br /><br />Will update this as I get more used to the camera.","I have been shooting for 30 years now as a hardcore enthusiast who sells my photos online. In that entire time, its been Canon everything for me and I never strayed given my familiarity and satisfaction with that brand. I upgraded from a 60D to a 80D in Mar and was quite disappointed to see picture quality not much better than my trusted 60D. Sure, the 80D has touchscreen, faster focus, etc. but picture quality (what we all really care about in the end) left me wanting to say the least. Then the K70 comes out and my wife ordered it as an upgrade to her K30. I did all the research for the K70 and was actually excited to see how it did against my 80D with the 24-105 L lens (total over $2k vs. <$1k for Pentax with Kit lens).<br /><br />In a word.... WOW!!! I shot around 50 pictures in different lighting conditions using both cameras and there was not one that came our better on the Canon. I could not believe so tried it again using a different lens and still the same. The K70 images are just so much sharper and better that I am actually giving up on Canon. I ordered the K70+kit lens and am very very happy with my decision. I think Canon has rested on their laurels way too long and have lost it. Lost me as a customer anyway after 30+ years.","Hello, I have been a photographer for 50+ years working with a lot of different subjects and gear, on and off as a part-time pro. Today, I mostly shoot landscapes, cityscapes, flowers, birds (a little), and do fine art studies and some tabletop in my home little studio. I make my own prints with a 17\" inkjet photo printer. I mainly work in Raw + jpeg, Av mode, the lowest possible ISO setting, +- 1f/stop bracketing, AF-S. When shooting dynamic subjects (i.e.: birds), I use the TAv mode, max ISO3200. I prefer framing with the pentaprism but use the articulated LCD monitor for high/low angle shooting. I don't do video with my cameras. The K70 is my 4th Pentax APS-C model. I received it a week ago and tested it with the following personal conclusions.<br /><br />Summary of the Pentax K70 key features: a very compact (for its class) and solid weatherized body with external controls for all common camera settings; a new 24Mp (Sony?) sensor with phase detection AF; 1/6000sec max shutter speed; max ISO102,400; 14bit color depth; class leading pentaprism; fully articulated LCD monitor; state of the art in-camera IS; a feature set way above its price with some unique capabilities (such as pixel shift high res).<br /><br />Body: The K70 is a small camera that is a pleasure to hold. It fits well in my medium-size, male hands, and feels reassuringly solid. The outside controls are well placed and let me quickly access all my major camera settings (aperture, compensation, ISO, drive, and test pic). Weatherization is a must for me since I like to shoot in all weather conditions. To the best of my knowledge, the body is polycarbonate on a metal chassis but Pentax and weatherization ensure that it is built with good materials and tight tolerances.<br /><br />Viewing: The large pentaprism is of superior quality. Up to certain distance I can see the subject coming into focus. The LCD monitor is bright and clear and its full articulation let me work even when my eye cannot reach the pentaprism (I often shoot plants and some landscapes close to the ground). I like that I am able to close it against the body when not using it.<br /><br />Sensor: 24Mp is more than enough for me (I get excellent 24x36\" prints out of my 16Mp Olympus M43 OMD cameras). The high res pixel shift mode does enhance resolution and color accuracy, and reduces noise. I used it in my studio and with outdoor semi-static subjects where I could combine it with a single shot to replace moving parts showing artifacts. Its new Motion Correction function saves processing time with some dynamic subjects. Since I shoot Raw and process in the Photoshop's 16bit Pro Photo color space, the camera 14bit color depth is very appreciated. Saving Raw in the dng format simplifies storage.<br /><br />Exposure: I find it to be quite reliable in most conditions (and exposure bracketing takes care of most of the exceptions). While I like to set it myself by consulting the histogram (test pic) and applying the corrections I want, when there is no time for fussing around it's good to be able to trust the camera. The K70 max shutter speed is a fast 1/6000sec, typical of more expensive cameras. There are Auto, PASM, Sv (Sensitivity/ISO priority), TAv (Shutter and Aperture priority), HDR, and other 13 custom modes, and 9 digital filters too. The Interval Timer, Multiple Exposure and especially (for me) Interval Composite (bright) modes are particularly interesting and deserve further exploration (google them). Int Comp Bright shoots a number of pics and combines them into one using the brightest pixels available (fireworks anyone?).<br /><br />AF: New to Pentax, the K70 has on-chip phase-detect autofocus pixels for a hybrid AF system that should speed up AF in Live View and video. In its review of the camera, photographyblog states that AF in LV is now significantly faster. AF-S, my main mode, is very fast and accurate. I am not a good judge of AF-C and tracking because my action photography is limited. I have fun and good success shooting shore birds and the guests at my feeders in AF-S and AF-C (depending on the action). Nevertheless, I would like to point out that the effectiveness of a camera AF also depends on technique. Like many pros, I always use center spot focusing and recomposing. The center AF sensor is the most sensitive and I always know exactly where my focus plane is. In dark conditions, I focus on an area on the plane of the subject that has contrast and/or detail and recompose. I can do this very quickly. With moving subjects, being able to anticipate the action helps a lot. For example, an osprey carrying fish or sticks for a new nest tends to approach (at least for a while) from the same direction and hover above the nest for a couple of seconds. One can get some great pics by being aware of this, positioning him/herself for the proper angle and light direction, and pre-focusing (the camera 6 fps continuous shooting is respectable). Also to be remembered is that IS compensates for camera shake but not for subject motion for which one has to use the proper shutter speed. For all these reasons, the K70 \"only\" 11 focusing points are not an issue to me. When working in the studio in Live View, the ability to move the spot focus point around is great. I often use focus bracketing (and stacking in Photoshop). The combination of a good macro lens, high res and focus staking gives amazing results approaching higher pixel count FF cameras levels (remember that IS has to be off when working on a tripod). BTW, the new cable release is very welcome together with the AC adapter.<br /><br />IS: The in-camera 4.5f/stop image stabilization is top of the line and also allows for pixel shift high res and AA filter simulation. Together with the camera low noise at high ISO, it lets me work without a tripod in most conditions, something that with age I have come to love.<br /><br />My default button and dial settings: mode dial: \"Av\" (TAv if action); front dial: \"F/stop\"; rear dial: \"ISO\"; Fx1: \"test pic\"; Fx2: \"choose spot AF point\" in LV; AF AE-L: \"lock exposure\".<br /><br />Conclusion: In action, I find the K70 to be very comfortable and fun to use. It is highly competent (it does a lot of things quickly and with no fuss) with a combination of IQ, construction quality, ergonomics, feature set and price that comes very close to my ideal camera. It is not tiresome to work with, I can see what I'm doing very well, quickly change major settings, shoot from any position, and not worry if the weather gets dusty, wet or cold. The boundary between advanced amateur and pro cameras is quite fuzzy. For my kind of photography, the K70 is easily capable of pro level performance. An all metal, pro shutter K3II would last longer but so far I have never had a camera that gave up on me because of old age. Also, for serious work one typically travels with 2 bodies (for redundancy and to minimize lens changing in tough conditions) which in the case of the K70 would cost a reasonable $1,300 (probably $1,200 by the end of the year). The rest of one's budget can be wisely used to buy great lenses of which there is no shortage.<br /><br />08/12/16 addendum<br /><br />A final note that could be helpful to some. I love to shoot in horrible (wonderful) weather including rain, wind, snow, ice, and sub-zero temps, often doing some slippery scrambling to get into position. For max portability, in these conditions I use Oly EM10II and EM5II cameras with slower, minuscule but good quality Oly and Pana lenses. In my experience, the K70 is overall superior to the EM10II (excluding size) at a comparable price, at least because of its weatherization, pixel shift technology and pixel count. The EM5II is my top camera which surpasses the K70 in some important areas such as size, the large and clear EVF, AF, IS, more external controls, continuous shooting and some really usable creative stuff like Live Composite. Alas, it is also about $450 more expensive (= a good lens). Working with all 3 cameras is very satisfying but I noticed something curious. While the small size of the Oly's is very convenient, I prefer the way the Pentax sits in my hands and I can operate it. It feels like the perfect fit. Moral: always try a new camera in your own hands before buying.<br /><br />08/13/16 addendum: a note about pixel shift high resolution (PSHR)<br /><br />PSHR is offered by recent Pentax and Olympus camera models. It has been received with various degrees of favor because it's limited to still subjects (not true). In real life, it produces levels of detail, color accuracy, lower noise and expanded DR comparable to top of the line FF cameras when used with still studio subjects and outdoor subjects with limited movement. The latter is done either by using the new Pentax K1 and K70 Motion Correction feature and/or stacking and masking a normal res frame to replace high res parts in motion showing artifacts. I have tried it with both my Olympus E-M5 mark II and the Pentax K70 with similar IQ results. The Oly can output a 40Mp jpeg and a 64Mp ORF Raw, with limitations about f/stop and max ISO. The Pentax can output a 24Mp PEF/DNG Raw and a jpeg with no exposure limitations. When everything is said and done, I do not care about the jpeg outputs and prefer the practicality of the Pentax 24Mp Raw which, saved in dng, can be opened directly by any Raw converter and has a more than high enough pixel count. Next month, Olympus should unveil its E-M1 mark II with even more advanced PSHR features.<br /><br />08/31/16 addendum<br /><br />Added pic # 7, a visual comparison of the Pentax K70 with a basic, bright lens set vs the Oly em5 II with equivalent, good IQ but darker lenses for max portability.<br /><br />02/22/17 addendum<br /><br />Still my favorite camera and the price is down to $600.

In the previous K-50 camera you had to manually focus while you shot videos. It also has 14 bit RAW and a 24 Megapixel CMOS sensor verses 12 bit RAW and 16 Megapixels of the K-50. The K-70 has a Vari-angle monitor that can be rotated 180 degrees to the left & 180 degrees backward and 90 degrees forward. You can also add an external microphone to the microphone/cable release terminal, another feature the K-50 did not have. A printed Operating Manual(A printed Start Guide is included, however more in depth information is in the Operating Manual)  and USB cable are NO longer included. Also, unlike the K-50 there is NO AA battery holder available as an accessory option to power the camera instead of using the included Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery D-LI109.<br /><br />One of the advantages of using Pentax DSLRs is that you can use lens that were originally made for 35mm film SLRs. You can use lens made from 1975 to the present on the Pentax K-70. There were 3 series of manual focus lens: 1. K series with manual aperture. 2. M series with manual aperture. 3. A series with automatic aperture. This lens has an \"A\" setting on the lens aperture ring. The following information is how to use these lens on the Pentax K-70:<br /><br />How To Use Manual Mode SIMPLIFIED METHOD<br />Manual Mode:<br /><br />When you use a Manual Focus(MF) A series lens do this:<br /><br />1. Set the lens aperture ring to A.<br /><br />2. Set the mode dial to M.<br /><br />3. Compose subject in viewfinder and press Green button. The aperture and shutter speed are automatically adjusted to the correct exposure at that moment.<br /><br />4. Trip shutter.<br /><br />When you use a Manual Focus(MF) M or K series lens do this:<br /><br />[in C4 Custom Setting menu go to #24 Using Aperture Ring and set to Enable.]<br /><br />1. Set the mode dial to M.<br /><br />2. Select aperture on lens.<br /><br />3. Compose subject in viewfinder and press Green button. The lens is stopped down and shutter speed is automatically adjusted to the correct exposure at that moment.<br /><br />4. Trip shutter.<br /><br />How To Use Program Mode SIMPLIFIED METHOD<br />Program Mode:<br /><br />This works with a Manual Focus(MF) A series lens only.<br /><br />1. Set Aperture ring to A<br /><br />2. Set the mode dial to P<br /><br />3. Compose subject in viewfinder and press the Shutter button lightly. The aperture and shutter speed are automatically adjusted to the correct exposure at that moment.<br /><br />4. If you want to change shutter speed, turn front e-dial and If you want to change aperture turn rear e-dial.(the camera will automatically adjust exposure after you do this) Otherwise skip this step and go to step 5.<br /><br />5. Trip Shutter.<br /><br />ALL CAPTURE MODES WORK WITH A MF A SERIES LENS WHEN THE APERTURE RING IS SET TO A.","Upgraded from a Pentax K-r, which was a great camera to begin with. As usual the in camera image stabilization means I can use any Pentax lens lens made since the 50's and still have the 21st century image stabilization. Very fast focusing and very crisp images even up to ISO12800. I rarely went above ISO3200 on my old K-r and my dad's Canon Rebel T3i. I had to zoom in on my laptop screen to see any color noise at high ISOs.<br /><br />WiFi - I was very very skeptical of the WiFi feature. The wifi works seamlessly using the Pentax app. You can focus, change shutter speeds, aperture etc remotely, while viewing the live view on your smartphone. You can also browse through the image library and transfer images direct to your phone. Great job here!!<br /><br />I am yet to try the pixel shift on landscape shots.

It is a fantastic camera and with my collection of Olympus and Panasonic lenses, the E-M5 is still a very relevant and useful camera.  However, during the last year, I patiently waited for the new E-M1 Mark ii to be released, thinking that I would upgrade my camera to what I believed would be the best possible Micro 4/3 camera for still photography.  When the new E-M1 was released I was very excited by its capabilities AND it is indeed the best Micro 4/3 camera for still photography.  But, when I had a chance to hold it - I found it to have grown noticeably bulkier and heavier than my original E-M5.  It was a very difficult decision, but given the cost I decided that the E-M1 mark ii was not the camera I was looking for.  In my opinion, the beauty of Micro 4/3 is that the loss of resolution with the smaller sensor size is offset by the substantial decrease in size and weight of the camera- thus making the camera portable and easier to carry around... and I carry my camera around all the time.<br />  I was back to square one thinking that I would continue shooting with my old E-M5 which has developed a handful of dead pixels.  Somehow though, I started reading about the Pen F that was released a year earlier... I had never considered a Pen series camera before because they lacked a viewfinder and were not weather sealed.  This new Pen had a decent viewfinder even though the camera was not weather-sealed.  I purchased it and except for a few issues it was exactly what I was looking for.<br />PROS; The right size, not too big and not too small.  Decent viewfinder.

There is no dedicated external mic port which renders this camera useless for quality video because audio is equally important as image.  The On/Off switch is not best- it should be a toggle.  Without any finger-grip on the front right of camera it is not always easy to hold the camera firmly, especially with larger/heavier lenses(I resolved this with a leather half case that has a grip built in.)  The dedicated exposure comp dial is too high and too stiff to rotate- this also might have been better as a toggle.  Battery life is still marginal, but flipping the LCD into camera can save some battery life.  A  tilting LCD is easier and more convenient to use than this rotating one(albeit less versatile.)<br />  Another complaint about this camera has been the location of the tripod mount screw, but I have found that with my half case mounted it is actually an advantage to have the mount closer to the lens to help support the Camera/Lens total weight- instead of a front heavy lens pulling down... if that makes sense.<br />  If Olympus weather sealed this camera it would be well worth the eleven hundred asking price and maybe a five star camera, I bought the camera for three hundred less so I have no complaints.

Small light and fun to use. Underneath its very capable camera. However, AF is bellow average","Great little camera with a beautiful build.","Absolutely loving this camera. Small light weight and with image quality that rivers the much larger cameras. Fantastic and classy build that is a head turner.","Yes, this is designed to look like a rangefinder camera. I own a rangefinder camera (Leica M8 w/ Summicron 50mm) but this isn't a 'my other camera is a Leica' review. Other reviewers have done a very professional job of describing what this camera can and can't do; I leave the topic  to them.<br /><br />I bought the PEN because, while I love my rangefinder, there's a great deal it can't do. Image stabilization is one; long lenses are another. In addition, very fast lenses are too expensive (for me) on a Leica.<br /><br />So: what I like on the PEN. I wanted to be able to compose with a viewfinder. The EVF is sharp enough to do manual focus, and with tech tricks like magnification, I can get the focus I want. Normally I'd control exposure via the lens; here, there's a very convenient dial which gives plus or minus three stops; good enough for most of what I do. Similarly, the ISO is easy to change -- actually easier than on the M.  The dials are well-designed and work just as they should.<br /><br />After a good deal of web-research, I settled on the Panasonic 35-100mm f2.8 and 20mm f1.7 lenses. They cost, but comparable Leica lenses would go far towards financing a Lexus. The shots I've gotten are very, very nice.<br /><br />The iauto mode gives fast photos and good-looking jpegs, but it seems to push the ISO way up. I do RAWS, and the images are too grainy; I tend to shoot in P mode, limit my ISO, and focus manually. Again, I enjoy my images greatly. There is a learning curve, but it's nothing like as long as it took to get up to speed on a rangefinder.<br /><br />I am very glad I bought this; it does what I had hoped it does. And I still won't be selling my rangefinder any time soon.","This is really an E-M5 Mk II in a different costume. Slightly higher resolution, but identical in size and shape. The controls have been shuffled, with the E-M5 coming out slightly ahead, though the dedicated exposure override dial is nice. But there's no reason to pick the PEN except that you like its looks.<br /><br />I do like its looks, though the styling owes more to the Leica/Contax/Canon axis than to the original Olympus Pens. But the size is a little disappointing. It looks like it should be much smaller, not the same size as the E-M5.<br /><br />I can't make a practical argument for owning this camera, but with a nice little lens like the 17mm f/2.8, it is fun to use and looks great.","It seems every review of this camera has to imply that because it's nice looking, there's not much else to like.  Well, sorry that the Pen looks a bit like a Leica rangefinder, but it produces excellent images and its really fun to use!  So yes, its true, the Pen F and Fujis don't look like Lego and that's good, but a bit beside the point.<br /><br />First, don't buy this camera just because it looks like a camera and not a giant lens with a tiny box behind it.  If your main concern is being stylish, I would avoid all m4/3 cameras because you have to work a bit to get the best out of them, whereas an APS camera can be used as a point and shoot, and the sensor is large enough to ensure you'll get great results even with everything set to auto.<br /><br />Second, don't buy this camera becase it has a 20mp sensor.  By all accounts, the 16mp sensor in the other Pens performs about the same.  Probably a limitation of the of sensor size.<br /><br />Finally, don't buy this camera if you're not prepared to spend a bit on the better Olympus, Panasonic and Voightlander lenses.  Obviously, any camera will benefit from good lenses but the m43 format is small and to get amazing results from an m43 camera, you'll need amazing lenses.  Forntunately, there are quite a few.<br /><br />So, other than looks, are there any reasons to buy a Pen F?<br /><br />(1) Starts out smaller/lighter than Fuji/Sony/Canon and the advantage grows as you add more lenses<br />(2) In-body image stabilization so any lens you put on the Pen is automatically stabilized<br />(3) Lots of lenses from different manufacturers.  Right now, I using a 7-14 Panasonic which, on a full fame camera would be a stabilized 14-28 that fits in the palm of your hand.<br />(4) Excellent viewfinder.  Not as good as a true optical viewfinder but for that you'll need to go to the much larger Fuji X-Pro.<br />(5) Extremely customizable.  Not only can you do things like change the contrast curve, color balance and even individual colors, you see the results as you adjust and can save them to custom banks.<br />(6) Completely silent modes.  There are several silent and/or anti-shock modes.  Not my area of expertise but this could probably be used on a movie set or similar.<br />(7) 50mp/80mp high res mode.  Of little use for most, but with an absolutely still subject, darn, this is impressive.  Camera generates a 80mp raw file from a series of exposures.  Not in a league with a medium format camera, but but several pounds lighter and many thousands of dollars cheaper.<br />(8) A favorite of mine, horizonal/vertical levels visible in viewfinder and LCD, if desired.<br />(9) Long battery life (just kidding).  Between the electronic viewfinder, LCD and image stabilzation, battery life is at best, on a par with most current electronic marvels.  But carrying a spare battery is never a bad idea.<br />(10) Separate flash.  I suppose there wasn't room for it, but just as well.  Instead of messing with a tiny built-in flash, trying to make it tilt until you hear a snapping sound, the Pen has a small, stand-alone flash.  Like the spare battery, you'll have to carry the flash separately but the camera is already lighter and smaller than the alternatives.<br /><br />That's my summary.  I'm still learning the features and as with Fuji and Sony, there are too many.  But when I find what works best, I save it to a custom bank so I don't have to carry the manual with me.  I'm not giving up my full frame Nikon and Canon cameras, but now I have an outfit that's significantly smaller and gives great results.<br /><br />One other thing; DP Review rightly points out that the Pen feels front-heavy if used with one of the larger lenses.  That's true, and it's because the Pen needs a handgrip.  Olympus makes one, and I wouldn't be suprised to see it thrown in as a promotion at some point.  I prefer the grip made by Really Right Stuff.  It weighs just 3 ounces and not only does it solve the balance problem, it gives you something to hold on to even when you're using a tiny, prime lens.","I have had many micro four thirds cameras from a Panasonic GX7, Olympus EM-1, and E-PL7 and this one is by far my favorite of the bunch.  The articulating screen is nice to turn it around and protect the screen while in bag or even just to leave like that to force me to use the nice viewfinder.  I also really like the ability to switch to black and white with the turn of the knob on the front of the camera.  Overall this camera is just well thought out and makes it easier to switch modes without really thinking too much or fumbling through menus.","I learned to shoot on Canon AE-1 Program film camera, by then already long obsolete. I've had a DSLR (Nikon D70) as well as a couple \"prosumer\" compact cameras such as the Canon G9, and they're great--but I never had quite the same experience as I did with the AE-1. The PEN-F, though, comes remarkably close. In silver, it even *looks* remarkably close, although it's smaller and lighter.<br /><br />Let's be honest: you're paying for the experience with the PEN-F. There are other cameras, including by Olympus, which offer similar functionality and performance for several hundred dollars less. But what you won't get from them is the feel of using...well, using a camera like the PEN-F. Everything about it is solid and satisfying. It turns out it's still nice to have all those fiddly switches and knobs and buttons; not only is it easy to use this camera without the touch screen, it often feels like it's the \"right\" way to use the camera. (Which isn't to say that the touch screen isn't both useful and lovely.)<br /><br />I haven't used it very much, yet, and so far I only have one lens (the Panasonic Lumix G 20mm F/1.7 II); I'm kind of re-learning photography with it. But I'm having fun with it in a way that I haven't had fun with a camera in years. \"Fun\" may not be sufficient reason for you to spend this much on a camera, of course, but just as the best camera is the one you have with you, the best camera to buy is the one that you want to *take* with you. I want to take this one with me.","I am blown away by this camera. I have been shooting with DX and full-frame Nikon. I have also shot with cropped censored Leica's and full frame Leica's. I sold all of my Nikon gear, which included a full frame d610, 85mm f1.4, 20mm f1.8 70-300 VRii and an SB 910 Flash. I have had the pen f for several months now and have not regretted my decision. In many ways I prefer the color profile and sharpness to my full-frame Nikon. I primarily do Landscapes and portraits and have found that the four thirds sensor is more than adequate for my needs. I also find myself taking more pictures than I normally would do to the portability of the pen f. I am also able to mount my Leica glass and Nikon glass via third party mounts. Love the versatility. And it's one of the coolest looking cameras on the market currently.","This is a great camera.","I have been using the Pen E-P5 camera body now for about 2 years and decided to try the Pen-F based on two things-the higher megapixels and the “high resolution” 40 MP mode.  My review primarily is based on these two things and whether it is worth upgrading from other Olympus mirrorless models to the Pen-F for them.<br /><br />Design<br />The overall dimensions of the Pen-F are almost identical to the Pen E-P5 with the exception being that the Pen-F is a bit thicker due to the viewfinder. The Pen-F weighs around .2 ounces more than the E-P5 so no real difference there either.  I hate the change of LCD screens on the Pen-F.  With the E-P5 if you want to tilt the screen all you have to do is tilt it easily with one finger.  With the Pen-F you have to first fumble around trying to find a place to grab the screen (easier said than done) then extend the screen out to the side in order to tilt it.  In my usage this amounted to a couple seconds wasted every time I wanted to take a picture.  If you are taking photos of wildlife or something that may run away in one or two seconds this could lead to a lot of missed opportunities.  The viewfinder to me is a useless feature because the majority of photos I take are in daylight while wearing sunglasses and I have to use the LCD screen.<br /><br />Image quality<br />I took many photos of wildlife and landscapes using both cameras in daylight and at night with the FL-600R flash attached.  Overall I noticed no difference in image quality comparing the Pen E-P5 16 MP images to the Pen-F 20 MP images.  There is no reason to upgrade just for the 20 MP images, it is not an improvement.<br /><br />High resolution mode<br />The 40 MP high resolution mode is the thing I was most excited about from reading the Pen-F specs and hoped it would take away the need to stack photos when shooting landscape scenes.  The photos taken in the high resolution mode are best compared to taking a photo with a 1+ second shutter speed at night.  Anything that moves causes the shot to be blurry and useless.  When taking landscape photos with the camera mounted on a tripod and no wind whatsoever I found that there would still be a blade of grass or leaf moving and this would ruin the shot.  If a bird flies by, if one grain of sand moves, if one leaf blows in the wind you can just forget about keeping that photo when taken in the high resolution mode.  Any area with movement is not just blurry there is this digitized looking mess in the photo that has to be seen to understand how ridiculously bad it looks.  I have never taken photos of a landscape where there was absolutely no movement and found that this high resolution mode is completely worthless for landscape photography contrary to other reviews I had read online.  If you are considering buying this camera for the high resolution mode take into consideration what you intend to photograph with it because if your intended usage is outdoors you can forget about using this mode.  The only situation where the high resolution mode would be useful is photographing something indoors with ample light in absolute stillness, where you probably don’t need 40 MP anyways.  On paper this seemed like a great feature but in reality it is an absolute disappointment.<br /><br />Overall<br />I returned this camera because the high resolution mode was horrible and there was no noticeable improvement in image quality from my Pen E-P5 camera body.  If you are new to Olympus mirrorless cameras this might be a camera to consider but you would be better off buying one of the older models for much less money.","Here is a link to a good review of the Olympus Pen F. If you hanker for a digital version of the old Leica 111F or 111G this comes close.[...]<br /><br />I bought and reviewed several cameras before settling on this one. I looked at the Panasonic LUMIX G8X and the Olympus OMD Mark5-2. Both nice cameras with great features but was seduced by the Pen F's homage to the rangefinders of the 50's.<br /><br />I won't add too much to Steve's review other than to say that this is not a point and shoot camera but a serious machine that takes advantage of technology so that rather than spending time in the darkroom there's a lot you can do right in the camera before the shutter is pressed. The ability to adjust highlights, shadows and mid tones right at eye level is amazing. Same thing for exposure compensation. HDR is an amazing feature: When the range of tones exceeds the camera's ability to capture you shoot in HDR mode which takes many shots at once of the same scene with varying exposure levels so one captures the detail in highlights and others detail in shadows and the camera stitches the composite together as one picture. Ansel Adams would have loved this feature alone. They give you the Zone system without you having to worry about exposure or a trip to the darkroom. I'm very excited about this toy and just purchased the 12mm F2 Olympus lens on eBay which in 4/3 lingo is equivalent to 24mm in 35mm format. Quality is super right on up to 11x14 and I usually limit my prints to 8x10 anyway. Never got in to big prints. The feature that Steve gets so excited about is the real deal: they have special modes that simulate TRI x and Kodachrome film. TriX mode 2 is uncannily like the silver neg and print. Other neat features are level bubbles in both axis' in the viewfinder if you choose and a key stoning feature where the camera will correct diverging vertices or horizontals which is useful for architectural shots. Menus are extensive and a bit daunting; it may take a few days to understand them all. I was a former Leica enthusiast and this camera comes closest to my old love in handling.<br /><br />This is an update after learning more about the camera: While the menus, particularly the advanced custom menus remain daunting, I've learned to love the Super Control Menu which allows the user to change stuff on the fly. It even works viewing in the viewfinder if the outdoor lighting is preventing good vision on the rear monitor. However every once in a while I forget how to set up something that is not frequently used, like Panorama mode. I took me two days to figure out how to do this and there were at least three separate menu selections to achieve this. Now of course it's forever ensconced in C4 custom mode and I shouldn't ever need to go through this again unless the cameras computer chip needs to be rebooted. Still, come on Olympus? Some one needs to write a decent manual for this otherwise gem of a camera.<br /><br />Sent from my iPad","Outstanding picture qualities .  Menu functions are well laid out. Olympus kit includes an external flash. A stunner!!<br />Movable rear viewing screen enhances video mode","Absolutely love this camera. The photos are coming out great. Sold all my Canon stuff and bought this along with an Olympus 25mm lens and I'm very happy about almost everything, especially the small size which makes it easy to travel with. It's all around a really fun camera to use.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Fantastic image quality<br />-Small<br />-Slow motion video is great<br />-Silent mode<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Not the best in low light<br />-Menu system is really confusing<br />-A grip on the front would be useful<br />-No microphone jack for video","Best ever. My new go to","GREAT RETRO LOOK AND FEATURES, NICE AND HEAVY, GREAT ART FILTERS, ANOTHER WINNER FROM OLYMPUS","Beautifully designed camera with excellent functionality and great image quality.<br />I have the E-M1 also but this little Jewell is my favorite. The 20MP image sensor creates excellent images and in the Hi Rez mode it creates 80MP image on tripod of non moving subject (Landscape with no wind)<br />All in all this is my favorite camera.","I go way back to the days of 8x10 B&W photography but have made the transition (to the extent my budget allows) to digital. I've gotten to the point where I can do a hi-res scan of my old negatives and end up with prints that are (at least to me) indistinguishable from the ones I made the old fashioned way (in a darkroom). Since I could not afford a medium format digital camera while still affording a car or home, I've been gradually upgrading the digital cameras I could afford as pixel counts increased over the years. And I should mention that I no longer feel the need to print really large images (good thing considering the cost of really large format printers...) which no doubt colors my views. But with this camera, at 20+ megapixels, I believe I'm at the point where the pixel count is sufficient to do what I want to do. Very extensive enlargements on the screen hold up very well. Image quality including sharpness is really good even with the relatively inexpensive line of zoom lenses usually sold with this camera. (But then I've made some of my favorite images with large format lenses made in the 1950's and 1960's.) The body itself provides an excellent interface for manual use, with a simple knob on the front and a similarly located one on the back to control f stop and speed respectively. The fold-our and rotatable LCD screen is really excellent when, for example, you have the camera high on a tripod, on a slope where it would be difficult to see the LCD. You can fold out the LCD and then tilt it downward, so that you can see it well even when the camera is well above eye level. Overall I find this a really excellent body. And I have never understood why any manufacturer would bother with a flapping mirror in a digital camera -- this sort of \"rangefinder\" design really makes much more sense than an SLR design. So I'm a big fan, now that I've used it enough to have an opinion.","Feels solid, beautiful design. Image quality is pretty good.","LOVE THIS THING. I was so tired of lugging around my Canon and the associated accessories I jumped at this small new mirrorless camera. I'm an old OM-1 user and chose this for its size and retro styling. I will admit it is so loaded with settings and features that I will probably use only 10% of them. I love being able to shoot photos without attracting attention to myself or my equipment. Just drop in my pocket and I'm off.","I love this camera! Coming from the OMD EM5, the form factor of this camera is perfect for me. Compact, ultra fast focus, fantastic IQ. Long lenses aren't a problem. The 5 axis stabilization really works well. Highly recommended!<br /><br />[...]","Love this camera! There are so many features, plan on spending some time figuring them all out, but once you tame it, you're in for some fun times.","This is a beautifully designed, solidly build camera. I purchased both the 25mm prime and 12-40mm Pro zoom. My intention was to use the Pen F mainly with the 25mm lens, but the Pro zoom is a superb lens and the one I preferred. Despite the zoom's size, I used the camera almost exclusively with the zoom. For me, the zoom flexibility outweighed the significant advantages of the 25mm prime's size/weight and portability. It's a personal decision, but I regret thinking I could look past the obvious constraint of fixed focal length to achieve portability. Don't be swayed by what others choose - decide what you need and what you prefer before going with the diminutive but very good 25mm. The zoom is a capable, beautifully constructed lens.<br /><br />The auto focus is fast and so far as I could tell, accurate. Exposure was perfect. The auto focus mechanism made enough sound as to be distracting to me, though.<br /><br />The included flash was versatile and powerful. It's a great tool to have in your bag for the times you need to augment available light. Its tiny size and tilt-head capability adds to its usefulness. It is a wonderful accessory to the camera.<br /><br />The quality of the EVF and LCD was superb. I have no complaints except, for me, flipping the LCD panel out was a fussy operation. The info on the panel was dense in the full-content choice of display options.<br /><br />I did not find the menu system quick and easy to use. To me, a menu should start with the most-used functions and work down a hierarchical tree to the least-changed options. I didn't find the menu system intuitive in this goal of a top-down structure. It's one of two characteristics of the camera that was a deal-killer. I recognize a menu system is highly subjective, and you may not be bothered at all, but I found it distracting and frustrating.<br /><br />The image quality was excellent, but not better than that of my Sony RX10. I purchased the camera both for its appealing design and portability, but also was seeking improvement in IQ over the RX10's 1-inch 20MP sensor. Shooting the same scene with both camera sequentially, I could not detect any difference in IQ. This surprised me, because a MFT sensor is substantially larger, and the price of the Olympus 12-40 Pro zoom approached the cost of the complete RX10 camera - which features a 24-200mm (35mm equiv.) F2.8 lens.<br /><br />Battery life was excellent, equally as good as my RX10. Handling was better with the Olympus, but both cameras have a control disk that's too-easily moved by my thumb joint. For all the great ergonomics of the Pen F, that control disk and menu system detract from it's intelligent design. The disc is too-easily depressed.<br /><br />A fully discharged battery takes about three hours to fully recharge, about the same as my RX10.<br /><br />I was disappointed to find that wi-fi connectivity did not include connectivity to my network, only to my iPhone. So, downloading images to my PC required a direct connection. Download time was adequate, but not outstanding, at a rate of about 7 MB/sec sustained. The included software for image management was good, about the same in features and usability as Sony's mediocre PlayMemories app.<br /><br />If I did not already own the RX10 I would have kept the camera, but given that the menu system was a disappointment and IQ didn't beat the RX10, I decided to return it and wait until I can afford a full-frame camera. I don't want to go to a system with larger, heavier lenses, but it probably will take a full-frame sensor to achieve a noticeable improvement in IQ.<br /><br />Please include the Pen F in your consideration of a high-quality mirrorless camera. Its design and build quality are very impressive (subjective) and the lens system is superb. Camera and zoom lens together are expensive, though.","The perfect fit for spontaneous artistic snaps and street photography + a great blend of customizable controls right at your fingertips. The layout and design are thoughtful and rock-solid. Unquestionably the best street camera I've ever used (and I'm gray enough to have used the original Pen-F if that says anything). A lot of manufactures have created cameras mimicking the body styles of this era, but with shortcomings in functionality or image quality. Not this one. This little gem is the real deal. Paired with any of the holy trinity of micro 4/3 and it sings.","It is indeed a sexy camera and probably the most beautiful one on earth. Buy it! You will love it!!","What a great camera... with the 17mm f1.8 lens it's killer.  The b/w filters are a great addition...  Olympus has outdone themselves with this beauty. I plan on keeping this for quite sometime.","I simply love this camera! I actually sold a Canon 5D MKii for this as this format suits my needs better these days. The image quality is excellent and I love all the available features in such a small package. The custom color function feature is a tad silly, but the Monochrome settings look exactly like a Black & White image should. These look great straight out of the camera and need no correction, IMHO. Sure it's pricey but you lose nothing when it comes to complete creative control.","This is an upgrade to my E-M5, and it is well worth it. The left side EVF is perfectly placed to keep my nose out of the LCD, the colors are great and the sharpness and detail are great. I use the PEN F as my casual walk-around/family rig with the Oly PRO lenses and it is so much easier to get really nice shots without carrying around my 5DII and L glass.<br /><br />I didn't expect the IQ to compete with FF cameras, but it's not far behind and it's very easy to use. Can't wait for the RAW update for Lightroom so I can see how the RAW files look.<br /><br />Highly recommended despite the complaints about the lack of weather sealing, and the lack of customizability of the front jpeg art dial (a petty complaint in my book–really just makes it more likely for RAW shoots to try out the jpeg filters).<br /><br />Enjoy!","I recently was able to get one of the first available Pen Fs from Amazon, and this review is based on first impressions after using it for about two weeks. Let’s get looks out of the way first--It looks great and is wonderfully refined compared to previous Pens. The overall build quality and functionality are excellent, the image quality is great, although—as others are noting—the new 20 meg sensor does not appear to be a deal breaker. Judging from the other early reviews, however, the camera it is being experienced with both enthusiasm and some hesitation. This is probably because the bar is being raised by so many fine alternatives and technological innovations among other mirrorless cameras. There are now many other choices within micro-four thirds (M43), as well as a number of very good mirrorless APS-C and full frame cameras, including some with image stabilization. So, where does the Pen F sit among the growing field of choices both within M43 and among the alternatives? That’s too big of a question for this review, but it is worth remembering that, unless you are going to stay with only a kit lens and a prime or two, you are buying into a system.  The original appeal of M43 was not only the smaller size of its cameras (which is now being matched by some with larger formats) but also the smaller size of its lenses—I’ll come back to that later. So, if you are contemplating moving to mirrorless APS-C or full frame models, the lenses are typically larger and heavier, and so far, only the newer Sony A7 series (A7 ii, A7r ii, and A7s ii) has five-axis in-body stabilization. The very appealing Fuji Xs and Sony A6000s still don’t.<br /><br />So, where does the new Pen F sit within M43? The Pen F truly is the “ultimate” Pen thus far. So, I will first evaluate it as a Pen. I’ve owned several. Thus, I find the new Pen F to be a welcome replacement for the aging Pen EP5, particularly given the Pen F’s new integrated EVF, bigger sensor, and better dials--with the exception of the Pen F’s new Art dial--which is more of a curiosity. For most shooting conditions the older Pen EP5 still produces results nearly on par with newer the OMDs. It had the first five-axis image stabilization, although with some minor noise issues. What I found clunky about the EP5, however, was having to add the expensive, large (but excellent) external EVF 4. The grip was also minimal since it seemed to be intended more for street shooting--mine came with the 17mm F1.8, which was a nicely balanced match. When the larger OMD EM1 came out, it integrated the same quality EVF, fixed the stabilizer noise and had the feel of a more robust body to which you could more comfortably attach the new larger f2.8 pro zooms. Although you can attach them to Pens (or even the tiny Panasonic GM5), the smaller primes and pancake lenses are a more balanced match for the Pens.<br /><br />This is also my feeling about the Pen F. It is a natural for street and light weight travel shooting and best matched to smaller primes or pancake lenses. I’ve used it with the Olympus 45 mm f1.8, the 17 mm f1.8, the 12 mm f2.0 and the Panasonic-Leica 15 f1.7, and Panasonic 20 mm f1.7, as well as the Oly 14-42mm EZ pancake. All are well matched and perform well. Although you can put the larger pro lenses on the Pen F, when I do, I feel the need for the optional external grip. I’ve got the ECG-4 external grip, and find it well made with better battery access, but the grip swings wide to the right, apparently to avoid cramping your hand into the retro front dial. More problematic is the need to carry an allen wrench to remove it. So, although I can pair the Pen F with the f 2.8 pro larger lenses, it seems to defeat appeal of carrying the small, stylish Pen. The larger OMD EM1 or Panasonic GHs are better matched for the larger lenses.<br /><br />Performance: Overall, I am pleased with the image quality of the new sensor. For how I typically shoot, I have not found any problems with the AF, as some are noting. I have tried to match shots of the Pen F against my OMD EM5 Mark II using the Oly 45mm f1.8 and 17mm 1.8, and I don’t find much of a difference in the results.<br /><br />Craftsmanship and functionality: The Pen F is beautifully made with excellent dials and no visible screws. The design is excellent. The retro front dial is dedicated to art filters and monochrome modes. The monochrome modes allow interesting possibilities. There are now more variations on for the previous art filters--too many for me. The addition is the exposure dial is most welcome. It would be nice to also see shutter speed and ISO in future models. The EVF has a smaller field of view than the EM5 II, but is still very good.<br /><br />Value: The initial list price of the Pen F does seem a bit steep considering that the body is not weather resistant. At its reduced price, the OMD EM5 Mark II seems like the nearest Oly competitor for the Pen F--it is now several hundred cheaper. It also is a very versatile camera with its optional grip as I noted in my review of the camera.  At about the same list price the Panasonic GX8 is weather resistant, has better video, but the image stabilization is not as advanced. The AF, however, is spot on fast.<br /><br />Overall, I like street shooting with Pens, using them at museums, or while traveling. For those purposes the Pen F is the penultimate Pen, and as a Pen, I give it five stars. Nevertheless, as an all-purposed camera, there are other options in the growing M43 field of choices. If you contemplating moving into mirrorless cameras, and are weighing M43 versus larger mirrorless formats, remember that you are buying into a system, so consider the size, weight, and price of the lenses as well as sensor size and quality before making your leap.","This is an absolutely gorgeous camera and its beauty is more than skin deep.Some have questioned the impact of the only modest increase of pixels to 20 mp from the 16 mp on the previous cameras. I also own an OMD-EM1 and have compared crops from both cameras on a red brick wall across the street from my house using the Olympus 17mm f1.8 lens hand held at an aperture of f1.8. From a 10x crop, the Pen f renders a sharper image than the EM1. So from my vantage point, the increase to 20mp is a definite advantage. I purchased the camera with the accessory grip, which is also quite well made and beautiful in itself. It definitely improves hand holding of the camera, but confers a real disadvantage. The SD card is a bit difficult to remove from the camera without the grip. With the grip, it is almost impossible. One must really push the top of the card hard to give the spring release as much recoil as possible to pop the card up as far as possible. Then it is a teasing effort with fingers on the edges of the card to finally get the card out. This is definitely a defect, which I am surprised that Olympus has allowed to occur. A redesign is definitely necessary. Apart from this, I love the camera and still give it 5 stars.","I tried the Pen-F against the Fujifilm X-T1 and the Olympus E-M5 Mark II, using the Olympus 12-40 f2.8 zoom, and the 25mm f2 lenses on the two  Olympus products and similar lenses on the X-T1. At first glance, the Pen F produced the most pleasing results; as a street shooter it produced really nice shots with the least effort. Then, some design weaknesses began to show. It was the only one of the 3 that wasn't weather resistant; and for street and travel shooting that gave me second thoughts. Also, the viewfinder position on the far left of the camera body made it hard to shoot with lwdr-eyed shooters like me; I had to permanently disable the touch-focus control, or hide the LCD, or continually shift the focus with my nose touching the screen. Also, I had to screen the viewfinder with my left hand since a large eye-shade wasn't available such as I have for the other two cameras. It was the only one of the three cameras that did not have a molded hand grip for my right hand. This made one-hand shooting with the 12-40mm zoom, or any other fairly heavy lens, impossible for me.<br /><br /> Also, when I took similar indoor photos of my new golden retriever puppy with all 3 cameras, in the same location and with the same poor lighting conditions, and then judged the results \"blind\" without knowing which camera was used for each shot, I clearly preferred the three-dimensionality and imaging of the one produced by the Fuji X-T1 sensor. However, the 20 meg Pen-F sensor was clearly sharper (no pun intended) than the EM-5-II sensor; and the inclusion of the exposure compensation dial on the Pen-F was also a welcome addition since the EM-5-II doesn't have one. However, the Fuji has the largest sensor of the three cameras and it also has an exposure compensation dial; but it doesn't  have the digital teleconverter doubling feature that all the Olympus cameras have that I dearly love.<br /><br />Since I write camera and travel books for a living and I need to replenish my camera fund kitty, I had resolved to either return the Pen F that I had just purchased, or sell of some of my other equipment. I really wanted to keep the Pen F, since the original half-frame Pen F was one of my favorite cameras when I was a \"semi-pro\" using cameras to work my way through collage. Also, the original appeal of the camera, based on my first 20 shots, was overwhelming. Then, common sense took over.  I frequently shoot in hostile weather conditions -- including in the last few years Siberia, Iceland, Patagonia, Brazil, Alaska and New Zealand. I've come to take it for granted that my cameras can survive bad weather. Also, I live in Southern California and spend a lot of time in bright sunlight where an oversize eye shade and resistance from ocean spray is a necessity. Therefore I've decided to return the Pen F and wait until Olympus comes out with a weather-proof model with the 20-meg sensor. If it can have the Pen form factor without the front dial (the only legacy camera I remember that had that kind of a dial was the Argus C-3 which was one of the ugliest cameras ever sold), so much the better!","I have owned several Olympus cameras, and my favorite is the OM-D EM-1, which was my \"go to\" camera for outdoor adventures, wildlife shots, and landscape photography.  But I was looking to get a smaller system, combined with some nice small Olympus prime lenses, and trying to decide on the EM5ii or the EM10.  Then the Pen F came out.<br /><br />I'm not a fanboy of retro camera looks. (I actually dislike the retro font and styling of this camera.)  And this camera is seriously overpriced right now.  (Hopefully, it will drop a bit in a few months.)  Nevertheless, this is a pretty good little camera.  Some good things, some not so good.<br /><br />Here's my take:<br /><br />I find the ergonomics to be okay, and it's fun to shoot.  I don't feel I need the extra grip, at least with lightweight prime lenses.  I don't bother using larger Pro zooms on this yet.<br /><br />The fit and finish are pretty nice, but the camera isn't nearly as solid feeling as the OMD.  And I really wish the various control knobs were more consistent with each other.  One is quite stiff, while another gives way too easily.  In fact, the main knob, with the shutter release, seems flimsy and feels like it might fall off someday.  Maybe I got a bad copy, though?<br /><br />The IBIS is excellent.  Definitely better than the EM1.  And that's nice.  Olympus does this well.<br /><br />The IQ is good for a MFT camera, with decent noise control, including nice usable images up to 3200 ISO. The best I've seen in this format (MFT) and rivals APS-C cameras I've used in the past.  (But the new Fuji X and Sony 6300 cameras could be much better.)<br /><br />Focusing (SAF) is fast, and accurate, as always, even in low light.  I rarely use CAF, so I haven't tested that yet.  But I hear that it's not so good.<br /><br />The extra bump in resolution is nice too, but not a game changer.<br /><br />The EVF is good.  Just like the EM10.  Nothing extraordinary, but solid.<br /><br />The LCD flip screen is okay.  But I would have preferred a tilt screen instead of a flip one.<br /><br />I also like that this camera and my EM1 share the same batteries.  The EM10 does not, which is a pain.<br /><br />The lack of weather sealing is a problem, though. For this price, that's kind of crazy.<br /><br />Overall, I want to like this new camera, but I ended up returning it.  Maybe I got a bad copy, but the knobs were pretty shabby, and the overall ergonomics weren't that great.  Plus, it's really expensive for what you get, especially compared to the Sony A6000.  And no weather sealing.<br /><br />Overall, I think this camera out retro styling ahead of important features, like weather sealing, and then they jacked up the price.  For $750, this would be a good camera deal, but for $1200? You might want to look at Sony a6000s instead.  Or a Fuji.<br /><br />Some reviewers love the retro looks and have probably been too quick to love this camera.  I'm not a retro fanboy, and could care less about that.  In fact, I kind of find the retro-styling a little annoying.  But it's a pretty good little camera anyway, and a solid (although incremental) step up from previous Olympus MFT cameras.  But it's not perfect, and is way too pricey for what you get, and I found myself liking it less over time, and ultimately returned it.","Just got my Pen-F from Amazon two days ago. I currently have an e-M5 Mk II and previously had an e-M10, epl5 and epl3. I really like the M4/3 format and am partial to the Olympus line.

The reasons I wanted this model were:<br /><br />5 axis stabilization<br />20 megapixel sensor<br />Built in viewfinder on a Pen style body<br />Design!<br /><br />I love the design. It is a pleasure to hold and look at. As corny as it sounds, for an older fellow that was shooting pics since the early 70's, it evokes a pleasant memory of functional and stylish rangefinders that were so pleasant to use. Very solid materials and build quality. It is basically a beefed up eM5 Mk ii in a beautifully executed rangefinder design with a really great hi res OLED viewfinder.<br /><br />If you want a technical review, there are a lot of well written detailed reviews out there. Technically I knew what I was getting since I have been an Olympus Micro 4/3 user for quite a while. I was not sure if hands on experience would match the hype, and for me it has.<br /><br />Since design and aesthetics are so personal, not everyone will be wowed by the cost of ownership. Count me among those that sees this camera as a sight for sore eyes.","Warning! This is the crack cocaine of camera hardware. Once you see this kit, hold it, and shoot with it, you won’t ever want to give it up.  (“We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious.”)<br /><br />The PEN-F is a literal throwback to the style, handling, and controls of the old mid-century half-frame Olympus rangefinder. The body is drop-dead gorgeous. It feels like a professional tool, not a plastic consumer-oriented digital imaging gadget. The textures are first class. The controls are right where you want them to be. There is a dedicated exposure compensation dial. The back controls are well laid out and easy to work.<br /><br />IT HAS A BUILT-IN ELECTRONIC VIEWFINDER! The is the major thing missing from previous PEN designs, and it has been incorporated without adding to the size or weight of the body. In addition, the touch screen is fully articulated now.<br /><br />Rangefinder designs have always been a street-shooter’s dream machine, and the PEN-F makes you want to go out and shoot pictures.<br /><br />Now, before I hyperventilate over this camera, let’s come back to earth and talk about specs and performance.<br /><br />The Good:<br /> * This is the first Olympus to go beyond 16 mp and use a new 20 mp processor. This definitely crisps up details and comes in handy when you want big art on the walls.<br /> * Handling is great - this is designed for the photographer who avoids automatic modes and wants full control at her fingertips.<br /> * You can adjust exposure by modifying the light curves, instead of aperture/shutter speed / ISO.<br /> * There is a dedicated dial on the front for selecting color and B&W profiles. These are kind of like art modes, but are designed to work more like selecting a specific film emulsion. This instantly gives you the look of films like Tri-X, Ilford Pan, Fuji Velvia, Kodachrome, and Ektachrome.<br /> * Single frame focusing is fast and responsive.<br /> * The five point image stabilization is the best available, and will allow you to hand hold shots that would otherwise require a tripod.<br /><br />However, consider this:<br /> * Both the light curve adjustment and profile selection only work on JPGs, not RAW files (as you would expect). If you mostly shoot JPG, then this is great. If you primarily shoot RAW, then those features don’t add anything you can’t already do in post-processing.<br /> * Continuous focusing is poor. This is something of a step backwards for Olympus. This has always been something of a problem, but the OM-D E-M5 Mark II has much better continuous focus. No sure what happened here - but if sports shooting is your gig, then you will need to look elsewhere.<br /> * No weather sealing like the E-M5 and E-M1.<br /> * Video is… just OK. This is an Olympus Achilles heel and I don’t know why they still aren’t improving in the area.<br /><br />Bottom line - your right brain is going  gaga over this camera. You won’t be able to put it down. You will look so cool out and about shooting with it. But try to pull it together long enough to give your left brain a chance to weigh in. If you need good video, weather sealing, or continuous autofocus, the similarly priced Panasonic GX8 delivers the goods in a sleek, modern (but not nearly as sexy) package.","Very good camera."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX85 (Lumix DMC-GX80 / Lumix DMC-GX7 Mark II)","amazon_reviews":["Excellent camera.<br />Very sharp IQ and very fast AF.<br />Handles well, feels expensive.<br />Kit lens is quite decent.<br />No Macro mode option that you can choose, and Pinpoint focus is not available in IA or IA+.<br />If you love Macro shooting, then get the Olympus 30mm Macro lens.....its excellent.<br />IQ is  better then all the Olympus Pen  4/3s, tho i have not tried the Pen F.

All in all a great product","The gx85 is a fine, compact camera for both stills and videos, but it does have some drawbacks, all of which I believe are intentional by Panasonic. Let me briefly point them out:<br />1) The electronic viewfinder is lousy. As someone who does all of my composing through the EVF, I can tell you that while the final image is sharp, the view through the EVF is not. In fact, I spent an inordinate amount of time fiddling with the diopter to try to improve the viewfinder image. Some have said that this is the same EVF as in the G7. I own the G7, and the EVF in the G7 is light years better.<br />2) There is no jack for an external mic. In my view, this was done so as not to cannibalize the g7, gx8, and gh4. The idea of building a camera that sets new standards for video, with 5 axis  image stabilization, and then to omit an external mic option, is bizarre, unless you realize that Panny doesn't want to destroy the market for its higher end cameras. Our loss.<br />3) It has no fully articulating screen. With the recent upsurge in vlogging activity, why any company would build a camera without a selfie screen makes no sense--unless they're once again deferring to the higher end models, which DO have a fully articulating screens.<br />The gx85 is a nifty little camera, with great image quality. And it is definitely sexier than its older cousin, the g7. However, if I were going on an extended trip and could only take one camera, it would be the g7. While bigger than the gx85, the g7 is actually lighter, with a feature set that produces both excellent video AND audio. Just some food for thought.","Everything I could have hoped for and more. The features and specs are amazing. The 5-axis stabilization is killer. I just miss the size of my GF6 and the screen that could flip 180 degrees.

The photo quality, ease of handling and features were awesome. I had the GX-7 about 3 years and was always impressed.<br /><br />When the GX-85 was released I was a little reluctant to sell my GX-7 but with the 5 axis stabilization, post-focus and 4K burst it truly sounded like they took the best of the GX-7 and made it better.

I have owned an E-M5ii for many months and just purchased the GX85 only one week ago.  This will not be a pixel peeper review or anything scientific.  This article is the perspective of a photography enthusiast that truly appreciates small compact system cameras like those from Olympus and Panasonic.  This article reflects my opinion.  My opinion is not influenced by any income or any incentive from anyone as I am completely independent from both Olympus and Panasonic.  I am also independent from any camera store or online retailer.<br /><br />I currently own the Olympus OM-D E-M5ii and love the camera.  I use the camera for landscape photography, travel photography, street photography, night photography and the occasional photo of people and events.  But last weekend I experienced an utter failure... either my fault or the cameras.  My son’s college commencement presented a very high contrast scene as he walked across a stage that was 60 yards/meters away from me.  A fleeting moment, his walk would occur over a 5 to 10 second period and I needed to get the shot.  Armed with my E-M5ii and the Olympus m.Zuiko 40-150mm f2.8 pro lens I set the camera to CAF, High Speed frame rate, 2000 ISO, f/4, and a shutter speed of about 1/100th of a second.  I was about .7 stops under exposed.  I cranked out about 20 frames while he walked and only about 15% of the images were sharp enough.  None of the images were truly satisfactory.  I was very dissatisfied with the results.  Keep in mind that a moving subject in low light conditions is probably one of the most difficult auto-focus conditions.<br /><br />The next day I was at my local camera store who was having a big \"CameraFest\" event with vendors and speakers.  I was visiting each booth and entered into a conversation with the Panasonic folks.  I was able to speak with Panasonic Luminary Giulio Sciorio about the issue I had at the graduation.  He introduced me to the Panasonic GX85 and a fairly new feature known as 4k Photo.  The concept is to record any critical event in 4k video and then simply pluck 8MB frames from the 4k stream.  I truly believe this capability could have made a huge difference at the graduation.<br /><br />I had never been interested in the Panasonic bodies for my passion is still photography and the Olympus In-Body-Image-Stabilization (IBIS) has become a must-have feature for me.  It allows me to take 1/2 second exposures without a tripod!  Compelled by 4k Photo, Post Focus and Dual-IS, I bought the camera with the 12-32mm kit lens.<br /><br />I have used the GX85 for about 6days.  That is absolutely not enough time to consider this article a review.  But it is enough time to have some clear and confirmed initial impressions.<br /><br />Ergonomics:<br />Ergonomics are subjective.  I am a larger man with larger but not huge hands.  I find I am able to comfortably hold the EM5ii more easily than the GX85.  The GX85 simply does not have an adequate front grip or thumb grip.  I could add some grip to the GX85 by using a little Sugru (moldable rubber) or I could wait for after-market grips.<br /><br />While the EM5ii has more buttons for easy access to control the camera, all the buttons on top of the EM5ii are more difficult to reach by feel when holding the EVF to my eye than are the back buttons on the GX85.  Back buttons reachable by a thumb are easier for me.<br />And if shooting using the LCD screen rather than the EVF, Panasonic’s touch screen interface is vastly superior to the touch screen interface of the EM5ii.  But when using the EVF it is a little too easy to accidentally touch the GX85 touch screen and unintentionally change the configuration of the camera.<br /><br />I find the EVF located on the left side of the GX85 to be easier for right-eye dominant shooters while the EVF located in the center of the Em5ii is better for left eye dominant shooters.  I am left-eye dominant.<br /><br />The EM5ii’s dial controls are definitely superior to the GX85 and I am a fan of the EM5ii’s toggle switch that changes the function of the front and rear dials.<br />I prefer the tilting LCD of the GX85 over the full articulation of the LCD on the EM5ii.  The tilted screen is more discreet for street shooting than a full articulation.<br /><br />Finally, and contrary to others, I prefer having the battery and SD card in the battery compartment as on the GX85.  It gives me one place to look to see if my camera is ready to go.<br /><br />EVF and LCD:<br />In my short time testing I’ve concluded that the EVF on the EM5ii is superior.  It seems smoother and larger.  But in no way is the GX85 EVF a deal breaker.  It is fine.  The LCDs are nearly identical in size, brightness and view characteristics while testing indoors.  I did not test in bright sunlight.  I would expect both to be miserably bad in bright sunlight.  But the touch screen UI on the GX85 is miles better than the touchscreen UI on the EM5ii.<br /><br />Sensor:<br />Both cameras have 16MP micro-four-thirds sensors.  The GX85 does not have a low-pass filter and therefore should be able render fine details better.  While my limited testing has not yet proved this to be accurate, I suspect it is true.  In all other ways I expect these sensors to operate the same and to have quite similar lower-light capability.<br /><br />Image Stabilization:<br />Is Panasonic Dual-IS better than Olympus EM5ii IBIS.  My testing in lower light conditions shooting stills with shutter speeds of 1/20th to 1/2 second generally showed that the IBIS in the EM5ii is superior.  I have used the EM5ii IBIS extensively and it is amazing.  Out of 20 test shots the Dual-IS appeared sharper about 10% of the time and the EM5ii IBIS appeared sharper about 40% of the time.  Sharpness was essentially the same 50% of the time.  The circumstances where Dual-IS appeared sharper was at longer focal lengths.  This is to be expected as OIS should be superior at longer focal lengths.  But just general low light slow shutter speeds, the EM5ii is my winner.  Please note, this was not a scientific test as I simply reviewed the out of camera JPGs for sharpness according to my eye. I did not keep the images to show to you.<br /><br />Features:<br />Both cameras have amazing features.  I am probably missing some in my comments below but will do my best to give some opinion.<br /><br />First where the  Cameras are Tied:<br />Auto Focus:  Tie.  Only upon further use will I make judgement here.  Both can clearly focus quickly on Single Auto Focus (SAF) and are capable in low light.  But regarding CAF (Continuous Auto Focus) I am very hopeful that the Panasonic Depth from Defocus (DFD) technology will be very capable as I find the EM5ii CAF ineffective when compared to the dSLRs I used before moving to mirrorless.<br />Shutter: Tie.  The GX85 has a new shutter mechanism designed to reduce shutter shock.  Well to my knowledge, the EM5ii doesn’t have shutter shock issues either.  Both have very quiet shutters and can be silent with the electronic shutter option.<br />Focus Bracketing:  .  Both cameras have the ability.  The EM5ii UI is not as intuitive but results in full RAW images.  The GX85 uses its 4K capability for “4K Post Focus” which is super slick but only results in 8MP JPGs per focus point.  Both cameras require post processing to blend the images.<br /><br />Now the GX85 Advantages:<br />4k Photo:  Advantage GX85.  Only the GX85 has this feature and it very useful.  The EM5ii has the ability to shoot stills while shooting HD video but the UI is very clunky.<br />Video Resolution: Advantage GX85.<br />Warranty:  Advantage GX85.  Through March 2017 Panasonic is offering a 3 year warranty on the GX85.  Olympus offers one year.<br />Fill Flash: Advantage GF85.  The GF85 has a built in low Guide number flash.  The Olympus comes with a detachable low Guide number flash.<br />In Camera Panorama:  Advantage GX85.  I cannot believe that the EM5ii doesn’t support in camera panoramas.  It doesn’t.  What could possibly be the logic here.<br /><br />And Advantages for the EM5ii:<br />Live Composite:  Advantage EM5ii.  Both cameras have this ability but the EM5ii does the blending in camera.  With the GX85 blending must be done in post.  This feature is amazing helpful when photographing after dark.<br />Weather Sealing: Advantage EM5ii<br />Bracketing: Advantage EM5ii.  The EM5ii features exposure bracketing, ISO bracketing, White Balance bracketing, Flash bracketing, and Art Filter bracketing.<br />In Camera HDR: Advantage EM5ii.  While both cameras can be configured for in-camera HDR, the UI for the EM5ii is much cleaner.<br /><br />One Camera:<br />I am thankful to be able to own both of these cameras and a bunch of great lens to go with them.  It is really hard to render a conclusion about one camera being a better single camera choice than the other.  But for my still camera photography I'd have to pick the E-M5ii.  The weather sealing, slightly superior image stabilization at low shutter speeds and live composite are very compelling features for me.  (Where the heck is in-camera panorama Olympus?)  Perhaps with more time with the GX85 I will change my conclusion.","I ordered mine today based on DP Review's Conclusions:<br />The GX85 is not the company's flagship, but in many ways it's arguably the most compelling Panasonic release to date. Represents the most effective image stabilization system in any Panasonic camera to date.<br /><br />The anti aliasing filter offers some of the best detail retention of any 16MP Four Thirds sensor around, with little sign of moiré .<br />Extremely responsive. Its touchscreen display offers one of the best touch implementations of any camera I've used. Autofocus performance is also outstanding,<br />Offers similar IS performance during video as the Olympus Pen-F, a class leader.<br />Offers ample video tools like focus peaking, zebra pattern, audio level monitoring/adjustment and a wind filter, and users can shoot video in any of the manual exposure modes.<br />Video quality looks excellent with good detail and color.<br />RAW files are on par with the best 16MP Four Thirds chips, but behind most current APS-C cameras.<br /><br />You get a 4K capable camera that can be used handheld thanks to great image stabilization. You also get an impressive stills camera with good image quality which can shoot fast action with relative ease thanks to its very good autofocus system and burst rate of 6 fps with AF-C. You get a logically designed body with enough custom buttons to satisfy most, a tilting LCD with an excellent touch interface and easy-to-use Wi-Fi connectivity.<br /><br />What you don't get is weather-sealing, microphone or headphone jacks, an external battery charger or the latest generation 20MP Four Thirds sensor.<br /><br />Panasonic LUMIX GX85 4K Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Camera Kit, 12-32mm Lens, 16 Megapixels, Dual Image Stabilization, Electronic Viewfinder, WiFi - Silver","I make my living in photography and video... This is my new favorite camera and here's why. When you carry a camera with you, you take more photos. When you take more photos you improve your craft. When you can easily carry a camera with you it helps keep the passion of photography alive and well even when you also do it for work. This is the easiest camera I have owned in many years to carry with me that also produces images on par with my flagship cameras. I currently own 12 cameras that get used on a regular basis. This is my favorite one. What more can you ask for? Great low light, great resolution, AMAZING video capabilities, built in stabilization that will blow your mind, excellent dynamic range. Then add on crazy features that only Lumix can pull off like post focus and 4K photos...  Stop hesitating, this is the camera you've been looking for.","Let's start by talking about 4K. The GX85 shoots 4K at 100 Mb/s, the as GH4. The GX85 will shoot 4K as long as your battery and storage allow. For me, my 64GB filled up after 1 hr 29 min, but hey, the camera filled that card up, no questions asked (battery held up, almost). If you want to shoot video in 1080P or lower, shoot in AVCHD and you will have unlimited recording time. You can officially retire that camcorder for good.<br /><br />In my opinion, this camera is better than the GH4 for video. Even though the GH4 has more bitrates for 720P/1080P and some flat profiles, the fact is that the GX85 and GH4 have identical best image quality, but your handheld footage on the GX85 will look much better than on the GH4 because of its excellent IBIS. After repeated claims that IBIS is impossible in 4K because of overheating, two years later, Panasonic somehow combine IBIS and 4K in a tiny body that can continuously shoot an hour and a half without any signs of overheating. Heh. Good one, Panasonic.<br /><br />If you want to bypass internal codecs, you're in luck because this camera also has clean HDMI out for external recorders. In short, while the GH4 still has some \"pro\" features some \"pros\" might want, in practice, the GX85 is every bit the video shooter that the GH4 is, at basically half the price and with IBIS! Chew on that!<br /><br />Anyway, many of the other reviews cover what I would have covered anyway, which is that this is a beautiful camera that is a superb stills shooter, but I just wanted to address the video issue, too, since a lot of these points were not made in the press releases (probably to protect the GH4's reputation as a high end video shooter).<br /><br />Despite all this talk of video, I'm mainly a still shooter. Ever since receiving my GX85, I find that I simply cannot put it down. This is a gorgeous little camera. I initially started using MFT because of its balance of size and quality, but over time, I had been trending toward bigger cameras because they had the best features. However, a weird thing happened. I took my camera out less and less. When I got the GH4 to be the camera to end it all, I pretty much stopped taking my camera to social events completely because the GH4 just felt too formal. But ever since I received my GX85, I want this camera around me all the time! I love shooting pictures again.<br /><br />The image quality on this camera is easily the best I've ever seen in any Panasonic camera I've tried yet. There is no shutter shock. Thanks to the lack of an AA filter, improve shutter, and IBIS, I find that pictures are sharp to the last pixel! There is no softness whatsoever.<br /><br />Are there downsides? Yeah, small ones, but it seems like almost every downside has an upside. For instance, I prefer charging in an external charger so I can be charging a battery while using another one, but in-camera USB charging has a huge upside for keeping my camera bag light! I must say, though, the port cover for the HDMI/USB is kind of annoying to open, but hey, I'll get used to it. The tilt screen is a bit stiff and doesn't have huge freedom of movement, but on the other hand, it's super low profile and functional enough.<br /><br />Blah blah, I could go on and on, but a lot of people consider the GF1 to be the best MFT camera that Panasonic has ever made. To me, this camera, the GX85, is their best camera since the GF1. It's a camera that combines usability, stylish looks, superb stills performance, and 4K prowess. And it even comes with a pretty good kit zoom lens. It is excellent bang for the buck.<br /><br />As an aside, I feel bad for GX8 buyers. I wonder how many of them feel a bit bitter about the improved shutter and IBIS on the GX85, which is considerably cheaper than the GX8 ever was."]},{"name":"Nikon D5600","amazon_reviews":["Great images, terrible software - which was supposedly the 'biggest update' - it's excruciatingly slow and unstable.

I noticed on Linux, I was having a difficult time getting the overall composition of JPEG and RAW  photos to match during raw processing, as the Nikon codec is proprietary and Windows/MAC O/S only.  I then realized, the exposure of one RAW image was far better than it's JPEG image, as the camera obviously incorrectly processed the JPEG photo after shutter release.  (I would love to explain the error and process for Nikon to correct, but my knowledge can be proprietary too! ;-)  In brief, take both RAW+JPEG photos, especially if you're taking photos in a difficult environment or performing legal work.  As mentioned above, JPEG mode can and will unknowingly apply further color, effects and/or apparent correction filters or algorithms to the image, when creating the JPEG file.  It maybe, the RAW image is already held in memory for creation of the JPEG image, so the process RAW+JPEG process is only requiring further bus and SD memory resources.","Great photos and it has a ton of options.","Ok.

Takes great photos right out of the box, for those that want to take great pictures just pop on the 18-55mm lens, set to Auto mode and forget it.  The lenses included will cover just about anything you could want to photograph, the kit lenses are great.  The 18-55mm should cover just about anything you would want to shoot while the 70-300mm covers the rest, with the high ISO capability of the camera you can get great handheld images with both lenses.  The touch screen makes navigating the menus incredibly easy, I am used to Canon menus but after a thorough reading of the manual can get through these easily and quickly.  The difference in price for the touch screen and the snapbridge connectivity was definetely worth the extra cost over the D3400 and D5500, although the picture quality should be exactly the same.  The quality of the photographs is better than my Sony A6000 and the lenses in the kit give you much more capability at a significantly lower cost than any mirrorless camera.  Snapbridge works great once you figure it out, most of the negative comments seem to come from users that never read the manual.  Good battery life.  The great thing about this camera is you can set it and forget it (full auto) or take control over just about every aspect of the camera easily and quickly.<br /><br />Update:  Nikon released an update improving connectivity to SnapBridge, works seamlessly now.","Nice compact Nikon DX-format body for traveling.  Picture quality is excellent, as are the camera features.  Snapbridge software is far from perfect, but I'm confident Nikon will fix this.","I love this camera. I am still learning what it can do, but I have taken fabulous pictures!","The camera is all I wanted it to be and even more....however, having said that, due to problems with SnapBridge I have knocked the whole package back to 3 stars. Nikon needs to refine how SnapBridge is paired with the camera, or iPhone or iPad. On several occasions the same photograph was transmitted from the D5600 over 300 times to my 7 Plus iPhone. What a hassle having to delete over 300 of the same photograph. Thinking the my iPhone 7 Plus was the problem I then paired the D5600 with my iPad and got the same results with another photograph...over 300 times. I will say 99 % of the photographs I took paired perfectly, but it's that one percent that created major problems for me. This is obviously some sort of software glitch. Has anyone else experienced this same problem....it is absolutely driving me nuts.  Help!!!!","I have had the Nikon D90 for several years now and just recently transitioned to the Nikon D5600.  I am truly impressed with the D5600 and it is now my go to SLR.  The size of the body is perfect.  Small without being noticeably small in the hands.  It just fits perfectly in my hands and is a perfect size.  Much smaller than my D90 which felt pretty hefty to lug around.  The D5600 is nice and light which makes it easier to carry on extended shooting excursions like school field trips or family vacations/hikes.<br /><br />The articulating screen is really nice.  I didn't realize how useful an articulating screen would be until I had one.  My old D90 does not have an articulating screen.  The screen is nice, sharp and easy to use also.  The menu's are easy to navigate, but I'm not a newbie with Nikon so I expected it to be an easy transition.  The 18-55 lens that comes with this kit is a superb all around lens.  With the combination of the D5600 body and the 18-55 vr lens the pictures are crisp and the color is well balanced.  I have shot several action scenes with my kids playing sports and it has done a wonderful job capturing them in motion.  The first priority when buying a camera is that it must take great pictures and the D5600 fulfills that requirement in spades.  Very happy.<br /><br />Finally there are all the new wiz bang features.  Most notably the Nikon Snapbridge app.  I have the snapbridge app installed on a Google Pixel phone.  The app has worked very well for me and I have zero complaints.  The best thing about this is I have the snapbridge photo folder linked to my google photo's app on my phone.  That means every time I take a picture and it automatically goes to Snapbridge my google photo's app then automatically takes the pictures from the Snapbridge folder and uploads them to my Google Photo's account!  So essentially every picture I take is automatically uploaded to Google Photo's for me!  I know there are many different cloud photo apps but I have found Google Photo's works best for me.<br /><br />Overall the D5600 is a wonderful camera!  As an added bonus I can use all the lenses from my old D90 on the D5600!  Very happy and I would highly recommend this SLR to anyone looking for a solidly built camera that takes great pictures.","The Nikon D5600 is a great step up from using a cell phone camera, giving the user a professional product every time. Though the cell phone camera is very convenient, the pictures in many cases look exactly like what they are, a cell phone taken picture. The Nikon D5600 has all the features an experienced photographer would desire to use for their profession, but the D5600 is also very simple to use for a novice who desires professionally looking photographs.  Bottom line is that the Nikon D5600 is a very assessable and functional camera for all skill levels.<br /><br />The D5600 touch screen is extremely easy to maneuver through, giving simple access to many of the available options to ensure quality video and photographs. An option, such as the ability to isolate foreground from background, and the ability operate in incredible low-light with excellent performance in addition to a class-leading autofocus (AF) system. With a 5 frames-per-second (fps) continuous shooting speed and a 39-point autofocus system it is easy to capture fast moving subjects, a real plus when you have many frames to choose from trying to get that one perfect pose.<br /><br />I attend a variety of athletic events, in several different types of venues, from indoor gymnasiums, outdoor fields, and indoor natatoriums. The NIKON D5600 provided me the capability to take professional photographs and videos in the most difficult light conditions, along with challenging humidity and temperature conditions. Also with the higher shutter speeds, capturing fast moving actions of athletic competitions was exactly what I was hoping to find in a camera and the D5600 delivered, without question.<br />Along with all the excellent qualities of the Nikon D5600, having the Nikon SnapBridge app, provides an easy wireless avenue to share photos through Bluetooth connection between a smart device and the Nikon D5600. This automatic uploading allows immediate ready to share photos to any smart device, either by direct connection or through Wi-Fi.<br />The Nikon D5600 is worth every penny, a very easy to use camera for the novice, while providing the extremely professional photographer all the bells and whistles needed to provide the expected quality product for paying clients.","Awesome after week two, seems much much better than my D5100 in low light and the touch screen is nice.  Picture quality is awesome.  Snapbridge works for me but seems to take a lot of power so I disabled downloading of photos to my phone.  I upgraded mostly to get GPS tagging from my phone which works great.","Great camera! Small and with all the tech that I need! But it's expensive!","I've dabbled in photography for years, but I've never been able to put the money into a DSLR.  I finally have the opportunity to get one, and it has been an amazing difference.  I've owned some nicer point and shoots but the difference is nothing short of astonishing.  With the aid of some video tutorials, a background with a few photography classes and some good old fashion practice and playing with it, and I'm getting the hang of taking some awesome pictures.  This Nikon does feature and auto setting which is nice to get a feel for the camera and it's basic controls, but the real magic happens when you start playing with all the modes!  I love that it features a rechargeable battery that clips into a wall charger.  I'd like a second for backup but the battery life seems sufficient.  The addition of SnapBridge is a great feature.  I easily paired it was my iPhone by downloading the app.  I love how easy it ease to get pics to my phone for easy sharing with friends and family!  Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with its features or quality!","I purchased this camera at a competitor but wanted to share my take anyways, since I frequently use Amazon reviews for my own purchasing decisions.<br /><br />My wife and I were looking for a quality DSLR without breaking the bank and our research led us to the Nikon D5x00 series.<br /><br />If you made it this far, you are probably like me and found Nikon had a slightly updated version of the highly touted D5500, and while the differences are not massive, there are a few notable ones:<br /><br />1) Snapbridge support offering NFC and Bluetooth connectivity on the D5600 instead of just WiFi on D5500<br />2) Touch screen support of picture advance/scrubbing in review mode<br />3) Automatic time lapse feature, nice for capturing sunsets, day changes automatically<br />4) Slightly smaller body, but slightly heavier weight<br />5) Decreased battery life and fewer shots for each charge (from reviews), possibly due to BT or revamped internals.<br /><br />Otherwise, the features remain nearly identical, and we ended up choosing this over the Canon Rebel T6i/s competitors because it was smaller and did 1080p/60 video instead of 1080p/30. The difference in price over the older D5500 was only $100 more and it also offered the 18-140mm kit in a bundle while the D5500 did not (where I bought it), so we ended up buying the D5600 just as it came out via pre-order.<br /><br />The main reason we ended up choosing this popular 18-140mm lens kit bundle was due to some research and youtube videos stating it was the best all-day carry type lens that gave some telephoto zoom, but also good results up close and in some lower light situations. Apparently, others came to similar conclusion since this kit is now showing as \"SOLD OUT\" where I bought it.<br /><br />We also ended up getting the Nikon 35mm f/1.8G as well for an indoor low light and portrait prime lens, so while we will minimize the need to swap lenses outdoors, we will still swap to the 35mm indoors.  Very pleased with this lens for the price and the pictures we have taken so far indoors and in low light have been fantastic, without having to hold the aperture open as long and keeping your hands steady as the 18-140mm in lower light situations.<br /><br />As for the camera itself, overall it performs very well but we haven't had a chance to really test it too much in the dead of winter. Snapbridge is still a bit quirky and annoyingly, does not auto-connect to the Wi-Fi on your phone, you have to manually navigate to it each time to use the phone control feature. We ended up buying the handheld remote instead to simplify the process.<br /><br />Some negatives of the kit itself, it is very sparse. There is no hood or lens bag included. The battery doesn't even come charged. There is no manual included.  There also isn't an SD card included, even a tiny one that would let you get shooting right away, so make sure to have one beforehand. I noticed some of the older camera kits included these kinds of things.<br /><br />We bought a couple extra batteries, and a Lowe Pro Slingshot 250 bag to store everything using BestBuy's 25% off combo, as well as a few filters, 67mm UV for protection and 67mm polarized for outdoor bright glare shooting. Overall very happy with the camera and everything we purchased so far, we'll be sure to test it out more in the future!<br /><br />Here's more info I posted in the comments about *SNAPBRIDGE*<br /><br />I have this camera as well as an iPhone 6s Plus, and the issues I've experienced are a bit more nuanced, but the OP does have a point, Snapbridge is clunky with BT/Wi-Fi and many reviews also made note of this in my research.<br /><br />Bluetooth does seem to pair fine with my phone automatically as most good BT devices should, but it seems like BT is used as default for only transferring photos, but not for remote viewfinder/remote control. My major issue with Snapbridge and trying to use it as a remote control function is that when you try to use the Remote photography feature, even though BT is already connected, it will not just use whatever is connected already (BT or Wi-Fi), it serially checks Wi-Fi first and then annoyingly, will NOT auto-connect to the local Wi-Fi network (D5600). You have to manually go into phone settings, connect to the D5600 Wi-Fi, then go back to Snapbridge. IF Android magically kicks you off your Wi-Fi network or allows more than 1 Wi-Fi network at a time, then Android would certainly have a leg up on iOS, but in my previous experience with Android and many other devices, that is not the case and devices are not smart enough to kick you off your existing Wi-Fi to join theirs.<br /><br />Now, I am not sure if this is an iOS-only thing, and it is possible that being off my home Wi-Fi network and shooting out and about and not being connected to any Wi-Fi network would facilitate the phone connecting with the D5600 automatically, but it is a showstopper, so much so that I just went and bought the $15 remote control. I also am not sure if Remote photography is even available over BT. If it is not, I probably should just look to disable BT and use the Wi-Fi for both transfer and remote photography which then takes away one \"upgrade\" of the D5600 over the D5500, which should also improve battery life.<br /><br />Hope that helps clear things up a bit.","I purchased this camera (with the 18-55mm VR II kit lens) from Amazon in order to replace a much-loved D5100 that was stolen. The camera has all the plusses I loved in the D5100, especially its light weight and reticulating LCD. In addition, the basic D5600 kit now includes the much-improved 18-55mm VR II lens, which is incredibly sharp and useful. Focus is now adjustable by touching the focus ring on the lens rather than flipping a switch. And the LCD, like the competing Canons, has touch-screen capabilities, making use of the menus far easier (and faster).  I compared the D5600 to a D7200, the flagship of Nikon's DX offerings, and found, quite simply, that I took much better photographs with the D5600.  The size and weight of the D7200 militated against spontaneity in my shooting. Admittedly, I would have gotten used to this in time, but even so, the D5600, to me, offered all the crucial flexibilities of the D7200 in a far more user-friendly, approachable context.  I found it far easier to shoot the D5600 in aperture-priority (A), shutter-priority (S), and manual mode (M). To be sure, you don't have two dials, but the single D5600 dial can control both shutter and aperture simply by holding down a button. The bottom line was the D5600's featherweight construction. I'm a huge believer in the adage, \"the camera you have with you is the one you will use.\"  Let's face it:  the competition is the iPhone's camera, and I've taken a hell of a lot of great photographs with it. The D5600 is light enough to make you stop and consider lugging it with you, iPhone and all.<br /><br />I'm less than enthusiastic about the single major improvement over the D5600's predecessor, the D5500:  Snapbridge. The low-power Bluetooth connection is capable, as I ascertained, at transferring large format images to my iPhone 6S, but the transfer is inordinately slow and consumes battery power voraciously.  Although the camera still has wi-fi, like its predecessor, wi-fi is now wholly subordinated within Snapbridge, such that the user cannot choose between Bluetooth and wi-fi. There is one positive:  So long as you have your smartphone with you, the Bluetooth transfers can be configured to encode your pictures' GPS coordinates, but there's a major downside to this:  If the pairing doesn't happen for some reason, and the transfer happens elsewhere, the coordinates will be wrong.<br /><br />I regret to say that I pulled out my D5100's EyeFi card and plan to use it instead of Snapbridge to transfer full-size images to my smartphone; in my experience, at least, it's 10x faster. Or better, I'll simply pull the SD card out of the camera and stick into the slot on my MacBook Air.  The unfortunate truth is that the D5600 offers very little in comparison with its predecessor, the D5500, and buyers might well consider saving $100 by foregoing the most recent version of this camera.<br /><br />This year marks Nikon's 100th anniversary, and for me personally, the 40th year I've owned and photographed with Nikon products. It is with sadness that I note signs of Nikon's desperation in the face of smartphone competition. In order to cut costs, evidently, this camera kit does not include the camera's reference manual, an indispensable item for serious photographers, and it isn't available on Nikon USA's site, at this writing. Personally, I'd prefer to have a printed manual rather than a 300-page PDF.<br /><br />In spite of my criticisms, I must say that I absolutely love this camera. Its light weight, reticulating touch-screen LCD, crystal-sharp optics from the 18-55mm VR II kit lens and beautifully thought-out controls have enabled me to take dozens of memorable, perfectly-exposed photographs.  The built-in flash is surprisingly useful, producing shots free from red eye and obviating the need for an expensive, add-on flash unit in many situations. Aside from time-lapse movies, a feature I haven't evaluated, I see little in the 5600 that isn't already available in the D5500, at a reduced price.","Hey whats up everyone, my names Chris Winter and today I’ve going to do an indepth Review of the brand new Nikon D5600 to see if it’s a good camera for you. Let’s review the brand new Nikon D5600.<br /><br />Build Quality<br /><br />Let’s first get started by taking a look at the build quality and features of the new Nikon D5600. When you first pick up the Nikon D5600, I’ve got to say that it really does feel nice. The Nikon D5600 is targeted towards either beginners, or photographers who want to step up from a begginer camera and I think it fits the purpose. It’s not a huge camera, but compared to something like this camera here, the new Nikon D3400, there is a noticable step up in size. Button placement is good too. Nothing too different from other Nikon bodies, so if you’re used to the Nikon system, you’ll feel right at home. So overall the Nikon D5600 feels great, it’s not too heavy and its not too light, its right in that sweet spot for a DSLR.<br /><br />LCD Screen<br /><br />Let’s now turn the Nikon D5600 around and take a look at the LCD. And this is where things get exciting. The Nikon D5600 is one of a small number of DSLR’s from Nikon to have an articulating screen. And it’s a good one at that. Compared to some cameras from some other brands, the Nikon D5600’s articulating screen is the real deal and can even be flipped to face you in the front. Now that might seem like an insignificant feature, but for people who film themselves like I do, that’s a huge deal and will mean this will be a great camera for youtubers. Not only that, it really does allow to get shots from up high or down low, which is normally a dificult thign to do if youre just relying on the viewfinder. The screen itself is also really quite good. I was very impressed with the screen from teh baby brother the Nikon D3400 and the Nikon D5600 is equally as good. One thing that I really loved about the Nikon D5600 is it’s touch screen. I really don’t know why more DSLR’s don’t include these as they make it them much easier to use. So overall the Nikon D5600’s articulating screen is definitely impressive and one of the highlights of the camera.<br /><br />Menus<br /><br />So I quickly wanted to touch on the menus on the Nikon D5600. Overall they were quite good with a lot of information and settings at your finger tips. Now if you’ve ever used a Nikon DSLR you’ll feel right at home in the menus on the Nikon D5600, but if you’re coming from a Canon background, it might take a while to get used to. So again, the menus are pretty good. They’re fast to get around and if you’re used to Nikon, you’ll feel right at home here.<br /><br />Competitors<br /><br />Now if you’re thinking about purchasing the Nikon D5600, theres a good chance you’ll have looked at some of it’s competitors. Firstly on the cheaper end, the recently released Nikon D3400 is another option to look at. It’s cheaper than the Nikon D5600 but importnatly is missing the articulating screen and the touch screen. The Nikon D5500 is the Nikon D5600’s predecesccor and is actually pretty similar. One thing it is missing htough is snapbridge which could be something you’re interested in. The Nikon D5600 also has a timelapse feature which is missing on the Nikon D5500 which is somehting we’ll talk about later. On the higher end we’ve got the Nikon D7200. It’s a little bigger and has great autofocus, but doesn’t have an articulating screen and is also more expensive. On the Canon side the Nikon D5600’s big competitiors are the Canon T6i and Canon T6s and also perhaps the Canon 70d and Canon 80d. The Nikon D5600 does have continuous auotofocus in video mode, but if compared to cameras like the Canon 70d or Canon 80d, it’s still not at that level. It works, but I wouldn’t bet my life on it. The Nikon D5600 also has a timelapse mode as well which is a really nice inclusion. This was included on the Canon 80d and i actually found mysefl using it quite a lot so having it on the Nikon D5600 is nice. And if you do like to shoot in slow motion, the Nikon D5600 can shoot at 60frames per second so you can slow it down it post, nice. So overall if you’re looking for a great DSLR for video, the Nikon D5600 might not be the best, but it’s good.<br /><br />So overall I’ve been very pleased with the Nikon D5600. Is it a huge upgrade from the Nikon D5500? Well not really, but this is a great camera not only for photographers, but also for those interested in vdieo as well. Good job with this one NIkon."]},{"name":"YI M1","amazon_reviews":["Decided to try one more time and ordered another one.

There are another things, like if you bump the ISO the image quality is very very poor. I would like have more control over video.. change the white balance durning the take is not a good thing... I have to use the camera more time to talk more about like it.","Great camera. The firmware updates are slowly coming which are taking care of most of the issues. Very happy just wish they would sell an extra battery seperately","I would like to preface this review by saying the camera does have flaws, but they were minor inconveniences. Minor inconveniences don't make up for how competitively priced it is(350$ compared to 700$ for Panasonic LUMIX DMC-G85MK 4K Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Camera Kit, 12-60mm Lens, 16 Megapixel (Black) or g7).<br /><br />For a product with such mixed reviews I really was hesitant, but I decided that the reported flaws were not a turn off for me. I'm not a crazy experienced photographer. Most of my experience is with aerial stuff on my phantom 3. I went ahead and bought this as a tool to get into interchangeable lens cameras. I have had experience with them before but never had one of my own. This camera really has all the features you need to take the jump to serious photography. There are so many settings and options to change!<br /><br />Image Quality: It's a mirrorless 20mp camera with a fancy Sony sensor, but as any photographer will tell you, that is not what makes a good camera necessarily. I actually think the sensor and body are more than adequate for even professional work, but the lens is where they cut corners. The lens feels well build but out of plastic. It zooms and focuses smoothly unlike reports of some reviewers, however not quite as smooth as some DSLR's I have used. The lens is okay but it has no stabilization and I could really do with a telephoto. The focus takes a lot of turning to do and the autofocus is garbage. The images it takes are attached. It has a fun feature where you can open the shutter with the button and then click again to close it. This lets you do as much shutter time as you want. The low light performance is great so long as you expose for long enough. The biggest downside for me, however, is the lack of RAW+Fine option. Everyone mentions this and it is definitely a problem. Regardless, it blows even the google pixel's camera out of the water. I was able to do a lot with the DNG RAW files in post, which is excellent. Focus is the biggest issue most other reviewers comment on and I agree. The auto-focus truly is bad. It was doing everything it could to refuse to focus on my subject for some shots. It is finnicky but not entirely broken. The manual focus is much better. It takes a bit more time but I probably would have ended up using it anyway even if the auto-focus was perfect, just because I like the control.<br /><br />Build quality: The body feels like metal. I know the lens mount is metal but I'm not entirely sure if the body is. Regardless, the body is built extremely well and it was the first thing that jumped out at me when I got the camera. It feels sturdy and premium - not like a 350$ Chinese product that one might expect. The lens is not entirely different. The lens is definitely plastic but it too feels well build. The little Yi logo obviously trying to mimic Leica's signature look is hilarious. I find these types of things very charming on Chinese products. Definitely could take a beating. The screen seems to be a 480p capacitive touchscreen that does the job. The only thing I need is to see it in the sun and to have the resolution to see my shot. Both of which it accomplishes fine.<br /><br />Features: The camera is very simple yet also very complex. People reviewing it call it simple only because the lack of buttons. You get a shutter, mode changer, and a user changeable dial to adjust things like aperture or shutter. It's quite brilliant, really. In aperture priority mode the dial changes aperture while the shutter automatically adjusts itself. In shutter priority the opposite happens. In both of these modes you just tap the exposure setting to select it and now the dial is changing the exposure. In manual mode this is how you do everything. Tap the shutter icon and your dial is changing the shutter. There's a lot of shooting modes: continuous, single, and also delay. I really wish I could change these without going to the camera settings. A little button on the screen to toggle it would be very helpful. There's also 4k 30fps video and 1080p 60fps video. The 1080p and below options have electronic stabilization - I would imagine because it does a bit of cropping to stabilize. Video in general has a cropping factor, that's just because normal pictures are 4:3 aspect ration and video has to be 16:9. That's a necessity. The video actually looks great. I don't recommend 4k30 without a lens with stabilization because of how jittery it is. The 1080p60 is great not only because 60fps is buttery smooth, but also because the EIS tones down the jitters. You could but it in a warp stabilizer in Adobe Premiere to further improve it.<br /><br />Conclusion/ Value: Despite mixed reviews I do not regret my purchase. I do admit I'm a fan of Yi for brining an action camera that beat the gopro for 1/6th the price. While the M1 doesn't beat the Panasonic or Olympus mirrorless cameras, everything else on the market is twice as much. To me, the minor flaws are worth saving 300-400$. The camera is not for someone that already has a great camera. It's for someone that needs a step into the world of interchangeable lenses. If I had something like a rebel or d3400 I would not buy it unless I repeatedly found myself travelling.","It was a birthday present and She loved it!! Now she can really take great pictures for both her Food blog and Instagram followers of her bistro.  But she has no idea that this a sweet camera.  Did my research and these are comparable to higher end DSLR cameras such as Canon but personally it doesn't get better than this.  Thank you to Yi Technology.  Looking forward to more!","This is a versatile camera, that's designed to be (almost) as easy to use as a smartphone, while allowing for a wide range of options that let you take much better photos than you could get with your smartphone. There are some hiccups, but overall it's a pretty impressive camera.<br /><br />Simplicity: it's designed to be simple. There is a knob on top that allows you to go into various shooting modes. Like most digital cameras, pressing the shoot button halfway does autofocus, then pressing all the way takes a picture. There are two buttons on the back, one for selecting and one for going into preview mode to see what you've shot.<br /><br />On top of that, the LCD screen is touch sensitive. You can slide the screen to the left and pick various different picture formats such as black and white. You can slide the screen to the right and get a lot of menu options. You can also touch a point on the screen that you want the camera to focus on, and then when you depress the shoot button it will focus on that point.<br /><br />That simplicity does have its drawbacks - if you want to make changes to anything, like the ISO or the shutter speed, etc. you have to go into the menu. Sometimes it's easier to have a quick manual control button or knob to adjust such things, because otherwise you might miss the shot while making the adjustment.<br /><br />The pictures you can get, when it focuses correctly, are quite impressive. The camera kit (at least the one I have) comes with two lenses: a 42mm F1.8 lens and a telephoto lens that goes from 12-40mm (F3.5-5.6). The 42mm lens is great for taking portraits, and you can really get a nice narrow focus that gives \"bokeh\" in the background. It has good low light performance and is what I tend to use when I'm shooting indoors. The other lens is more versatile, and it's what I use for everyday outdoor use when I don't know what kind of a shot I might want.<br /><br />As others have noted, the autofocus performance is imperfect and somewhat slower than I've seen with other cameras. Upgrading the firmware when I first got it helped with that (the instructions in the manual on upgrading the firmware are not very good: but if you search \"updating firmware yi-m1\" you'll find a link on their website to download the firmware in a zip file and then when you open that you can find both the firmware file and instructions for updating it). Even with the upgrade I have found some odd things: like when you select somewhere on the frame that you want it to focus on and then try to autofocus but it can't get a focus on that point, it won't take a picture. If you change things it will, but I lost a few pictures when I couldn't get it to focus on the point that I wanted and then the subject moved away.<br /><br />Downloading their app allows you to transfer pictures from the camera to your phone, which I found to be a handy feature. Something they seem to think is a handy feature are the various \"sample\" pictures of models in a range of poses. You can download these as templates and they will put an outline of where and how your model is supposed to sit. Other than as a fun gimmick, I can't see why I'd ever use these.<br /><br />Overall, this is an easy to use camera, that has a very good sensor, comes with two good lenses and allows you to add a number of additional lenses designed for micro 4/3 mirrorless cameras. I'm quite happy with it, and I think it's a good deal for the price, but it isn't perfect. If you want a more conventional mirrorless camera you'd have to go with the name brands, but you'd pay a bit more for it.","The first moment I saw the M1 I fell in love with it and ordered it!,. The camera was working great but then when I try to connect with it's WiFi it just did not working! Anyway after many emails to the supporting group ( Nice People ) I could not solve the problem! and also It was not possible to upgrade the firmware because of the WiFi connection  and later on I tried to do it  manually but it didn't go through so sad!! I sent it back to the Y1M1 company.","So far working great. Upgraded the lense and made a big difference.  Manufacture responds promptly to questions.  The autofocus takes some getting used to but works well enough once you get the hang of it","I received a free sample of this camera for review purposes. This is YI's first foray into serious picture-taking cameras (they currently offer action cameras and home security-type cameras), and as an avid photographer I was anxious to see what it had to offer.<br /><br />The unboxing was interesting. It comes in a cool black box and despite already having a couple of mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras I was surprised at the small size. The camera charges via microUSB which is welcome. It comes with a single battery. It does not come with an SD card which is a little surprising considering that its feature set aims this camera at the entry-level amateur photographer who probably does not already have a drawer full of SD cards.<br /><br />One feature that I do not have on any of my current cameras that I was interested in trying was the touch screen. It works well, it's responsive and the interface fairly intuitive. I like how you can tap an icon on the touch screen and it will change what the physical dial does (changing aperture or shutter speed, for example). I love being able to set the focus point with a tap on the touch screen, although the focus point is on a grid with no object tracking so if you touch in the area of an object and move the camera slightly before shooting your focus point might not be what you wanted it to be.<br /><br />On the downside, the screen is fixed to the back of the camera. Most cameras in this class have articulating screens that allow you to move them around if you want to take a photo at a position other than eye-level. You can't flip it around to take a selfie, and holding above your head or at waist level makes framing a picture awkward or impossible.<br /><br />The kit comes with two interchangeable lenses. Neither one has optical image stabilization, which is pretty much a deal breaker for me. The lack of stabilization is made worse by the fact that the camera and lenses are so small and light. Considering my cell phone has optical stabilization, I was surprised and disappointed. Additionally, the lenses, which are plastic, feel cheap all around. The zoom lens has an oddball locking mechanism; you need to slide a switch and rotate the zoom ring to fully retract the lens.<br /><br />The controls are few, with a couple of physical dials and buttons. That's all you need really since the touch screen provides so much functionality. The camera has the worst on/off switch I've ever seen, and if you bump it (or it gets bumped inside your bag or purse) it will turn on.<br /><br />Picture quality is overall good for a micro 4/3s-size sensor. I have heard that YI is using a higher-end Sony sensor inside the camera. Video quality is good, but the lack of image stabilization makes most footage unusable unless you put the camera on a tripod. YI has issued a firmware update which adds digital image stabilization, but tragically this does not work at the highest 4K resolution.<br /><br />As I write this, you can get a Sony a6000 with a kit zoom lens for exactly the same price as the YI. In my opinion the a6000 is a much better option. While it doesn't have a touch screen, it has a larger sensor and some advanced features like object tracking and in the end will give you better-looking photos and video. The Sony mirrorless lineup of cameras and lenses has become quite mature in the last couple of years, and you'll have infinitely more and better options to upgrade your lens or camera body when you're ready to move up in the future. The YI is an okay first effort, but at its current price it does not provide a good value in my opinion.","Bought it for its good Sony 20Mp sensor. Its light and compact and to use it with my M43 lenses from my Lumix:<br />Summary: good image resolution and sensitivity/ISO. light and compact.<br />Sadly my Lumix 14-24 power zoom does not retract on power-down.(woks fine on my GF5).{fixed with firmware 1.2-int, Feb2017)<br />In bright light its most difficult to see menu,(low contrast, poor icons, small grey font).  in low light its difficult to focus.<br />Wireless only downloads jpegs, not raw; no live view and no remote control. no remote shutter control.<br />Hopefully user interface and features get improved by additional firmware upgrades.<br />The company photos are misleading: looks like a solid body; but there are notable seams. Display screen on marketing photos covers all rear screen; in reality the image is substantially smaller.","I've gone on exactly one photoshoot with my new Yi, and I can safely say the workmanship and attention to detail here is untenable at this price point by any of the other players in the market. I'm quite a fan of, let's say, unconventional camera bodies (a proud owner of a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera and was demoing the Lytro Illum for a while before deciding against getting one), and needed something to complement my growing collection of MFT lenses. This camera is a beast. It supports shutter speeds as fast as 1/4000th of a second and as slow as 60 seconds (or more in timelapse mode) and shoots 4k video. However, your needs are important. If you need a camera that primarily shoots video, you would have to turn off manual mode and learn how to focus yourself (the autofocus during video with this camera is very wonky; professional videographers never use autofocus for video, however). If you need a low-cost and low profile camera that shoots extremely high quality photos, this is the perfect vehicle for your creativity. I prefer the shots I've gotten with this little thing to anything Nikon- or Canon produces, and it's so lightweight and tiny that you won't get those stares a huge DSLR get you, nor the bicep fatigue. The autofocus during photo-taking is zippy and accurate with the kit lens, and the lens itself is pretty damn amazing. I haven't even considered swapping it out yet, but that will change once I want to do night photography or landscape photography. I've attached real-world indoor shots as well as a few outdoor shots, and if they seem too dark it's primarily because I was still trying to figure out the menus.","As I understand it, this is the first camera made by the Xiaomi company in China.  As a first effort, this is a nice camera.<br /><br />This camera came in a box with two lenses, a 42.5mm f1.8 portrait style lens, and a 12-40mm f3.5-5.6 lens (a typical standard zoom lens).  This is a micro 4/3rds camera, so you should multiply the focal lengths (in mm) by 2 for the full-frame equivalents.  Although I have not tried any, this camera should be 100% compatible with Olympus and Panasonic micro 4/3rds lenses.<br /><br />As a mirrorless camera, it has a few quirky things.  I have limited experience with mirrorless cameras (as a Nikon DSLR user), although I have tried Sony and Fuji mirrorless briefly.  I fully expected to see my exposure change on the LCD as I made adjustments to the aperture, shutter speed, and iso, but it doesn't seem to happen that way on this camera.  It acts like a DSLR, in that, you cannot actually see your real exposure (how light or dark the photo is) until the photo is taken and played back onscreen.<br /><br />The on/off switch is also backwards. It is labeled properly, but you turn it off and on in directions opposite to what I am used to. The direction you turn a lens to mount it on and off the camera is backwards from Nikon, but the same as Fuji and Sony, if I recall correctly.<br /><br />Another issue I noticed is that this camera has some difficulty judging exposure in Aperture Priority.  There were multiple times when I would try to take a photo in Aperture Priority at f1.8, iso 200, and the shutter speed would be stuck at something like 1/8th of a second.  This is way off and leads to massive blue from handshake, as it should be at least 1/2000th of a second based on my experience with such as wide open aperture and the available lighting.  Only when I would point the lens at a lightbulb would I get 1/500th of a second.  Given this, I only recommend this camera for use outdoors, especially if you find you need a shutter speed of 1/200th or faster.<br /><br />It can only save photos as RAW or JPG, but not both at the same time.  Most cameras support RAW+JPG.  The RAW files it produces are easily read by Lightroom.  Lightroom has no current support for the lens profiles.  The lack of lens profiles does not affect you unless you wish to apply specific lens corrections (vignette and distortion removal).<br /><br />The default ISO is 200, although it does support an extended ISO of 100.<br /><br />I tested some video recording on this camera, and thought it was generally good.  I was very happy to see the smooth exposure transitions as I pointed the lens from areas of light to dark.  The onboard mic seems super sensitive, as it was able to pick up the sound of my breathing, and others noises in the house (which sound like a helicopter, although I don't recall any such sounds at the time of recording).  Perhaps ghost hunters and paranormal researches would be interested in that!<br /><br />There is a unique feature in this camera, call \"Super Professicnal guide\"...that is how it is spelled in the manual.  This super guide places an overlayed stick figure drawing on the screen that shows you how to pose a person for a portrait.  I like it and have to try it out some more.  Its a nice thing to have.<br /><br />You definitely need fingernails to open the memory card compartment flap.<br /><br />The menu is fully touchscreen based, like using a smartphone.  It only has two physical buttons, for playback and a function button.<br /><br />The lens mount on the camera body is metal, but the included lenses themselves are all plastic and glass.<br /><br />Overall, I think they did a good job on this camera.  It is completely usable right out of the box (once you charge it of course...via micro USB) and offers a full range of features.  It has a few issues, such as those I pointed out above, but you will probably be ok, and I suspect some of them can be worked out in future firmware updates.","The idea behind this camera is brilliant -- the power of micro four-thirds (MFT) with the ease-of-use of a modern smartphone. Unfortunately, the great idea and great sensor this camera has are hampered by really bad software.<br /><br />There are two major issues with this camera in its current state. First is the autofocus. It's slow and often inaccurate. This autofocus is a problem with both stills and videos. The second problem is the JPG compression; it ruins the quality of still images. Considering that most people looking for an easy-to-use camera want JPGs, that's a huge issue.<br /><br />The problem isn't the camera's sensor (made by Sony). RAW images look very, very good. If you happen to have software that can work with RAW files then you can get some strong results from this camera. Again, most beginners want good-looking JPGs that don't require much editing, if any.<br /><br />Being an MFT camera, the body can be used with a number of great lenses. That's some fantastically versatility. The kit I have came with both a prime and a zoom lens. Obvious the zoom is more versatile, while the prime offers significantly better quality.<br /><br />There's a chance that this camera's performance will be improved through future firmware updates. Using the most current version, I can't recommend this YI M1. It's a beginner's camera that gets its best results through expert use. It's really a shame, because it's a fantastic idea and the sensor quality is great. On paper, a \"gateway\" MFT camera that's simple to use, has a great sensor, and offers nice lens versatility is a fantastic thing. Sadly, the current software tarnishes the idea with bad autofocus and JPG performance.","Fine starter or (big) pocket size 4/3rds a camera. Uses many ideas from phone software that takes a bit of getting used to.<br />Lenses are excellent and other 4/3rd lens work as well as old legacy lenses with converters. Select a few setting and the results produce high quality images.<br />The 20 MP sensor and camera processing keep noise low at high ISO.<br />One of the first cameras to use touch screen to excellent advantage without overdoing it.<br />Interesting integration with wireless and bluetooth. With firmware updates substantially improving the camera (solved focusing issue), this one is a keeper!","I'm not an optics expert, nor am I a professional photographer. I own two mirrorless cameras. My Yi - M1, and my Sony A6000. When I'm out shooting, I want the image I'm trying to capture to be sharp and clear. If the camera can't do this, I don't want it. I'm also interested in composition, of course, but for me, nice composition of a blurry image is junk, and it's deleted.<br /><br />I'm certain that an expensive lens on this camera would allow me to take even sharper photos than it does with the kit lenses it comes with, but I don't believe I would necessarily see any appreciable difference. By the way, there are at least 50 other lenses for sale, from other manufacturers, that will work perfectly well with this camera, but you may not need any of them. The photos produced by this camera and the included lenses are very good, and in my situation I am not interested in spending a great deal of extra money to obtain what? A 15 - 20% increase in sharpness over what these are already producing for me? If you had the two photos next to each other, one shot with the lens that comes with this camera, and the other shot with an expensive lens, you may or may not see some slight differences. It really should depend on what you are going to do with the photo that makes the difference. Are you going to show it to friends on your cell phone or computer screen? Or are you going to blow it up and hang it on your wall. In either case, Is it worth another $1000 or more to you to improve the quality another 15 - 20 %? Unless I have a customer willing to pay me for that photograph, for me It isn't. The expensive lens most likely will help more if you regularly create photos that you intend to blow up to, say, 2' by 4' images. If you are like me, you don't blow your images up very often. I have over 93,000 photos that I've taken, and I have yet to blow up a single image to a size larger than 8 1/2 by 11 inches. My last one was over 10 years ago. Even at that size it is doubtful you could see a 20% increase in sharpness. How does someone even make the accurate determination that it is a 20% or more improvement?<br /><br />Those of us who are not professionals will only need the type of expensive equipment professionals use, in order to satisfy some emotional need to have the best toys that exist for our hobby. Probably one other reason would be for \"bragging rights\", whether or not you even use the equipment, and this ties in pretty well with the first reason why we may want the \"best.\" If you can control those needs, this camera and kit lenses will do just about any photographic thing you will need it to do, and in my opinion it does it very well. It's also quite fun having some of the new high tech functions this camera has.<br /><br />I have books about posing models that are wonderful, and very useful, but I don't take them with me when I shoot photos of my wife, sons, and friends. This camera has the ability to show the owner a few various poses right on the screen. You can show them to the person you are going to photograph and it will help them to pose better for the photo. I think is a wonderful idea, and I wish I had it on my Sony A6000. It would also be nice if there were poses for males as well as females, but on this camera it is not to be, at least not yet.<br /><br />Having a touch screen to help you change the settings for different circumstances and subjects is useful and fun. It is also very quick. You can see what you are doing much easier, so for you who need glasses, that's a big plus. You are not spending 3 minutes trying to set up your camera, only to find out you already lost the shot.<br /><br />You do not have a built in flash with this camera, which for me isn't a problem. Actually having the built in flash has been a problem with some of my past cameras. If your built in flash camera has a lens longer than a couple of inches, you will, on certain photos, find a concave dark/black area in the bottom of your image, which is the shadow caused by the light from the flash which was blocked by the lens. Yes it can be useful at times but for me mostly it was an annoyance because on those photos I had to try to crop out a useable portion of my image which wasn't affected.<br /><br />Compared to the Canon Rebel T3I I used to carry, this camera weighs less than half as much. It is also much smaller so it is easier to carry around. Take the lens off and you can carry the two pieces in your pockets. Very cool. The touch screen removes the need for several other buttons I used to have to deal with on my other cameras.<br /><br />The quality of the photos I'm getting are very similar to my Sony A6000, and my Sony takes great photos. They both have a 25,000 ISO limit which is, for practical purposes, useless. I can get, on this camera or my A6000, a photo using an ISO this high, but I for one anyway, would never show it to anyone else. The amount of noise in the low light areas of a 25,000 ISO photo is dreadful.  I do have very good noise reduction software that is produced by a company called Topaz Labs, but even this software doesn't do much to help a shot taken at 25,000 ISO.<br /><br />Here are some good and less good things I've noticed about the camera.<br /><br />1.The camera is almost all plastic, so like almost every other electronic item you already own, it needs to be given a little care. It can easily be smashed into pieces. Plastic helps keep the cost and weight down. I consider it a good trade off.<br /><br />2. I find it easy to hold in my big \"ex-farm boy\" hands, even though it does feel small.<br /><br />3. I like the lock/unlock button on the zoom lens because it helps keep the storage size smaller.<br /><br />4. I wouldn't mind having image stabilization in these lenses, which they don't have, but I'm so used to establishing as rock solid a photography stance as I possibly can, that it's not a big deal. Besides if the photo is really important to me, I'm going to use a tripod, period. If you are like the adorable short skirted cuties, walking around in their 4 inch high heel shoes, that I saw in Las Vegas last week, the lack of image stabilization might be a deal breaker. Judging from the way they were taking photos, with one swinging hand that never seemed to stop even while they were pressing the shutter button, they probably think that blurry is the way all photographs look anyway, and it's doubtful that any image stabilization would be of much help to them.<br /><br />5. The lenses do feel pretty lightweight, but I never read in any rule book where I am required to have a lens which is as heavy as a brick in order to transmit reflected light to my camera sensor and produce a clean sharp image.<br /><br />6. I would enjoy being able to turn off the shutter sound especially around children. I could get better shots if they don't really know I was, or was about to take photos of them.<br /><br />7. I would like to be able to shoot bracketed photos in Camera Raw, because CR is pretty much all I ever shoot. Of course, with CR you do have a wide exposure range to work with anyway in post processing, so it's not as important. But there are times though when I would like to shoot HDR photos and with this camera I will need to do this in JPG format, or manually set and shoot my individual bracketed photos.<br /><br />Here are a just a couple basic things to make your first interactions with the camera a little easier, since there is really no \"useful\" user manual. These took me about 45minutes to figure out, so maybe I can help save you about the same amount of time.<br /><br />1. To change the F stop, select it on the touch screen, and then use the wheel at the top right of the camera to set it to the F stop you want. Do the  same to change the EV.<br /><br />2. There are three information screens.<br /><br />3. At the bottom of your screen you will see 3 dots. The position of the white dot indicates which screen you are in. (white dot in the middle means you are in the -- Duh!!!! ---- middle screen)<br /><br />4. Slide your finger from far left to right on the touch screen to access various settings. (ISO, basic setup, date and time etc.) From this position, slide it up or down to find additional settings on the same screen.<br /><br />5. If you are in the middle screen, slide your finger from far right to left on the screen and it will take you to the far right \"color\" screen.<br /><br />6. The small user manual that comes with the camera mentions you need to press the Q button on the camera to accomplish some functions. There is \"No\" Q button on the camera. There is however a \"0\" button in the lower right on the back of the camera, and this is what they are talking about. This alone took me 5 minutes to figure out.<br /><br />My only real big criticism of this camera is the lack of an eyepiece. Of course I know why it isn't there, but I still find I can hold a camera much more steady when looking through an eyepiece than I can while looking at the touch screen on the back of a camera. If I'm shooting at speeds of over 1/60th of a second, I guess I'm OK with either type of camera, but I still prefer the eyepiece.<br /><br />I'm going to bore some readers at this point. So feel free to quit and go read something else. I won't be offended. I don't have any other lenses which will work on this camera in order to compare with the ones I received in the kit, so this isn't meant to be a full report on the lenses. Just a little information on the best setting for the 12 - 40mm F3.5-5.6 lens when used at full power zoom, auto continuous focusing, on a distant object. I took photos of a truck with trees on its right and left sides, about 500ft away from me. I had the camera on a tripod and set it to 2 second delay to control any camera movement. As I expected, the lowest apertures and the highest apertures produced pretty poor images in terms of sharpness. The best photos were produced using F stops from F8 - F13, with F8 giving the very best image when viewed at full resolution. Something I find in most lenses I have used, but not all. The truck was acceptably sharp, and the tree leaves were too far away to see much detail in them. It was a good photo. The main reason I didn't include the photo here with the review, is unless you are looking at it at full resolution what's the point? You're not going to see how good the photo really is.<br /><br />This lens does show some Chromatic Aberrations of purple and green on certain photos. That's not terribly unusual. My lenses on my Sony A6000 do also. As a matter of fact, as part of my post processing, I run all my photos through software to correct for Chromatic Aberrations. Unless you are looking at the images at from about 50 - 100% resolution you don't really notice it, and they are easy enough to remove with software. Since I know they are there, automatically remove them. This is easier to do when shooting in Camera Raw.<br /><br />My final opinion of this camera is - I wouldn't trade my Sony A6000 for it, but I do wish my Sony had some of the features of this Yi - M1. The quality of the images are reasonably comparable with what I get with my Sony. If you do a lot of Social networking on the Internet, the Yi -M1 makes that much easier once you download the app and you connect your camera to your smart phone. I don't, so for me, who cares? I didn't use the app much, because that's not really my thing, but it did work, and I understand there will be software upgrades coming for the camera and the app.<br /><br />I like the camera very much, and find it fun to use.","I am giving 5 stars because of the incredible value.<br /><br />I bought this camera on Amazon. The sensor is the same as the $1000 Panasonic GX8. The pictures produced are terrific and I love the ability to use many MFT lenses. Yes there are lots of niggles that hurt the usability ie EVF. For light travel and excellent picture quality you can not beat the $499 or less price point. I am sure various little issues will be fixed through firmware update. <br />Jus my 2 cents.<br />4/14/17<br />Update. Firmware 2.0 adds remote viewing and camera controls.  It has fixed many bugs.  My main camera is a Sony a6500.  I still enjoy using this camera.  It is a very good value and works with many of my Olympus lenses.  It is not a simple point and shoot camera and I think many of the negative reviews are not correct.  Other m43 20mpix cameras are $700-$800 more.  Yi has upgraded the firmware every two months and I see no reason why this won't continue.  If you want a novice point and shoot look elsewhere.","Get it at the right price and you may love having this camera in your car console so you never miss a shot.<br /><br />NOTE: Based on improvements in updated firmware, I upped the rating to four stars but it does not seem to show.<br /><br />Before getting into shooting, I gave myself a tour of the Yi M1 and noted some small traits. The initial feel of the body is solid, though plastic. The tripod thread is stainless steel, but is not centered under the lens. In fact, it's not centered on the body. Of course you won't be able to change batteries while on a tripod.<br /><br />The body cap can be removed without pressing the lens release button, but once you mount one of the lenses you'll probably never use it. To collapse the kit zoom lens, press the “unlock” switch and keep rotating past the 12mm setting. Later, when you turn on the camera, it will warn you to unlock the lens for use.<br /><br />Initial setup is quick: choose English as your language and set time/date. You must slide your finger on the touchscreen to increment settings.<br /><br />Switching the camera on involves pressing the switch back against the body, which should allow quick response.<br /><br />You have three screens: settings, shooting, and color mode. Pressing the shutter while in settings or color mode automatically takes you back to the shooting screen, where you see f/stop, shutter speed and +/- EV settings, ISO, AF mode, while balance, images to go, battery state and wireless on/off.<br /><br />Speaking of that screen, it is large and bright. But it's not articulated, a feature I use all the time with my other cameras. Needless to say, there is no viewfinder.<br /><br />To get to the full settings menu, go to settings on the mode dial. I've not found a screen mode that includes level or histogram, two tools I regularly use.<br /><br />Overall, camera a bit cramped in my hands. There are deep dots under thumb and a sharp, rubbery finger grip area, so I never feel that it will slip away.<br /><br />There's a red AF assist light on the front, to the left (from operator's position) of shutter release. I turned it off in settings.<br /><br />There are shortcomings in setup, but we can hope that these limitations get remedies in future firmware releases. The most glaring, I think, is lack of a way to set the maximum ISO available in auto ISO.<br /><br />The lens mount on the camera is metal (yay!), but the bayonets on the lenses themselves are plastic (should I be saying “composite”?). Unfortunately, neither lens that came with the camera features optical stabilization.<br /><br />There's a hot shoe, but this strikes me as inappropriate to the overall traits of the camera. I wouldn't carry a separate flash to use with the M1. It's also interesting that a two-lens kit is offered with a 12-40mm (24-80mm in 35mm terms) variable-aperture zoom and a 42.5mm f1/8 prime that should be popular for portraits. Both lenses are unapologetically plastic. As I write this, Lightroom finds no profiles for the Yi lenses.<br /><br />Focus is all contrast detect, but nicely covers most of the screen. And you can use the touchscreen to tell it where to focus. There are, of course, a bunch of jpeg settings but since I shoot all raw, all the time, I'll be using the DNG setting.<br /><br />I often shoot in aperture priority mode with a three-shot exposure bracket. Sorry, once you set the camera to capture raw files, you loose exposure bracketing.<br /><br />I shot a few casual test shots around the house. One included objects inside my balcony door, outside and a brightly-lit house wall. Auto ISO went for 2,000 and I was shooting at f/5.6 and 1/100 sec. After tweaking both noise reduction and sharpening (in Lightroom), the image showed acceptable (not great) noise characteristics and sharpness. DXO Optics Pro 11 failed to recognize the DNG image files.<br /><br />A real test of dynamic range (how much bright to dark info the sensor can capture) involved an outdoor scene with bright highlights and dark shadows. I shot with the M1 and a Sony a6000 for comparison. It would have been grossly unfair to compare the Yi camera to my Sony A7R2, a top tier camera regarding dynamic range. I brought images into Lightroom, pulled highlights all the way down, lifted shadows all the way, then adjusted exposure until the images did not show highlight clipping (blown bright areas). The test images (posted here) clearly show less shadow detail in the M1 image.<br /><br />Why would  you want the Yi M1? Well, it's intended to be friendly to those wanting to step up from a phone camera, thus the screen-centric interface. But it would also have appeal to anyone interested in something larger than a pocket camera but smaller than APS-C. At 20MP resolution, the M1 offers the highest resolution of any micro four thirds (MFT) camera. It looks like a viable glove box camera to me, something I can keep in my car for opportunistic shooting.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AS OF 12/14/16<br />A firmeware update adds the ability to cap the ISO in auto ISO mode. Alas, it did not add the ability to AE bracket raw files. I should add that it's a bit obscure how to do the firmware update. It comes in a rar file that takes a special extraction program; why not a zip file?","This is an interesting entry into the mirrorless market.  The design looks like a Leica, but it's actually more compact.  I can't help but compare the kit to my Panasonic LUMIX GX85 4K Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Camera Kit.  The YI is a bit smaller, although the supplied lenses are larger than the compact Lumix lens.  The bottom line is that I'd highly recommend you spend a bit more money for the Panasonic.  It's a superior camera with comparable feature set.<br />OK, having said that, I will say that the YI is a cool little camera.  The shutter has a pretty loud click, for some reason.  You can set it to multiple exposures and it's pretty fast.<br />The included lens kit is perplexing.  There's a zoom, which is what you'll use most of the time.  Then they include a fixed focal length lens, that gives you some macro capability.  Both lenses are about the same physical size but the prime lens doesn't really extend your range since it's just 2.5mm longer than your zoom.  It's an odd choice.  I'd think some sort of longer telephoto lens would be much more useful.<br />The big picture on the YI is it feels well made and it's more compact that the Panasonic equivalent.  The user interface is not as intuitive as I'd like, but it's certainly usable.  I'd highly recommend you get your hands on one in person before you buy to evaluate it for yourself.  Or go with the Panasonic, which I can easily recommend as an alternative.","I recently purchased the YI M1 with the two lenses for under $350. Even without the special savings, it's an aggressively priced mirrorless camera at $500. Given that few 4K mirrorless cameras are under $500, it's great that the YI M1 offers it. While I find its performance to be great for still images, the lack of manual controls for 4K video recording restricts it from being a candidate for those who intend to be serious with video. Once you start shooting video, you're basically at the mercy of the automatic capture of the camera - so you can adjust things like white balance, shutter speed, aperture, or ISO.<br /><br />Despite that, I am pretty impressed by its still image quality. The 42.5mm f/1.8 lens in particular delivers an agreeable amount of sharpness to my subject, as well as given that soft focus bokeh effect to other elements. Like I said, it offers great value, but with a little more work over on the video side, it can potentially be an all-in-one solution","I am impressed it only needs a caver or an eye piece for monitor screen","This camera was FANTASTIC.<br /><br />I was so excited to get this camera after I had fallen in love with its little brothers (the YI Action Cameras). So when I got this I immediately went out and tried it out. The photos I included below are examples of pictures that I took.  I know these two pics aren't the most amazing things in the world, but for a guy who is just getting into photography I'd say this camera is great at what it does. Not to mention you can upgrade the camera from the phone app rather than having to upgrade it through a computer, is Amazing.<br /><br />I did see some of the issues that were stated before, however they WERE FIXED by a new update. I love this camera. It's great for a beginner like myself.","I purchased this camera with the 42.5 lens.  I very much like the image rendering form this camera. It works well with my other micro 4/3rd lenses.  But.....AF ISSUES<br /><br />I can accept somewhat slow AF if it is accurate. With this camera you literally have no clue what focus point it will use.  Even setting it on the center focus box, it randomly and erratically chooses a different focus point at least 50% of the time.  It's incredibly frustrating and you can not expect it will focus where you have it set.  And this is after updating with the latest firmware.<br /><br />If they can fix this with future firmware updates I will revisit this camera, as I like the IQ.<br /><br />Update:<br />I decided to re-purchase this camera with the 12-40 lens and the AF issues now seem to apply to my Panasonic Lenses.  Using the YI lens, I am not having the issues.  I don't know how Olympus lenses function as I don't own any.<br />I very much like the IQ rendering from this camera.  Hopefully YI will release some fast primes.","So far so good. Only problem is that sometimes it won't focus correctly but i hope future updates will fix it =)<br /><br />Update<br /><br />New firmware seems to fix the problem but still not 100% but its getting better now","This is the product I HAVE BEEN MOST excited about since it was announced..  I have been so excited that Amazon Trade-In has been my best friend helping me earn enough gift cards to buy this camera!  I know in the past Yi has asked me to review some of their products but this is one I have purchased.. Now I am just as excited for the Yi Erida Drone! HURRY AND RELEASE IT!!<br /><br />Planned Use:  I want to get a little deeper into photography and not just tinkering with my 10 year old DSLR that I purchased used or just taking photos with my Action Cameras..  I really feel this camera is great for someone like me who wants to learn a little more about photography but also keep it simple!  So far I think it is perfect for that!!  Id much rather spend only $500 for a learner camera instead of $1000+ on a leica!<br /><br />Short Review: EXCELLENT CAMERA for the price!!  This camera is perfect for someone like me who comes from a generation of smartphones!  I had NO ISSUES learning how to use this camera BUT I gave it to a friend who takes TONS of photos with a DSLR camera and he had issues learning because this camera has been dumbed down for the smartphone generation..  The touchscreen works GREAT and the camera has really been simplified by having limited buttons..  Photo quality, while I haven't had a long amount of time to test it out, is GREAT SO FAR!!  I plan to take it out tomorrow and shoot some fall photos that I will upload as a sample!!  I just received the camera tonight so tinkering is all I have gotten to do BUT I PLAN to update this review as I get more time to play with it..<br /><br />Build Quality:  While the camera looks like a Leica, this camera is made of plastic and not metal..  It is made of a high quality plastic that feels GREAT in hand, but if you are used to a heavier camera, this might feel a little cheap in hand..  This camera is actually a blessing that its not nearly as large or heavy as the 10 year old DSLR it is replacing..  Yi has also sourced VERY high quality parts for this camera.. During my research I have found that the mechanical shutter is made by the Japanese Company COPAL, and the sensor is made by Sony..  The lens mount is metal which was one of my worries originally.. I wasn't sure how a plastic lens mount would last so I am very glad it is made of metal..  Overall, the quality and design of this camera is GREAT.<br /><br />Pros<br />1.) Photo Quality - So far Photo Quality is excellent!! I will have some sample photos later in the week to upload!<br /><br />2.) EASY to use - Coming from a smartphone generation, the touchscreen was super easy for me to learn!!<br /><br />3.) Model Suggestions -  THIS FEATURE ROCKS!!  Basically the camera will suggest different ways to pose your model..  A stick figure shows up on the screen with the suggested pose that will look GREAT!!  I love this feature and wonder why YI is the first to think of it!<br /><br />4.) GREAT VALUE - For $500 you get the body and one lens.. Panasonic has camera bodies that you can get for slightly less BUT you will have to buy a lens making it cost more.<br /><br />5.) Wireless Connectivity and Bluetooth LE<br /><br />6.) Supports RAW photos<br /><br />7.) Video quality so far is great<br /><br />8.) Scene & Shooting Modes - This camera has a TON of scenes and shooting modes, again, making it great for someone learning about cameras and photography..<br /><br />9.) Manual Modes - You can manually use EVERY bit of this camera which is GREAT when you want those professional shots<br /><br />10.) Shutter Speeds - Slowest shutter speed of 60s and 1/4000s as the fastest<br /><br />11.) Manually Adjust ISO - ISO range 100-256000<br /><br />12.) Focus - Includes Manual and Auto Focus<br /><br />13.) Includes leather neck strap<br /><br />14.) MFT Lens - Giving you thousands of Lens Options! ANY MFT lens should fit!<br /><br />15.) Flash - There is not an included flash but you can attach a flash to the camera!! The camera DOES offer a Auto Focus assist flash though, but it's just a red light<br /><br />16.) Small and compact! No more lugging that old DSLR up the mountains when I hike!!<br /><br />17.) Packaged like a PREMIUM camera and FEELS like a Premium camera!<br /><br />Cons<br />1.) Limited YI branded accessories at the moment.. No extra batteries, looks like the case hasn't been released yet, and cant buy the lens on their own at this time.<br /><br />2.) As of now, the first firmware update MUST be installed manually using a SD card.. I received this email from Yi after I ordered the camera with instructions on how to do that<br /><br />3.) Doesn't seem to support RAW+ JPG.. I know, I shouldn't be shooting in RAW+ JPG but I do like having both formats when I take photos!! Maybe a firmware upgrade will allow this<br /><br />4.) Touchscreen at times doesn't seem to be as sensitive as one on a mobile phone.. But that didn't cause me any issues<br /><br />Overall: So far I am impressed with this camera.. The few sample photos I took inside far surpassed my expectations!!  The quality is excellent!! And the price is even better","Update 1/7/2017: YI claims that the latest firmware fixed the problems with Image Stabilization and Exposure jumping erratically.<br /><br />Update: The low light performance of this camera is awful.  Please see sample shot when there was still some daylight in the sky.<br />[...]<br />The good:<br />First I will say that I really want to love this camera and the 3 stars that I'm giving it is extremely generous and only because the problems may get better with future software and firmware updates.  The MFT Sony 20 megapixel image sensor is really good for a camera in this price range.  Note that it crops before it bins the image for 4K video recording so it is a little more zoomed in and it doesn't use the full sensor for video.  The box is very well packed with thick foam to protect the camera.  The body is solid and the lens is a decent starter lens for the price.  The USB cable is very good quality and snaps perfectly into the charging port.<br /><br />The most obvious auto-focusing problems were resolved with the updated firmware I downloaded on 10/19/2016.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Lots of camera lock-ups even after I updated firmware from SD card on 10/19/2016.  This mainly happens when I try to record 4K video.  Once it locked up for so long that I had to pull the battery.  Other times it would lock up for minutes at a time.  YI claims my SD card is causing these problems because it isn't fast enough, but my SD card can read 600 Mbps and write 240 Mbps which clearly exceeds the 75 Mbps 4K requirements.<br /><br />The image stabilization in video is very problematic and produces some very strange warping distortion in the video.  Someone posted a sample of the problems here [...].  There are also strange exposure flickering problems where the video flashes back and forth from dark to bright.  Given that I paid $499 on Amazon which is much higher than the $325 price in China, I'm not too happy about paying a huge premium to be a beta tester.<br /><br />The Android App is very primitive.  There is no Wi-Fi live video preview for you to remotely compose your shot or video.  I asked Yi support by email before buying this camera and Yi Technology support assured me by email that it had low latency Wi-Fi preview like the Yi 4K Action camera.  I guess it's true that there's no preview latency over Wi-Fi since there's no preview over Wi-Fi at all!  I bought this camera based on the reputation of the Yi 4K action camera and I am disappointed.  The app also only lets you download photographs but not videos.  The app setup and getting connected is awkward and it puts too much focus on the tutorial for how to take good portraits than useful functionality.  YI claims that the Wi-Fi preview function in smartphones is coming, but I was told by YI support that it already supports low latency preview.  That deception caused me to buy this camera in the first place so I am very unhappy about this.<br /><br />The settings are confusing because you need to swipe right and swipe up to get to additional settings like the video settings.  The manual is very vague and skips a lot of these crucial steps so a first time user can easily get frustrated.<br /><br />The Wi-Fi is only 2.4 GHz which is another disappointment compared to the dual-band Yi 4K Action Camera.  Even if the future smartphone App supports Wi-Fi preview, it will have to contend with the interference prone 2.4 GHz band which will cause problems. Why couldn't YI Technologies have matched the experience of their cheaper Yi 4K Action Camera?"]},{"name":"Canon EOS 5D Mark IV","amazon_reviews":["While it is expensive, features like 4k video, touch screen and auto-follow focus - not to mention 120fps at 1080 - are absolute winners in my book.

Their digital line has impressed me over the years throughout product evolution.  As an owner of every EOS 5D model since the original, this model is just as impressive as with each generational upgrade.  I bought a 5DS for architectural photography, which it delivers impressive image resolution; but for weddings the 5DS was overkill.  As an upgrade to my 5DMIII, I needed something that could perform without resolution overkill.  The answer is the 5DMIV!<br /><br />First off, resolution is just right.  30MP is just what I needed for wedding and portrait photography.  50MP is too much and 22 MP is no longer competitive.  Albeit I have gotten great image enlargements out of my 22MP cameras.  The ability to crop further is enticing to me!<br /><br />The touch screen is an amazing upgrade!  It makes surfing through menu functions so much faster and easier.  Having the additional information within the viewfinder; such as shooting modes - is a hit!  The burst rate is much better on this model than before.  With a good CF card that has a 80MB/s data rate, one can ensure they aren't missing that perfect shot.<br /><br />Overall - wonderful camera.  I cannot say how much I am impressed in one review.  I hope to update my review once I have experienced the product a little further - perhaps once wedding season fires up again!<br /><br />If your asking if it is a better upgrade (Or worth the $$$) over getting a new Mark 3; don't question it - it is worth the extra money!","first impressions are quiet shutter that feels much better than the Mk IV but the substantial increase in options makes it more difficult to find the ones I want; I guess I will learn my way around soon.","An worthy upgrade from the Canon 5D Mark III, in terms of much faster focus speed, improved dynamic range and better low light sensitivity. Very glad I upgraded and am very happy with this camera. The 5D Mark III now goes to our daughter.","While I hated to spend the cash, this is a significant upgrade over the Mark III and worth the price.","Exceptional.","I won't go over all the features of this camera this that has already been covered before. I'll just tell you that if you're only looking at a sheet of specs and price, this camera might not be as appealing as others, however, when you buy a Canon like the 5D, you're paying for QUALITY and reliability.<br /><br />When I first made the switch from APS to Full Frame, I was shooting with Nikon and I was deciding between the 5D Mark II and the D600. I luckily chose the 5D because the D600 turned out to have some major design issues, and according to users, the camera was useless due to some stains on the sensor. I took more than a year for Nikon to replace these cameras with the new D610. OVER A YEAR. I always think that if I had bought the D600, I would have been stuck with a camera that doesn't work for a long time and probably lost a lot of business on the way.<br /><br />Again, you can keep looking for other options with higher specs (if you use the camera mainly for video then definitely look for some other options) but if you want a high quality, reliable camera with the best set of lenses available, you won't regret buying this camera. I still use my 5D Mark II, I've shot over 100K photos and it has never failed me. This is why you buy a Canon.<br /><br />Also, what I love about the new 5D Mark IV:<br />- More resolution<br />- Improved dynamic range<br />- Improved low light quality<br />- Improved focusing system<br />- Touch screen","Better in every way over the Canon 5D Mark III. Much better dynamic range, better AF, better noise in high ISOs, built in GPS, built in wireless, and even manages to weigh slightly less than the Mark III. No more banding when trying to recover details in shadows.<br /><br />Battery usage is a little higher due to GPS polling. You can change this however to a few different time intervals to suit your needs.<br /><br />The sensor is not as good as the top of the line Sony sensors but you give up Canon's extensive lenses, better ergonomics, CPS.","I was so excited for this camera. I'd been waiting months to buy it. Well, surprise surprise, today while playing with it I realized that when filming at 120 fps (which was one of the main reasons I bought this), that there's NO AUTO FOCUS OR SOUND. Wow, that's practical! What's the point even including 120 fps then. And worst of all, this fact is hidden in all specs and descriptions online. What a huge disappointment. I mean, the 120 fps is only available at 720p anyway, which is not a huge resolution to be offering 120 fps anyway (GoPro does 240 fps at 720).","Photo quality wise, I don't notice any upgrade from the mark II and mark III.  Images look better on the amazing LCD screen than they do on the computer!<br /><br />The wifi and time lapse features are great to have and work really well.<br /><br />It is such a bummer dealing with the crop video. The files sizes are huge, but I don't think I would even care if the crop was not on there. Have to drop it down to 1080 for wide angle shots.<br /><br />The video autofocus is amazing. So accurate and smooth.","I write this review from the perspective of an advanced photographer who does the occasional video. For three and a half years, I owned the 5D Mark III; its responsiveness and the image quality it delivered with a good lens made it less a camera and more an extension of my mind and eye, faithfully recording the grand landscapes, events, and decisive moments I was privileged to see. The upgrade to the IV was more a personal choice, rather than from being compelled by any major limitation of the III. I've used it now for more than a month, and feel I know enough to write a review.<br /><br />A 5DIII user will find the controls very familiar; I was able for the most part to start using it without referring to the manual. This is a good thing - all that muscle memory you built will remain useful. The shutter feels softer and quieter, a design carried over from the 5DS/R to reduce vibration. The viewfinder phase detect AF is everything you expect from a camera like this - I had no problems with my 24-70 II, 70-200 II, 135 or 85 1.8 at maximum apertures. Tracking appears improved, although I need a bit more time to say definitively. Perhaps the biggest surprise is the touchscreen. After a month, I find myself using it more and more in preference to the joystick when navigating the menu. Dual Pixel Autofocus is as as fast as advertised - certainly as fast as viewfinder AF. What I found pleasantly surprising was that I seem to be able to get sharp shots at exposure times well over 1/focal length seconds using this method. You do have to get past the ergonomic considerations of shooting with a heavy camera held at arms length though, and it is probably better used with smaller lenses versus something like a 70-200.<br /><br />In terms of image quality - you will certainly notice the extra resolution. For the times you don't need it or are not able to use it effectively, the camera helpfully offers lower resolution RAW modes. I find the 17 MPix MRAW mode is very useful for run of the mill shooting needs giving something reasonably close to the resolution of a 6D or 5D III. The camera's JPG engine is clearly improved over the 5D III. The fine detail mode is a nice addition. I gave up on shooting JPG with the III due to the soft detail and very aggressive NR even at base ISO. On the IV, you can probably shoot JPG in a fairly broad range of conditions.<br /><br />The dynamic range - which was the main reason I upgraded - is certainly better than the III. The early fall morning shots I took with the camera clearly showed it capturing a greater range of tones than my old III. Shadows are much cleaner - at base ISO, the IV has less than half the read noise of the III. The complete absence of banding or pattern noise makes this an even bigger advantage, and this is easily seen and much appreciated when you work on RAW files. The camera does appear, for the most part, to be ISOless. What I mean by this is that once you know your aperture and shutter speed, you are better off shooting (in RAW) at low ISO and then boosting in post. I've taken shots at ISO 400 and boosted by 3.2 stops in Lightroom (the equivalent of ISO 3675) and get very clean images. The benefit of this is that you preserve the greater dynamic range available at low ISO versus throwing away the highlights during in camera amplification. One application I've found this useful for is when shooting in challenging and changing light conditions such as stage events. I've taken to setting my aperture and shutter speed for DOF and movement and simply shooting at low ISO, with confidence that I will not overexpose highlights, and can easily recover a 3+ stop underamplification of darker regions in post with no noise penalty. This makes me less reliant on metering accuracy gives me more time to focus on composition and timing. I do find this to be a significant advantage versus the Mark III, and one I have come to appreciate very much as I have spent more time with the camera.<br /><br />It does bear noting that the noise advantage of the IV over older Canon sensors, particularly the 6D, diminishes significantly at high ISO. This is because at high ISO, the dominant read noise is the upstream read noise from the sensor as opposed to the noise from A/D conversion. Increasingly amplified with ISO, it swamps the conversion noise which is the only component benefitting from on chip ADC and which is unaffected by ISO (the upstream read noise of the 6D, once scaled for pixel size, is actually lower than that of the 5D IV; in contrast, the conversion noise of the 5D IV is much lower than that of the 6D. Both cameras have lower pixel size scaled upstream read noise than the 5D III.) I've included a more detailed technical discussion in the Comments section for those interested.<br /><br />The biggest advantage for videographers will be the availability of AF when filming. This feature alone has led to me using the video functionality more frequently than with the III. Even with this, I consider myself at best an occasional videographer, and don't do much 4K, so the video features are adequate for now; I would defer to other reviewers for more detailed commentary (update: I have done a little 4K video now; the quality is great, but the video is clearly a space hog, and processing is an exercise in patience). There is no question though, that Canon has deliberately hobbled this camera. Implementing a log profile to preserve dynamic range, a more compressed 4K codec, and other helpful features are all relatively simple firmware additions that Canon chose not to make to preserve product segmentation and the higher margins they get from their dedicated video cameras. They may well come to regret this, given the direction that Sony has taken, and one hopes the prospect or reality of lost market share, or perhaps the efforts of the intrepid folks at ML, will make these available in future firmware updates.<br /><br />Overall, the 5D Mark IV is a superbly capable photography tool that addresses some of the shortcomings of what is already a very good camera, and will allow you to use your abilities to take great pictures in a wide variety of situations and enjoy yourself immensely doing it. Almost by necessity, it feels like a bit of a smaller step up from the III than that camera was over its predecessor. The features in the 5D Mark III made it one you could take into situations where a 5D II simply wouldn't perform. In contrast, you're likely to use the 5D IV in much the same way as you would the III, and the newer camera will do the job better. This is not at all a bad thing and probably reflects the reality that DSLR development is closing in on its asymptotic limit, and perhaps also how good a job Canon did with the Mark III. If you can afford the 5D IV, you'll enjoy the greater shooting and editing flexibility and the ability to capture better photographs in a somewhat expanded range of conditions versus its predecessor. You'll no doubt also find yourself taking more videos due to the convenience and ease of focus tracking through dual pixel AF. Features like the intervalometer, touchscreen, WiFi and GPS are nice additions, although they are not primary attributes for me in determining camera choice. If you are upgrading from a 5DII or crop frame and are on a budget, I can attest, through the several tens of thousands of photographs I've taken with the 5DIII, that it remains a great camera and, at current used prices, very good value for your money.<br /><br />Image notes: The first and third photographs were shot using a 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II - as flawless a lens as I've shot with - the second with an 85mm f/1.8 and the last one with a wonderfully sharp (but unfortunately, rented) 35mm f/1.4L II. The second photograph was shot at ISO 400 and pushed 3 stops in post- something that you really couldn't do with the III -  and illustrates the point about \"ISOless\" shooting. Note that the underexposure applies only to ISO - regardless of camera, you want to maximize the photon signal incident on the sensor - without blowing the highlights - to minimize shot noise as a proportion of the signal, and you do this through maximizing aperture and exposure time subject to other shooting constraints like DOF and movement. This is obviously also the basic premise behind ETTR. The third photograph of the dancer was taken in single shot mode - one shot, one capture - using AI Servo and illustrates the tracking speed and precision of the focusing system.<br /><br />Additional information: I won't make a buy/no buy recommendation, since this is really dependent on each individual circumstance. If you've read this far, I wanted to share a few resources I've found useful, all publicly available for free: Emil Martinec's 2008 paper on noise and bit depth is truly outstanding. Bill Claff's website is a great resource for data based noise comparisons between cameras as well as technical data on sensors such as full well capacity, read and conversion noise, etc. That data shows that the 5D IV's advantages over previous generation Canon sensors in the 6D and 5D III extends beyond just lower conversion noise due to on chip ADC. Roger Clark's website has some excellent material as well, and finally, DPReview is a wonderful website for real world comparisons and for finding explanations of very technical concepts such as noise, dynamic range, and ISO invariance in layman's terms.<br /><br />If you have a question, or notice something inaccurate in my review, please leave a comment and I will answer to the best of my knowledge.

Thank you for reading!","We love this Canon 5D Mark IV Camera.  We have the 5D Mark IIi and the 5D and the pictures from these two cameras do not compare to the quality of the pictures from this camera.  Have not tried the video yet but will soon. We wondered if the step up would be worth it and it was.","I have Mark III and in video Mark 4 is the best","Upgraded from a 6d. It's a great camera for the working photographer. I don't think is the best option for a videographer, but if you do videos occasionally it will work for that as well. If I was taking pictures for myself I would probably invest in a smaller mirrorless system, but for professional work I think this is still the most reliable system. (shot 10+ jobs before giving this review)","There are already a lot of technical review of the IV posted so I will not bore you with another. I have been using it for a few weeks and I am thoroughly impressed. I have been a Canon user for 40 years and have had about 20 Canon film and digital SLRs. This is, perhaps, best DSLR that I have ever owned. It handles well, has great image quality, does everything that I need it to do, and has some great bells and whistles. Sure, there are DSLRs that have one spec or another that is a bit better than the IV but, as an all around body, it is tough to beat. I have no substantive criticism. Pair it with Canon L glass and you have the current state of the art in your hands.","Absolutely love this lenses! Not only for the quality but also for how much inspiration and creativity I been getting from my experience! It opens a new world of possibilities in artistic and conceptual photography. Besides of that, it's hell of fun! So far it's being pure joy!","This is an amazing camera! Huge improvements over the prior Mark III. A pleasure to use.","The box the camera came in was fantastic. Nice and spacious for the camera. I purchased because I was trying to sell my old camera. I had the Canon EOS T5 Rebel which was okay. It was fine when I first started photography and film but I needed an upgrade.<br />I tried to sell the T5 once I got this camera. I put my old camera up on craigslist and got a couple of spam offers but one guy actually seemed interested. We planned to meet up one day at a lunch restaurant to do the transaction. I put my camera in the lens box that came with this item. It fit absolutely perfectly. It fit the base of the T5, 2 lenses, a battery, and adaptor quite well. I felt like I had re-packaged the camera. It fit so nicely in the box I was so ready to sell it to this guy on craigslist.<br />He didn't show up. Yep. No show. Didn't even let me know he was gonna bail out. A real bummer. He missed a very nicely packaged T5 Rebel Bundle. Oh well. I will keep the T5 nicely tucked away in this amazing box until I can successfully sell again.<br /><br />Also, the 5D Mark IV is pretty nice.","I went from a Canon 5D mark II to a Sony A7RII, then back to the Canon 5D mark IV. I love megapixels, but I couldn't get the deep colors of Canon with my Sony. All my photos were flat, and needed post processing. I'm not a fan of post processing, and all of my pics needed it with Sony.<br /><br />This camera is off the hook. Amazing color renditions!","I'm really happy with my 5Div so far.  The focusing is fast and accurate and it has less noise than my 5D3 did.  Since I do a lot of theatre photography, that is really important for me.","Canon EOS 5DIV fits nicely as a versatile FF between the 6D and the 5DS/R and represents a solid upgrade from the 5DIII. Canon wanted the 5DIV to addresses three key shortcomings of the 5DIII by giving the 5DIV improved AF, better DR and more MPIX. And Canon succeeded. Many hoped for more than 30 MPIX but for them the 50 MPIX 5DS/R remains an attractive alternative. Overall the 5DIV is a reliable, well-balanced stills camera with an impressive sensor. Only the current price level and limited video options speak against the 5DIV and make it lose a star here.<br /><br />Handling: Coming from the 5DIII/5DS/R you will find this camera body very familiar – all the way down to the battery. It is the forth generation 5D-series camera and the entire button and screen layout feels very mature and natural. There are however several important upgrades. Most notably the quick AF select button and the touch screen. Two useful, practical additions that I am very happy about and makes using the camera easier. The body feels as solid as the 5DIII even if lighter and has improved weather sealing. 5DIV is a camera built to last many years.<br /><br />The body is clearly made for still photography. The weight alone makes shooting videos without a tripod a dog because of the combined weight of camera & lens & the fact that the 5DIV can only shoot video using live view. Once again Canon has missed out on providing either in-body IS or a swivel screen for decent hand held video operation. And Canon – I’d really like both.<br /><br />I do not shoot video much myself, so will not review this or address the controversy regarding the codec Canon uses. There are several other reviews focusing specifically on this. What I will note is that Canon claims its possible to rip excellent 8 MPIX stills from the 5DIV video shots. I have not had a chance to try this myself and hardly any reviews demonstrate the usefulness of this feature.<br /><br />The software menu is close to the 5DS/R menu with a few nice extras to go. Compared to the 5DIII it’s noticeably better. The touch screen with its user selectable menu items adds to the package. Still, Canon’s menu system is reaching the limit of user friendliness. When Canon gave the 5DIV a touch screen they should have redesigned the entire menu system for touch screen. Apple long ago demonstrated how touch can work wonders for user friendliness. This does not change the fact that compared to the 5DIII/5DS/R the touch screen is a blast for changing settings quickly without fiddling with buttons and sub menus.<br /><br />The 5DIV retains the expanded custom settings available for defining your own C1-C3 shooting options. These can be extremely useful if set up correctly. However, again Canon defies our expectations when it comes to custom settings by limiting certain buttons to certain functions. Still, all owners should consider learning how to use C1-C3 actively. I have pre-settings for action, bracketed jpeg shooting and shooting against the sun.<br /><br />Battery time is said to be shorter than for the 5DIII but I did not find it much of a difference except if using the gps/wifi functions. If you shut gps/wifi down you can go far on a single battery. I suggest new owners get one extra spare battery at first – and add more if needed.<br /><br />The screen is excellent – and you can easily see if your pictures are sharp. New for the 5DIV is that you can set the white balance of the screen. It’s not perfect but you can get a better idea of your result if used wisely. Despite some options for how to scroll through your pictures they are still curiously limited. Here the touch screen saves the day by offering swipe in playback mode and pinch to check focus. Most important is probably the ability to tap-to-focus in video mode. Its not only cool but with the improved AF system in live view its never been easier to track the face of a person through a live video shot.<br /><br />Generally, the 5DIV is very responsive and quick to operate. From pressing the “on”-button to AF and shooting to checking the results on-screen.<br /><br />Basic Settings & AF: Everything you need and then some. Amongst the essentials the 5DIV has wide auto-bracketing (up to 7 frames) and Canon has an excellent implementation of auto-iso all the parameters you could wish for. You can confidently rely on auto-iso to make “smart” choices. Finally, as before the \"Green\" auto-setting also works with RAW files which is great whenever I hand the camera over to my family members.<br /><br />AF is a key area where the 5DIV is a significant upgrade compared to the 5DIII. Already the 5DS/R got improved AF but the 5DIV is another step up. Compared to the 5DIII it has upgraded and expanded AF points and highly customable ways to employ these – like restricting the use to cross-type AF sensors. Several AF points can focus in lower light than the 5DIII – and even if a stop down from ev -2 to ev-3 does not sound like a lot it makes a very real difference.<br /><br />Together with its dual pixel AF the 5DIV clearly boosts the best AF of the 5D series so far. I mostly shoot sports and moving subjects so AF is very important to me. So trust me when I say that the 5DIV AF is a noticeable upgrade from the 5DIII - which never impressed me - and even a little better than the 5DS/R - which did impress me. Still, Canon AF is not perfect and Canon users still must wait for smart AF settings such as eye-focus AF.<br /><br />Recording options: 5DIV has a video crop “mode”. But it’s forced on you for 4K video shooting – and so most video shooters see it as a limitation. There's no crop mode for stills. 5DIV does offer compressed RAW files which can be useful in an emergency.<br /><br />The RAW buffer has been criticized as has Canons choice of a CF-slot instead of CF-fast slot. As expected the two card slots can be set individually to record in all modes and combinations. If the lack of a CF-Fast slot is important to your shooting you may want to look at a Dx-model instead. The 7 fps of the 5DIV is excellent but if you need fast – as in mission critical fast – look elsewhere.<br /><br />A novelty with the 5DIV is the ability to shoot dual pixel shots and adjust the focus in post-processing. At first I was taken aback at this opportunity but in real life use this is less useful than it may sound as the margins depend on several factors including shooting double pixel shoots. This will not only produce 80 MPIX+ RAW files but also slow down your camera. I did not have time to properly process any such pictures for this review. I commend Canon for its innovative approach and hope we will see more – and better – implementation of this promising feature in the future.<br /><br />30 MPIX is a decent but not a compelling upgrade from the 23 MPIX 5DIII. In fact, the jump up to the 50 MPIX 5DS/R and 5DIV is larger – even measured in percentage increase in pixels on each side of your RAW file. You do notice the difference from the 5DIII, but 5DS/R users will also notice the difference downwards from the 5DIV. Seems to me that Canon wanted to protect the 5DS/R from being cannibalized from a too potent 5DIV. The 5DIV also comes with a motorized shutter like the 5DS/R. I simply love it. It makes shooting the 5DIII seem loud and old-school.<br /><br />Image quality: The 5DIV sensor is excellent and another step up from the 5DS/R. Canon has consistently been improving its sensors from the 5DIII. First with the 6D, then the 5DS/R and now the 5DIV. Compared to the 5DIII Canon wanted to improve DR. Already the 5DS/R came with a nice DR boost and the 5DIV does even better. It’s still not as good as the competition but the gap has closed somewhat now. And it’s not the miracle brew some people make it out to be. You will still have typical night scenes showing blown highlights and 100% blacks side-by-side. But every improvement is useful and it’s a very noticeable upgrade compared to the 5DIII at the lower iso levels with the 5DS/R on its side being closer to the 5DIV than the 5DIII.<br /><br />For daily use I will shoot the 5DIV comfortably even @ iso 3,200. And even use iso 12.800 for acceptable results when absolutely needed. Here it helps that the 5DIV like the 5DS/R has a very nice noise pattern making cleaning up noise much easier.<br /><br />The Camera handles different light situations very well. Canon still does not offer light metering according to the selected AF point. It is such an obvious option that it’s difficult to understand why Canon lags the Nikon and SONY here. White balance has improved over the 5DIII and it comes with the anti-flickr that all newer Canon models have (which is very useful).<br /><br />Color output is beautiful, balanced and well-rounded. I see nothing lacking with the 5DIV.<br /><br />Other thoughts: Micro adjustment works well as expected. Micro adjustment is so important for optimizing your results that I strongly encourage everyone to test their lenses as the first thing to do after getting a new camera.<br /><br />Wi-Fi and GPS are nice additions. I still think Canon’s Wi-Fi system is one of the worst imaginable. It needs a very, very serious update to be user friendly. Many will probably never use the feature – its that’s bad. GPS is straight forward: just turn it on. It has settings you can tweak to avoid too much battery drain. Still, I managed to turn it off without noticing – no doubt a user fault but I still wonder how that happened?<br /><br />The sum up: The Canon EOS 5DIV is an extremely capable camera for still photography with some weak points when it comes to videos. Canon could have done more on the “gadget” side of things and added a few more MPIX to an otherwise excellent sensor. The bottom line is that the 5DIV is a very safe choice and you can shoot virtually anything with it and get great results. The only drawback – except for video – may be the current price which seems high compared to the competition. If you are an existing Canon user there’s however much less need to look to the competition than before the arrival of the 5DIV.<br /><br />That leaves us with a key question: what should 5DIII users do? I mostly suggest “skipping” one generation of a camera series. However, the 5DIV sensor and its improved AF is such a compelling upgrade over the 5DIII that its worth the upgrade.","I have had versions 2 and 3 of 5D Mark series and Canon has built a excellent update with the 4. They have made nice refinements, love the touch screen, love the multiple user menu windows, love that the chip is much better than previous versions and these cameras are pretty bomb proof. I have never, knock on something, had one miss a beat in literally hundreds of thousands of shots.","It is an excellent piece of kit, a still camera, with a good reach with solutions into  the areas of problems  which you would normally walk away.from. It is a worthy member of the 5D family, I am familiar with them all.","I love it ??","perfer over the 5dsr which I also have. 30mp is a perfect size and not overdoing the ability of this sensor. iso1600 is very clean compared to the mark 3, 6d, 5dsr.","I have been waiting for a camera that performs well in low light and one that can also achieve good dynamic range. Having already invested into the canon system over the last several years, meant I would not switch to Sony or Nikon, even though they both have good performing cameras. My main shooter has been a 7D Mark II for the past couple of years.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great low light performance. For me, easily acceptable images up to ISO 16000. Even ISO 25600, but it gets muddy.<br />- Dynamic range is very improved over my 7D Mark II & newer 760D; I can really boost those shadows several stops without added noise.<br />- 30MP sensor shows a lot of detail.<br />- Touch screen is awesome! I find my self missing it when I switch to the 7D Mark II.<br />- Focus speed is fast, but to be honest the 7D Mark II focus seems just as fast.<br />- Area focus zones, zone switch button, and general design carried over from the 7D Mark II - awesome!<br />- Focus point lights up in red.<br />- Exposure meter in manual mode at the bottom of the view finder, where it should be! 7D Mark II has this on the right side of the view finder.<br />- More customization of button functions, allows quick switch from One Shot to Servo<br />- GPS works, and works well, can leave on without battery drain. 7D Mark II took several min for it to begin logging.<br />- Over all build and sealing seems as good as the 7D Mark II.<br />- 1080p video @ 60p looks great! Does not overheat when shooting 4K.<br />- Takes same cards & batteries as the 7D Mark II.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Focus points are not far enough out, my 7D Mark II has a better distribution. I found I do more focus and re-compose with the 5D Mark IV.<br />- Lack of articulating screen. I think this could of been added while still maintaining the tank build of the camera.<br />- 4K video MJPEG codec - it has some benefits, but honestly the file size is too big to work with quickly. Sony Vegas chokes, but will work.<br />- No HDMI 4K out.<br />- Some lenses need peripheral illumination correction turned off for jpeg. Since it's a global setting, I just left it off. I shoot raw anyway.<br />- Battery life seems to be on average around 500-600 shots, I thought it should be closer to 800.<br /><br />Overall I'm very pleased with the camera. I love the canon controls & design, as well as the auto ISO setup compared to Nikon. I'm not heavy into video, but I plan on mostly shooting 1080p, and I'll leave the 4K to my lx-100, so the lack of better 4K capabilities is only a minor annoyance. My old 550D would overheat when shooting 1080p, and the Sony cameras also overheat on 4K, so far the 5D Mark IV has been working reliably. On the stills side, the camera performs great, the sensor provides sharp images with very nice details, even though there is a low pass AA filter - good glass helps; like the 85mm f1.8 from Tamron :)","great Quality<br />Still trying to figure out the Video","This camera has totally redefined the 5 D camera line. Outside it puts you at ease with its familiar looks. Under the hood is a whole new level of technology and refinement. There are too many positive aspects of this camera to name here.  However, touch screen, improved AF, intuitive menu and work flow efficiency just to name a few.As a working professional this camera will save me time while presenting new opportunities and therefore make me more money.","Fantastic camera, upgraded from 5dMarkII and 7D.  High ISO files are so much cleaner.  Camera feels familiar, I have not had to look for where the buttons are, but it is light years beyond the mark II.  I've shot 3 weddings since receiving it and have been amazed with the results.  My only complaint so far is the battery life, it is much shorter than the 5dMarkII and the 7D.  I have the battery grip though, so it's not a huge concern.","This is based upon a loan from Canon under the CPS program.  I am a loyal Canon fanboy and am grateful for the loan of this very nice camera.  Up front I want to say that I have the 5DSR which is an amazing camera.  So, I am a little jaded.  I am a landscape photographer and shoot 95% of my images using a tripod for very detailed resolution.  I currently have the 5DMKII as an emergency backup.  So, I was looking at this camera as a new backup allowing me to retire my MKII or have it converted to infrared.  The MK IV is nearly an exact replica of the 5DSR operationally.  My main purpose in testing it was to determine if the sensor issue was solved.  I think it is much improved.  However, even at 30MP it does not compare to the resolution and brilliance of the 5DSR.  Moreover, the price is pretty high for a backup. In fact, it is high enough that I will probably buy a 2nd 5DSR.  I have no need for the fast shutter because I don't do sports, nature or video and the WIFI doesn't mean all that much to me.  I also shoot everything around 100 ISO even in low light (long exposure)  and don't have a need to push high speed in low light.  If you shoot sports, weddings, events, video and nature, this camera will work perfectly.  For Landscapes and architecture and other fine detailed applications, not so much.","i have taken about 500 photos with Canon 5D Mark IV so far and clearly I see the improvements from Mark III in every aspects. I have had 5D Mark III for about 2 years and loved the camera but after I upgraded with Mark IV, I am much happier.<br />It is more than an excellent camera.<br />I don't use a video function much so I pass to comment on that.","I just purchased this camera last week as an upgrade from the mark 3.  I am loving this camera!  As a professional Wedding Photographer this camera is a worthy upgrade for me.  My first impressions of the camera make me come to the conclusion that the upgrade is worthy for several reasons:  The focusing is much improved!  After culling my images from Saturdays wedding, I found much less focus mistakes.  I also noticed a big difference in focusing in low light.  Another noteworthy feature is the much improved iso performance.  I think I shot in the one of the darkest church's in my career on Saturday, having to bump up my iso to 32,000 I was so impressed with how well it did.  Grant it there was some grain but truly not bad!  None of the purpleish/greenish grain in the high isos that I frequently encountered with the 5d3.  The dynamic range has much improved as well.  There were a few very over exposed images from my Saturday wedding and I was so happy I was able to retrieve them in lightroom.  On the Mark3  I would have been able to improve that image but I would not have been able to save the whites and would have most likely deleted it or turn it  black and white.  Not only was my church super dark on Saturday but so was the venues dance floor.  I noticed many reviews talking about the awesome live view mode.  I was able to test that out on the dark dance floor and I was blown away.  This feature worked amazing and I think will benefit so many wedding photographers.  Another notable for mark 3 users upgrading is how similar the controls are set up , so it makes transitioning to the mark 4 really easy.  I must also say I love the touch screen is so fantastic.  If you are a working professional that shoots frequently in low light situations I highly reccomend this camera!","Holy macorole, I just found out my wife bought this camera under my account. Ehhh, what's $4K when you're making $9/hour. I'll be ok and honestly I was trying to figure out why my wife has been so nice to me lately. She's got a camera worth more than our kids and cars put together. And like every other stay at home mom that has created an instant success as a \"professional photographer,\" I am proud. Of 9,682,873 photos we have of our children, we've found a few to put on our wall and it's worth every penny of that $4K.","I'm writing this review as a hobbyist rather than professional photographer (that is, that sells photographs for a living). My first 5D was the Mark II, and I've used the Mark III for over 3 years myself, and instead of going through all the nitty-gritty of the Mark IV which you find elsewhere, I'm going to speak to mostly to the differences I've found in my day-to-day experiences and whether it's worth the upgrade for the hobbyist.<br /><br />First off, coming from the Mark III, the IV on the outside is very much similar, and you could mistake them at a glance.  The differences include a slightly rougher cap on top of the new Mark IV body (where the Canon brand label sits) whereas the Mark III had the same material extended from the body over the cap.  Perhaps it's a new material housing to play more nicely with the GPS/Wi-Fi?  There's also new switch to toggle face detection in Live View mode in the back.  The mode switch dial is also the newer Canon styles that bumps up a bit rather than the more flatter design of the Mark III.  Otherwise, for those coming from the Mark III, you can feel right at home picking up the Mark IV for the first time.<br /><br />In terms of shooting, I personally find the viewfinder to be brighter on the Mark IV than on the Mark III.  This could just be my units and maybe a bit of dust on the Mark III, but using the same lenses, I find the Mark IV viewfinder a joy to use, much like the Mark III's, and even a shade brighter!  The new Dual Pixel AF works as advertised, and is much faster than the Mark III at face detection and toggling between different subjects - a big improvement here.  The back review LCD is also a touchscreen now, which allows for your standard panning of shots as well as pinch-and-zoom.  Although many shooters will still opt for the familiar mechanical buttons, as a hobbyist that shares the camera for others to shoot as well as reviews them on the spot with many moms with Android/iPhones, it's so much easier now to have them use the touchscreen to flip from photo to photo, and to zoom in and out to see themselves and whether the shot is worth keeping ;)<br /><br />In terms of photo quality, the highlight is the improved dynamic range of the new 30MP sensor.  Although improved from the Mark II to the Mark III, I see a marked improvement for the Mark IV.  Pushing exposure on underexposed shots with the same ISO produces less banding on the same shots with the Mark III.  Although Canon is still behind Nikon in this area, I'm happy to see improvements in this area.  Auto-focus at lower light levels at the center point is also improved, so that helps with getting those low light shots as well.  As for overall crispness and quality of the shots (which of course, depends very much on the lens itself), I found photos were very similar on the Mark IV, which is not in anyway a let down given I thought the Mark III was overall excellent in terms of stills quality.<br /><br />Also as a hobbyist with a simple Lightroom workflow, I still have Lightroom 5.  With Adobe's latest Camera Raw 9.7, Adobe now supports the Mark IV, but you'll need the newest Lightroom 6 or Lightroom CC, which is another cost to add to your upgrade tally if you don't already have those versions and plan to use Lightroom.  Also, although Adobe will enable editing of the new Dual Pixel RAW format in Lightroom, it looks like, at least for now (as of late September 2016), it doesn't support any making micro-adjustments in focus that can be done in DPP.  I find that it's useful when shooting with fast primes like the Canon 50 f/1.2L where small adjustments can help you hit focus.<br /><br />Overall, another superb iteration of the Canon 5D line that hits many of the upgrade checkboxes, most particular in the area of dynamic range.  I'll update my review as I've gotten more behind-the-lens time with the Mark IV, and in particular, video shooting.  So, is the upgrade worth it for Mark III owners?  I would say for those of you shooting in more low light settings, the upgrades could make the additional cost worth it for you.  However, for many others, given that photo quality improvement from the Mark III is not revolutionary, I would say it may not be at the current MSRP for Mark III owners; maybe wait for the next Black Friday sale to bring the price down a bit.  Also, having used the Mark II as well myself, for those Mark II owners itching for the next big thing, with two generations of technology under its belt, the Mark IV is a worthy upgrade that you don't have to worry looking back on!","I own canon 5d Mark ii and Mark III .<br />I preordered this Mark IV and got it a short while ago. I did three major shooting projects including extensive video use. It is definitely night and day more advanced than any camera in terms of video function regarding auto focus. I am also very happy to see its enhanced focal ability when using the 50 mm f/1.2.  I am in the process of doing post editing using the dual pixel raw to handle some photos slightly out of focus on the eyes.<br /><br />My recommendation would be this : if you are looking for autofocus function from a dslr , get this camera a shot.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />For a Mark III user, I can tell you that photo quality wise you probably would not see major improvement unless you are dealing with HDR lighting conditions or if you are struggling with focus issues once in a while.<br /><br />I will update here once my experiments are done with the post editing.","Yes, pricy, but loving this camera! Jumped from a 5DII, and it is night/day in features, such as connecting via Wi-Fi to the EOS Utility, GPS, etc. The touch screen is superb. Been a Canon person forever, and never an issue. In fact, still have the first, a 1962 vintage SLR, and it works flawlessly. A big plus is all the 5DII accessories work, such as the batteries, AC adapter, etc. Now if Adobe would hurry to support it...","Very pleased with this having upgraded from a 5D Mark II. I was originally keen to upgrade to the Mark III when it came out but was put off by the initial negative reviews and the increased launch cost, only to see its reputation grow considerably in the time it was available making me regret my decision. The Mark IV again is not seen as revolutionary enough in some quarters – exactly as the Mark III was initially – but it substantially different to the Mark II and I decided it was time to ignore the nay-sayers and give it a go.<br /><br />And my first impression? I have been really stunned by the performance and changes since the Mark II and a weekend with it has shown me what a considerable upgrade it is – albeit quite complex in comparison.<br /><br />I probably shot around 70,000 frames on the Mark II covering wildlife, landscapes, weddings, astrophotography, timelapse and travel so I consider myself pretty familiar with the platform. However, the Mark IV is considerably more advanced and therefore has MANY more options. Consequently it has taken quite a bit of learning (and fun) experimenting with all the new options to see how it works. The manual is 700 pages! But I was still able to pick it up without any of this and see how much of an advance it is.<br /><br />Favourite changes compared to the Mark II<br />1) Autofocus – stunningly fast through the viewfinder. Hugely better than the Mark II. Nice to be able to select zones to focus with as well as just points.<br />2) Autofocus (live view) – I never used this before because it was so bad, but now it is stunning. I can even accurately focus an F11 combo (2x extender and F5.6 lens), something not possible through the viewfinder – even on the Mark IV which will only focus an F8 combo.<br />3) Drive. The speed of the drive is incredible compared to the Mark II (more than twice as fast). It is also nice to now have a silent shutter option at about half the noise level.<br />4) Wi-fi. This is really fantastic, simply because I can get images of the camera so quickly. From taking a personal photo to sharing it from my phone takes less than a minute. Previously this would take 10-15 minutes by the time I had started the computer and Lightroom and imported the photo. Makes me more likely to use it for personal use rather than just serious photography.<br />5) Resolution. The 50% bump in resolution is really noticeable. I can zoom in considerably more and the options for cropping are obviously much better. I also don’t seem to have any issue so far with soft images which people have said happens with high resolution sensors although I have only used L series lenses.<br />6) ISO. It is great to have auto ISO with programmable limits now compared to the 5D II but I have been really impressed at how far I can push it. 12800 was something I wouldn’t even consider going near with the Mark II but now the quality of this has really blown me away. More like an ISO 3200 image on the Mark II, maybe even better.<br />7) Ergonomics. There are more physical buttons on the Mark IV which, although I am learning, are clearly going to be useful for switching settings even more rapidly. The rating button was on the Mark III, but for me coming from the Mark II, this is a very welcome making sorting the images in the field much easier.<br />8) Batteries and cards. The Mark II battery still works in this (the LP-E6N has slightly more capacity but is otherwise identical) and of course the Compact Flash is still accepted. I would have liked a newer format option but for now this works well for me. Writing images from buffer seems plenty quick enough.<br />9) Timelapse. I do a lot of this and whilst I like my programmable external controller it looks to have enough features to make it practical to use the built in intervalometer instead.<br />10) Touchscreen. This is actually really useful, especially when focusing in live view, zooming images, or swiping through them – just as responsive as a good smartphone. I am finding I am using the camera in a different way like selecting focus for a video or picture on the back (it feels like I am chimping a LOT) but the focus is so darn good it seems a shame not to!<br /><br />Things I need to get used to<br />1) Battery life. I have been playing around a lot and GPS/Wi-fi have been left on for now, but it drops much more quickly than the Mark II.<br />2) Awkward ergonomics using touchscreen. Because your right hand grips the camera you need to loosen that to pinch zoom in/out. I have almost dropped the camera several times doing this. I guess the only option is to learn to pinch zoom with my left hand only or always use the strap!<br />3) Complexity. The camera has an order of magnitude more options than the Mark II. It has only been one weekend and I need to spend more time getting to know the camera but some bits I will probably never understand. This is probably less of an issue if your are coming from a Mark III.<br />4) Dual Pixel RAW.  I have yet to try Dual Pixel images as reviews suggested the effect was so negligible I haven’t yet tried.<br /><br />In summary I am really pleased I have made the change. I was concerned that the benefit wasn’t going to be enough to justify the cost to swap but I now think it is well worth it.<br /><br />Update:<br />Lightroom now supports the 5D Mark IV and the photos attached are just using the default settings in Lightroom (no extra sharpening etc). As you can see the full frame image is of a sunflower with a bee on it. I have included a 100% crop of this to show that the sensor has picked up even the individual hairs on the back of the bee despite it being tiny in the frame. This was handheld at 1/200s on a 24-105mm L lens set at 105mm.","I do mostly street style and editorial work and this body is a fantastic step up from my 6D. I've stuck with the 6D instead of upgrading to the 5D mark iii because it was one heck of a body for the price and it got the job done. Focus was sharp and low light shooting was a breeze but the slow FPS was not ideal.<br /><br />With the 5D mark IV though, I'm loving the 6-7 fps and the 41 crosstype focus points are well spaced so I'm shooting more keepers making culling in post much harder, a good problem to have. The AWB is more intuitive than my 6D but since I shoot in RAW, I've had more control in post. Now I find I only have to tweak WB a smidge, if at all. A caveat though, I shoot in natural light.<br /><br />The built in wifi is a feature that really made the 6D such a desirable body at its price. I still recommend that body to anyone who is looking to step into full frame shooting. The wifi on the 5D mark IV is faster and easier to setup but it uses the same app and was pretty seamless for me to get used to.<br /><br />All in all, I think this body is a great upgrade for someone who already owns a 6D or 5D and 5D mark ii. A mark iii owner will probably not feel the same bump in features.","There are so many professional reviewers all over the world already reviewing this camera that my .02 just isn't worth the effort it would take to type it all. So instead I'll keep it short and only give my .01 cents.<br /><br />Grip - I've seen some reviewers saying the grip has improved, I can't tell the difference but it still feels just as great in my hands as the MK III so that's a good thing.<br /><br />Buttons - The top wheel feels smoother and better as I switch between menu items, the new button on the back Canon chose to require at some odd places in the menu, fortunately it has a pretty obvious icon when it is needed.<br /><br />Screen - Personally I do not care either way if it has a touchscreen, I don't like fingerprints on my screens so I only use touchscreens when there is not a corresponding button for it, so I'll probably rarely use it with this camera.<br /><br />Information Screen - I haven't seen anyone mention yet the cool new information screen. The 5D IV does have a pretty cool new screen that only shows what you really need when you are shooting which is Shutter Speed, ISO, Aperture and focus point. It's a lot less busy than the one that shows the WB, Picture Mode, Card Status, etc and has become my new favorite Info screen.<br /><br />Menu System - The menu system is about the same with only a few new options. I consider this a good thing, very little new to learn. Canon's menu system is already excellent.<br /><br />AF - In the few tests I've done so far, AF seems much faster, in fact the camera overall seems way more responsive. I hadn't really noticed a performance issue with my 5D MIII but the 5D MIV is definitely more responsive in every way.<br /><br />Color Temp - Maybe it's just me, but it seems to shoot slightly warmer than the 5D MIII. I haven't gotten around to comparing RAW vs RAW for the two, but at least on the back screen the image looks to be around 200K warmer than the previous version.<br /><br />Battery Life - Battery life seems to be decreased, maybe the tradeoff for the extra speed was some loss in battery life.<br /><br />Viewfinder - I like the fact that the focus points stay visible through the viewfinder, this really helps to keep track of the focus point as you start framing your shot. I rarely use anything but a single manual focus point then I frame my shot after focusing on the target spot, but if you are shooting a moving subject, knowing where the focus points are becomes more important.<br /><br />Video - I will never rely on this camera for video. Anyone buying this primarily for video will be disappointed.<br /><br />Storage - I have seen plenty of people griping about Canon sticking with the same storage options as the previous generation; to me this is a good thing; I do not have to go buy more memory cards.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />In my opinion if you are a photographer and have the MK2 or MK3 this camera is a no brainer upgrade. Sure it's not revolutionary, but it's increased responsiveness, dynamic range, and the many small behind the scenes features I think make it worth the upgrade.","Upgraded from the 5diii. There are a lot of reviews out there so I won't attempt a detailed review.  Ill update as time goes on.  I can't edit RAW images in my LR standalone (v 6.4). I took 200 images at my kids soccer game and it worked as easy as the 5diii.  The biggest feature I like so far is the touch screen.  The screed is super HD.  Think iPhone retina.  The touch is easy as a smart phone.  In live view you can touch to focus and immidiatly take a pic. Makes a difference taking Picts of my kiddos when I'm trying to get a specific composition.  Since you have the full view it makes getting the shot a lot faster. No more recomposing then shooting. Then when I need to change focus points there is nothing faster than a touch to focus.  A digital level option is added to the center top of the view finder.  It's an added bonus for me since my images are always crooked.  I've only scratched the surface of this camera. Seems like canon added features to help people get the shot quickly and effortless.  My canon 5diii lasted 4 years+ and I expect to keep this one for four years+. I'll update on image quality asap.<br />***9/23/16***<br />Shooting my kids soccer game in full sun I shot in jpeg + RAW. Something I never do but I was waiting for the LR update.  The 5d IV has more options in jpeg picture options.  There are now 3 options for sharpness.  The jpegs were perfect coming right out of the camera.  Typically I shoot RAW 100% with canon and jpeg with my Fuji. Nice to shoot basic shots in jpeg in the canon now.","Just received my 5D Mk IV today and am very impressed with it so far.  I am upgrading from a Mk II which I loved but this outperforms that camera in every way.  Focus, low light captures, image quality, etc.  I have tried it out with my 35 1.4L, 24-70 2.8L, and even my 50 1.8 - these lenses all have new lives with this body.  Amazing so far.  I will edit the review as I get some more shots with the camera in various conditions.  I also purchased the BG-E 20 battery grip  Canon Battery Grip BG-E20 for the Canon 5D Mark IV Digital SLR Camera as well.  Love the feeling of the grip (and E2 Hand Strap) with this body and the larger lenses.","I upgraded from a Mark II that I used like a rented mule. I had a couple of \"must haves\" for the upgrade. First, I needed a more sophisticated autofocus system. The Mark IV delivers in speed and accuracy, and it's easily customizable with both the switches and touchscreen. I also wanted more dynamic range, and at least they got into the Sony ball park. I would complain about it still being behind the Nikon D810, but it delivers enough to get the job done and it makes up for it in low light / high iso performance. It also makes up for it, in a an overall sense, when paired with good glass - something that too often gets missed by the spec sheet nazis. From a performance perspective I am very happy, and from a usability perspective I'm also very happy. The touch screen, along with the generally sensible Canon menus and switchology work for me. It has everything I want in a camera, and does everything well, so overall I'm very pleased. It's a good solid piece of equipment that really delivers when paired with a good lens.<br /><br />Update: Went from just wanting an upgrade and being overall happy to absolutely loving it. 30 mp is a good bump up in terms of resolution without being monstrous (they are still big files), but the best thing is that good hand held shooting is still possible (this thing rocks with the Canon 100-400 Mk II). The touch screen is amazingly useful and quick - wouldn't want to be  without it now. The dynamic range is where it needs to be, the autofocus is fantastic, and the high iso performance is exceptional. The customization options (including the touchscreen) have made this into an amazing piece of equipment for me. I almost got lured down the Sony / Metabones adapter road, but I'm glad I didn't. The whole little camera / big lens idea doesn't make sense, and why give up any features or performance? I can use my canon glass and speedlights and do everything I need to do without compromising anything.","I own a 7D Mark 1 and a 5D Mark II - Both still great cameras with a lot of use over the years - The 5D Mark IV is without a doubt, a superior upgrade. The quality feature list is longer then most people can properly detail. If you have an older camera, it is worth looking into the 5D Mark IV.<br /><br />Right off the bat. If you're a nature, bird, or sports photographer, you get access to all focus points at F8. So if you use an Extender - at F8 you're are not limited to a single Focus Point anymore. Focus is also faster. The touch screen is amazing. Once you start using it to preview pics - send pics to your phone/Tablet or other WiFi Device, you won't look at your old cameras the same way again. You can also remotely adjust settings,and take photos or video with your WiFi device. And yes, you can also toggle on GPS info.<br /><br />I've only had my camera for a week and I have yet to test a 1/4 of the new features yet. The menu system is much improved and all of it is easily accessed and changed through the touch screen. I've yet to try HDR Photos, HDR Video (1080), 4k video,<br />Time Lapse Video, Unlike the Mk II you get 7 Exposure Brackets instead of 3. There's plenty more I haven't mentioned. This is a very significant upgrade from the Mark II.<br /><br />Batteries: Important to note! The Mark IV uses LP-E6N whereas the Mark II uses the LP-E6. Having read up on this difference, the LP-E6N offers about 10-15% more battery efficiency = Incremental longer usage per charge. Beyond that, the batteries are the same size. The \"N\" designation was purportedly added after as safety enhancement in the Battery build required in Japan. Are the batteries interchangeable? This is best left open to ones research for Pros and Cons<br /><br />I see a lot of negativity in online reviews on the 5D Mk!V and I'm going to say that if you're buying a DSLR to fulfill your videography needs, there are superior DSLR's out there. Yes, the 5D Mk II started the Video in DSLR movement, but the reality is Canon has allowed other players to take that mantle away. If you use your cameras primarily for Photography and minor video work, this is a great upgrade.","exceeds my expectation","Yes, it does not have full 4k 60p, but as a still camera it is superb. And, though I have not done much with it yet, the dual pixel focusing for video is a huge improvement over contrast detection focusing on the mark III. It's not a revolution but it is a nice evolution from the mark III.","I think the camera is superb. I upgraded from a Canon 7D and owned a 50D before that. At this early stage I could not be happier with my purchase. This is only my third day with the camera and at this early stage in the game I can only offer some quick first impressions:<br /><br />-It feels great in the hand much better than my 7d does. The larger grip fills my hand/s perfectly.<br />-The wifi is exceptionally convenient and well implemented. I can control the shutter, focus point and an assortment of other settings from my phone. I can also browse, review, delete and save photos to/from my phone. All of the mobile operations feell fast and seamless.<br />-The touch screen has me wondering how I've managed without it on my DSLRs for so long. I own an aged Sony point and shoot with a touch screen but that experience can't hold a candle to this. The touch screen on the 5d mark iv is perfectly responsive and the familiar Canon menus are optimized to take advantage of it brilliantly. Overall the experience is a very welcome improvement and the performance is akin to my iPhone. It really is the best menu/interface experience I have ever had with a DSLR.<br />-The high ISO/low light performance has me feeling like the camera can find a considerable amount of light where there is none.<br />-The autofocus capability shooting video and utilizing live view to shoot stills is phenomenal. Coming from a 7d I feel this is a huge blessing.<br />-The sound of the shutter is softer and sounds a ton smoother. I really enjoy it.<br />-AF is everything I expect from a Canon and more. I find myself playing with the focus settings/modes more than on previous cameras and I chalk that up to it being way better and satisfying. On my 7 I would regularly just leave it on single point AF (trust issues?) now I am having a blast and really enjoying using zone and auto selection AF.<br /><br />I am sure I will uncover less favorable aspects of this camera in the near future but at this point I am very pleased and will undoubtedly be relying on this camera for the next 4+ years. I did not buy the camera from Amazon and therefore I will not show up as verified.","I only had this camera for a few days and I love it, very fast and accurate focusing system not  to mention the sharp images. All I can say is wow!","The Canon 5D Mark IV is one of the most anticipated cameras. Mark III users and other camera enthusiasts are pondering if they should make the upgrade or jump ship. I purchased this camera from B&H so it won’t show that I own it and I will updated this review as I continue. Now, a bit about my background, I shoot weddings for a living after retiring from more than 40 years of running my other businesses. I have watched every Mark IV Youtube videos available before its release so that I would know exactly what to look for upon receiving the camera. Here is the good, the bad and the ugly.<br /><br />Reasons to buy<br />1. 30.4 MP full-frame provides the ideal file size for wedding photographers who have to process thousands of photos. The image was large enough for cropping but not too large to slow down my workflow. However there is a better choice for landscape photographers, the 5DSR and Nikon D810 with higher resolution. Having a higher pixel count has many advantages and in some way allows the Mark IV to be more effective than the 7D Mark ii other than it is slower at 7fps. The Mark IV has about one stop better ISO and DR (dynamic range) performance and this means I can comfortably use ISO 1600 instead of 800 to double my shutter speed. In wildlife photography, especially birding, the crop sensor 7DM2 is extremely difficult to frame birds in flight whereas the Mark IV allows you to capture a wider image and crop later in post. Please keep in mind that you will not have the same reach with the Mark IV as the 7DM2 when cropped to the same resolution (30/1.6/1.6=11.7 MP). Of course we should always try to fill the frame by using a longer lens or best to get closer to the subject but that is not always possible.<br />2. Seven frames per second continuous shooting speed. Sounds like just one extra frame improvement from the Mark III but read on, the faster processor and bigger buffer are what made the difference. Buffer did not get filled up if I shot jpg but maxed out at about 40 frames with sRAW and 10fps with RAW (The claim of being able to continuously shoot 21 pure RAW pictures is untrue, at least I was able to accomplish that with the fastest memory card) and it continued to shoot at about 4fps in sRAW (appx only 25% of the Raw resolution, something I would avoid using unless I know they are going to be casually loaded on Facebook and in that case you may as well shoot jpeg, mRAW is a bit better about 57% of the RAW resolution. Even after the buffer was full, the Mark IV continuously shot at 2fps in RAW for as long as I held the shutter. Extra frame over the Mark III is nice because you may just miss that first kiss. But the frame rate is not the biggest improvement, not as important as how fast it can clear the buffer and how it allows you to operate regardless of a full buffer. For wildlife or sports the Mark IV can unload a full buffer 4 times faster than A7Rii, in about 5 seconds vs. 20 seconds. This makes it impossible to use the A7Rii for actions, especially when it drops to 0.5 fps (one frame every 2 seconds, 4 times slower than the Mark IV) after the buffer is full. I tried the A7Rii frame rate in both compressed and uncompressed modes with the same result. The conclusion is I would never use an A7Rii for birding or sports but I would gladly take the Mark IV with me anytime. These experiments were conducted with the 128mb Class 10 U3 Lexar and Transcend memory cards independently in each camera. However for pro sports shooter, I am sure the 1Dx Mark II would be a better choice as it is faster with bigger buffer.<br />3. Focus. This is the most important feature for my application and it is where Canon shines. It has the same 61-point AF system with 41 cross-type but with expanded vertical coverage compared to the Mark III. But I don’t see much usage for the vertical coverage, may be more horizontal coverage. In low light the mark IV focuses faster than the Mark III, Nikon D810 and Sony A7Rii with higher hit rate which is another big reason for Mark III users to upgrade. In live view, the Dual Pixel focus speed is much faster than Mark III which still uses contrast detection. This works well for photo as well as video. It is very intelligent and tracks quite well even when the subject’s face is turned away. Dual pixel is accomplished when each pixel in the sensor is split in half, capturing a left and a right image. These images are processed and compared in nanoseconds to attain focus. The Mark IV algorism is superior to just face detection. It can track object, for example it can follow the bride's shoe. However it is always going to be slower to focus than spot focus because the processor has to work continuously. Dual pixel AF comes in extremely handy and that alone is worth the upgrade. This is something the A7Rii has but the A7Sii is lacking. In live view, the focus area select is limited to 3 options instead of 7, track, spot and expanded. It can be changed with the \"Q\" button only in live view mode and can not be adjusted with the AF area select button. IMO, Canon's strength is on focus speed, despite of how much I like the IQ on my A7Rii, it has less focus hit rate on action shots than Mark III or IV. The Mark III and IV will continue to be the go to camera for wedding photographers.<br />4. ISO range 100-32000 with 50-102400 expansion. ISO noise is improved from the Mark III by about one and half stop, usable at 1600 in my opinion. I noticed there are less color noise than the Mark III and the grains are finer due to a higher resolution sensor. This is really helpful for low light shots which require a faster lens than F2.8. Even though the ISO has improved from the Mark III, a reason to buy but it still has more banding and noise than the A7Rii. The D810, A7Rii and A7Sii are still the low light monsters.<br />5. Touch-screen LCD monitor. Finally Canon makes it easier for us photographers and you can use both the buttons and the touch-screen simultaneously. Yes, there are certain menu that can be navigated quicker with the dials so it is brilliant you can do both. There is also a confirmation tone after you have tapped the item. The screen is higher res than Mark III and as sensitive and accurate as my iphone. Reviewing photos on camera has never been so easy. Scroll, pinch, swipe and tap, it is so fast to navigate, again a feature D810, A7Sii and A7Rii lacks. Resolution on the screen is 1,620,000 vs Nikon D810 at 1,229,000 and Mark III at 1,040,000.<br />6. Dual Pixel Raw. With the dual images generated from the split pixel, Canon cleverly processes them as Dual Pixel Raw allowing post micro focus adjustments. This is good to have for wedding and portrait photographers, as you can fix minor focus problem in post at appx. half inch focal range so don't expect miracles and it is a hassle to use with double the size file. Currently, Lightroom does not support this feature at the moment so the workflow is painfully slow using DPP Application. Adobe has announced that they will support Dual Pixel Raw so this is a temporary problem.<br />7. Weather sealing should be improved but it is hard to prove. But with Canon’s legendary quality, I believe they did borrow the technique from the 7D.<br />8. DR (Dynamic Range) has been greatly improved. The shadow has a lot less noise than previous models. Increase latitude to push shadow for under exposed area and the ability to retain detail over the 5D Mark III and 6D is truly incredible. Canon's claim on increase DR is 100% true, the difference is so obvious that it makes me hesitates pulling my favorite Mark III out of the bag. DR is still a bit shy from A7Rii but greatly improved from the Mark III and 6D. It can now compete with any full frame head to head. If I am buying a still camera for just the DR, the A7Rii or the Nikon D810 will be the choice but the Mark IV is just so much better in so many other arenas.<br />9. Wifi and GPS. Uploading photos to phone to share in social media has never been easier and I am glad Canon has finally caught up with the trend. There is a second setting in the GPS menu that let you shut down GPS when power is off. This is extremely helpful in saving power which the 7D Mark ii is lacking.<br />10. Improve handling. The grip is more comfortable than the Mark III. I have medium size hands, I own and tried many cameras, the Mark IV has the most comfortable grip for me. The rubber has been improved from the Mark III. It is more secure and comfortable to hold.<br />11. Third party gear. The popularity of the Canon lens system makes owning this camera a dream as it has created an extremely strong third party support. For example the Metabone adapter which works wonders on the Canon lenses, allowing me to share the glass and to use the Sony A7Rii as my main video camera and Canon 5D Mark IV as my still camera. The combination of these two cameras is perhaps one of the best systems to use for weddings. Despite of how much I like Nikon's IQ, I could not share its lenses with Sony to obtain auto focus with an  adapter. This is the main reason I purchased this camera. I want to make it clear that I am not associated or paid by any parties for this review.<br />12. Canon added the extra AF area selection button which can be used for quick ISO adjustment. Under CUSTOM CONTROL on the last icon at the bottom you can set this button to adjust ISO with the front dial. This extra button makes adjusting ISO on the fly a single step process. I change ISO quite often between indoor and outdoor during the reception so this comes in quite handy. Basically Canon has added a third wheel for the ISO similar to that of the A7Rii, except it is better because my A7Rii ISO wheel often gets accidentally bumped.<br />13. HDR video. I can save blown out highlights shot in this mode for about 1 to 2 stops. However, it will only shoot in 30FPS at 1080P because it actually shoots in 60FPS and combine the 2 frames in HDR. This mode is not available in 4K since the limit is 30FPS.<br />14. Country of Origin. 5D Mark IV is made in Japan, Sony A7Rii, A7Sii and Nikon D810 are made in Thailand. This can be viewed as a bias opinion but I have always had better luck with products Made in Japan. I think, this is the main reason why Canon is more expensive with less features compared other brands. I am a heavy shooter and my 5D Mark III is 3 years old, never had a single issue and my Sony A7Rii broke twice in less than a year.<br />15. Multi Shot NR (Noise Reduction). In this mode the camera takes 4 quick consecutive shots and process them to reduce noise. This allows you to shoot in much higher ISO with noticeable improvement in IQ but remember to keep your hands steady (no tripod needed) and it only works in jpeg. How is this different than stopping down 2 stops on the shutter speed? The Mark IV takes 4 images separately, process and align them to produce less noise verses stopping down the shutter which causes motion blurs. When I run out of options in low light, I would switch from RAW to JPG and change to this mode. You will find the photos quite usable even at ISO 3200.<br /><br />Reasons not to buy<br />1. LPF- Low Path Filter. Canon could easily remove this filter but chose not to. My take on this, is that Canon is very conservative and they chose to sacrifice sharpness over Moire for many reasons. On my A7Rii I do occasionally see Moire, for example power lines so this is a preference and may not be judged as a defect. Read up on<br />http://www.birdphotographers.net/forums/showthread.php/126621-Understanding-the-Low-Pass-Filter-Effect-Cancellation-Issue-What-You-Must-Know-About-Canon%E2%80%99s-Two-New-50-Megapixel-Camera-Bodies<br />However, I would rather choose sharpness and risk Moire such as in the Canon 5DSR design. This is where Nikon and Sony shine, their IQ is sharper without the LPF but with slight risk of Moire.<br />2. 4K video recording is perhaps the worst feature Canon has added to this camera. Motion jpeg creates a warping appx. 240GB file size in just one hour of record time. Also due to the 1.74x crop, I was unable to shoot wide even with a 16-35mm, not to mention the less than okay low light quality. On the up side the Mark IV allows you to frame grab at 8.8MP which gives me better IQ compared to frame grabbed from A7Sii. My assistant can now shoot backup photos at 30fps continuously in critical moments. If you intend to frame grab, I highly recommend that the shutter speed is set to 1/125 or higher otherwise most of the frames would not be usable. Canon should have given us another codec option with better compression and not worry about cannibalizing their pro cinema line. Their near sight leaves the door open for Sony and Nikon. The way Sony is progressing with Nikon's dependency of Sony's sensor, I estimate both Canon and Nikon's dominance on the pro market will not last more than a decade. For now I would keep my Canon lenses and keep my fingers cross that they will up their game.<br />3. No Tilt screen. Some may wonder why Canon didn’t put this in the Mark IV. My guess is that the tilt screen makes the camera less rugged, harder to seal and both Canon and Nikon want to make their pro gear bullet proof. The toughness of Canon gear is one of the main reasons I use it exclusively for weddings. It’s sad to say that my Sony A7Rii gave me a “Camera Error” message in just a few months of light usage (I couldn’t fix it even after doing a hardware reset) and my Mark III lasted for years. Do I wish for the tilt screen? Canon and Nikon both should listen carefully, I want the tilt screen even if I have to sacrifice some durability and weather resistance.<br />4. Weight body only is 800g (Not including 90g battery) appx 2 pounds (1 pound=454g), it is 60 grams lighter than the Mark III and 30g heavier than Canon's lightest full frame 6D but still much heavier than the GH4 and A7Rii (625g including battery). A reason to go mirrorless instead of DSLR. If I travel, I would carry only the A7Rii (not even bring the A7Sii which is only good for video) as I am not a pack rat.<br />5. The memory card is outdated and slow Canon should have used Cfast.<br />6. No EVF. EVF has many advantages operating in the dark. You can see what the sensor sees instead of everything pitch dark coming from the mirror which makes composition and exposure harder. With EVF, if you are under exposed by not paying attention to the meter, you will immediately notice and make the correction. Here is a unique idea, Canon can add an EVF next to the current view finder as it will be extremely useful for shooting video under the bright sun. It can be retracted like the RX100 but with Canon I don't think that would ever happen. Most would agree without the EVF, the DSLR will be not be able to compete with Mirrorless in video features. This is one of the reasons that Canon is trying to separate still from video on their DSLR line up and steer video shooters to their cinema line . I am not paid by Canon, Sony or any third party. IMO, Sony is better on video and Canon is better on photos.<br /><br />Important update: As of 9/24/2016  the raw files from Mark IV is supported in Lightroom CC but not in LR 5. No older versions of LR get any updates when there is a new version available. You can use the newest version of the Free Adobe DNG converter Ver 9.7 to convert the native RAW files to DNG's that LR 5 can read.<br /><br />In conclusion, the photo quality of the Mark IV has been improved remarkably from the Mark III but if you want to shoot video, this is definitely a “no buy” and I would only use it as a backup. Canon is facing some real competitions on sensor technology but amazingly it is still able to keep up on the photography side. For Canon to survive this market in the long term, it has to either heavily invest in mirrorless technology or to follow Nikon's foot print to use Sony's sensor. But to compete in price with the added features Canon may have to make it in Thailand. It's not Canon does not have the ability to make better sensors, just that it is unable to drive cost down to compete in the DSLR market. Imaging the Mark V with Sony’s video specifications and Canon’s brilliant stills technology, may be a reason Sony will never sell its sensors to Canon. The way Sony and Nikon are progressing, I think they are the choice for the all around video and still cameras. Now Canon is hanging on threats relying on its market dominance created through the decades. Most Canon photographers are ready to jump ship, some already did and Canon engineers absolutely have to get on the edge of their chairs to hold on its crown. I sure hope that they will get their act together with all my investment in all the Canon lenses. The Mark IV in video application has inadequate codec selection (biggest killer is file size), lack of zebra, focus peaking, over cropping in 4K mode which affects not only focal length but also ISO performance. The only advantage is its dual pixel AF but the cons out weight the pros. For now, as a photographer, if you own Nikon, stay with Nikon for its great IQ, the Mark IV features are evolution not revolution and they are still not worth the switch. If you are serious about shooting both stills and video buy this camera and the A7Sii or A7Rii and share the lenses with the Metabone Adapter. One thing that I did not mention about the advantage of DSLR over mirrorless is that the sensor stays clean whereas my A7Rii sensor had to be cleaned 3 times during my last 30 day trip. A lot of my pictures had spots which took hours of Photoshop. In the DSLR, the mirror basically acts as a shield during lens change. Sensor cleaning is a huge hassle (almost impossible without leaving some smear even after trying out multiple sensor cleaners) and I hesitated swapping lens on many occasions on all my mirrorlesses. If you shoot mostly photos buy this camera and never look back, IMO, it is the best all around stills camera in 2016.","[[VIDEOID:5c89caba40cdce594375dffacc7fe853]] So far, I'm on the fence. From a photographer perspective, Canon has improved a lot. Autofocus is very nice and snappy, image quality is great, and the touchscreen is surprisingly useful. Dynamic range has been improved but moire has gotten worse. The camera feels a little lighter and somewhat cheaper than 5d mark III and the wifi features seem to be a little iffy.<br /><br />As far as video is concerned, the 5dmkIV doesn't feel like a huge improvement to the 5d mark III. 4k Video is a nice upgrade but the 500mbps Mjpeg codec is data hungry, eating up around 4GB a min or so. The touch screen is a good update and the focus system in video mode is very handy. That said, the lack of audio interface adapter is very frustrating. Canon gave us the funky port on the front of the camera, and they've released an audio adapter for the XC-15, it really would have been great if that was an option on the 5dmkIV.<br /><br />I will continue to update the review as I spend more time with it, currently, I'm giving this 4 stars, but I'll update this as I continue to spend time with it.<br /><br />9-24-16, I've been shooting stills and video with the camera for almost a month now. The touch screen has started to grow on me.","I started my career as a photographer shooting Canon, and switched to Nikon in 2014 for a few reasons, including the massive dynamic range difference. From 2014-now I have used two D750 bodies and most of Nikon's finest primes and zooms. For a variety of reasons that I won't bore you with, I have decided to move back to Canon, the release of the 1dx mark ii and 5d mark iv finalized that decision because they finally have a reasonable amount of dynamic range compared to their predecessors.<br /><br />One of my main problems with Nikon was the autofocus. You see raves about it all over the place, and I cannot for the life of me understand how (unless you're using a new D5 or D500), as none of their bodies up until the D5 and D500 released this year have any cross type focus points on the sides, they're all in the central columns only. As a wedding photographer that alone caused  many missed shots and frustrations.  While for portraiture you have time to focus and recompose, event photography requires fast and accurate focus of moving subjects in dim environments and if you want to compose the shot well in camera you're going to have to use focus points that are not in the center all the time. Even my old 5d mark iii did a significantly better job in that regard.<br /><br />Enter the 5d mark iv:<br /><br />-Greatly improved DR, but not quite as good as Nikon, but the difference is only significant at base ISO.<br />-Amazing customization, from button layouts, to autofocus settings. Convenient new focus mode switching button.<br />-LCD screen is very nice, the touch screen is surprisingly useful<br />-Touch to focus in live view, dual pixel AF tracking is absolutely revolutionary, I've never seen anything else like it. For both photos and video I can see it being a huge convenience.<br />-High ISO performance is exceptionally good, on par if not better with the Nikon D750, and surpassing the D750 beyond ISO 12800. Remember that it's doing this with 6 more megapixels of resolution as well.<br />-New viewfinder with more information displayed.<br />-The autofocus grid is slightly larger and it's noticeable. MUCH better/larger spread than the Nikon D750 was.<br />-iTR autofocus rivals Nikon's 3d focus. To be completely honest though, I still feel Nikon's 3d tracking worked a little better, but iTR is proving to be quite good too.<br />-Autofocus overall is like a Ferrari vs a hyundai when comparing the 5d mark iv to the D750. Not so much in the center but when you go to the left and right columns of cross type points, the 5d locks just as quickly as with the center, no problem. The Nikons can too, if there is enough contrast in the correct direction. If not, it hunts, or it's slow, and you've already missed the shot. However, we all know that in 2017 the D5 system will trickle into more affordable full frame bodies, and they may actually gain the edge. However there will still be things like spot AF missing, because only Canon has that (reduced focus point size for pinpointing critical focus, which is very helpful in certain situations).<br /><br />-I'm not going to talk about video because I did not buy this camera for video. Anything it does in that regard is considered a bonus. I will say that the dual pixel af focusing would make for some super easy tracking and pulling for anyone that does video. I know the 4k crop and format is a turn off for many people though.<br /><br />-the resolution is a perfect step up without being overkill. An uncompressed raw from the Nikon D810 for example, is around 75mb. I would not want to use that for events. The 5d iv files are roughly 45 mb though, which is still pretty hefty.<br /><br />-New auto white balance mode with whites priority. This is friggin amazing. It works so well and will definitely help post processing times. Basically, under any ugly lighting conditions, whites will still be pretty much white, as much as they can be.<br /><br />-flicker reduction. If you shoot weddings and you're caught in churches or fluorescent bulb lit rooms, you know how annoying lighting can be. Even when using flash, your background/ambient exposures can vary greatly due to flickering. This mode eliminates that by syncing the shutter to the flicker.<br /><br />So things I don't like, to be fair:<br /><br />-No AF point linked spot metering, STILL. This is obnoxious. It's a $3500 camera, yet they don't include a feature that's included in most nikons, like the D750, that you can pick up for less than half the price. It's a lot more awesome to have than people may think. Canon will give it to you, for $6000 in their 1d series bodies.<br /><br />-No flip screen. I really don't think it's that hard to make a robust flip/tilt screen that's suitable for a professional camera. The D750 has spoiled me with the screen. The days of having to lay on the ground for a shot have been over, but I guess they'll be coming back.<br /><br />-Adobe's color profiling - this is not an issue with the camera but anyone that uses lightroom for raw processing should be aware. If you're used to a 5d iii or 6d, which have fairly punchy colors and contrast most of the time when you open a raw in lightroom with adobe's standard profile, you are in for a shock. Adobe made their profile for the 5d mark iv much duller. You're going to have to modify your presets. The same was the case with the D750 so I'm assuming this is just a new adobe trend, which means get used to doing extra work.<br /><br />Overall great camera, seems to be very under rated. People are so focused on hype and specs on paper. This camera feels solid and performs very well, and will definitely be up to the task of heavy professional use. There is enough dynamic range for nearly any situation unless you are completely butchering your exposures.  The only task I can see it not being as good as Nikon for is real estate photography. With a D810, at base ISO, you can take a photo indoors exposing for the light outside of a window to capture the outdoor scenery, and literally pull the entire indoor area/room out of the shadows cleanly, saving you from having to use lights or exposure merged HDR.","i have only had it for a few hours now but so far its great, i really love it","Awesome camera so far!

It takes some time to get used to it. I feel more comfortable using it now. Not really for beginners. I bought a book to help me to understand and may be use the many features.  At first I thought the pictures came a little dark, but I made a little adjustment and it is great now.<br />Some very important things I think are missing.<br />1. GPS; how in 2016 can a travel camera be without GPS, I do not understand this one. I would give up WIFI for GPS.<br />2. Holding the camera could be better and impossible with one hand. I bought a rubber grip from flipXpac and now I can use it with one hand, which can be very useful sometimes.<br />3. One which is only important to me is in the special effects. I would have like to have the \"watercolor effect\" like Sony has on some of their cameras.","Arrived promptly and fully.","Pros: Good camera. Good quality and features. Excellent menus for access to all the software. 1\" sensor is adequate. Even the mic does a good job. I bought it for the compact size and lens zoom range. Customer service was excellent. I managed to torque the lens and the TX repair place repaired it under warranty in a timely manner. I had to initiate all communication but they were quite responsive when I did.<br /><br />Cons: Like other point-n-shoot type cameras the extending lens is a bit fragile. Gotta be careful with it.","Best travel camera made.  Still learning to use all of the features.  I'm sure in the next year or two you'll be able to get a 1 inch sensor with a 600mm zoom which would be the ultimate travel camera.  Until then, you can't beat this.","This is an incredible camera for the point and shoot category.  It is just small enough to fit in my pants pocket (cargo pocket) but it is versatile enough to use in almost any situation. I read some reviews that complained about mediocre image quality.  I believe that is solely due to the fact that Panasonic sets the contrast low by default, making the images look flat and boring.  This is easily fixed in the menu by increasing the contrast, saturation and sharpness (I used the curves adjustment in the setting to boost contrast).  Once that is done it produces incredible pictures. The camera seems to do a really good job of preserving highlight and shadow detail, even with jpg images shot in high contrast lighting (using the camera adjustments I mentioned above).  I probably won't be using my Canon 6D nearly as much now. I was looking for a pocket-able camera that is as convenient as a smartphone but produces much better pictures.  I tried several cameras before I settled on this one. The menu has a ton of customizable features, but they are organized so they are easy to find and use. I also wanted panorama and hdr capability like a smartphone, and this camera delivers, with the exception of some problems with HDR mode.  My one complaint about this camera is that the HDR mode does a poor job of aligning the 3 images, resulting in an unusable image at least 1/2 of the time. I don't know if Panasonic aligns vertically and horizontally but forgot about rotation alignment or what, but whatever the reason HDR alignment sucks. The HDR exposure works well in capturing the right amount of highlight and shadow detail but the alignment software is broken.  I hope they will fix this in a future firmware release. Other things I like about the camera is that it's the easiest point and shoot camera I have ever tried at taking pictures in bright sunlight.  The screen is large enough and bright enough that I have no trouble composing shots in bright daylight. I review my images on my 50 inch 4K monitor when I get home and I can really see the detailed results the camera gives.  The color accuracy for the most part is even better than my Canon 6D DSLR, although the pictures come out slightly blueish at times when there is a lot of shade in the scene.Overall, this camera is the ideal point and shoot camera for enthusiasts, in my opinion, and only the HDR alignment problem keeps it from being perfect.","Living up to my expectations. Takes sharp photos in almost any setting. Low light great. The 250 end is super to have but the 25 is not wide enough for some subjects. The image stabilization is superb. Can't beat size and features for travel.","Great form factor and good IQ, the best compact I've seen so far given the zoom range. The only complaint I have is soon after I got the camera dust/lint started appearing under the front lens element  and of course there's no way to clean it out. I carry it in my vest pocket so it's not out in the elements","This is a great camera at this price point. It has terrific zoom capabilities and the color reproduction is spot on. The image quality isn't quite as good as the Sony RX100, but if you want zoom, this is definitely the camera to go with.","So far I'm really impressed with this camera, the only negative if I'm going to be nit-picky is a bit of softness in the center of focus at certain focal lengths. Overall really pleased. Better battery life than I expected, amazing video quality and rich vibrant stills.","This is an amazing camera. I don't think you can get much better quality in your pocket in 2016. I bought it to take when I can't bring my SLR on long hikes or insecure situations, and it works well from image quality to WiFi connections.","I did a lot of homework before deciding on this camera. What did I want to use it for and how much was I willing to spend to get good pictures? Family. Kids. Vacation pics. Although there are a lot of manual controls available and that can be switched to quickly I wanted something that could focus on moving subjects and capture quickly. The DMC-ZS100 fits the bill quite nicely and the 1080p60fps I have it set to capture video at is beautiful. 4K is available but I just don't need it right now. The camera turns on quickly and, from what I've seen in video reviews and written reviews, is capable of capturing more than 300 photos on a full charge. I sincerely don't go that crazy with photos and video and I've yet to spend a day out with this camera and lose a single bar. Being able to plug the camera directly to the adapter rather than having to swap and/or remove the battery is a huge plus for continuous shooting and recording. The touch screen is amazing as well. I couldn't find myself settling for a camera without one after this.<br /><br />The photos? After reviewing them on a computer I'm very impressed.<br /><br />I haven't had it long and I'm looking forward to using it a lot more. Also be advised that Panasonic have released a version 1.1 firmware that I found by searching the term \"dmc-zs100 firmware.\" Apple also updated their latest OS with support for importing the ZS100's RAW data in case you capture in RAW and use Apple Photos.","I recently took this camera on a 2 week trip to Alaska and was very happy with the results.  It will fit in a cargo pocket (barely, and you will know it's there) but it does nicely in a small belt case.  I think the pictures turned out very good for the size of the camera.  Intelligent auto works great if you don't want to tinker with any of the settings.  I took quick pictures in a lot challenging backgrounds and had no problems at all.  When you do want to move past intelligent auto, the camera is crammed with features.  The viewfinder is nothing special, but it gets the job done (I use the viewfinder for almost all of my pictures).  I previously had an LF1 and this camera beats it every way but the size.  I tried an RX100 IV and although it's image quality was better than the ZS100, I didn't like the popup (although superior) viewfinder and it can't touch the ZS100 for zoom.","I really really wanted to like this camera, since I used to have an earlier version of the Lumix which was my favorite camera for many years. The specs on this were remarkable and it's SO tiny! I bought it to take on a San Diego trip, and by the end of the trip I was really regretting my decision to bring it instead of my Olympus Stylus 1s. It was constantly crashing and freezing and a lot of the pictures were grainy. Plus it seemed hard to get it to focus on what I wanted it to, even with using the touch-to-focus option. For the price, it just wasn't worth it! I returned it and went back to my Stylus 1s, maybe I'll try the brand again in a few years.","This is simply the best compact zoom I have ever used. Bar none. This Panasonic ZS-100 is the ONLY fit in your jacket pocket 1 inch sensor compact with a longer zoom (as of this review). It does many things very well. The video is outstanding - 1080p or 4k. If you are looking for quality pictures and video WITH a zoom look no further. If however you are looking for a low light camera with a 1 inch sensor, this really isn't it. I would direct you towards Sony or Canon's f1.8-2.8 camera's (but you get less than half the zoom). There are trade offs either way you go. I have used a 1 inch sensor Canon before and I will say while the quality of the pictures is great, I really missed being able to zoom farther.<br /><br />The post focus function on the camera is very nice - taking pictures in post focus allows you to focus on any area of the picture taken - after you have taken the picture!. It can be a very useful tool.<br /><br />I'll add that I'm shooting just in JPEG format (raw is available) and I'm extremely impressed. I had planned on getting a Canon dslr 80d because I have Canon lenses and using that along with this camera for quality pictures but after playing around with the Panasonic I just don't feel I need to do that. If I can get away with quality pictures and not have to lug around a heavy dslr I'm all in. I will probably end up selling my Canon dslr lenses instead. I don't think some of the negative reviews here give credit how impressive this camera is for how small it is.<br /><br />There are a few things that I didn't like about this camera (as with any camera). It seems to hunt when I'm looking for a target in shadows or low light. My wife also mentioned that she wished the touch screen icon was a slight bit larger in tracking mode (or a way that we could adjust the size somehow). All in all it's a great camera as long as you know what you are buying. Again, for low light with very little zoom go with a Sony or Canon f1.8-2.8. If you need zoom in a compact camera with quality pictures and absolutely fantastic video, this Panasonic ZS-100 is your camera.","I bought this camera for 2 reasons:<br />1 inch sensor and the view finder for when its bright sun and I cant see the screen.<br />I have had the camera for a fee days and so far its been great.<br />I have owned other Panasonic cameras and never had a bad experience with any of them.","Great allaround camera to have with you at all times. For portraits I recommend setting to 70mm or longer to get some blur to background.","Bought as a companion point and shoot camera for my OMD EM1, and for photos at concerts - and for this purpose it's awesome. Pocketable (just), the IQ is fine for me and it's a great traveling companion. Can't beat the sensor size / zoom combo.","This is not a camera for low light. I shot at 800 ISO and the results were grainy, grainy. Whether using the LCD or the Electronic viewfinder it is very hard to see the light meter. There are lots of bells and whistles on this camera completely useless to me. I shoot manual, RAW. This is probably a good camera for someone who shoots in auto, aperture priority, or shutter priority. For more serious photographers the only thing it has going for it is its focal range. I decided that my Canon G15 is a better compact camera for me; I took the ZS100 back and got some lenses for my Olympus O-MD E-M1.","Purchased just before a trip to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Saipan.  Wanted a small camera to take 4K videos and secondarily stills.  Little time to read included manual, so relied upon iA setting for all movies and stills.  Camera worked great.  I was using SanDisk Extreme Pro 128 GB UHS-1/U3 SDXC cards and did not have any delays, even when recording up to 15 mins straight.  Able to take clear 4K videos on Shinkansen (high speed rail) from Tokyo to Kyoto.  Zoom worked great too, as able to get clear pictures of Navy pre-position ships in Saipan harbor from Mt. Tapochau (middle of island).  Small enough to easily take everywhere.  I did get additional batteries and with a mix of 4K video and stills would regularly need just one additional battery for a full day of shooting.  Back home used iMovie to quickly see how 4K video turned out.  Problem is that current iMovie \"optimizes\" video without a button to remove optimization, so videos looked choppy.  However, if import in iPhoto, no such problem so 4K video looked very good.  Only issue with camera was that needed to be careful that I did not touch the screen on the back as could cause changes to settings of the camera.  Overall, worked for what I wanted, great 4K videos and stills, small, easy to use, well priced.","Very versatile camera. Great photos. Took it to a week long music festival. Great results both indoors and outdoors. Left the DSLRs and other cameras in the car. Indoor shots at ISO up to 3200 were quite usable.  Took most photos in RAW format, but also had good results with 4KPhoto setting.","I've had my ZS-100 for about a month now and have had the opportunity to use it in a bunch of different circumstances. It is an AMAZING camera - fast, sharp, versatile. I love its 4K photo burst capability, which makes it possible to grab perfect action photos (in my case, portraits of squirmy babies whose expressions can change in a nanosecond). And I was frankly stunned by how quickly the pop-up flash recycles. The camera feels nice and solid in my hand, the controls are easy to access, and I appreciate the ability to switch from LED to electronic viewfinder (although some reviewers complain about the quality of the EVF, I have no complaints about it). The only thing I wish it had is built-in GPS ... I know GPS is a battery-drainer, but I travel a lot and appreciate having built-in geotagging. I'll adapt. I've probably owned a couple dozen cameras before, from film SLRs to DSLRs and mid- and high-end point-and-shoots, and I think this one might be my favorite.<br /><br />It took me a few weeks to find a case that fits the ZS-100 well. I ultimately bought TWO cases. The Case Logic QPB-202 molded case fits the ZS-100 perfectly, but the ZS-100's lens thickness doesn't leave room in the case's inside pocket for a spare battery or SD card unless you're careful to insert the camera with the lens towards the top, not the bottom, of the case. Its snug fit and hard-shell cover make it a good case for tossing the camera in a backpack or larger camera bag. I also bought an Ape Case small digital bag (#AC165), which offers a slightly roomier fit for the camera itself, plus a small exterior zippered pocket that's large enough for a couple of spare batteries and SD cards. It also has two exterior mesh pockets (can't think of a use for them, unless I decide to make a custom-fit rain cover for the case) and two interior mesh pockets that could, I suppose, hold batteries or SD cards - but I'd rather be able to get the camera in and out without snagging on anything. I use the Ape Case to carry the ZS-100 when I want quick access to it and am not carrying it in a backpack.","If you want a camera that is compact. has a large sensor and a useful zoom range, then the ZS100 is for you. Granted, there are negatives to this camera. Compared to other 1\" inch sensor compacts, the lens is on the slower side. The max aperture of 2.8 is little over one stop slower compared to other 1\"in cameras like the RX100/G7X. Zooming in to 70mm drops the max aperture down to F4.5 and at 100mm, it is at F5.2. These high Fstops take a hit on low light situations. If you are shooting in a dim setting, I would stay below 70mm to maintain acceptable image quality. Also zooming out to 250mm results in a soft image. Granted, it is substantially better than smartphone/iPhone digital zoom but it is no DSLR zoom lens. The camera also lacks a rubber grip but has a indent. 4K video also has a small crop to 37mm, so you lose some wide angle. The viewfinder is on the smaller side and the screen is fixed.<br /><br />Now with the main negatives out of the way, here are things that I like about this camera. The combination of size,sensor size and zoom range is unmatched. There were definitely compromises but I like the balance. Compared to 1”in sensor bridge cameras like the FZ1000, the ZS100 is one fifth the volume and retains the 1”in sensor and max aperture. The sensor size for a ultra compact camera is also a plus. The 1”in sensor is a step up over the smaller 1/2.3 sensors found in cheaper compact zooms. You will get usable images up to ISO 6400. The ZS100 also beats out its 1’in compact sensor rivals(RX100/G7X) by offering a 10x zoom lens. In outdoor settings, the 10x lens is substantially more useful than the short 3x zoom on the RX100. 4K video is of high quality(100 mbps) and unlike the RX100 MK4, you can record up to 15 minutes of 4K. At under $700, the ZS100 is $250 dollars cheaper than the RX100 MK 4.<br /><br />Overall, if you can overlook the compromises, the ZS100 offers a great value and a nice blend of features and form factor.","5 stars, even though, or even because, its auto-closing lens cover jammed within a week of starting to use it. But by that time I was enormously impressed by the quality of the photos from this pocket camera (but you better have pretty big pockets). So I called Amazon, and was stunned by the speed and quality of Amazon customer service. Within minutes the issue was resolved: another ZS100 was send that day, and I received UPS mailing labels for the return of the flawed camera. Two days later, I was back in the woods with a ZS100 again.<br /><br />I've been using Panasonics for a few years, now; the pocket models like this one and larger bridge cameras like the FZ200 and 300. While their operating system requires study, once you've got it down it's reasonably intuitive. I'm primarily a nature photographer, shooting while hiking and kayaking. If I'm expecting to do some serious photography, I take the bridge cameras. But if I don't want the weight/hassle, I take the smaller cameras. The ZS100 will fit into a pocket, but it does have to be a big pocket, and in a loose fitting pair of pants, or you'll struggle getting it in and out. A small fanny pack works as well or better.<br /><br />Photos are clear and crisp. You can choose your level of control, from shooting full Auto to complete manual. A huge range of pre-sets are possible, including 3 Custom settings: mine are set to general landscape photography, quick response animal shots, and the 4K Burst mode. 4K Burst wasn't something I had expected to make much use of, but I've discovered that being set up to use it lets me take some great pictures of birds taking off and landing from lakes and rivers.<br /><br />All in all, and excellent camera backed up by excellent Amazon customer service.","Just after getting this camera, my wife and I spent two weeks in Southern California.  The photos we got from this jewel are outstanding!!!  It replaced my Nikon D3100 and the convenience of this camera far outweighs carrying around a bulky DSLR.  I recommend downloading the detailed owners manual from Panasonic so you can take full advantage of all the features.","First of all, this: “I participated in an Advocate Program on behalf of Panasonic USA. I received product samples as part of my participation. All opinions are my own.”<br /><br />And also: I am not a professional photographer. I love photography -- I love taking pictures and I love looking at them. But I'm fairly new to the discipline and there is a lot left for me to learn. The Lumix ZS100 has dozens of amazing features and a seemingly infinite degree of flexibility and customization. I didn't need or use all of these features and benefits, and I suspect most amateur photographers would fall into the same category. Regarding this review, I hope that what I lack as a professional I can make up for in practicality. You might be wondering: what does a camera like this have to offer a casual hobbyist like me?<br /><br />And the answer is: a lot. For one, it offers a more authentic experience. The ZS100 is a small camera, but it's got heft. I've read some reviews complaining that it's so light it feels insubstantial. I respectfully disagree -- it's not unwieldy, but it feels solid and well-made, as, in fact, it is. The all-black metal body has classy looks and a smooth feel, but not so smooth that it's slippery. It just feels good in your hands, right down to the knurled metal dials on top and the subtle ridge built into the body that greatly enhances the grip. The overall build quality is admirable -- as evidenced in small details like the flash mechanism. (Seriously: compare the pop-up flash on the ZS100 with similar mechanisms on other cameras and you'll see what I mean.) A quick once-over is enough to convince you the thing is put together well, and should hold up for a long time.<br /><br />And you really can't say enough about the convenience of the size. I take a lot of pictures on the street that I'd prefer to go unnoticed, and the ZS100 is exquisitely inconspicuous.<br /><br />Another element of authenticity: I haven't come across many cameras in this category -- small body, large sensor, zoom capability -- with a good, honest viewfinder. The ZS100's viewfinder blinks on automatically and begins focusing as you raise the camera to your eye. Manual focus works wonderfully with the viewfinder as well, as objects take on a blue gleam when they come into sharp focus. In addition to the viewfinder, of course, there is a 3\" diagonal touchscreen display which is incredibly versatile.<br /><br />The zoom is not extravagant, but nor is it paltry. I was able to get in close enough for the vast majority of the shots I took, and all in all it was a clear upgrade from my previous camera (which I nonetheless love dearly), a Lumix GM1. Other features worth noting are the much-ballyhooed 4K and post-focus modes. The former is a godsend for shooters who take a lot of action shots -- at sporting events, on busy streets, or at the pool with kids on vacation (as another reviewer mentioned). Seriously revolutionary. These are not the kind of shots I normally take, but I played around with it enough to be able to tell you that the process is much easier than I expected, and I like that you can create new files -- as many as you like from the same 4K stream -- right on the camera before transferring them to your computer. The post-focus was nifty too, and works as advertised, but again, I tend to build my shots around focal points right off the bat, so it's not a feature I used very often.<br /><br />So how did I use the ZS100, and what kind of pictures did I take? Lots of tight streetscapes of urban & rural environments -- houses, storefronts, intersections, interiors, that sort of thing (see them at [...]). I used the viewfinder almost exclusively, and set the camera to (A)perture priority with the rear dial set to adjust f-numbers. Eventually, I settled into using the zoom lever for zoom and the control ring for manual focus. Once I made this change, I was happier with the results. The autofocus works fine, but I felt I was able to get even better shots on manual, especially when shooting with a wide aperture. I worked with RAW files, though the jpgs I experimented with looked great too. The camera really impressed in indoor conditions -- I took some absolutely glorious interior shots in low-light environments, and even when grain was present, it wasn't particularly noisy and only added a bit of character. Colors remained rich and vibrant throughout.<br /><br />As I said before, I loved my Lumix GM1, and I'm certainly going to keep it around. But the ZS100 is an undeniable upgrade: I get a powerful zoom, a great viewfinder, better build quality, extra features that are both fun and useful, and enough customization to keep things familiar and make whatever changes are necessary. I feel like this camera is a perfect fit for the photographer I am, and even the photographer I ultimately hope to become.","I wanted this camera badly, so I bought it a day or two after it became available. It was through Amazon, but the order was fulfilled by Focus Camera. The ZS100 arrived in a few days (seemed a little slow on the shipping) and immediately there were problems out of the box. I got lots of error messages just trying to do the initial setup. I did get it set up and took a couple of photos, but was getting error messages and freeze ups every minute or so. So the same day I received it, I shipped it back to Focus Camera for a refund. Once the camera arrived at Focus, the refund was slow in coming and I was not reimbursed for the return shipping. I eventually got the refund and Amazon reimbursed for the shipping after I complained.<br /><br />The camera was in short supply and I wanted it badly for an upcoming assignment (a paying photography gig), so I ordered a replacement from Adorama. That one came promptly with a carton full of accessories -- and the camera worked perfectly out of the box. On to the review of the Panasonic ZS100:<br /><br />I like it... I really like it. I have had several Panasonic ZS series cameras starting with the ZS7, but the last one I got (the ZS50) was not nearly as good as I expected. It's photos were just fair at best, although video was pretty good. I loved the size and the long zoom (30x) but the lens added distortion and artifacts, especially when zoomed all the way in. I knew what I needed: I wanted to trade some zoom length for a bigger sensor. That's exactly what the ZS100 is, and it works much as I expected.<br /><br />The Panasonic ZS100 has a \"1-inch\" sensor, which works out to a diagonal of about 16mm. That doesn't sound that big, but it has something like four times the area of the sensor in the ZS50 (which is a 1/2.3 inch sensor). More area means bigger pixels that have better light gathering ability, which means lower noise and higher resolution from less optical interference. This sounds complex, but I can tell you that it works -- the ZS100 takes much better photos and much better video than the ZS50. Of course, it costs quite a bit more.<br /><br />What I like about photos from the ZS100:<br /><br />-Excellent clarity and color<br />-Much better in low light than a small-sensor camera. The ZS100 really is usable to ISO1600.<br />-The flash on the ZS100 is excellent. It's a pop-up flash that lines up with the lens almost exactly, eliminating ugly flash shadows.<br />-Even though the lens is f5.9 when zoomed all the way in, I still get excellent bokah. Check one of my images below.<br />-At 20 megapixels, there is plenty of resolution for my applications, which includes magazine publishing.<br /><br />What I don't like about photos from the ZS100:<br /><br />-The lens is not as good as the removable Panasonic lenses I have for my GX8 Micro-FourThirds camera. Lens quality seems to be the limiting factor on the ZS100<br />-The auto focus doesn't always find the right focus, even when the subjects are in the clear and seemingly obvious.<br /><br />I want to re-iterate what I said about the flash on the ZS100: This is the best flash I have seen on a pocketable camera, and I have owned about 10 such cameras over the years. It reaches out 15 feet or so with good illumination and the results look natural. Because it's a pop-up flash, it is virtually impossible to accidentally cover it with a finger. (It was much too easy to accidentally cover the flash on the ZS50.)<br /><br />I complained about the autofocus on the ZS100 and you might think that I could just use manual focus. I do use manual focus and it is easy to use, but it's just not as fast as touching the shutter button to get a focus. I love that the ZS100 has a convenient manual focus, which I find especially useful for video shooting -- more about that in a moment.<br /><br />As for my photography assignment, I completed it with the ZS100 with good results. A couple of these photos are shown below.<br /><br />Now onto the ZS100's video capabilities. I actually shoot video more than I do photos, so I was really excited to get the ZS100 for its 4K video capability.<br /><br />Here's what I like about the Panasonic ZS100's video:<br /><br />-4K video quality is excellent, and HD (1080p) is even better.<br />-The format the ZS100 uses for 4K video (100 Mbps MP4) plays back on all my computers with minimal complaint. I can even take the raw video files and play them on my Hisense 4K TV. That has a REAL \"wow\" factor!<br />-When shooting 4K video, the lens works out to be 37mm to 370mm, and I like the 370mm telephoto. Having 37mm at the wide end is not so good.<br />-Although no one has mentioned it that I've seen, the ZS100 will record 1080p at 120 fps for nice slow motion. Yes, it will do 120 fps at 1080p -- very nice. When shooting at 1080p, either slow-motion or normal speed, the zoom range is 31mm to 310mm.<br /><br />Here's what I don't like about the ZS100's video:<br /><br />-Again, the lens is not as good as the MUCH more expensive lenses I have for the Panasonic GX8. As with photos, the lens quality limits the ultimate quality of the images. They just don't look quite as pristine as the photos and videos I get from the GX8, although the ZS100 does fine with both. (The cheapest lens I have for the GX8 costs as much as the ZS100 camera, so this is not a surprise.)<br />-There's no jack for external audio.<br />-Having the widest shot be 37mm (31mm at 1080p).<br /><br />For a pocketable camera, the ZS100 does a great job with photos and video, although a tick below the similarly priced Panasonic LX100. On the other hand, the LX100 has just a 3x lens, although higher quality... decisions, decisions.<br /><br />Ergonomics and handling:<br /><br />The ZS100 is chunkier and noticeably heavier than the ZS50. The ZS100 will easily fit in a jacket pocket and will even go in a roomy pants pocket, but you'll notice it. I carried it for four days at a big convention, where I took dozens of photos for publication. It was in the pocket of my sport coat and was not a problem there at all.<br /><br />The 3-inch touch screen display on the ZS100 is excellent, and I quickly adapted to the touch screen after not having one on the ZS50. The ZS100 also has a small but useful eyepiece (electronic) viewfinder that is wonderful when shooting outdoors or when I need the added stability of holding the camera to my face. The eyepiece viewfinder has just enough pixels to be useful -- as far as I can tell, the ZS100's eyepiece viewfinder is identical to the viewfinder on the ZS50.<br /><br />The other buttons and controls on the ZS100 are in logical locations, although there is a knob on top of the camera that I don't really see the need for. I can probably assign it to do something I regularly use, such as exposure, but I haven't yet done that. It's just there and does nothing at the moment.<br /><br />Overall, I like the size, photo quality and video quality of the ZS100 quite a bit. I wish the auto focus was better, but I very much enjoy the lower noise and higher sensitivity of the ZS100, as compared to the ZS50. It does exactly what I expected the larger sensor to do. And the flash -- I'm very happy with the flash on the ZS100, despite the fact that it shoots only straight forward and can't be pointed anywhere else.<br /><br />Below are a couple photos from the ZS100. Amazon won't let me post a link to a video, but if you go to YouTube and search on my name (Bob Kovacs) and ZS100, you will find multiple videos that I've shot with the ZS100. I also have a l-o-n-g video review of the ZS100, and a comparison video: ZS100 vs. the Panasonic LX100. One nice recent video I shot with the ZS100 is on Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day 2016. Go to YouTube and search on \"arlington cemetery memorial day 2016 zs100\" and you'll find it.<br /><br />I recommend the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS100, and appreciate Amazon's customer service for making right the initial problem I had.","Pros,<br />  I do not have to carry an additional camera while vacationing. The lens is 1 and 1/2 stops slower than LX100, but the noise performance at the same ISO is comparable, which is fantastic as this can work indoor just fine, as this camera has a fantastic OIS. This was the camera I was waiting for to replace my Panasonic GH2 with 14-140 lens. This is a perfect all in one camera for any families, you really do not need anything else.<br /> There are a few scenarios that this camera will not cover.<br />  1. Wildlife, the lens at 240mm equivalent is too short to get the close up of the animals and birds. I went with Panasonic zs60 again a fantastic camera for day light wildlife shots. I carry one of these based on if I am in the city or on a trail.<br />  2. This cannot do that professional style shallow DOF that you can get from a wide aperture lens. Specifically if you are doing composed portraits. I still go back to my Lx100 to get those shots<br /><br />  With this camera I can finally ditch my full body GH2 as there simply is no reason to carry one.<br />There camera will cover every scenario you can think of and they are all easy to carry.<br />1. Panasonic LX100 for those planned composition shots and night time photography<br />2. zs100 for the general purpose have on you all the time for every scenario with the family<br />3. zs60 for those excursion to the wild. -******* UPDATE after testing found that zs60 at 30x optical zoom does not produce any better resolution picture than ZS100 with digital zoom. I am suspecting bad optics in zs60 or the smaller senor looses a 2x resolution even if it has the same megapixels. Test was in braid daylight at ISO 160 and the same shutter speed of 50. Returning zs60******<br /><br /> No more bulky lenses and cameras to lug around.<br /><br />Cons for dropping a star:<br />  1. Grip: there is no good place to place the thumb as they have removed the rubber grip there so either you are touching the screen or hitting the fn button as your finger is right on top of it and not having the grip bulge makes it very easy to press it. May be I will attach/paste a rubber stopper there.<br />  2. The indoor WB felt was in accurate, though it was keeping up (close) with my lx100 in terms of noise, the WB was way off compared to LX100. It is possible because I have a mix of daylight and led bulbs. but still lx100 had no trouble. Though this does not affect me as I shoot raw, but still.<br />  3.  There is a slight softness at 240mm edge of zoom. This make it even harder to recommend for wildlife given that the zoom is already not enough and the lack of sharpness at that zoom does not allow you to use digital zoom to compensate","The first group of pictures I have taken with my ZS100 turned out very good, and I'm very pleased  (especially the lighting).  Grandma here.  I previously owned a Panasonic DMC-TZ5 which I bought many years ago as the salesperson at the camera store said it had the best zoom for a point and shoot at that time which is what I wanted for concert pictures.  I loved that camera, and it took excellent pictures of everything, including concerts, and would still be using it if I hadn't of dropped it and broke the door that held the battery in.  I figured it was time for an upgrade anyway and started looking.  I've gone from wanting good concert pictures to wanting great pictures of the grandchildren (I make photo books every year.).  One is eight, and I used the TZ5 for all his pics.  Since the camera broke last Mother's Day, I have not had a decent camera to take pictures of my grandaughter - 8 months old.  After much research (hours on Camera Decision as well as other sites and WAITING months for the camera to be released and then to read some reviews from people actually using this camera), I ordered the ZS100 basically because of the 1\" sensor.  I had no idea what that really means, but it seemed very important.  (There is only one real camera store left in my area, and they do not carry Panasonic or had any stock of point and shoot cameras to view.)  While there were a number of other point and shoots that scored higher in Camera Decision on portrait photography (which I guess would be taking pictures of my grandchildren), this camera always scored so much higher overall in the point and shoot category that I couldn't justify not spending the extra money for it, plus my heart was set on getting another Panasonic.  My question . . . while my first set of pictures on the totally automatic mode came out good . . . what tips can someone give me (on a basic, elementary level), to get even better pictures with this camera.  I think I have bought more camera than I need, but I am happy with it, and hope to take getting good pictures to a higher level.  Again, too technical will go right over this grandma's head!!!!  Thanks . . .","I have been waiting for this camera for a long time!  It combines all the features that I like in a point and shoot and finally has a larger sensor (1 inch) that gives it a much better quality picture. The long zoom range is really great too. It has some really nice creative modes, like the glistening water ( it puts sparkles on whatever is shining brightest).  You are also able to keep the shutter open for up to 60 seconds, so you can take really cool night shots. What I was disappointed about in the ZS 40 and ZS 50 was that they did not have a \"vivid\" or \"happy\" mode that would work in the program mode or other modes. They had a \"creative\" mode that would add saturation, but only in that mode. My photos were always so washed out and seemed to lack color.  The ZS 100 has brought that back (although it does not work in every mode, like in the creative modes). Now the camera will give the photo more saturation in the program mode. The pictures are turning out beautiful!  With this camera it's easy to take a professional looking photo. It is a bit more expensive, but it's worth it!","I have been looking for years for a small camera with a decent zoom and very good image quality, and up till now I have been able to even come close.  This camera is a little larger than most point and shoots, but not by much.  The sensor is 4X larger than the average compact megazoom and I'd say the picture is 4X better and even though the zoom is only 10X the digital zoom maxed out and cropped can easily get you to 30X with BETTER image quality than the standard compact megazoom. This photo of the tulips was taken at about 35mm equivalent and the crop shows the amazing detail of this camera.  I LOVE it.  Thank you Panasonic for finally getting it right!","I spent a lot of time with this camera and took the rx100 m4 along for the ride.  The pros :<br /><br />Descent still image quality.<br />Good slow motion Video at about 100 fps<br />Post focus was cool.<br />4K burst was good at getting the shot but...<br />Good zoom<br /><br />Cons:<br />4K burst produced blurry images for me most of the time.<br />Image quality at zoom was just ok. I know what can you expect.<br />Camera did not feel as solid as the Sony.<br />No flip screen.<br />Evf was a joke. Awfully.<br /><br />I wanted the zoom but I just loved holding the Sony and loved it's 1.8 image quality.  Plus slow motion of 960fps was fun.<br /><br />Plus the raw files were not compatible with iPhoto or aperture. Boo","I still own the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS8, a small point and shoot, so I was already familiar with the photo quality, the Leica lens, the user-friendly menu, and the solid feeling of the little camera.  For a while I was considering the Sony a6000 (I checked it out at the local Best Buy).  From the moment I held ZS100 I thought I had bought a Leica camera.  It has such a solid, well-constructed feeling, perhaps a bit on the heavy when taking it on hikes, but no complains for how well it is made.  The photo quality is superb (I'm not a big video user...yet).  The number of features and controls is mind boggling.  I was able to find the advanced user manual, which is about 400 pages long!  Since I enjoy B&W photography I tried the monochrome mode; beautiful tonal range.  This is exactly the middle of the road camera I was looking for.<br /><br />The advanced user manual can be found here:<br /><br />[...]","Received my ZS100K camera a week ago and I have been practicing by shooting stills and movies experimenting with its various features.  Picture taking options are almost like DSLR cameras. The electronic view finder, helpful in very low light sitiations is amazing. This camera has replaced my Nikon Coolpix P 530 that had 42x zoom.  ZS100K is the only point-and-shoot \"pocket\" size camera I could find that has a large 1-inch sensor, 20 mp resolution AND 10x zoom.  Almost all cameras in this category, including mirrorless varieties have paltry 3x zoom. Now, to get a camera with such a large sensor and a lot bigger zoom than 10x, one has to sacrifice compactness and easy portability.  Large zoom (30x and higher) with 1-inch sensor enlarges the size considerably.  So, for me this is a compromise I like - large sensor, and 10x zoom.  Pictures taken with this unit are stunning even in low light.  The tripod mount under the camera doubles as an attachment for slave flash.  The bundle I bought came with a Vivitar slave flash unit. Together with the built-in flash and the slave Vivitar unit, one can shoot pictures in any low light situation..  Overall, I love this camera.","I like the the ZS100 and after weeks of use find the ZS100 proved to be a very good all around camera.. The ZS100 is somewhat different than prior ZS models. The box came with a starter manual and no software. You need to  download the software and advanced user manual.  The charger included is not the drop in battery model which could be an issue for some..<br /><br />The ZS100 feels good in the hand as there is enough to hold onto and all buttons and dials are easy to reach.. If you are use to any Panasonic model, the menu system is easy to follow. When you get the camera all you need to do is set the date, Location, format your high speed U3 SD card with at least a 64gb SD U3 card if you want to record in 4K and you are good to go.<br /><br />The image and video quality is very good to. excellent.. Image stabilization is very good too.<br />The EVF is small but sufficient. It won’t match the EVF on the more expensive (RX100 iii and iv and larger cameras like the RX10 or FZ1000. It’s good enough especially in bright lighting conditions.<br /><br />I find it best to avoid using advanced functions at the beginning and use just the IA settings for the first several hundred shots and videos.  If you are like many users, you will find the IA mode and/or scenic mode works surprisingly well. Even if you are an advanced user,  it is best to  try IA mode first.<br /><br />What I like about the camera and the best features.<br /><br />1. 1 Inch bsi sensor allows sharper images and better low light image and video quality much better than the tiny 1/2.3in. sensor on the ZS50, ZS60 and other small compact cameras.<br />2.  Better grip because extra thickness..<br />3.  Good zoom range eq 24-240,  much better than RX100 and other 1 inch sensor compacts<br />4.  EVF helps for bright sun conditions. .<br />5.  Touchscreen is wonderful. Sharp, bright and very sensitive. Adds extra function buttons.<br />6.  Great 4K video. It works best at wide angle, good lighting. It also works OK in IA setting too<br />7.  Small enough to carry in pocket or on your belt  (how I carry it)<br />8.  Camera includes a built-in flash that pops up better than flash in front on the ZS50, ZS60.<br />9.  Easy to use 4K photo.  Quick access to images scrolling on touchscreen.<br />10.4K video can run much longer than 5 minutes on competitve more expensive camera<br />11. Post focus for Photos. (Interesting but not tried yet).<br />12. High speed burst at 30 fps. 4K photos have 8 mp resolution<br />13. Silent mode , no shutter sound. Works well in quiet settings.<br />14. Reasonable pricing considering the EVF, touchscreen and 4K video and photo.<br />15. Extended 3 Year warranty free if purchased and registration submitted within 30 days<br />16. Excellent and  relatively easy user interface and menu system.<br />17. Wifi is easy to setup and access control of camera and transferring images.<br />18  4 fully programable function buttons. And additional soft button on touchscreen.<br /><br />Disappointments with the camera.  Things needing improvement for future models.<br /><br />1. The lens which starts at F2.8 rises quickly as you zoom and rises to F5.7 which makes low  light photography difficult when the lens is zoomed out.<br />2.  EVF is very small and resolution is limited.<br />3.  EVF works best if you are Right eye dominant. Left eye, your nose hits LCD screen.<br />4.  No easy way to add filters or lens hood.<br />5.  Popup flash works well but is relatively weak. Limited distance<br />6.. No Microphone or headphone jack. (Rarely found on small cameras)<br />7.  No NFC or GPS<br />8.  Bokeh or blurring of background is better than ZS50 but very limited.<br />9 . LCD screen is fixed and can’t be turned for selfies or video.<br /><br />The sound quality was fine as long as it isn't too windy. The stereo mike is on top of the camera. There is no port for an external mike, earphone or external flash. If this is important I often switch to a larger camera which has that option.<br /><br />Bottom-line:<br /><br />The ZS100 has many great features such as an improved EVF, 10X zoom, touch screen, 4K video and it’s small enough to fit in your pocket. The  image quality is better with the new 1 inch sensor.  It’s a  camera that you can take anywhere and get much better quality than the best smart phone or other small less expensive compact camera.  It’s a camera which you can tavel with at home or on vacation.","This is a good camera that checks off a number of boxes for many people.  This is not the perfect camera, nor is it trying to be.  It's not a full frame sensor but it does have a good size 1\" sensor that gathers a lot more light than the traditional small sensors shoved in cameras of this size for so many years.  It's not a super zoom but it's got a good focal range of 24-250 that is wanted by many.  Finally, it's compact, which is really appreciated by those who prefer to travel light.<br /><br />The image quality (IQ) is good for a camera of this type and should satisfy many.  You can't go too far wrong with this camera and I think a great many people will enjoy it.  Are there cameras that can do better in all the things I just mentioned?  Sure, but this camera didn't aim to be the \"best\" in any particular category.  It aimed to be a pretty nice collection of a number of features so many people were after (compact, good sensor and nice focal range).<br /><br />My only personal issue is the menu system, which I hate LOL!  Fortunately, I'm not one who needs to fiddle with settings too often and once I've got things set up pretty much the way I traditionally like them . . . the settings become stable for me.  All in all, it's a nice package that takes good images.  It's kind of the first of it's kind in this category and it will be interesting to see how Sony, Canon, Nikon, Fuji, etc. react to it and attempt to surpass it.  We are finally starting to see the things so many of us wanted for so long appear in a compact package.  Hopefully, this is just the beginning.  I'm confident this category will grow and be refined.<br /><br />The main thing is to just get out there and enjoy the journey of capturing images and memories.  Don't get caught up in all the technobable and camera trashing that sadly has become sport for too many.  The camera forums are filled with people trashing EVERY SINGLE CAMERA that comes out!  Listening to them too intensely can paralyze you from buying anything!  Just go out and enjoy taking pictures!","Going on vacation and not in the mood to carry around a huge body camera and multiple lense adding up over thousands of dollars? Then this camera is your answer.<br /><br />I'm upgrading from a Panasonic zs19 so this is quite a change.<br /><br />First off the feel of the camera is very light, there doesn't seem to be much of a sturdiness to it. I would be somewhat scared to have this fall to the ground. It also doesn't help that the outside is a pretty slick plastic aiding in possible accidents.<br /><br />The 1\" sensor you continually see mentioned. To explain it a little, a larger sensor allows more light to be captured for your image, in turn providing an image with much more detail than a smaller sensor. The fact that a 1\" sensor is squeezed in to a mostly pocketable point and shoot camera with 10x optical zoom is a huge bonus.<br /><br />As said, this has a 10x optical zoom and additional digital zoom. This should be more than enough for most but if for whatever reason you require more I would suggest looking at the Panasonic zs 60 which boasts a 30x zoom in a small package, but will sacrifice a 1\" sensor.<br /><br />There is a touch screen as well which allows you to set zoom, specific favorite settings, take the picture, adjust the focus point and is all pretty responsive and works out well for being 3\"<br /><br />There is also a post focus option you've likely seen advertised for cell phones recently. This allows you to take a picture and afterwards you can change the focus point from something close in view to a further point or vice versa and capture the exact picture you want.<br /><br />4k video is also available but be advised that the image stabilizer does not work in this mode. There is \" live cropping \" during 4k recording to help keep stability.<br /><br />Obviously RAW is available to allow various editing such as white balance, contrast etc.<br /><br />Wi-Fi is available to connect the camera to your phone which provides you the ability to remotely use the camera or transfer photos and video to your device. Unfortunately nfc is not an option to accomplish this<br /><br />There aren't really any cameras with these features and quality  to compare at this size"]},{"name":"Sony Alpha a6500","amazon_reviews":["We shoot weddings full time and love our A7rII, A7s, A7II, FS5, and FS7 – but we wanted something smaller and still high quality to carry with us for our own personal life shooting.  Having recently spent 3 weeks in Europe with this camera, all I can say is wow.  Everything from the 24mp stills to the 4k IBIS video is absolutely fantastic.  Doesn't leave me missing any major pro feature in our bigger cameras.","The Sony A6500  is an awesome camera.  Was able to use all my existing E-mount lenses with excellent results.  Very excited with this purchase and has gotten us back to taking pictures of our family weekly.","Wife loves it.","Compact, versatile and produces quality images!","Worth the upgrade from the a6300.","I recently upgraded from the A6000 and could not be happier.  I am an amateur photographer with a love for landscapes, sports, wildlife, and capturing people doing what they love.  The A6000 was a tremendous entry into an advanced camera that has produced, and continues to produce, excellent results.  I stepped up to the A6500 to take advantage of the improved focusing, increased buffer, and the IBIS system.  The IBIS has really improved the sharpness of my work and added confidence in capturing images beyond the normal focal length/shutter speed guidelines.  I recently paired it with the Sony 18-105 G series lens and the combo is amazing.  We are planning a trip to Europe later this year and cannot wait to take this over the pond and test my skills.  If you like the e-mount system (I do), looking for maximum flexibility in shooting varied subjects, want a camera that will produce professional results, and are looking for the benefits of a mirrorless camera, do not hesitate to pick up the A6500.  I am confident that this camera will take my photography to a new level.  BTW - the 4k video is also awesome!","No remorse in buying this camera. I own 2 other sony camera (NEX6 and A77) but this beast can outdo both.","Purchased the a6500 with Sony SELP18105G E PZ 18-105mm F4 G OSS as a potential replacement for my full frame D610 camera. I've invested in some nice Nikon glass such as the 70-200 f2.8 and 2.0 tele converter to take photos of my kids recitals and other school activities. However the kit seems to be getting heavier each year!  I decided to purchase the a6500 as a potential replacement due to the lighter weight, 4K video and a few other shortcomings of the D610 such as no GPS (can use Bluetooth with the Sony), small buffer size and low video quality. I however do love the tack sharp images I get from the D610 and 70-200 combination so will be putting the Sony through it's paces to see if it's a keeper.<br /><br />Headed to Disney in a few weeks and will be leaving the Nikon at home to see how well the Sony performs. So far the Sony has taking some nice videos although I thought the image stabilization would be a little better. It's not something you can easily walk around with while taking videos without some significant shaking; my Sony handycam seems to do a little better in this department. As for photos, so far nothing to complain about but it's taking me a little while to adjust to the new AF options. I've missed a few shots but it was operator error not the camera.<br /><br />Battery life is horrible but I knew this before I purchased the a6500. I'll be carrying extra batteries (wasabi) and a USB battery pack with micro USB cable until I get a better feel of how many batteries It'll take to get through a day of shooting video and images. I do like the fact it can be charged via micro USB as it provides more options while traveling.","Overall excellent camera.  I owned the NEX-5R before this and was very happy with it.  I wanted to upgrade mostly looking for better low light performance.  The A6500 is amazing when it comes to video, especially in low light.  I really like the customization of the buttons. The in-body stabilization works great on unstabilized lenses. Very solid build quality.  The only thing that would've made this camera better would be an LCD the could flip 180 degrees for selfies, like the NEX-5R could.","We shoot weddings full time and love our A7rII, A7s, A7II, FS5, and FS7 – but we wanted something smaller and still high quality to carry with us for our own personal life shooting.  Having recently spent 3 weeks in Europe with this camera, all I can say is wow.  Everything from the 24mp stills to the 4k IBIS video is absolutely fantastic.  Doesn't leave me missing any major pro feature in our bigger cameras.","The Sony A6500  is an awesome camera.  Was able to use all my existing E-mount lenses with excellent results.  Very excited with this purchase and has gotten us back to taking pictures of our family weekly.","Wife loves it.","Compact, versatile and produces quality images!","Worth the upgrade from the a6300.","I recently upgraded from the A6000 and could not be happier.  I am an amateur photographer with a love for landscapes, sports, wildlife, and capturing people doing what they love.  The A6000 was a tremendous entry into an advanced camera that has produced, and continues to produce, excellent results.  I stepped up to the A6500 to take advantage of the improved focusing, increased buffer, and the IBIS system.  The IBIS has really improved the sharpness of my work and added confidence in capturing images beyond the normal focal length/shutter speed guidelines.  I recently paired it with the Sony 18-105 G series lens and the combo is amazing.  We are planning a trip to Europe later this year and cannot wait to take this over the pond and test my skills.  If you like the e-mount system (I do), looking for maximum flexibility in shooting varied subjects, want a camera that will produce professional results, and are looking for the benefits of a mirrorless camera, do not hesitate to pick up the A6500.  I am confident that this camera will take my photography to a new level.  BTW - the 4k video is also awesome!","No remorse in buying this camera. I own 2 other sony camera (NEX6 and A77) but this beast can outdo both.","Purchased the a6500 with Sony SELP18105G E PZ 18-105mm F4 G OSS as a potential replacement for my full frame D610 camera. I've invested in some nice Nikon glass such as the 70-200 f2.8 and 2.0 tele converter to take photos of my kids recitals and other school activities. However the kit seems to be getting heavier each year!

No raw video and the settings/menu aren't very quick for switching between different settings.<br />So if you are looking for a fast versitility camera it may not be the perfect match but the autofocus is incredible and very intuitive. I also wish the screen swivelled. Beautiful viewfinder and great shots in low light with low f lenses.<br />Battery is doesn't last as long as I'd like either. Maybe about 3 hour life.","Being a Nikon D610 owner for a few years, I was due for an upgrade. After research, I decided to switch systems and go with Sony. Best move I could have ever made!! ISO performance is out of this world. Easy go up to ISO 6400 with minimum noise. IBSI is very good too, especially for handheld. All in all, from video to photography, this one will be in my bag for a few years!!","just wish it came with a kit lens, but I am loving the camera! It takes amazing pictures and video","Great sensor, greats specs on the paper, but on the real life... Not really a camera, a gadgetry , poorly , ergonomically flawed piece of equipment. Returned it. A pain to use, i wasn't reaching out to it with joy, but with fear... Everything seemed crammed, small, hard to access, like things were happening in a small, cryptic universe that i didn't understand. Such a different experience from my Canon 5ds, which is ok, i understand, it is a mirrorless camera, but. I remember my GH1 hacked, a much better camera for me, way better ergonomics, much more user friendly. Sony has to learn how to build these mirrorless cameras, after putting such amazing specs and sensors in them.","Best camera I've ever owned.","Wished it had longer battery life but if perfects otherwise.","Best camera I've used.  Finally enough changes to upgrade from my NEX 7.  No heavy glass to carry.  Uses all my NEX 7 (APS-C) lenses.","Great camera with great features!!","First off Amazon shipped this to me through Focus Camera and it was delivered a day ahead of schedule. Great job! Thank you for the great service!<br /><br />I'll keep this short - after a couple of months research into mirrorless cameras - I decided on the Sony A6500. I sold my Nikon D7000 and 6 Nikkor and Sigma lenses, 4 flashes, and one RC macro lens kit, all so I could buy the Sony. I was determined to downsize so I wouldn't have an excuse to not carry a good mobile camera everywhere I went ( not including my iPhone 6 ).<br /><br />After using it for a couple of weeks now I am liking this purchase more and more. Other than the menu system being a bit overly complex, I have no complaints on how easy this thing is to use. Both the responsive touch screen and the viewfinder make it the best of both worlds when composing pictures. The quality of the shots is outstanding with virtually any of the 5 lenses I bought for this system.  (The Rokinon 12mm F2.0,<br />Sigma 19mm f/2.8 DN, the Sony SELP18105G E PZ 18-105mm F4 G OSS and the Sony SEL1018 10-18mm Wide-Angle Zoom Lens, and the Sony 30mm f3.5 macro) - the pictures are amazing as is the software in the camera once you get the hang of what everything does.<br /><br />When you learn the basics about programming buttons on your camera for different functions it speeds along everything. As does really learning the menu and how things effect the various shooting modes on the top dial.<br /><br />I have been shooting non-stop with it since I purchased it. And with all the lenses getting very sharp images, well exposed and virtually no noise with iso settings in excess of 6400 is making shooting exciting for me again.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into a detailed review of the camera as better people than me have done it already.  Suffice it to say I am extremely pleased with the camera and how it's making me shoot and see the world through a fresh set of lenses and a seriously good camera. (No video to speak of yet - though the little I've played with - again, it's at a level that is beyond my current abilities to really take advantage of it - but I plan to make use of it as well and learn to shoot good video with time and this camera is one you can grow into, just like the photos.).<br /><br />So I highly recommend this camera to anyone - be it a hobbyist, amateur or a professional looking for a second or third back-up that is well built, solid and very compact. I find I take it with me everywhere and am seeing things again in ways that have been missing as of the past few years.","This is a great camera, but is not much of an improvement over the Sony A6300.  This falls under the mid price range and for most beginners, this will be a great choice.  It has a new touchscreen and a new 5 axis stableziation.  The battery life isn't that great, but I like having an extra battery on me just in case anyways.  The apc zoom could be better on this if you compare this to nikon or canon, but I still found the pictures to come out good.  I would not recommend this camera if you plan to use this for video.  The screen dims quite a bit and the battery life once again is short (about hour max).  There is a big heat issue problem, which continued with the A6300.  You can tell to record anyways but you will run the risk of damaging the camera.  There is no way of knowing how long you can record while in this mode without totally killing the camera.  So depending on what you plan to do with this camera.  I think this is a great choice for stills, but video not so much.","Honestly was disappointed and went back to the a6300.  I have no idea why, but this camera's auto-focus was off 75% of the time using the same lens as on my a6300.  I ended up in frustration and returned it.","As a long time user of the Sony NEX-7, and the owner of a number of the Sony and Zeiss E-Mount lenses, I have been looking forward to the arrival of this camera with the upgraded features, the in-body-stabilization, enhanced Auto Focus capability and the user interface improvements. These are all the good things that Sony has added to the flagship of their APSC line. The image quality is also outstanding. So what is not to like??<br /><br />I didn't jump on to the A6XXX bandwagon when the first in the series was introduced because it just didn't seem to be enough of an upgrade in image quality to warrant the additional expense. But most of all, the wonderful body styling and ergonomics of the NEX-7 had been converted into more of a \"brick\" with buttons and dials. There just wasn't any comfortable way I could hold the camera that truly fit my hand. Then came the A6300, which was yet another \"brick\" with slightly better features. I had high hopes that the A6500 would finally break that mold and provide a camera body with great ergonomics and dials and function buttons that were logical and fell naturally under your fingertips. I know that the Sony design team can do it, because I have also held the A77 and more recently the RX10-III, which are both really nicely designed bodies that conform easily to natural handgrip positions. But, alas when I finally took delivery of the long awaited a6500 I was disappointed to see that besides a slightly enlarged handgrip (a welcome improvement) the camera body is still very \"clunky\" feeling in my hands, with no comfortable location to place my left hand. With larger lenses this is less of a problem, because you can always grip the lens barrel (fair enough). With shorter lenses like the 35mm, the 20mm, the 16-50mm, or the Sigma primes, that isn't really possible or comfortable. Not to mention that the rotating dial next to the mode dial is stiff and awkward to engage with your thumb. There are lots of good examples of better ergonomically designed cameras both smaller and larger than the A6500. The Panasonic GX7, GX8, GH4, GH5, the Olympus OMD-EM1, The OMD-EM5, and even the Sony A7 series are much \"handier\".<br /><br />UPDATE 3/17: I finally decided that the IBIS and the improved user interface was enough of a reason to upgrade to the A6500 from the NEX-7, and I would just try to get used to the new blockier \"form factor\". The good news is that the more I used the camera, the more I liked it and the less I was bothered by the graceless ergonomics. Somehow, my hands found the right places to be when I was taking a picture. At the end of the day, the camera is a tool with a lot of great features and superb image quality. There is a lot to like about this camera, so I am revisiting my original 3-star rating to 4.5 stars.","The Sony a6500 camera is undoubtedly an impressive camera, but at a high cost and some missing essential features. I'll compare this camera with 3 other Sony APSC cameras so you can decide if its cost is worth it. All 4 cameras use E-mount lenses and all 4 have phase & contrast detection focusing, electronic viewfinders (EVF), and 921K dots resolution, articulating 3\" LCD screen. These cameras feature 2 types of continuous shooting: regular mode adjusts the focus for each shot, while speed-priority uses the focus of the 1st shot for subsequent shots.<br /><br />1. The 2014 NEX-6 camera has an impressive feature set for a low cost. It shoots 16MP photos and has 99 points for phase detection, 25 points for contrast detection, and a 2.36M dots resolution EVF. Regular & speed-priority continuous shooting are: 3fps for regular and 10 fps (frames per sec). It shoots videos at 1080 resolution at 60p speed. I have used this camera for 2 years now and it takes sharp, beautiful photos. It has been discontinued for 2 years now, but you can still buy it in like-new condition for $300 as of Jan 2017. I only thing I wish it had is an extra control dial (top right dial in back of newer Sony cameras).<br /><br />2. The 2015 a6000 camera is only a slight improvement over the NEX-6. Since you can't buy the NEX-6 new anymore, this is your alternative for a low-cost Sony APSC camera. It shoots 24MP photos (50% more) and has 179 points for phase detection (1.8X more than NEX-6) and 25 points for contrast detection, but a smaller 1.44M dots resolution EVF (40% less). Regular & speed-priority continuous shooting are: 6fps for regular and 11 fps. It also shoots videos at 1080 resolution at 60p speed. The trade-off of a smaller, less resolution EVF for slightly better focusing and photo resolution is not worth it.<br /><br />3. The 2016 a6300 camera is an improvement over the a6000. It shoots 24MP photos and has 425 points for phase detection (2.4X more than a6000), 169 points for contrast detection (6.8X more), and a 2.36M dots resolution EVF. Regular & speed-priority continuous shooting are: 8fps for regular and 11 fps. It shoots videos at an improved 4K resolution at 30p speed. Also, the camera is weather resistant and the EVF has 120 fps mode to help with action shots.<br /><br />4. The 2016 a6500 camera has all the features of Sony a6300 camera. Also, it is the 1st Sony APSC camera to have 5-axis image stabilization that works with any E-mount or A-mount lens and a LCD display that is also a touchscreen, which allows for touch focusing. Sony claims that the stabilization can increase performance by 5-stops, but if you're using an OSS (optical stabilized) lens, that performance increase is more likely 2.5-stops only. If you have a Sony DSLR camera, then you probably already have OSS lenses since a majority of Sony lenses are OSS. If you already have some OSS lenses, then the a6300 is the recommended camera since you don't really need the stabilization. Otherwise, the a6500 is the recommended camera for shooting lots of videos or action/ night photos. It's twice the price of the a6000 camera, so be sure you really need the image stabilization.<br /><br />However, I recommend waiting since all 4 models are missing 2 critical features. The camera needs GPS since many people upload their photos online or keep them on a phone, which many sites/ phones place on a map. Although some sites can place common images (ie: Eiffel tower) on the map, most sites & phones require GPS coordinates to auto locate the photos and place them on the map. Companies have been resisting adding GPS because of its cost and power usage. However, cheaper lower power GPS sensors are now available. An alternative is to have Bluetooth 4.0LE that can continuously communicate with a smartphone to grab GPS coordinates whenever the user take photos. The current app for Sony cameras can insert GPS coordinates only after each photo was taken and manually selected, so that needs to be improved. Also, the LCD screen is too small and too low resolution. It boasts 921K resolution 3\" LCD screen, but that's equivalent to only 640x480 pixels on an area that's less than half of any smartphone. You need a larger area to touch and higher resolution if you're using the screen for touch focusing. Sony should increase the LCD screens to at least 3.4\" with 1080x720 pixels (2.33M resolution). GPS & a larger, higher resolution LCD are required for the price Sony is asking for the a6500.","The a6500 is an all-around solid camera.<br /><br />+ The build quality is excellent, handling is equally excellent, and image quality is superb.<br />+ ISO noise is well-controlled right up to 6,500 and even ISO 12,500 manages to hold on to a fair amount of detail- though it does loose subtle color detail but is only noticeable at the 1:1 ratio.<br />+ The weight is manageable for long periods of shooting and it is nicely balances with the Sony Zeiss SEL1670Z lens.<br /><br />-  Unfortunately the touch-screen leaves a lot to be desired; hopefully a firmware update will improve its responsiveness however. Add a screen protector and it is all but useless.<br /><br />A few adjustments to the system and you'll have beautifully saturated images with excellent dynamic range (specifically you'll want to shoot JPEG images in Picture Profile Two, and will want to increase Saturation to +2, increase Color Mode Red to +4, and reduce Knee to 97.5% from 100%leaving everything else alone. This corrects colors and helps avoid blowing out highlights. Reminder Picture Profiles only impacts JPEG images, not RAW. DRO will automatically be turned off).<br /><br />If you can afford it buy it. Some say spend the extra money and get a full-frame equivalent however this will seriously add size and weight to your camera bag and you have very few choices for long telephoto lenses whereas the Sony G 70-300mm gives an effective focal length of 450mm on this body making it ideal for sport and animal photographers.","No problems, excelent camera, i love it!!","great camera","I won't repeat all the good things--autofocus, IBIS, etc. Great little camera. I also have the a7ii & a77ii. Also great cameras. BUT my copy of the A6500 turns true blue into blue-green. I have never had a color problem with my other Sony cameras. I have tried adjusting white balance with only marginal benefit. The problem appears worse when an object is translucent or backlighted. I can fix in Lightroom, but do no not fancy post processing every sky for color problems.I shoot wildlife, mostly great blue herons and hummingbirds. Lots of blue to fix! About to return camera. Maybe try another copy. Want to know if anyone else has color cast problems with A6500 or A6300? For now I will give 3 stars. Quality control should have caught this. Not a cheap camera! Will update if problem is fixable or I get new copy without the problem.<br /><br />UPDATE: Baffled by color shift. Opened a file with FastRawViewer which showed me the embedded jpeg in the raw file as well as the raw file on its own. The raw file shows my blue subject as I see it. The embedded jpeg shows the blue-green shift which is not what my subject looks like! See photos from FRV.","All I can say is WOW! Coming from Canon 60D to this with the 18-200 LE lens. The pics are beautiful from near to far. Also added the 50mm f1.8 for portraits. I just realized what I have been missing all these years. I am just an excited amateur photographer with a new toy.<br /><br />The a6500 fits perfectly in the hand, has the right weight and balance. Although its expensive, the seamless experience in taking the pics and 4k videos definitely justifies the cost. Very happy with purchase. The 3-axis Zhiyun Crane would be a great addition to this setup.","Awsome camera, read about it and you will know.","great camera nice improvement from a6000.  Wish the touch screen had more functions. Like navigating the menu via touch etc.","I was completely surprised with the new a6500 that you still need to have \"two\" wireless flashes and that you cannot use the built in flash as the trigger like other Sony Cameras.  I just got the new and totally awesome a6500 and this little guy is a beast and a great camera!!  I purchased the HVL-F43M Flash for the sole purpose of having an off camera flash.  Surprise, now I will need to get another flash or the wireless deal from Sony to accomplish what should already be in the camera.  BTW, the flash is a really nice flash also, so no equipment complaints here.  I travel to some pretty remote places and have very limited space for gear, hence why I shelled out the big bucks for the a6500.  I am hoping with some software/firmware updates this will change going into the future.  If was almost a fine print deal in the user manual that the built in flash will not work to trigger the Sony off camera flash.  Even on the help section from Sony, it only list the a6000 as not working without using two flashes.  Little bit aggravated about this and was looking for anyone and Sony's advice on how to fix, update and just get this working the way it should work.  Again, love the camera, lenses and flash, really top notch stuff!Sony Alpha a6500 Digital Camera with 2.95-Inch LCD (Body Only)","Yeah! Very nice","A6500 with  E 16-70 zoom lens:<br /><br />I love this camera, but as a nut for good equipment, I thought I’d comment on the couple of things that are not so perfect on my A6500.<br /><br />The mode dial on mine is sticky, so tight and hard to turn that I think it’s probably just defective.  I’m going to try swapping it at the dealer for a different one when they get more in stock.  Hoping they aren’t all like this.  It would be ok if you hardly ever use the mode dial, but it’s a problem for frequent use.  Otherwise, the camera body is very nice.<br /><br />My lens, Sony VARIO-TESSAR T* E 16–70 mm F4 ZA OSS, wonderful, but again, a slight mechanical complaint.  The zoom action is stick-slip-stick-slip all the way from one end to the other, when you are trying to zoom slow.  Not smooth.  I doubt that this is a defect.  Probably typical.<br />Want to mention about the lens, this zoom lens will focus at very close distances and it makes almost no difference whether you are full-wide or full-telephoto on the zoom.  Mfr spec says minimum focus distance is about 14 inches.  I found yes, 14 inches full wide, and I would say 15 inches at full tele.  Very close for a 70 mm lens that is not advertised to be a macro lens.  You might not even need a macro lens if you buy this zoom lens.<br /><br />I’m awed by the features and the performance, for example the range and quality of auto ISO these days, wow.  I do a lot of technical photography, where I want to see small detail very sharp.  I’m finding that if I have enough light (from either the built-in flash, or an HVL-F32M flash if necessary) to keep the ISO below about 500, I can get great detail with very little grain.  “Steady Shot” (IBIS) lets me use slower shutter speeds than I have ever used before.  So for example, if I want good depth of field, I can use Aperture Priority Mode, set a high F number, check the ISO and shutter speed in preview, take a few shots without flash and with flash, and probably get something very good.  Fix the color balance and brightness of the flash shots with simple “Auto Correct” in “Play Memories Home”, and done, usually.  Actually it won’t preview the ISO number when you are using a flash, but it will show you what ISO it used right after you shoot.<br /><br />When you have the focus mode set to \"DMF\" it will jump to a zoomed screen automatically when you start rotating the focus ring on the lens.  I love it!<br /><br />Really, we are having wonderful technology here.  So 5 stars.","Love the camera - light, compact and capable.","All I can say is WOW! Great pics and video!!! It's small enough to take anywhere but produces better pics than my Canon DSLR.","The a6500 is not for everyone.  Unless you need IBIS and some of its other advanced features -- Sony makes less pricy aps-c alternatives such as the still excellent a6000 and the mid-priced a6300.  Other vendors such as Fuji has a better lineup of native aps-c lenses.  Many photographers prefer Fuji's more intuitive retro design which is easier to pick up quickly. Indeed the a6x00s bodies require a bit of time to learn and more time to correctly customize the setting/buttons to your needs.<br /><br />So why 5 stars?. Because, in the right hands, the a6500 is as good as it gets.<br /><br />1.  Best-in-class aps-c sensor with excellent dynamic range (note that competitors--Nikon and Fuji--use the same sensor though so this is a tie, not a true advantage,)<br />2.  With focus peaking and now IBIS, best-in-class for adapting both modern (Canon, Sony Alpha) and legacy lenses,  IBIS also is invaluable for any lens that lacks OIS.  The IBIS can be very effective--by my own measurements--up to 5-stops for long telephotos.  Note that older manual focus and other non-Sony lenses only get 3-axis stablization.  Overall, these capabilities free you from being locked into a single vendor's system. If you want to use only native glass, Fuji has a better selection of native aps-c lenses at the time of this writing.<br />3.  Best in class AF capabilities (more pdaf coverage, eye, af, fast af with native lenses).<br />4.  Huge buffer plus 11 fps burst mode..  Combined with AF capabilities, great for sport and action photography.<br />5.  Streamlined rangefinder style.  Lighter and more compact than competitors.  However, some have a different take --If you want a bunch of knobs to twittle or prefer a larger DSLR body to hold, this is not the body for you.  Also, if you are a professional and feel that dual card slots are a must have -- go elsewhere.<br />6.  Custom buttons allow the  body to be customized for different shooting scenarios. Done correctly, rapid, one-handed shooting plus fast adjustments with no menu diving required.  Again, these customizations/correct usage patterns require some learning, setup and even experimentation of the part of the user.  You can't just pick up an a6500, fire away and hope to master it in a few minutes.  Too many under the hood features for that approach to be viable.<br />7. Less expensive than comparable alternatives (Fuji XT-2 and Nikon D500).<br /><br />That said, before, you buy the a6500, make sure that you understand your strategy for mating it with suitable glass, Otherwise you may be disappointed with the skimpy and over-priced / under-valued selection of native emount aps-c lenses.  But again, you own full frame lenses from Canon, Sony FE, Sony Alpha or Sony Alpha dt-- you can adapt all these lenses with suitable adapters from Sony and Metabones.  And Sony does have some native emount lenses that are worth considering. Alternatively, there are classic MF legacy lenses that work better on the a6500 than they ever could on their original film DSLR bodies.","Awesome camera,  first of all,  if you're getting into entry level dslr shooting and considering spending in the low 1k-2k range,  this camera should be in your consideration.  I've been dabbling around with my dslr now for a few years now,  with a canon 70D,  which in itself is a great entry level camera that has a lot of features and video, but if you times those features by 10x,  you get what the sony a6500 is,  it's like a souped up race car, where the canon was a low end non s version porsche boxer,  sure it handles well and gets the job done, but in the end,  you want the souped up race porsche GT-3.  So the sony gives you 4k video,  better low light,  more autofocus points,  faster shutter,  larger buffer,  i mean when you hear how fast this things takes pictures and how clear they are, you will regret your purchase.  Although,  i have learned a lot from my canon,  this camera is more fun, more wild?  While you have to deal with it's short comings, possible overheating in video mode, and short battery life,  that all to me makes this camera more dynamic and keeping you on your toes.  Sure there is a lot of menus you have to traverse, but once you get your settings in for whatever lens you have,  i have been using the older 16-50 and 55-201 lenses that you can get in bundles and kits, and it's been fantastic.  So yes, i can imagine what it's like getting a zeiss, or the G-master lenses,  just things for me to look forward to in the future.  Need a few low F primes for that bokeh,  pronounced like bouquet,  taken from  a japanese word, for fuzzy,  but i hear a lot of people on youtube say it like \"bohkah\"  umm no.  lol.  Anyways super fun,  still a fun camera with the cheaper kit lenses and still takes pretty damn sharp photo's with these lenses.  Great in all light conditions,  does a super job in program,  but will venture out and play with my own settings to get the best balance that i prefer.  You get some manuals,  battery,  strap, and charge cable that plugs into the phone.  So suggested you get the 16-50 lens,  an extra battery and some external chargers to keep the batteries going,  they do need a 2.1amp usb charger rather then the lower power chargers for other devices.  And if you're into VLOG-ing.  Then this camera again is one of the better ones to get as the pictures are really clear,  great for food vlogs or just selfie vlogs,  lots of mic kits.  Need to find a nice flash that will operate remotely with this unit to use for a bounce flash as well, but all the things that make photography fun.  It has a small built in pop up flash, but it's pretty small.  It has connectivity via wifi and bluetooth, and if you use the sony play memories app,  it can tag your photos with GPS if you are on travel and want to save location information.  Pretty cool,  so all around cool camera, pay a little up front now, but it'll be a keeper for a long while.","I own the Sony a6000, a6300, a7s and now the a6500.  I have been into serious photography for over 48 years.  So here is my first impressions of the a6500.  Construction: solid as a rock.  Extended grip is welcomed, provides confidence in hand holding without neck strap.  Autofocus:  not evaluated.  Image stabilization: I cannot see the difference in still images and have not evaluated in video.  Internal buffer:  \"Huge\" with the proper memory card.  Summary: The primary reason for me buying this camera is the huge buffer, second is the Image stabilization which should help with adapted manual focus lenses.  I would have no problem using this camera or recommending it for travel, weddings, portraits, airshows, etc. etc..","I use it primarily for shooting video. So far, I've had 0 issues with it shutting down from overheating. I had previously had the a6300 but returned it a few weeks later because it continually shut down from issues. This one is great though! :)","Outstanding camera!  Really, really like it.","The cameras is as advertised and promoted. Delivery was a mess. UPS failed the initial delivery and passed it off to a cheap liquor store a few miles away that first did not have the camera so I had to go back again and finally got it. Not thrilled.","I have owned the NEX 7, a6000, a6300, and now the a6500 (got it from other than Amazon through my local dealer). I have been very happy with each of these cameras and found each to be a significant improvement on what came before. So it is with the a6500--I am very glad that I bought it.<br /><br />The two best things about the camera for me are the IBIS and the touchscreen. I am moving from Canon (after 30 years) to Sony, and I have begun to build a set of full frame e mount lenses. Many  of these are not image stabilized, and so the a6500 makes them stabilized. I also have a large set of Canon lenses, amny of which do not have stabilization, like my 50mm f/1.2L. All of those lenses are now stabilized on the a6500.<br /><br />The touchscreen is fabulous from my point of view. It really has helped me a lot in getting the focus point where it should be.<br /><br />Between the image stabilization and the improved placement of the focus point via the touchscreen, I find that I am getting sharper pictures and a higher hit rate. I don't find the touchscreen laggy or difficult to use--it's like setting the touchpad on your computer to move the pointer at moderate speed rather than very quickly--it gives you more control. You just need to learn how to use it. And I am still not very used to the camera, having it for less than a week as I write this.<br /><br />There are lots of other improvements in the a6500: more buffer, less noise at high ISOs, better grip, more rugged body, etc. It is a great camera,<br /><br />My plan has been to have both an aps-c camera and a full frame Sony, and I was enjoying the Sony aps-c cameras while waiting for the next itertion of a Sony full frame. The a6500 is so good that I am feeling less need for the full frame Sony. It's a great camera.","This camera is absolutely amazing from the Ibis to the amazing auto focus features it really truly is much better than any other Sony or APSC camera in its class/price range.  As long as you know how to adjust the colors in camera the end result will be absolutely stunning.  The video is impeccable in the photos are extraordinary, with so much dynamic range and post adjustment ability. I would recommend this camera over any other camera when it comes to both photos and video in one body there really is nothing on the market the beats it in this price range","[Updates At Bottom]<br />There will be a lot of reviews from this camera covering the technical specifications and image quality and the camera in general.  This review will be primarily for people who are coming from the A6000/A6300 as I’m sure anyone dishing this kind of money for a camera are familiar enough with this camera or are looking at an upgrade from the aforementioned cameras.<br /><br />I am a novice/amateur photographer and I have only been attempting photography for just over a year.  This camera goes far past anything I need at this second but, I like and appreciate technology and learning how to better my hobby.  This will not necessarily be a review for the hardcore or professional photographers.  I am using this with the Zeiss 24f1.8, 50f1.4, Sony 35f1.8, 18-105f4, kit lens 16-50, as well as the Sigma MC-11 adapter with Canon 85f1.8.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with the A6000 or A6300 know that they take amazing photos.  The A6500 is no different in this regard as one would expect.  They are great cameras and the A6500 only improves on that formula but the question is does it improve it enough?  Enough to justify another Sony camera purchase within a year?  Enough to justify $1400?  Enough to justify an upgrade from the A6000 when that camera body alone can go for under $500 now?  Enough is going to be relative for a lot of people so let me just say, yeah it kind of is for me.<br /><br />I have used the A6300 since release and it has been outstanding.  Image quality, speed, low light shots, video, the list goes on and on.  When the A6500 was announced I was a little annoyed.  Granted it was set to a new price bracket of $400 more than the A6300 but had it been announced at the same time as the A6300 or even next year as a follow up, I would have felt better about my initial purchase.  I was reluctant to order the camera just on the principle of the matter and honestly not wanting to support this kind of sales model.  As I read more about the A6500 those few main new features kept on poking at me; a touch screen, in body 5-axis stabilization, and a much larger buffer.<br /><br />I have to start by saying that the touch screen is mediocre and a bit disappointing in 2016.  I guess we are so accustomed to touch screens on our phones, tablets, and computers that we just have expectations of what a touch screen is in 2016.  The A6500 does not have that touchscreen.  Beside the fact that it is not used nearly as much as one would expect for things like going through menus, it is also not super responsive, and just plain not as useful as you would hope.  Don’t get me wrong, it is a decent addition and while it has its quirks it is awesome to use it to pick focus points while looking through the view finder opposed to the directional buttons.  It is faster albeit less precise a method to pick your focus than a directional pad control but it also feels like a touch screen from 10 years ago.<br /><br />I used a Sony NEX-5T, an older and lower end model that came with a touch screen.  It worked well and especially considering the other controls were limited.  When I moved up to the A6300 I was surprised that it didn’t at least have the touchscreen that the 5T had.  Now the A6500 has that touchscreen, literally, the same screen.  Actually to be honest, it is less useful than the touchscreen on the 5T because you could use that touchscreen for menus.  This touchscreen seems below Sony and below our current standards and feels tacked on for a bullet point for presentation.<br /><br />I do have to say regardless of the touchscreens shortcomings, it is a nice feature as a touchpad when looking through the viewfinder.  While it is noticeably lagged behind your fingers movement, it is still faster than using a directional pad for me and in general it works.  If this your main consideration for buying this or upgrading to this camera, I would look for other reasons.<br /><br />Fortunately the 5 axis in-body stabilization is fantastic.  While this might not be a necessary addition for a lot of people, I have a few lenses that don’t have stabilization which means I end up losing light to shutter speed and turning up the ISO.  The stabilization in this camera works very well and allows me to keep my shutter speed and ISO far lower than I could with my A6300 for lower light shots.  Again, if you’re using some of the native emount lenses, you may have stabilized lenses and have less of a need for 5 axis in-body stabilization but I have to say that this is far better and works in conjunction with stabilized lenses making it easier to get sharper and clearer images.  If the in-body stabilization is one of your main considerations for upgrading to the A6500, know that it is one of the few things that absolutely makes the upgrade worth it.<br /><br />Another thing that tended to annoy me with the A6300 was the buffer.  It filled up fast and took what seemed like forever to clear which meant you could miss the shot you wanted if you weren’t careful.  This wasn’t a constant problem because I don’t do a lot of continuous or burst shooting but when I did, it was always disappointing that I couldn’t take more shots or I had to wait a while to view them.  The A6500 completely turns this around.  The buffer is much larger allowing you to take far more shots before it fills and allows you to view them much faster.  With the A6300 you became very aware of the buffer limitations and shot around them whereas with the A6500, you almost forget you have limits.<br /><br />One of the unexpected nice additions is the new grip.  When I first saw that it had a new grip, I didn’t really think much of it because it wasn’t all that much bigger.  Also, the grip on the A6300 was manageable so a new grip wasn’t something I was thinking of.  Although the grip is just a bit larger, in the hand it feels so much better.  The added size is just enough to keep my fingers and hand in a tight claw formation.  My fingers don’t press up against the camera or the lens the way that they used to with the A6300.  Overall it makes the camera easier to handle and especially for longer periods of time.  You just feel like you’re holding onto something more significant which leads to less fatigue over time.  It is like driving for hours without a steering wheel cover and squeezing the smaller steering wheel.  It was probably the greatest addition that I didn’t know I needed.<br /><br />Another nice new feature is an extra programmable function key.  While I did actually like the placement of the function key by the shutter for the A6300, I do appreciate having more programmable buttons.  It just limits the number of button presses rather than having to search through menus.  If they had left the function button by the shutter and then added the two more, I would have really liked that but I can deal with the new placement for the added button.<br /><br />The deep Sony menu system that most people seem to hate has been updated,…slightly.  Although the menu system on the A6300 wasn’t great, I didn’t really have much to compare it to and found it functional for the most part.  Sometimes it took too long to find a function or feature but eventually I’d find it.  This updated menu is slightly better.  It is slightly more intuitive, it has color making it slightly easier to identify which area you’re in, and it is slightly better organized.  I’m glad they tried to improve their seemingly outdated menu system but they probably could have done more as well as included touch screen controls for navigating it.  This kind of thing is something they could potentially fix with firmware updates but I don’t see that happening.<br /><br />There are a few minor things I thought they could have worked on to add more value to the camera.  First although not totally necessary for me is a second card slot.  It wouldn’t necessarily have added much bulk considering the larger grip anyways and it would have been a nice added feature for their flagship APSC.<br /><br />Second, the battery is the same.  I’m actually partly ok with that because of what I’ve spent buying these NP-FW50 batteries.  I have a bunch of them so I can always take a couple extra with me which is all I’ll ever need but the battery life on the A6300 was mediocre and the A6500 is supposed to be up to 10% worse.  I haven’t tested the battery enough to tell for myself but if it is 10% worse than mediocre, that puts it at less than ideal.  Still, having many batteries alleviates most energy concerns and I was never too disappointed with the battery life of the A6300.<br /><br />Another thing although not necessarily a gripe is that the back of the camera including the buttons feel a little light or cheaper than the A6300 which I thought felt more thick and less plasticky and hollow. It isn't a problem but just one of the things I felt the first time I picked up the camera.<br /><br />Last thing I would have liked to see change would be the articulating screen.  I’m glad that it does articulate at all because it definitely comes in very handy when shooting something lower or higher but I was hoping that they would have added 180 degree articulation of some sort.  This is a very minor gripe for me because it would be very limited in use but some of the lower end Sony mirrorless cameras offer this and it came in handy on the 5T.<br /><br />There are a lot of features to go over that I won’t cover here.  I don’t do a lot of video recording so I won’t try to speak to that.  I personally have never had my A6300 overheat on me for pictures or video so I can’t really speak to that although in my very limited time with the A6500, I can say it also has not overheated.  There are a good amount of technical reviews that will go over all aspects of this camera so I will leave that to smarter people.<br /><br />Is it worth it?  Yeah, for me it is but I can’t say if it will be worth it for everyone.  If you shoot with an A6000 then it may be worth it as an upgrade to the focus, buffer, 5 axis, and touchscreen.  If you shoot with an A6300 then you’re really just looking at the 5 axis stabilization and buffer.  For now the touchscreen just isn’t enough reason to upgrade but the stabilization and buffer can be.  If you shoot in single shot and use native emount lenses with optical image stabilization built in then you don’t need this camera.  It is no doubt a great camera.  It has blazing fast auto focus, a great buffer, does fantastic video, produces amazing images, and all in a pretty compact form factor.  However, it is also expensive with a still somewhat limited lens options, mediocre battery life, a touchscreen from 2007, rolling shutter issues(that I don’t worry about), and a wonky menu system.  If you want a good camera and don’t mind shelling out the money to get it, then get it.  You’ll be happy because it is a great camera but you don’t need this camera to take good shots.<br /><br />I can recommend this camera because I know this is an amazing camera for me and for others but if you’re on the fence and the money is an issue, it wouldn’t hurt to test one out first or wait 9 months for the A6700. Lol<br /><br />I will update this review as I have more time with the camera and will try to answer any questions I can.<br /><br />[UPDATES]<br />After a little more use I'm finding that the touchscreen is a nice feature.  It is still implemented rather poorly, not used nearly enough, and while using it as a touch pad while looking through the viewfinder is laggy, the feature is still useful and growing on me a bit.<br /><br />Also, I'm really missing the placement of the custom key by the shutter on the A6300.  While they've added another custom key, the placement of the two isn't as convenient for my fingers to get to easily.  Not a big deal and I like having the extra button but would have liked  to have kept the original where it was.<br /><br />[MONTH IN]<br />The 5-Axis IBIS is fantastic and pairs amazingly with the Zeiss 24 1.8 and the Zeiss 50 1.4 since none of them offer stabilization.  I am getting better low light shots and able to lower my shutter speed far lower than I would have expected.<br /><br />The touch screen is still useful but flawed and in the end I'm still happy with it despite some frustration.<br /><br />Another thing I don't beleive I noted in the review regards the eye piece for the EVF.  It is a little different than on the A6300 and seems to keep my eye lashes and oils off of the EVF much better.<br /><br />The grip still amazes me considering how much better it feels from adding so little.<br /><br />For everything I am enjoying about this excellent camera, I am moving more towards 5 stars despite the price and the new features from the A6300 being somewhat limited.","This new camera from Sony has many new features that we have been waiting for that were more common in Full Frame models.  On the top of this list is IBIS (In body image stabilization). This is great for video and stills (in low light/slow shutter speed). An increased buffer, along with the ability to view images or continuing shooting while the camera continues to write to the card, is a very welcome change and prevents downtime. The new touchscreen is useable and a great feature for video, but is lacking in speed versus the lighting fast autofocus. Some reworking will make this feature indispensable sports and wildlife shooters. A very cool feature of the touchscreen is the ability to double tap to zoom (even when looking through the viewfinder during photo review, which is awesome on sunny days when you can't see the screen). You can also slide side to side with you our fingers after double tapping to zoom; just like a smartphone! This intuitive capability that mimics today's modern day smartphone is where cameras need to be in terms of usability; it's what most electronics consumers expect in 2016.  This makes reviewing images and checking for sharp focus much faster in the field, and less downtime for your clients and yourself!<br /><br />  There are some other cool features that don't impact picture or video quality, but are a welcome change versus the A6000 (which I also own) and even A6300 (which I don't own).  Those include:<br /><br />  A deeper grip! (I have big hands and really enjoy this modification).<br />  The eyepiece is much studier and clips on by sliding it down and into place (secured).<br />  A bigger shutter button, has a nice feel to it.<br />  An additional custom button on top.<br />  And finally....a much, much better lens mount!!! This highly overlooked reworking is great and has a matte finish just like the camera body.  This stronger and more secure mount really comes in handy with the heavier and longer 2.8 zooms and fast primes.<br /><br />  I haven't had any issues with overheating while shooting in 4k, but to be fair, temperatures here in California aren't over 65 degrees, so it's hard to tell. I may turn the heater up to 85 for a bit to test it indoors, simulating summer temperatures. I will update and let you guys know.<br /><br />  The only thing that I wish this camera had was a dual card slot and a headphone jack to monitor sound while recording video. Neither of these features are deal breakers, but would be greatly appreciated by professionals looking to have an alternate to their full frame cameras or as a B camera for video.<br /><br />  Bottom line: if you are coming from an A6000, you will be pleasantly surprised with the many new features... if you already own the A6300, then this camera may not be worth buying and selling the A6300.  I honestly believe that the bigger buffer, in-body image stabilization and touch focus (mainly for video) and the deeper grip make this camera much better and totally worth the money. If you have the money, I'd pull the trigger....I certainly don't regret it!","Received my  pre-order this week as an upgrade to the a6300, which has been my daily driver.<br /><br />This camera is fantastic as an all-around 'jack of all trades'.  It is not the absolute best in any single category - but near the top in almost all.  Focusing speed, high ISO performance, 4k video quality, overall image quality, etc.<br /><br />I still have a lot of legacy glass from Minolta and from my a77 (such as the good 16-50 2.8 from that kit).  Having the in-body image stabilizer is the feature I was missing in the a6300, and worth the price of admission.  Being able to hand-hold a fast 50 or an older portrait lens changes what I can do quite a bit.  Freezing motion in natural light with manageable ISO, even with the old glass - just what I was looking for.  All with the same image quality I've come to expect from the 6x00 series.<br /><br />I no longer regret selling my a77ii after this upgrade - this was the 'all in one' I was looking for.<br /><br />I am a two-system shooter, also using a Canon 70d quite a bit for video.  There is nothing wrong with the Canon.  I love it.  However, most days, when just 'grabbing a camera to capture a moment' - I find myself grabbing the Sony.<br /><br />The menu system is still pretty bad.  The ergonomics are not great (compared to any of the larger bodies like my 70d or a77ii), but the deeper grip on this upgrade is a little helpful.  As a left-eye dominant shooter, I still smudge the back screen when using the finder.  Battery life is abysmal compared to an OVF - better have 2-3 for a multi-hour shoot.  The touch-screen is useful for focus points only - you'll find yourself poking at the screen thinking 'it should recognize touch for this menu', when it doesn't.  At the end of the day - these are nit-picks vs. gripes, the camera does so many things so well, I can look past the shortcomings.<br /><br />I shoot a lot of dance, from tele distance in dark theaters with no flash allowed.  This is the first mirrorless body I've had that can keep up in that environment.  In fact, it more than holds its own against the Canon.<br /><br />Overall - very pleased.  For my needs, the IBIS alone was worth the upgrade.  The updated buffer speed, slightly better ergonomics, and addition of the touch screen were all nice-to-haves that make an already great camera an outstanding one.","You can view my review on my blog for higher quality photos:<br /><br />journal.hellomikee.com/sony-a6500-review<br /><br />While the a6500 is very much similar in all aspects of the a6300, there are some subtle as well as not so subtle differences that make this camera worth a higher price point. Does it replace the a6300? For some photographers like myself, yes it does because I have specific needs for a camera like this, while for others, the a6300 is more than enough camera for them.<br /><br />For me, this is an almost perfect APS-C camera that I could rely on not only for work assignments, but also as an ultimate travel camera for picture perfect landscapes, portraits and stabilized video clips.<br /><br />Build and Camera Controls:<br /><br />The build quality on the a6500 has some subtle differences, the first being a slightly larger grip. With the addition of IBIS, it makes sense that the camera needed a little more surface area, which also resulted in a slightly heavier camera overall. The added size of the grip actually feels awesome and I prefer it over the previous series. While still small and compact, the a6500 feels more durable.<br /><br />The dials also feel more robust and secure. The on and off switch is much more stiff, which I like as the a6300 and a6000 would sometimes accidentally switch on when being placed in a bag. The top dials also have a little more firmness to them. My favorite update is to the back dial. I was constantly accidentally changing settings on my previous cameras because the dial was so flimsy. On the a6500, it’s much more firm and you actually have to apply a bit of pressure to start turning, which is nice.<br /><br />I also noticed that the mount feels much more secure and tight. The click between the mount and lens feels so much more solid now. It’s subtle updates that really lend itself to this camera feeling more premium and well-crafted.<br /><br />Image Quality:<br /><br />At the time of writing this, Adobe has yet to release a camera raw update so I’m unable to work on raw files, but I’m still amazed at how much detail I can pull out of a jpeg from this camera.<br /><br />Sony sensors are the best and this is no exception. It has the same sensor as the a6300 so files from either are probably indistinguishable.<br /><br />My favorite aspect about the quality of images this camera produces deals with the amount of dynamic range available in post process. You can push and pull so much out of the shadows and highlights of these raw files without loosing any quality or producing and sort of banding or weird artifacts.<br /><br />This and the a6300 are the first APC-S cameras that I feel can stand up to FF cameras. In fact, when editing alongside a7R II files, it’s hard to tell which file I’m working on. The only time I can really see a difference is when I’m shooting a prime wide open and really getting that FF shallow depth of field or when I’m pushing the ISOs really hard. Even then, I sometimes guess wrong.<br /><br />Video Quality:<br /><br />I can’t speak too much about video quality because all I really know how to do is hit the red record button, so this is coming from a super novice, but the video quality I’m getting during my travels look awesome. What I love most about taking video is the continuous focus works really good.<br /><br />It’s probably the best I’ve used on a ICL camera.<br /><br />I also like that you can shoot in .mp4 format now with this which I couldn’t with the a6000 (.mp4 was only for 720p). This makes it easier for me to grab videos off the SD card and edit via iMovie (see, total video amateur).<br /><br />As far as rolling shutter goes, it seems to exhibit the same characteristics as the a6300 so I don’t see any improvements there.<br /><br />User Interface:<br /><br />Another change, which I’m assuming will be passed down to previous models via firmware update, deals with the User Interface and the reordering and redesigning of the tabs in the camera menus. Like I’ve said before, I never really had issues with Sony menus. With all the customization they offer within their custom buttons and the function menu, I rarely have to dive into the menu structure itself.<br /><br />I’m much more concerned with the speed of these menus and the overall speed of navigating around the camera and that’s where the a6500 excels. It’s quick and does what it needs to do.<br /><br />IBIS:<br /><br />The main reason I upgraded to this camera is for IBIS. Personally, I feel it’s an absolute must for a travel camera. Aside from the photo benefits of having a stabilized camera, which means every lens you have will be stabilized allowing you to shoot at slower shutter speeds, all my video clips will also have some form of stabilization. This is so important for my travel videos. And the fact I have it in such a small compact body is quite amazing. Most lenses will have 5-axis image stabilization while manual lenses will only benefit from 3-axis. If your lens currently has IS, it will use a combination of both resulting in 5-axis.<br /><br />Touch Focus:<br /><br />IBIS was already enough for me to upgrade but then I didn’t realize how cool touch to focus is. This is a feature that really took me by surprise. I love that I could just tap anywhere on the screen to change my focal point. There’s also a little “x” icon on the screen that if you press it, it brings the focus back to center. This is super helpful as I found it annoying trying to get the focus point perfectly back to center on my own.<br /><br />Another annoyance, which many have already mentioned, is that there is a lag when you are dragging your finger across the screen. For me, I don’t see a need to do that while looking at the LCD screen. It’s all about tap and go. But it is annoying considering this is a premium product. How much more would it have cost to get a really good touch screen on this camera? With all the technology we have with smart screens, there’s just no excuse to put outdated tech into this camera.<br /><br />With that said, where I do see dragging useful (and the only option) is when looking through the EVF, you’re able to use your thumb to drag around the focus point (when looking through the EVF, tap to focus won’t work). I love this feature. While there is still a slight lag, it’s not nearly as annoying as seeing the focus point follow your finger. Instead, it feels more like a track pad for your thumb. You can also set this to work on the full screen or half the screen (it’s set to the right half by default).<br /><br />I’ve only been playing with this for a few hours so I’ll need to test it out in the field to really get a grasp of touch focus and if it’s better than a dedicated joystick or not, but so far, it’s already a much welcomed option/addition.<br /><br />But that’s as far as it goes with the touch screen. Tap and drag to focus is all we get. No zooming or swiping. Another cop out in my opinion.<br /><br />I’ve applied a screen protector and it does not seem to affect touch focus.<br /><br />New Metering Modes:<br /><br />There are two new metering modes available on the a6500. The first is Highlight, where exposure metering is focused on the brightest area of the frame. The second is Entire Screen Average. This maintains an average metering for the entire image.<br /><br />I’ll need to do more testing on these. I’m wondering if Highlight would work well when shooting a white wedding dress. As far as Entire Screen Average, I’m wondering really what the main difference is with that mode vs Evaluative Metering.<br /><br />Wish List:<br /><br />There has not been any updates to the LCD screen resolution. I think the EVF is one of the best out there but I was hoping that the LCD screen would get a higher resolution. It’s not bad but it’s not great. It doesn’t bother me so much because I use the EVF about 90% of the time, even when checking focus and playback. It’s so good, bright and clear that I’d much rather check my photos on there, but a higher resolution and sharper LCD screen would be beneficial for those times I’m tilting the screen to get lower and higher vantage point shots or sharing photo playback with others.<br /><br />Speaking of LCD screens, it would also be useful if the screen popped out towards the left side for filming. I know a lot of vloggers would appreciate that and because I’m getting more into video, it’s something I’d like in the future.<br /><br />We’re still missing a front control dial that would sit nicely under the shutter button, similar to the a7 cameras. This is a great dial for controlling your aperture.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I’ve only had this camera for a few days so my review may be pre-mature. But at the same time, a lot of this camera shares very similar, if not exact, attributes as the a6300 so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of it. I loved the previous models so I know I’ll love this camera, especially since a lot of what I felt was lacking in the a6300 has been addressed in the a6500.<br /><br />It’s shaping out to be one of the best compact cameras I’ve ever owned and while it has ticked all the major specs I need in order to be the ultimate travel camera, its also the ultimate companion to the a7R II.","Due to the limited reviews of this camera and the fact that I own a a6300 and was able to borrow a a6500 for a day to compare I figured Id throw my 2 cents in.<br /><br />This is going to mainly cover the questions comparing it to the a6300 and if it is worth the extra cost or even the upgrade from.<br /><br />First off what it does well; The new 5 axis IBIS (In body image stabilization) is definitely noticeable and absolutely helpful to handheld videographers that shoot without OSS lenses. That said, shooting video without a rig or stabilization is still a bad idea. Is it worth it over using just the OSS that lenses use with the a6300? Well the answer to that really depends on the lens you shoot with. If you shoot with Rokinin Samyang lenses that do not have image stabilization then you will likely enjoy the IBIS that the a6500 body offers, but if you shoot with mostly sony native E mount lenses that for the most part all have OSS, then you aren't going to see much of a difference.<br /><br />The new touchscreen is a welcome addition to those who shoot handheld or sports and need quick on the fly focus point adjustments, to those of use that strap the camera inside a rig and or cage though its not noticeable as the on body screen is rarely used let alone in a way that is easily accessible. So like the IBIS this is highly subjective depending on what your intended uses are, but keep in mind the $400 is a big price jump just for touchscreen capabilities when the fact is the a6300 already has some of the best constant and instant focusing I have seen in a handheld.<br /><br />Now thats the end of what it does right as pretty much every other spec is identical to the a6300, now on to what it does wrong or what it fails to improve upon.<br /><br />The biggest for video users is the rolling shutter, and I am sorry to say that it has not changed in the slightest. I notice the same exact degree of distortion between the a6300 and a6500. Though this can be \"fixed\" in post, its still disappointing.<br /><br />Battery life, still exactly the same, though I didn't really expect a change since they are still sticking with the same exact battery NP-FW50 which in my opinion is lacking in power hungry dslrs, sony really needs a new battery model.<br /><br />Overheating, Its the same cramped form factor with the same overburdened image processor so the overheating issue remains the exact same, and it is unlikely to be fixed via software. I really would have liked to see Sony put some more effort into heat dispersion but it seems the issue is going largely ignored.<br /><br />So for me I will be sticking with the a6300 and not upgrading, and If I had to buy a completely new camera today its would still be the a6300 as I dont see any features that impact me enough to warrant a $400 price difference, but its something that everybody will have to decide for themselves.<br /><br />Also something to keep in mind, even though Sony says this model is meant to run side by side and not replace the a6300, I still wouldn't be surprised to see the price drop just a tad on the a6300 which may make it an even better choice.","In comparing to the a6300, here are the important points:<br /><br />In-body stabilization - this will add extra stabilization if you already have stabilized lenses, and it will provide stabilization for lenses that don't have it already.  This is important for those of us who do photography or video with vintage lenses or high quality lenses without stabilization, like the Sigma Art series.<br /><br />Big buffer - The a6300's buffer isn't small, but the camera waits to write to the card after a burst of shots.  So for sports photographers, the new, larger buffer and the no-wait features are nice.  You can review or continue to shoot while the camera writes to the card.<br /><br />Overheating - It isn't so much that Sony \"fixed\" the heat problem... instead they provide a means of \"living with\" the heat the camera generates.  As such, there are fewer scenarios in which this camera will shut down due to overheating vs the a6300.<br /><br />The touchscreen is underwhelming in photo modes, it engages too slowly to be useful.  In video mode it works, but not quite like you'd want.  You can, technically, get it to focus on a subject and then track the subject, but making that happen is a chore.  Most will find it difficult enough to use the default way. Sony needs to spend a bit more time on this.<br /><br />All that said, the camera is almost identical to the a6300 in terms of quality and normal operation.  There is an extra custom button, which is nice.  The grip is a little deeper, which is nice.  The rolling shutter is still absolutely awful in video or silent shooting modes.<br /><br />With the exception that it is not full-frame, it is the first mirrorless camera that has the features needed to satisfy DSLR snobs (I know, I switched from Canon).<br /><br />PS - If this review helped, or if you're just bored and enjoy clicking things - could I trouble you for a \"Yes\" vote below?","Sony appears to have another home run with the A6500.<br /><br />I'll admit it, I've become a Sony camera fanboy.  It all started with the ground-breaking NEX-6.  Each generation of these mirrorless cameras just keeps getting better.  I skipped the A6300, as it didn't really seem like enough of an improvement from my trusty A6000, but this release has compelled me to pull the trigger.  Here are my impressions:<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br /> + They've managed to stuff in-body 5-axis image stabilization into the a6x00 body without adding much more bulk.  Awesome.  Now any lens is stabilized, even those old Canon FD film lenses.  Prior to this release, you had to spring for a full-frame Sony to get this benefit.<br /><br /> + The grip is slightly larger, and feels better in the hand than the A6000.  They've managed to make it feel substantial without adding excessive bulk.<br /><br /> + Touchscreen.  Finally.  Being able to quickly set focus point via touch is a welcome improvement.<br /><br /> + The level is back!  It was puzzling that it was missing from the A6000.<br /><br /> + Mode dial now two has presets.<br /><br /> + Burst shooting on hi+ is outstanding.  On the A6000, it would start to stutter and choke after 3-4 seconds of continuous shooting while it tried to write to the memory card.  To make matters worse, you had to wait to shoot again while the buffer flushed.  Now, they've added buffer memory and some hardware updates that allow what feels like endless high speed shooting with no lag or delays.<br /><br /> + Autofocus is fast and accurate<br /><br /> + The eyecup mount has been revised and is much more secure.  After losing two on the A6000, this is a welcome improvement.<br /><br /> + The lens mount has been reinforced and is now metal.<br /><br />Con:<br /><br /> - One of the Intelligent auto modes on the dial is gone - Intelligent auto +.  No big loss for me, as I never used them, and am not sure why they were present at all on a prosumer camera.<br /><br />That's the only (minor) downside.  Build quality is solid, and it has a nice matte case finish.  Image quality is, as expected, outstanding though not notably better than the A6000 from what I've seen so far (noting that I can't yet open RAW files), but with all of the other improvements, it makes a worthy successor and a great buy."]},{"name":"Sony Alpha a99 II","amazon_reviews":["Having had the A99 since it was released and after a month with the A99ii, I can say the upgrade is well worth the price.

I started with an a200, then a77, and upgraded to the a99 three years ago, but was ready for my next camera.  I photograph 15 weddings and 60-80 families each year, and really wanted to stick with the DSLT Alpha line, even though (as others have commented) Sony seems to be focusing on their mirrorless lineup.  I have an a6000 as my travel camera, and rented the a7s2, and was nervous for the smaller feel of the mirrorless cameras.  Spring 2016 I told myself that if Sony hadn’t announced the a99 successor by the end of 2016, I’d start the move to mirrorless.<br />After months of rumors online, Sony announced the a99ii and the specs were amazing.  I finally got my new camera in my hands yesterday and it has lived up to my high expectations.  I took a photo last night of our Christmas tree, handheld at 1/25 second without motion blur, thanks to the 5 axis IBIS. (photo shared straight out of camera)<br />The body is a tad smaller than my a99 mark 1, closer to the a77 (crop sensor) body.  It uses the same aftermarket grip as the a77, and it worked with my Neewer® Professional Replacement Camera Battery Grip Pack for VG-C77AM Works with NP-FM500H Batteries for Sony Alpha SLT A77 A77V and A77 II.  It also appears to work with cheap knockoff batteries (my a99 mark 1 would give me error messages when I tried to use them) but I wouldn’t expect them to perform the same as Sony batteries. The autofocus has been spot on so far, and I’m eager to spend more time shooting with the 399 focal points.  When shooting in a burst, you can now review the images quicker as it continues to write to the memory card.  A99 mark 1 required you to wait until the last image was saved before displaying any.<br />The built in wifi removes the need for an Eyefi card to send images directly to your phone.  This is my favorite feature at weddings and events; I can quickly post and tag couples or organizations on social media during the event, instead of waiting until I get home.  Sony’s app lets me use my phone as a remote or transfer images (even when shooting in raw).<br />All in all, this is an amazing pro-level camera.","This review might best start with some brief history.  Unless you’re inside the Sony A Mount community, it’s hard to appreciate the struggles the community has had with the questions swirling about the future of the Alpha Mount.  Alpha Mount (or ‘A-mount’ for short) is the mount system, lens and camera technology that Sony bought from Konica Minolta just 10 short years ago.  Members of the A Mount community have been barraged by increasing rumination on the ‘blogosphere’ about the death of Alpha Mount for most of the past two years, and by intermittent trolling to the effect that Sony was going to walk away from A Mount, for much of this entire 10 year period.  Sony has frankly done little to squelch this rumor-fest, other than to occasionally state (on record) that they were committed to the future of the Alpha Mount, while at the same time, largely failing to advertise a single A mount camera, including even the well-regarded APS-C flagship model released just over two years ago, the Sony A77ii.  Indeed, Sony’s digital camera advertising for interchangeable lens cameras over the last 3 years has been virtually all E-mount, and almost never A-mount, which was simultaneously slowly disappearing out of most retail space.  To add to the drama, Sony rebranded both NEX APS-C mirrorless as well as all full frame E-Mount cameras (the successful A7x series) as “Alpha.”  This meant that the “Alpha” designation transitioned from referring simply to Sony-Minolta’s A Mount to including both A mount and E mount (two very different mount systems).  Confused yet?  If so, join the club!  All of this rebranding of E Mount as ‘Alpha’ only served to amplify the cycling of rumors and rumination that A-Mount was indeed dead.<br /><br />In this context, without any advance notice (as is their normal and secretive corporate practice), Sony announced the most advanced camera they’ve ever created in the Sony A99ii, to a stunned Photokina crowd this past September.  The release generated not just a collective sigh of relief but also a large “WOW” from the A-Mount community (and a few ‘wows’ from other parts of the digital photography universe as well).  There may never have been a Sony product release that was more eagerly anticipated (or more anxiously feared as not coming) as the Sony A99II.<br /><br />Just how advanced is the camera?  And how does it differ from a traditional DSLR with its flipping mirror and optical viewfinder?  It combines a diverse array of technologies not seen in any other DSLRs: 1) SLT technology (a fixed semi-transparent mirror replacing the traditional flipping mirror, allowing full time PDAF in both stills and video and a highly responsive full-time live view, easily besting any other mirrored camera), 2) a new improved 5 axis in-body image stabilization system, with ~ 4.5 stops of stabilization (on paper anyway), 3) a backside illuminated (BSI) full frame sensor combining high resolution with good low light ability (debuting in the very successful A7RII and the top-rated sensor in DxO in that body) and not available outside of the A99ii/A7Rii (not sold to Nikon as previous gen chips were), 4) a new LSI (large scale integration) chip allowing extremely high data processing speeds; 5) an unprecedented integration of on-sensor phase detection (OSPDAF) with a more traditional dedicated separate PDAF array – supported by the SLT mirror – to create a ‘hybrid autofocus system’ (more on that later).<br /><br />Hold on there chief – what about the downsides of the SLT?  Good question . . . Purists have always regarded the SLT/EVF concept with suspicion, and until recently, OVF has clearly been superior in relationship to action and sports photography, due to the EVF blackout and delayed ‘slideshow ‘effect in many EVFs, because of EVF lag.  However, the EVF in the A99II is highly responsive, and with minimal display lag, and if you shoot at eight frames per seconnd, it gives you a comparable experience to what you would see on a traditional DSLR with OVF.  It can also go to 12 frames per second, with full aperture and autofocus control (but now with a modest lag in EVF view).  And to boot, with the new LSI chip and high speed data processing, you can immediately view any image right after shooting.  In low light conditions, EVF is clearly superior, given the gain supplied by the display system (which allows you to see clearly in quite low light).  You also get to see what your final image might look like as you manipulate any number of exposure and image parameters, and additionally, the EVF can readily embed other shooting and composition tools such as ‘zebra’ (visualizing areas of potential overexposure) and ‘focus peaking’ (highlighting areas of decent focus) that are simply not available on optical viewfinders.  Although a preference for OVF or EVF may seem largely determined by what you’re used to, once many people have seen the benefits of a properly executed and rapidly refreshing EVF, with enough brightness to deal with sunny conditions, they cannot go back to a traditional optical viewfinder.  There is the - widely trumpeted - downside of about one half stop light loss, which again disturbing to the OVF purists, but this increase in noise and decrease in DR cannot be seen, in even large prints, from typical viewing distances (but see CONS for further discussion). But it’s all tradeoffs . . . like all technology design considerations.  You can’t optimize everything, as all design parameters are tradeoffs of one virtue against another.  While I believe that the SLT advantages outweigh the downside of losing slightly less than ½ stop of light, this approach may not please everyone.  As always, “your mileage may vary”.  Mirrorless OSPDAF still hasn’t quite caught up with dedicated PDAF arrays . . but it’s getting closer.  But it may be an asymptote, rather than an eventual intersection, given the physical advantages of dedicated off-sensor arrays,  with their much bigger pixel elements.<br /><br />So much for the history behind this release . . . and its variation from traditional DSLRs. How does it actually feel in your hands?  It’s a solid pro-build type body with good ‘heft’, a deep and comfortable grip, but still smaller and more compact than any comparable FF camera body – just about the same size as the A77ii.  The transition from other SLTs to this feels seamless and easily bridged.  In fact, it feels like you are just working with an A77ii but with much more low light ability plus 4k.  It’s also highly capable, excelling in three technologically ‘disparate’ applications: 1) 4K video; 2) portraiture and landscapes (where medium format and other higher resolution FF cameras such as the Nikon 810 and Canon 5DS/DSR excel), 3) sports and action shooting (where lower resolution FF models costing $6k+ such as the Nikon D5 and Canon 1DX Mark II excel).  In other words, this camera is able to compete with best-in-class, more specialized full frame models across these three types of shooting.  And unlike other competing full frame models from CanNikon that do offer 4K video ability, there is no limiting heavy crop (1.4 to 1.8x) that virtually eliminates wide-angle views, and, the 4k is derived from oversampling in Super 35 mode, so it’s a bit sharper than the competition 4k (if you can live with a 1.5 crop – if not, you can shoot from the full sensor view). Thus, the camera is both exceptionally versatile, and relatively compact in size and weight compared to the competition.<br /><br />From the standpoint of its specifications, despite its relatively svelte dimensions, it’s a heavy hitter:<br /><br />• Up to 12fps at 42.4MP continuous shooting with AE/AF tracking, 8fps without ‘slide show’ effect or EVF blackout.<br />• Hybrid PDAF combining 79 cross-point from dedicated off sensor array fed by SLT plus 399 on-sensor phase detection for enhanced AF accuracy, speed and tracking.<br />• 42.4MP full-frame sensor w/no low-pass filter for medium format level detail and resolution.<br />• Up to ISO 102,400 for low noise stills and video.<br />• 4K AND 1080p movie recording via full pixel readout, in full-frame or super 35 (cropped) from 6k oversampling.<br />• High bitrate codec in XAVC S, with S-log2/3, and 4:2:2 HDMI out.<br />• 5-axis in-body image stabilization, optimized for full-frame sensor.<br />• Both slow and quick frame rate video for time lapse or slow motion effects without extra software or hardware<br />• Wi-Fi/NFC code for easy file transfer and remote control.<br />• Dust/moisture resistant magnesium alloy body w/ 300k+ cycle shutter.<br />• Ultra-fast OLED w/EVF benefits and virtually OVF immediacy.<br /><br />So, how does this thing really work and shoot?  Overall, exceptionally well.  I’ve had six weeks with it now, and it’s just a gem to operate and shoot with.  But again, I’m used to the basic template of the SLT operating system, while those coming from a CanNikon background may find the transition a bit steeper in terms of the learning curve.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1) FF sensor that is Sony’s (and industry’s) best.  Combines high resolution and high speed FPS, 4k, and variable frame rate video (allowing either time lapse or slow motion effects). Very good high ISO and excellent detail. Amazing functional ability and versatility in a single package. Not available in any other FF camera and Sony isn’t selling this sensor to anyone else, unlike previous 36MP FF sensor.<br />2) Excellent 5 axis IBIS worth (on paper – but see discussion) 4+ stops that is functionally invisible (i.e., does not adversely impact IQ), and available on all A Mount lenses.  Advertised to be ~2 stops better than previous IBIS system (in A77ii).  Decent IS in video as well, in both 1080p and 4k (but see discussion).<br />3) Ability to use the full range of A-mount glass, with full IS benefits (but see Con #1 and discussion).  This gives many options: modern (and expensive) Zeiss and Sony G glass but also high-value legacy Minolta glass options, depending on budget and priorities.<br />4) 4k is nicely detailed, and competes with best in class (A7RII/A7SII/A6500/GH5), with excellent low light ability.  Exceptionally versatile video specs and codecs (but see major Con #2).<br />5) Compact form factor body, very slightly smaller than A77ii (but feeling like the same camera) and with excellent ergonomics and customizable controls – making this the most compact FF body out there, outside of the A7x series (but without the ergonomic limitations of the A7x group).<br />6) Hybrid AF system combining 399 on-sensor PD elements, combined with 79 focus points from dedicated PDAF array, fed by SLT mirror (but again see Con #1 and discussion).<br />7) Much better organized operating system and menu structure, with major degree of potential customization of control architecture to suit end-user preference and style.  Additionally, the ‘Fx’ button gives instant access to 12 selectable camera functions of the user’s choice to streamline menu access. Proper configuring of Fx choices obviates most menu diving.<br />8) Ability for Wi-Fi and NFC to send images to your smartphone.<br />9) Dramatically improved Wi-Fi remote control app over the A77II – which was appallingly bad.  This version of smart phone remote control appears as capable the apps for RX10/100 models, and for E-mount.<br />10) Multiple point MFA, wide and telephoto ends for zooms, plus separate settings for the four corners and center for lenses that do hybrid AF (but seen con #7)<br />11) A reasonably deep buffer, with ability to review images immediately, enhancing usability in sports and action photography – 9 seconds roughly of 8 FPS with my card if shooting full sized JPEGs or RAW. Enormous flexibility too – if shooting RAW or JPEG, at 8 FPS, and utilizing crop sensor mode (18MP files), the buffer is almost unlimited (~153 RAW images using my card Samsung Pro SDXC I card - but see Con #8).<br />12) Best JPEG engine in the DP world, shared with the Sony A7Rii.  If you have any questions about this, see the DPR comparometer, and pull up these two cameras, and the Canon 5D IV and Nikon 810.<br />13) Real functionality for your crop sensor DT lens library – (so don’t reflexively dump your lens library in other words if your coming up from APS-C).  If you want smaller files (18MP) or a lighter lens/camera combo, you get increased buffer depth, extra reach on your telephoto lenses, and still plenty of image information. Works brilliantly with the DT 16-50 2.8 as a default Super 35 video or walk-around lens.  A major plus of having a high res 42MP sensor.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1) Only Sony lenses (and not quite all of them) allow access to hybrid AF system, although the dedicated PDAF system (upgraded version of system in A77ii) is still quite competent and flexible all by itself.<br />2) Sony continues to limit AF in movie modes to Program mode only, with fixed aperture (3.5, or widest if lens doesn’t reach 3.5). Reasons for this are unclear, but perhaps to reduce competition with the more video-friendly E Mount?<br />3) Modest ½ stop light loss from SLT mirror.  Much is made of this, but tests have shown that even at higher ISOs, individuals can’t reliably discriminate ½ stop of extra noise, without pixel peeping A/B displays, and never at typical viewing distances.  Tradeoff to achieve better AF performance, as OSPDAF hasn’t caught up to the best dedicated PDAF.  But it this is still troubling, SLT mirror can be removed for landscape and any other MF shot, if that last bit of ISO is deemed important (a dicey practice and not for the technically inept as semi-transparent mirror is fragile and almost impossible to clean without damaging it).<br />4) Speaking of ISO, according to initial DxO testing, ISO scale is almost one full stop optimistic (indicated 200 is ~ 110) – and a slightly less than one stop ‘boost’ to indicated ISO continues on up the ISO scale.  Not clear if this is simply unusual sample variation (DxO tested a funky sample) or Sony’s thinly veiled attempt to exaggerate the apparent low light performance of the camera. Some ‘fudging’ on ISO is commonplace - almost universal - but typically it’s ~1/4 to 1/3 a stop, not ~ 1 stop.<br />5) Menu system is still complex (but not excessively so for pro/FF class of camera).<br />6) Joystick control is sometimes ‘fiddly’, making selection and scrolling processes somewhat unsure.  Could Sony just spring for the premium switchgear in its flagship model, instead of something that feels like it cost $.43 cents from a discount parts bin?<br />7) MFA can be complex, most esp. for H-AF lenses.  Top, bottom, left and right corners, plus center (five points) X2 (wide and tele end for any zoom lens).  Better for sure than NOT having multiple points of adjustment, but with these many places to check and calibrate, some form of auto setting might be desirable?  Or at least a menu setting that allows you to clone center, corner, upper and lower into a single value for wide and in another single value for telephoto.  This means you would only have to enter two values instead of the current 10.<br />8) Buffer clearing is a bit slow (~30 sec if shooting RAW in 42MP, and running out to full buffer depth of ~60 images), even though this is mitigated by ability to review immediately.  Unfathomably, Sony doesn’t support SDXC II cards, with their roughly 3x faster read/write times. You can still use a SDXC II, which will speed workflow from camera to your computer (in USB 3.0), but it won’t help with write times to speed up buffer clearing.  Just plain weird that Sony didn’t support SDXC II.<br /><br />I’ve had this for roughly 15 weeks now, so I have now several clear and strong impressions, these after the gloss has worn off.  The camera is nicely substantial, slightly heavier than the A77II, but almost exactly the same size.  It’s functionally just like a FF A77ii on low light steroids and with 4k. I’m very pleasantly surprised by the Wi-Fi remote control app, as Internet forum chat had suggested that this would be unchanged from the A77II – but it’s actually vastly better, and appears very similar to the excellent versions running on the RX10/100.  This is a real plus on tripod shooting, allowing the user to activate the shutter without even a hint of movement in the camera body. Don’t leave home without it!  The camera feels great in normal shooting, smooth and responsive both in terms of shooting as well as reviewing/menu scrolling.  4K footage, particularly Super 35 mode, is often spectacular - maybe among the best I’ve seen or close to the best.  The best telephoto primes paired with this body will create absolutely stunning wildlife pictures.  In relationship to the many complaints about lack of H-AF support for legacy and 3rd party glass, if you shoot in ‘expand flexible spot’ mode, there seems to be little if any difference between the hybrid autofocus functionality with lenses like the Sony 70-400 G2 and older screw drive Minolta legacy glass.  I’m sure that if I was shooting more in ‘wide mode’, and using Eye AF combined face recognition options, this would be a potentially bigger issue.  In any case, screw drive legacy glass and Sony G and Zeiss lenses focus quickly, and even in low light, focus is quickly locked (unless you’re trying to focus on monochromatic smooth surfaces without texture, which virtually no AF system will handle).  On the other hand, the new 5 axis in-body image stabilization clearly does not seem quite as effective as the ~ 5 stop system in the RX10III (my only other benchmark for a system claiming 4-5 stops), and I have done no formal testing, but it seems more like 3-4 stops.<br /><br />Overall, what’s the bottom line?  The camera is very smooth, and responsive in all its operations, from shooting to reviewing images, while color, contrast, detail and DR are all superb, as one would expect in this class of camera.  And it’s just a great gift to be able to configure it in a way that is totally ‘simpatico’ with how and what you shoot – kudos to Sony for making the camera so easy to configure your way.  With the Fx menu setup properly, one can avoid menu diving almost completely, gaining rapid access to settings that you tend to modify.  It’s just a pleasure to shoot with, and then enjoy the spectacular images and video that it can effortlessly generate.  It’s nothing less than a screaming home run for A Mount and Sony.  It might be the best ‘all arounder’ FF camera anyone has yet made, if you weigh 4k, sports, and landscape equally.  It will, I predict, be back-ordered for all of 2017, as demand for this level of excellence, is completely outstripping supply, and even Sony’s most optimistic sales expectations.  If you have A mount glass, and want the best possible images, there is simply no other better option.<br /><br />Now if Sony would just remove the artificial restriction of forced P mode in video if you want AF, so we can have aperture control . . . . are you listening Sony?<br /><br />UPDATE DECEMBER 27, 2016<br /><br />Successful wildlife outing in Venice Florida two weeks ago, with many spectacular shots, and which brought cameras strengths and weaknesses into a little bit clearer focus (pun intended).  The biggest problem was that in 4K, both full frame, and in the Super 35 mode in APS-C, the image stabilization was borderline for smooth-enough video with just handholding.  You may really need to shoot on a tripod if you’re going to do video and expect even semi-professional looking results.  This is a bit of a disappointment, as I had high hopes that the image stabilization would be a little bit better in video.  It’s not bad, it’s just not great, and frankly, this is consistent with the IBIS in stills being a bit underperforming relative to its highly touted specs.  Perhaps I have just been badly spoiled by the phenomenal image stabilization modes in the RX10III, where if you shoot in 1080p you can have amazing degrees of stabilization (with a progressive crop factor  . . . not unexpectedly).  Haven’t had a chance to see much beyond a few short clips in Super 35 video (APS-C) – subjectively it looks like it might be just trace sharper than the full frame 4K.  Both look great, and both the DR and color are fantastic.<br /><br />The remote control from smart phone app is slightly disappointing in that it appears I am not able to elect to shoot movie clips from the interface itself, unless I first throw the camera into movie mode via the mode dial (admittedly a small inconvenience).  The remote app still allows excellent remote shooting on a tripod, displaying what mode I’m in, in the lower right corner with either a stills or movie icon, and control over shutter speed, exposure value, and ISO. It’s pretty responsive (not a lot of lag), and does give you a nice remote viewing screen.  I suspect with a good-sized android tablet it might really be something, particularly useful in relationship to so-called slow and quick movie settings, where you’re either doing time lapse or slow motion.  Such a remote control app running on a tablet facilitates work review on a much more discerning and revealing viewscreen.<br /><br />I continue to be impressed with the enormous subtlety – if any difference at all – between regular PDAF(for any A-Mount lens, 3rd party and Minolta legacy glass) and the hybrid autofocus (for Sony lenses), particularly if you’re shooting with expand flexible spot.  I can’t really tell any difference in AF speed or accuracy, but I have shot no action scenes that might challenge the AF system, and potentially reveal an advantage to the H-AF.  While this lack of obvious boost to AF speed in H-AF may be disappointing to some, it suggests that if you shoot with third-party lenses in flexible spot mode (or particularly center point AF mode), you’re not really missing out on much of anything.  If you’re going into wide autofocus modes, AF functionality differences become much more visible, because now you’re getting outside the dedicated PDAF array area.  But that’s just not how I shoot.  Informal testing suggests that the tracking is a bit better than the A77ii, and competitive with the Nikon D5 and Canon 1DXII.  That’s impressive company.  I have yet to run out of buffer depth, even in FF RAW, and in crop mode (18MP), buffer depth is just ridiculous.<br /><br />What about Lenses? . . . and you thought you spent a lot of money on the body!  Hah!!  There has been a lot of focus on the relative neglect of A mount lens ecology by Sony in their single minded focus on E mount lenses – but I still just don’t see the lens library deficit that some are complaining about.  While Sony does need to update the A Mount lens ecology (particularly the ultra wide angle primes, their aging 35mm prime and their telephoto primes), don’t believe the talk about how there “aren’t any A-mount lenses good enough for the sensor” – that’s just untrue.  The lens ecology may be third behind Canon and Nikon, but it’s hardly impoverished.  As great options, there are the CZ 24-70 2.8 I/II, Tamron 24-70 and 70-200 USD, Zeiss (24/50/85/135) and Sigma Art (35/50) primes and the remarkable Sony G2 70-400 and Sigma 24-105 f4, the Minolta legacy tele-primes, and several newer options as well such as the Sigma 500 4.5. All offer good to excellent performance . . . even if CZ lenses aren’t cheap.  My two most valuable lenses are 1) the Sigma Art 24-105 f4 and 2) the Sony 70-400 G2 – and they both deliver consistently great images on that sensor.  A Sigma 24-105 f4 recently replaced the CZ 24-70 f2.8 as a basic walk-around zoom, due to its extra reach and lighter weight.  With just those two lenses, I can cover an enormous range of shooting situations.  And I can always generate extra reach, using the ‘smart teleconverter’ function or the APS-C modes, as the 42MP image size gives me a lot of extra room for cropping.  In the APS-C crop mode, I still get 18MP images, which is competitive with the sports FF models from Canikon, and a nearly unlimited buffer.<br /><br />On the other hand I’m really disappointed that Sony decided to delete the multi-frame noise reduction mode, probably because they believed it was not needed with a FF sensor.  I’m not sure I agree with that, as it does give an extra stop or two of effective noise reduction if you’re shooting static subjects and you don’t want to process RAW files and mess around with NR in post. Speaking of which, finally, there is Optics Pro 11 support for the RAW files . . .DxO was however once again ‘late to the party’.<br /><br />So how do I feel about my pricey purchase, 15+ weeks in?  Definitely no regrets, and the camera is worth every penny compared to what the competition offers for similar or even more $.  The A99ii opens up options that just did not exist in A-Mount, both in terms of low light shooting, high resolution landscapes, 4K video, and for a kind of luminous image quality that you just have to see to believe.<br /><br />UPDATE JANUARY 25th, 2017<br /><br />First real problem with the camera emerged 3 weeks ago while on vacation.  An apparent hotspot on the sensor – essentially what appeared to be a ‘blown’ pixel emerged out of nowhere and for uncertain reasons.  After a discussion with Sony, a warranty claim was generated and the camera was sent into Precision Camera in Enfield Connecticut . . .  With fingers crossed and some trepidation, as Precision Camera frankly does not have a great reputation in the Sony community.  I was pleasantly surprised that they seemed better organized than many accounts might have suggested.  The camera was repaired, with online tracking of where in the assessment/repair/shipping process the camera might be, with accurate tracking information, and sent back in perfect working order in a week or so, with a cryptic technical report referencing “pixel adjustment” – but I frankly had no idea what the heck that might mean.  I would have assumed that sensor would have to be placed this report suggests otherwise.  It’s also curious that a single blown pixel on the sensor would also appear as a clearly visible hotspot in both the EVF and rear LCD, as one would assume that a single hot pixel would get averaged out (given that the resolution of both those displays is way below the sensor resolution), but that’s clearly not how it appeared – the hot pixel was very hot and seemingly magnified on both displays.  Never heard of or seen anything like this, and the technical report was, as I said, ‘cryptic.’  I’ve never heard of a “pixel adjustment.”  After some research, and feedback posted on this review, it appears that a reset of the motherboard eliminated the hot pixel, and may even be part of the monthly cycle for the camera.  So I now regard this as not a big deal, but still puzzling.<br /><br />UPDATE FEBRUARY 19th, 2017<br /><br />The big news is the rather mixed review of the A99ii from DPR, particularly critical of the A99ii for its relatively poor AF and tracking, while begrudgingly admitting it may have a large and perhaps unmatched envelope of abilities. The evidence base for their conclusion seems thin to me, and is at odds with better action and sports shooting performance reported by numerous professionals using this body, and at odds with other professional reviews, and last and probably least, my own testing of the AF system on moving targets (which doesn’t show perfect tack sharp performance on every shot, but better than DPR’s results).  The whole back-and-forth debate is available at DPR Sony A-Mount Forum, if you are really a glutton for punishment.  I believe that the AF and tracking settings that DPR used were poor selections (for example, shooting in ‘balanced emphasis’ vs. ‘AF priority’ which ensures that AF is always locked before the shutter would fire), and, their data has not been replicated.  Time will tell whether they have it right and everyone else has missed the boat in thinking that its AF and tracking in high speed shooting were decent (if behind a Nikon D5), or whether this was an instance of extracting poorer performance using poorer choices.  Meantime, if you want near-perfect tracking and AF, and that’s more important than anything else, get a Nikon D5.  If you value a real balance of typically disparate, even somewhat conflicting, functional abilities, including 4k without a huge crop factor, landscape and portraiture with high resolution, and ability to shoot action (if with slightly lower hit rates than a D5), this camera is clearly a far better choice.  What makes this camera remarkable is that even if it is not ‘best in class’ at any of those typically separate types of shooting, it is close enough.  No other FF body achieves this level of ‘decathletic’ performance.<br /><br />UPDATE MARCH 24th, 2017<br /><br />The Imaging Resource review just was finished, and, as expected, it is better balanced and I believe more representative of the camera’s real strengths and weaknesses than the DPR review, which still – in between the lines – betrays an anti-SLT bias.  I recommend the IR review as the first really comprehensive professional and balanced review of this remarkable Sony FF body."]},{"name":"Nikon D5","amazon_reviews":["Some people will give this camera a stellar review because its their first real pro body, but trust me, its good for those of us that have owned pro bodies before.  I've been shooting with pro bodies since 2004.  I've owned 1Ds, 1Ds-II, 1Ds-III, D3, D3s, D810, others...  So I'm not impressed just because its a pro body.  However I did love the Nikon D3s so much that I stuck with it from 2009 to 2017 (and I still have it), so its not like I'm just a gear junkie.  I can't compare it to a D4 or a D4s because I skipped those.<br /><br />Anyway, let me summarize.<br /><br />AF<br />I'm accustomed to the amazing 51 point AF system that came with the Nikon D3s.  It was revolutionary and my understanding was that it didn't really get significantly better in the D4 or D4s, which is why I waited.  Now the D5 has 153, 3x more!  Is it 3x better, well no... but its better and not just marginally, its REALLY GOOD.  It rarely misses, but when it does miss its not far off and typically yields a usable 5x7. Whats even better is that it can do it in nearly zero light, \"moonlight they say\", but I get solid AF in what I'd call pitch black. I tend to shoot natural light (no flash) and this camera can AF in any situation. Its hard to quantify these things.  My summary is that it yields much higher hit ratio than the already amazing D3s and it does it in nearly zero light.<br /><br />Noise<br />If you're pixel peeping at 100%, I see slightly less noise than the D3s at 100%, however the D3s is 12mp.  If you scale the D5 down to 12mp it looks much cleaner than the D3s.  Compared to the D810, there is no comparison.  D810 isn't bad considering the amount of data you're collecting but even when you scale the D810 36mp image down to 20mp or even 12mp, it doesn't look nearly as clean as the D5 or D3s.  Though IMHO still very clean and not a bad choice for low light -- just not the best choice.  I find D3s, D810 and D5 are all phenomenal up to about ISO 1600.  D810 is usable but D3s and D5 and are still very clean through 6400.  At 12800+ the D5 seems to be about a 1/2 stop ahead of the D3s in noise when pixel peeping each at 100% or maybe 1.5 stops ahead if you scale the D5 down to 12mp.  Where the D5 really shines apart from the D3s is the D3s is not usable after 25600 IMO other than B&W, though the D5 if scaled down to 8mp or 10mp is usable in color at ISO 102,400 or instagram photos at 204,800.  The D5 starts to get a color tint at ISO 400k which is when I must go B&W.  But to be able to grab a photo in extreme low light at ISO 400k and actually have something you could put on your wall (B&W) is simply amazing, magic.<br /><br />Dynamic Range<br />Let me start by saying, yes yes its true, the D810 is better at recovering blown highlights or deep dark shadows at bright ISOs like 64 - 800, but beyond 800 the D5 is equal and beyond ISO 800 the D5 begins to out perform the D810 in recovering highlights and shadows.  So its a matter of taste.  IMO low ISO shots are for studios and landscapes, in those situations you can set up your shot perfectly with lights or bracketing and don't need highlight or shadow recovery as much (though its convenient).  I almost exclusively shoot above ISO 800 and thats where the D5 is like magic, yes there is noise but to be able to recover 2.5 - 3 stops of shadows at ISO 6400 is pretty damn impressive!<br /><br />Speed:<br />D3s was already fast enough for me at 9 or 11 fps.  14 is just a whirlwind of memory card eating.  It is great when capturing bracketed shots handheld (which you shouldn't do) or when capturing kids, one of the 50 photos you just snapped is bound to have a non-blinking smile in there ;)<br /><br />Ergo and Weather proofing:<br />As good or better than the D3s, they're almost identical.  One complaint I thought they'd have fixed by now is the custom button assignment.  I still can't assign any function I want to any button I want.  Its like they're teasing me.  Why?  I just want to assign Auto-ISO to that button for that rare moment that I need to capture something in a split second.  Nope, can't do it.  Silly Nikon.  Touch screen is pretty cool, though I'd have bought the camera even if it didn't have it.  I love to be able to pinch and zoom and slide around while zoomed to make sure no one was blinking, or double check that yes in fact the D5 did get perfect focus AGAIN... Wow...<br /><br />I could go on, there's plenty to love.","Best snapshot camera, ever. I mean it. My Nikon D810, under ideal conditions, takes much better pictures, with higher resolution and much better dynamic range, but with my Nikon D5, I almost always get a usable picture, as the camera simply focuses really well, and very quickly, and in very little light. There is something to be said for walking away with \"the picture,\" even if it isn't necessarily the best quality picture. If that makes sense...","I've owned many cameras, including a D3s and D800, but the D5 is really a great performer in every respect.  I bought the CF version because I have many CF cards, but the QXD version is supposed to be even faster.  So far, the CF version has worked extremely fast and provides extreme low light shots with excellent quality.","Awesome camera!","Best Nikon digital yet!","I love it.","Great camera.

It is great when capturing bracketed shots handheld (which you shouldn't do) or when capturing kids, one of the 50 photos you just snapped is bound to have a non-blinking smile in there ;)<br /><br />Ergo and Weather proofing:<br />As good or better than the D3s, they're almost identical.  One complaint I thought they'd have fixed by now is the custom button assignment.  I still can't assign any function I want to any button I want.  Its like they're teasing me.  Why?  I just want to assign Auto-ISO to that button for that rare moment that I need to capture something in a split second.  Nope, can't do it.  Silly Nikon.  Touch screen is pretty cool, though I'd have bought the camera even if it didn't have it.  I love to be able to pinch and zoom and slide around while zoomed to make sure no one was blinking, or double check that yes in fact the D5 did get perfect focus AGAIN... Wow...<br /><br />I could go on, there's plenty to love.","Best snapshot camera, ever. I mean it. My Nikon D810, under ideal conditions, takes much better pictures, with higher resolution and much better dynamic range, but with my Nikon D5, I almost always get a usable picture, as the camera simply focuses really well, and very quickly, and in very little light. There is something to be said for walking away with \"the picture,\" even if it isn't necessarily the best quality picture. If that makes sense...","I've owned many cameras, including a D3s and D800, but the D5 is really a great performer in every respect.  I bought the CF version because I have many CF cards, but the QXD version is supposed to be even faster.  So far, the CF version has worked extremely fast and provides extreme low light shots with excellent quality.","Awesome camera!","Best Nikon digital yet!","I love it.","Great camera. I love it, my clients love the images I create with it  . . .what more is there?<br />Pro shooter since we landed on the moon . . .  I have not had this same uber smiley feeling since I got my hands on my first new Hasselblad : )","I love this camera and I'm going to buy it Soon,","Good value, good service, excellent transaction, excellent product.","Its hard to believe that less than a decade ago, I was using a D2hs. . . and LOVED it. . . this is another leap forward.  The D3 was a leap, the 4 was a step.  . .this is another leap.  The focus tracking is superior and no longer trails the Canon, and if you pair this with a 200mmf2, you have the best indoor VB, BB or gymnastics camera on the planet.<br /><br />The ISO upgrade is great the subtle changes in the ergonomics and touch screen are great.  The 4k video is a non issue with me, but that may be good for some.<br /><br />The price is too high, but what isn't too high these days?  $4 for a loaf of bread?. . . yep, too high.","I have owned D3, D4, and now D5. This is monster camera. It beats all other camera in the current market.","This is a GREAT replacement for my D3 - The picture quality is out of this world - I can soot anything that moves with confidence. If you shoot action (Football, Basketball, Soccer, Air Shows, Birds  in Flight) you gotta get this camera.","So I have owned mine for over a month now, and am finally confident in writing a review as Nikon updated the firmware.  This does it all and well, now is it a megapixel or Dynamic Range monster like my D810, NO.  That is what I have my D810 for, but this is a speed monster and focusing beast with the cleanest high ISO images I have ever seen.  I mean 12,800 almost needs not correction in Lr.  I have this as compliment to my D810 as they are very different cameras for different purposes, and now feel I have my entire tool box full.  One word of advice, get the biggest XQD cards you can, I have 6 64 gb cards and this thing can chew them up and spit them out given you can get 3,000 shots of one battery.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA! I've had and still use many Nikons including an 800 and a D4. The D4 did what it was supposed to, but had a number of shortcomings. The D5 is simply better everywhere. Superb noise and image quality. Great sensitivity. Super fast shutter and frame rate for action. Lots of customization to make it work the way you want. Buttons in the right places with the right customization capability. Great movie capability as well as stills. Incredible control on images as well as mechanics. Better autofocus on moving subjects than I have had before. Intuitive display. Touchscreen is nice. Feels great in your hand.<br /><br />I just wish it had a built in GPS - but it works fine with several external GPS units, they just add unwanted bulk.  And 24MP would have been nice. The 800 is great but more than I need many times. 20MP is right at the edge for great wildlife with sometimes shaky framing. But I think Nikon did the right trade offs on capture rate and image size for this generation.<br /><br />An hour playing with the menus, tweaking the customization and practice shooting and the D5 felt like home.  The menus and options follow the standard Nikon formats, with additional possibilities around things like time-lapse, movie settings, controls and notably shutterless photography - using the electronics of the sensor for very quiet and fast operation.<br /><br />I have been using this camera in far more settings than I ever used the D4. It is great for many purposes. Sports. Wildlife. Portraits. News.  While I recommend against handheld panos for stitching, the leveling display in the viewfinder has given me great results for landscapes and scenics. It is quickly becoming the first camera I reach for.","Superb. Coming from 3D this is so much more than I expected. Incredibly fast, the autofocus is mind-blowing, you have to try hard to make image out of focus. The high ISO produces great photos ready for post process.","I just simply love this camera! It is super quick to focus and holding it is like a dream! Images are beautiful and crisp! I've had everyone of their Pro bodies and this is the topper! Truly worth the money!","Unbelievable camera for all low light situations. I have used it for high school sports at night at 25,600 ISO/1500 sec. with incredible results. I have used it for live stage performances at 12,800 ISO/1/500 sec with spectacular clarity. Right now probably the best professional sports camera on the planet.","I have been using Nikon since Nikon came out with D3. Since then I've owned D3s, D4, & D4s. They all have been amazing pro bodies. Now that I got my D5, it's what I expected  & even much more from Nikon flagship camera. I'got the XQD version. The quality of images are beautiful, Colors are amazing. Low ISO to very high ISO are very much useable images, I am a wedding and Portrait photographer, I do mostly Asian wedding & most of my weddings are indoor and in the evening and the lighting condition are not so ideal. It's a wonderful camera, I am loving it.<br />Focusing is amazing with 153 points of autofocus, even in a low light. This camera can shoot indoors without a flash at a reasonable ISO without significant noise in the images. 4K video capability is beautiful, now that Nikon has announce they are coming with firmware update to video to go 29 minute and 59 second, I am very excited about that as well. This camera is night and day different from my D3, D3s D4 & D4s.<br />I also brought 3 SB-5000 and WR10 Kit. after sending WR10 back to Nikon and getting the firmware update I got it back and it works just flawlessly with my Nikon D5. Really amazing combination. If you are thinking about buying one then go for it, I know you'll love it.","Very Pleased!<br />I picked my D5 up last week and have been setting it up and running some tests.  There is no doubt in my mind that this Nikon  flagship camera is outstanding in low light, speed and auto focus.  I used it to shoot a track meet and  softball game at a local high school and was blown away by the speed of the camera and its ability to focus quickly and accurately with fast moving subjects.  The picture quality and color were also outstanding. I can't wait to try it with birds in flight and I expect outstanding results due to its autofocus capabilities. I will update the review after I have used the D5 for other purposes.  I expect the best based on what I have seen so far.<br />The only criticism that I have is that the user manual leaves a lot to be desired and I think Nikon must have cut and pasted from an earlier manual as many of the camera functions are handled poorly or not at all.  Come on Nikon, there is no excuse for this!.","After taking almost 10k images, the feature I am most impressed with is the new focusing system...  Low light and moving action is where this tool is designed to consistently capture image after image crisp and in focus.  Using the D3s, I've learned to use the center point focus capturing that \"perfect moment\" during action -- sometimes it was \"spray and pray\" hoping that the right moment was captured.  With the D5, I find the group area AF to be most helpful. This uses a diamond shaped pattern of 5 points to track the subject; they act in concert to maintain focus as a single point and avoids mis-focusing on the background. The 3D and Auto AF also have face detection priority which is amazingly accurate. For BIF, I utilize the 25 point dynamic AF most frequently.<br /><br />For static subjects and controlled lighting, I think you can get better images with the D810 where you will have larger files and better dynamic range at 1/2 the price.  Find the right tool that works for you!<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Upgraded from a D3s which has served me well over the years. Read those concerns about dynamic range and ISO invariance. While interesting and thought provoking discussion, in the end does the end product look good? Putting down a few thousand shots this week, two things immediately stand out.<br /><br />First, images shot in challenging lighting environments and thus high ISO is just amazing. Perhaps this is because I am coming from a D3s, but its no slouch for low light either...  Shooting for competitive swimming, I'm often at ISO 9000-15000. Images have noise but easily cleaned in post processing.<br /><br />Second, the focusing technology is incredible!  The auto-area setting in the D3s was not very good in capturing erratically moving subjects. I often used single point focus and this was hit or miss at times. With the D5, I am stunned at the number of in focus images in auto-area AF mode. 153 focusing points is awesome and it does prioritize the face!  I also really like the Group-area focus mode for fast moving objects toward me.<br /><br />This camera is a tool built for those who shoot in challenging lighting environments and moving subjects. If your job/work/images are taken under these instances, this is the right tool for you. D5 paired with my 70-200 28 is just magical. Build is solid like all the other Nikon D series bodies. I'm not a video shooter, so its not an important feature for me. I have absolutely no regrets!","Received two D5 bodies last Monday.  Sold a 4s on Tuesday.  ISO 800 is now my \"working\" speed and I have no problem ratcheting up to 3600 if necessary.  Heck, 6400 is perfectly acceptable for publications.  One body is on a 300, the other a 200-400.  The 810 is usually permanently married to my 600mm.  A D5 will replace the 810 in the evenings and early morning when doing \"wing\" shots where increased FPS is required.<br /><br />There is nothing to complain about with the D5.  Admittedly there are problems with \"odd\" ISO speeds (speeds in between the \"normal\").  Nothing serious from the stand point of wildlife shooting though.  I will say that the D5 is no earth shaking upgrade from a 4s.  The touch screen is a nice addition.  I do like the ability to swap over to CF cards if there is sufficient reason and Nikon keeps the cost under $200.00.  EXPEED5 is the prime reason for my changing.  The remaining 4s is now my backup.<br /><br />Photos:  Left is a light crop.  Right is a tight crop at 200%.  ISO 800, f/8 at 1/1000.","The Nikon D5 is, of course, Nikon's top-line DSLR, designed primarily for high-speed photojournalistic shots and extreme  low light.  It is a big and heavy beast of a camera.<br /><br />The camera is a thing of beauty, or at least stunning presence and quality.  Be the envy of friends and major governments and political candidates.  People love to pose and perform for it, because they know it's awesome.  But there is substance, too – it takes gorgeous pictures in just about every shooting condition you can throw at it.<br /><br />You may want to buy this camera because it's the best camera Nikon makes.  Actually, it is a very specialized tool.  If you want to shoot landscapes or quiet and still nature, consider the D810 instead.  It's half the price and gives you almost double the resolution, which is what you need.  The D5 is what you need if you want to get the moment Britney Spears flashes, the time the alligator crashes over the berm and you were there to get it, or the fleeing glimpse of every nuance of the musician's performance.<br /><br />Even if you can easily afford this camera, and want to shoot action, make sure it is suitable for you.  Before you buy, try and hold it (or the similarly big and heavy D4S or D4) and see how it feels in your hand.  You may find it too large and heavy for your personal use case, in which case you should put it back on the shelf and consider the cheaper, crop sensor D500.  Or you may find it just right, in which case you will love it :).<br /><br />I love the way it feels in my hand – it really balances beautifully especially with lenses like the 24-70 f/2.8 with which I do most of my people photography.<br /><br />Superior high-ISO image quality<br /><br />With the nightclubs I shoot in getting increasingly dark, I really wanted a better high ISO camera than the D4 that I still own.  This was particularly so since the D810 seemed to be catching up.  It was time for a change, especially since my D4 has gone through 475,000 plus shutter actuations, with a shutter rated for 400,000.<br /><br />So how did it do?<br /><br />The D4 would shoot at ISO 6400 with very little visible noise, and 12,800 with significant noise that was still acceptable to me.  The D5 shoots beautifully at up to ISO 51,200.  So at this point 51,200 is better than 12,800, which is very impressive to me. I made a test shot at 102,400 which looked roughly equivalent to ISO 25,600 on the D4 and therefore not really acceptable.  However, I have not taken any real world pictures at that speed, so I will update this review with more information as I obtain it.  Note that at ISO 102,400 it may be difficult to see the image in the viewfinder, because you are actually asking it to significantly brighten reality.  You are starting to run into limitations of our own eyes.<br /><br />This is, alas, all JPG shooting. I have not tried RAW because Apple's software does not yet support RAW conversion for the D5 files.  What I hear is that about half the improvement is due to the sensor and half is due to superior JPG conversion in software.  So the D5 is likely to do well with RAW up to 25,600 and you will have to use JPG processing for 51,200 to be acceptable.  What I notice, however, is that while I frequently needed to bump up exposure in post with the D4, I have not had to do this with the D5 at all thanks to its superior high ISO ability.  So thanks to the camera's superior performance at 51,200 it may be possible that you will no longer need to push exposure, meaning that it will be less and less important to use RAW in the future.<br /><br />As Thom Hogan says, they moved our cheese!<br /><br />The three controls flanking the shutter release button have changed position.  I always found it awkward to push the Video Record button in the D4.  The D5 has solved this problem; the new positions are much easier to use.  However, it's going to take time for me to get used to the new position of the ISO and Mode buttons.<br /><br />The controls all seem to feel sharper and crisper than the D4.  Of course this may be because I have a D4 with an enormous amount of use, but I still think it's significantly nicer than my memory of my then-new D4's controls.<br /><br />For some reason I find it easier to hold vertically than the old model.  I think they changed it a bit for the better.<br /><br />For an old iPhone user such as myself, the new pinch to zoom mode is wonderful!  It's really cool to see the image change size and be easy to move it around.  However, it's a bit awkward that when you do pinch to zoom and then take pictures, the zoom level remains the same instead of being reset to the normal magnification, meaning that you cannot use the control buttons to change the image without resetting the zoom.  Still, on balance I would never return to the conventional controls of the D4.<br /><br />XQD Card and Reader<br /><br />Based on my experience with the D4, get the dual XQD version, as I did.  CF cards are about half the speed of the older XQD and when my D4 switched from XQD to CF I groaned about the far inferior performance.  This is especially true since the 128GB Lexar XQD card is available at a very reasonable price.  New XQD cards are double the speed of the old ones, so don't even dream of getting the CF version.<br /><br />I bought the D5 from a local camera store, and they were a bit confused about whether I would get the XQD card and reader free.  Be insistent with your dealer about this issue.  The free XQD card is 32GB, which is a bit small for use with this camera, but it will do while your Amazon order is going through for the bigger card.<br /><br />The free reader is not compatible with the slower cards, so if you are upgrading from a D4, either keep your old reader or give your old cards to the person buying your D4.<br /><br /><b>4K Video</b><br /><br />The 4K video mode is, unfortunately, a DX crop factor and therefore probably will require the use of DX lenses for most of us.  Since I bought the D5 instead of the D500 primarily because I would prefer to use the optically and mechanically superior full frame lenses, this is a bit of a letdown.  When I have had a chance to review my 4K footage more carefully, I will update this section with more information.<br /><br />Regular 1080P video still looks fantastic and you can even film at up to 60fps if the mood strikes.<br /><br />Value<br /><br />I seriously considered downgrading to the $2,000 D500 instead of buying another awesome beast of a top-end camera.  Embarrassingly enough, the D500 has WiFi and the D5 charges an \"economical\" $699 for it.  The D500 is also much smaller and lighter, and is far more affordable.  To get a taste of what the high-end camera is like, the D500 should give you about 75% of what you get with the D5 at less than 1/3 the price.<br /><br />The D5 is famous for its cockroach-like durability.  The shutter is rated for 400,000 exposures instead of the 200,000 for the D500.  I've taken over 500,000 shots with my D4 without a miss, and I have every confidence the D5 will do just as well.<br /><br />It's a beautiful world, we only photograph it<br /><br />In the end, I really love owning this particular kind of camera.  I love the super-high speed operation, the precision of the FX lenses and the overall presence of the design.  It's genuinely addictive to own Nikon's most professional camera.<br /><br />Sample photos<br /><br />The first photo was taken with the D5 and 80-400 f/4.5-5.6 (old version) during daylight conditions.<br /><br />The second photo was taken with the D5 and the 24-70 f/2.8 VR (new version) inside a very dark nightclub at ISO 51,200.","I bought this camera for many reasons, the incredible high native ISO of 102,400, sensor resolution of 20.8 Million, 153-point auto focus points, and numerous other strengths.<br /><br />What I didn't know is the camera can shoot silently in live view mode! It's a menu setting in the Photo Shooting Menu > Silent live view photography, it's the very last item, and you have to turn it on, by default it is off. But then if you shoot with Live View the camera is silent, even in high speed continuous! This is absolutely huge for me, life changing even. I am ecstatic. I shoot golf tournaments, and my camera cannot make a sound. So up until now I had to use lower quality cameras because they were quite. Now I can shoot golf tournaments with my best camera. It's like Christmas, and I can't believe no one is talking about this huge benefit. I would have bought the camera solely for the silent mode if I had known about it.","If yu are looking for the clean shadow noise of your D3 at ISO 200 to 1600, this is not your camera.  I also do not like the color engine for skin tones.<br />April 25, 2016  Having used this for a month I am updating....Good camera that, at lower than 3200 ISO, needs a little more post processing, but not much. I find that at those ISOs, you need to add +17% noise reduction luminance to hide the grain (noise).<br />Spectacular fast focus.<br />Great at iISO 6400 to 25000.<br />You can get orders that you would not have otherwise.","A new flagship has arrived in the Nikon camp, and its name is the D5. I was lucky enough to snag a CF version from Midwest Photo Exchange the week of its initial release, and have been playing with it practically non-stop ever since.<br /><br />Mind you, I will not be spouting data and pixel peeping in this review. Being primarily a wedding and engagement photographer, my opinions will be based with that in mind for the most part, and how it has served me in the conditions I've put it through. Mileage may vary, but hopefully this will give you a real-world view of what you can expect from Nikon's newest offering.<br /><br />All that being said, what do I think? I think I love this camera.<br /><br />It's really hard to know where to begin on this front. The D5 is truly a beast, and more of a camera than I had even anticipated.<br /><br />Obviously, Nikon touts this camera as the ultimate sports shooter, and with its 12 FPS on continuous high, it really is. Despite never encountering a bride who has attempted the 100m hurdles down the aisle (which could be a whole new level of awesome, ha), I wanted to put the D5 through its paces and see what it could do. I had my four year old son run and fight crime in the backyard (I do believe we have the highest crime rate in our backyard of our entire city...but we have our son, so we're safe!), and tracked him nearly flawlessly with AF-C and 3D tracking. I was astonished at how well the 3D tracking performed.<br /><br />So naturally my next move was to take this concept into a darker situation, which is why I met up with my little cousin who is a tumbler, and I had her do her best to flip and fly and confuse the camera in a lower light situation. Again, it performed amazingly. The 3D tracking kept a bead on her throughout all of her tumbling, and left me in awe at how fantastic the files were at higher \"normal\" ISO ranges. ISO 4-5k is still ridiculously clean to the point of being comparable to ISO 1k or so on other cameras.<br /><br />Which leads me to the next point - Nikon has touted this camera as its low light king, capable of performing at ridiculous ISO ranges that, quite frankly, most will never use. I certainly will never push ISO 100k for a wedding. However, I have been in situations with my D750 where ISO 10k is something I'm utilizing. I know plenty of people who use the higher ISOs and are comfortable doing so, so of course I will never argue personal policies, but generally for my taste, ISO 10k is about where I'll stop on my D750 for deliverability. That game absolutely changes with the D5.<br /><br />The D5 is a true beast at high ISOs, and really does shine when put into those situations. I repeatedly put the camera in high ISO situations and left extremely impressed. ISO 28,800 is about where I would probably tap out on delivering to a client, and would be more comfortable staying under ISO 25,600. But seriously -- ISO 25,600? That's BANANAS. I genuinely cannot wait for the next candlelight ceremony I shoot, knowing I'll be wielding this workhorse. Low light simply is not an issue with this camera. The files remain clean, retain their colors fantastically, and are an absolute dream to work with. I'm very, very excited to shoot in low light with this camera.<br /><br />Ergonomically, the D5 is extremely comfortable to wield, despite its size. Coming from a D750, that was the first thing I noticed. The heft is real, but it's not overwhelming. It feels sturdy, and I want sturdy when I'm dropping the kind of money I am on a D5. It's built like a tank, but it's not so unwieldy that I don't want to use it. All that to say, yes, you'll notice it's no lightweight when you pick it up, but you don't necessarily need to go to the gym and lift weights prior to picking up this guy up.<br /><br />The grip is shallower than my D750, but not so much that it feels unstable. I like the grooves, and my hands feel natural when gripping the camera in both landscape and portrait orientations.<br /><br />Pleasant surprises abound in the D5, and for me, I'm really enjoying the joystick and touchscreen features this camera touts. I have missed the joystick from my Canon days, but never realized how convenient it truly is until being given one on the D5. It speeds up my AF point selection, and anything that allows me to get the image faster is good in my book. Along those lines, I'd forgotten how nice image scrubbing is on the Canon side, and scrubbing on the D5 with the touchscreen is a dream. The ability to zoom in, whip through photos, and review what I've been doing is great, and definitely a nice added feature.<br /><br />Finally, the auto white balance on the D5 feels much more true to life than my D750, something I very much enjoy. The skin tones feel a bit more true, and while I generally shoot on cloudy or auto WB, I find myself leaning to auto more in certain situations, knowing the colors will be fairly true to what I'm seeing.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie, I really miss the Wi-Fi feature and tilt-screen of my Nikon D750 when I use the D5. I have been heavily utilizing both, so to suddenly be without them is a bit of an adjustment, but it's not a deal breaker. I would, however, love to see those put into the D5S.<br /><br />Other than those two nit picks, I feel the D5 is an astounding piece of technology, and a jump forward in low light, which is something that's crucial to me as a wedding photographer.<br /><br />There have been posts online about how the D5 has less dynamic range at low ISOs than some of the cheaper Nikon offerings -- and it's true. However, to me, if I want to have extreme dynamic range at the lower ISOs, I can reach for my D750. I also don't make it a routine to push my shadows 3-5 stops over what I shot at, because I try to shoot as accurately as I can in-camera, regardless of the camera I'm using. The D5 is a low light beast, and thusly, Nikon focused on the high ISO capabilities of the camera. That doesn't make it a slouch in lower ISO situations by any means; however, naturally, when you choose a tool, you're choosing it for what it specifically offers. In the instance of the D5, if you're looking for hands down the best high ISO performance, a next-level AF system that many times feels like witchcraft, and/or the ability to fire off frames at a blistering speed, the D5 will not disappoint. I can already see myself making this camera my main player in low light getting ready rooms, in dark churches, or situations that might require a faster FPS (hello, 100m hurdles bride!), then turn to my D750 for portraits, receptions, etc.<br /><br />Each tool has a specific purpose, and it's up to the person wielding the tool to utilize it properly. However, I can say this much: the Nikon D5 has stepped up to the plate with this fantastic flagship camera, and it's truly a joy to use. I can't wait to get into full swing of wedding season and really put this camera to work.<br /><br />Whether or not this camera is right for you isn't something I can answer. However, if you asked me if I would make the hunt and drive to score this camera again, I would absolutely tell you yes. It's a fantastic piece of equipment, and I'm looking forward to shooting more and more with it.","I am a professional photographer and I either own or have owned many other Nikon FF bodies, including the D4, D810. D750, and D700. I use these cameras as a job function; they pay my bills. So a lot of the gimmick features are wasted on me. I want bodies that do their job, do it well, and don't fail me.<br /><br />The D5 is not the D4. It's not the same thing with a few tweaks. Even a few days of ownership are enough to be certain of that fact. That statement includes both positives and negatives, both of which I'll try to outline here. As the weeks and months go on I will update this review with further findings. I'm going to touch on four main issues: autofocus, high ISO performance, handling/ergonomics, and overall impressions.<br /><br />First, the autofocus is incredible. Not good, not great; truly exceptional. I almost have to try to make it miss. The D4 does a great job of focusing in most conditions but it does struggle in a few situations. Erratic side to side movements are very tough, for example. I've yet to find a situation where the D5 struggles. Short of using superlatives I'm not sure what there is left to say on this subject. A+, 10/10, AAA.<br /><br />High ISO performance is one of the hallmarks of the D series. It's always excellent and the D5 is no exception. When the light gets low the D5 steps up and doesn't disappoint. I'm primarily a RAW shooter but I've been shooting RAW+JPEG since I have received the camera. The JPEG's are superb. It's very obvious that Nikon has made significant progress with their JPEG engine. The RAWs are also excellent, but not quite as amazing (comparatively) as the JPEGs. They are still MORE than acceptable and I find them to be about a stop better than the D4. However, I expect a future firmware update, paired with software updates, to make them truly amazing in the months to come. JPEGs get an A+. RAWs get an A.<br /><br />The ergonomics of the D5 are every bit as good as their predecessors. Everything is tight, well built, and well placed. There have been some small changes in button layout, all of which I think are improvements. The biggest improvement being the relocation of the ISO button. Instead of being located in the bottom left it's now near the shutter, making changing ISO on the fly much more convenient. It will take some relearning of muscle memory, but in the long run it will definitely be a positive.<br /><br />My overall impressions are highly positive. I think that Nikon's changes have been for the better and that those improvements have been significant. The high ISO quality has been improved and even a minor improvement (combined with more resolution) is impressive. The focus improvements are significant and immediately noticeable. The low ISO dynamic range seems little lower than I would have hoped for, but it's not a concern for my work and I can't imagine buyers of this camera would be concerned with it either.<br /><br />As I said, I will update this review in the future after I use it more, but if my long term impressions are anywhere close to what I've seen so far, I'll be highly pleased with this purchase.","I've owned a D300, D700, D4, D810 and now this D5. It's legit. Don't believe the hype. Granted I've had it only two days but what I've shot so far is excellent. It's a beast and I'll update this review after I shoot a wedding this weekend.  =D","i just received the camera and am in the process of setting it up. it is a joy to use and i much prefer the DSLRs to the various mirrorless cameras i've tried (four of them so far). yes, it's heavier, but has that good, solid feel of quality equipment. i wish it would use the same batteries as the D3x, but i can accept the world as it is :)","The camera arrived a few hours ago.  Took some initial pictures.  The image quality is amazing.  Great detail and color.  Great focus.  Very easy to shoot indoor pics at high ISO.  Very happy.  I can sense this will be a great camera.<br /><br />Update: April 3 AM.<br />The auto focus is indeed amazing.  There is almost never an issue with almost instant focus.  The high ISO capability is also extremely useful, and gives you great latitude in exposure settings.  This is also very useful for Macro photography, where it allows the use of high shutter speeds to prevent motion blur.  The camera also appears to have great dynamic range.<br /><br />Have posted some initial photos taken around my neighborhood and indoors.  Nothing spectacular, but gives some indication of the camera's capability.  The macro shot of the blanket was hand held and taken with a 200mm Nikkor lens with an extension tube.  These photographs have not been altered by any software.<br /><br />Hope this helps."]},{"name":"Panasonic Lumix DMC-G85 (Lumix DMC-G80)","amazon_reviews":["This camera had the potential to be the best vlogging camera ever made. I was highly disappointed with it. While the camera offers 4k footage, in-body image stabilization, a flip screen, a microphone port, and an easy to use touch screen, I had some use-specific gripes about it.<br /><br />If you are filming yourself, this camera may seem perfect.<br /><br />Issue # 1: The Autofocus<br />The AF system on this camera is contrast-based, and I lost several pieces of footage because the autofocus lost my face during filming. My vision is not the best, so I looked at the flip screen and it seemed like I was in focus. When I got home to edit the footage for my vlog, it was focused on the background, rather than my friend and I. This happened a few times. I think you could get focus for stills easily using the viewfinder, but you definitely cannot rely on the autofocus to film yourself. If you have someone helping you film, I don't think this will be an issue.<br /><br />Issue # 2: Lens Prices & Crop Factor<br />I picked up this camera with the 14mm f2.5 lens to do my VLOGS. The lens quality was fine, but it just wasn't wide enough for what I needed. The crop factor on this camera is 2, so you must multiply the focal length and aperture by 2 to get the effective 35mm focal length and aperture. Therefore, my 14mm lens was actually a 28mm f5. A LOT of people don't understand this, which makes people think the cheaper lenses are much better than they actually are.<br /><br />Anyway, so I looked into the lens selection of wider lenses. The best focal length on Panasonic cameras for vlogging is actually 12mm (24mm equivalent). The lens options were a wide angle zoom (for about $800 or more or the 12mm f/1.2 for $1,300. These lenses really are needed for vlogging yourself or shooting in situations where you don't have a lot of light or want to separate yourself from the background. The lenses are much more expensive for the Micro Four Thirds cameras (like this one) because they need a much more expensive array of lenses to get enough light onto the smaller sensor. Therefore, I would not recommend this camera for vlogging due to the expense of these lenses, the crop factor, and the low light performance (without an expensive lens).<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend a different camera for someone who wants to vlog or does a lot of self filming. I think Sony's RX100 Mark V is much better for vlogging in 4k with a few caveats. The Canon G7x Mark II is also great is you don't think 4k is a must. As for 4k interchangeable lens cameras go, I think your money might be better spent on a Sony A600 or A6300 (roughly the same price as this one), because it will give you better image quality and autofocus you can count on. It doesn't have a flip screen like this one, but you will get a lot more footage you can use.","I'd been researching cameras at the $1K price point for a long time. I narrowed my search to a few competing models, such as the Sony a6300/6500, Canon 80D, and Olympus OMD EM1. All of them had very compelling features and I'm pretty sure I would have been happy with any of them. But none offered the value quotient or best all-around performance than the Lumix G85... on paper, at least.<br />When my camera arrived I had very high expectations. This camera has met or exceeded my expectations in just about every aspect:<br /><br />- Performance is ON POINT. Focusing is super fast and tack-sharp. The shutter makes a beautifully quiet flutter sound, and if you need it totally silent you have the capability of doing so in \"Silent Mode.\" One caveat I must point out is the continuous autofocus, which can drive me crazy. It hunts around too much, especially when things get dark.<br /><br />- The body isn't exactly compact but is a good deal smaller than even the smallest DSLRs like my mother-in-law's Nikon D3300 (another fantastic camera). Still, it feels solid in my hands and will provide good balance for heavier long zoom lenses, which is what I wanted.<br /><br />- The 12-60mm kit lens is extremely versatile, focuses quickly, and takes very sharp pictures. As expected, it's not the best for indoor shots or blurring backgrounds... you will need a faster lens (F2.8 or lower) for that. But otherwise, it performs admirably plus is stabilized and weather-sealed, to boot! I've been adding more lenses to my kit, but the 12-60mm will continue to get regular use.<br /><br />- The menu system is easy to use once you familiarize yourself with it. I'd played with the Sony menus at my local Best Buy and found them confusing.<br /><br />- Battery life is average. I went on a camping trip last weekend. I thought using just the optical viewfinder would make a huge difference but alas, two days, 300+ snaps and a few videos later, the battery died on me. I've subsequently purchased a couple back ups.<br /><br />- The in-body image stabilization is a game-changer. Although only stabilized Panasonic lenses will offer me DUAL stabilization capabilities, you won't have to be afraid of picking up non-stabilized Olympus lenses. (I have my heart set on the 40-150mm F2.8!)<br /><br />IN CONCLUSION: there's so much more that I could say, but I'll wrap up talking about the value proposition of this camera. For a thousand bucks, where else can you find:<br />- a quality weather-sealed and stabilized camera body<br />- a VERY GOOD stabilized/weather-sealed 12-60mm kit lens<br />- a fully-articulating screen<br />- great quality stills and awesome 4K video-shooting capability?<br /><br />If you want to spend more for marginal upgrades in any particular area of photography, then spend more. But if $1K is your budget, you've just found your new camera. This thing is awesome.","Excellent camera. Seems to be one of the better value options on the market at the time.

Among the several Panasonic bodies I've owned, my favorite had become the G7 (the predecessor to the G85) for its light weight, compactness, handling and grip, the many controls and their placement, and its customization options available. With some feature-upgrades (added IBIS, improved EVF, a metal front-plate, better mechanical shutter [although I generally use the electronic shutters in my cameras, since they are quiet and shake-free], etc.), and with an interesting lens included, I bought a G85 with the 12-60mm lens as a kit. Upon receipt, I checked for an early stabilization defect some people had noted with video - but my sample did not appear to have this problem (it's since been addressed with a firmware update for early G85 samples).<br /><br />I soon returned the kit for a refund for two reasons: with the G85, a very light G7 had become almost as heavy as my GH4 (which I recently sold, since I no longer shot much video with it, and I preferred the much lighter G7 for stills); and this second sample of the 12-60mm lens, which was much improved over the first sample of this lens that I tried, it was still not up to the image-quality of alternative lenses that I already owned - and it still had some evident  asymmetrical image-softness problems.<br /><br />I've taken about 200,000 photographs in the last few years with this MFT gear, and I prefer light and compact cameras and lenses for most of what I do with it - and as a result, the very noticeably increased weight of the G85 was an issue for me that overwhelmed its functional advantages over the G7. The G85 is a very nice camera, with many excellent features - but it was not a good replacement for my G7s for me...<br /><br />--DR","Coming from a full frame Canon and the Sony a6300, I can report that I'm not missing much in terms of image quality. The Panasonic G85 delivers enough still IQ, excellent ergonomics, and superb video quality that I haven't looked back.<br /><br />The IBIS works amazingly well with both pictures and videos. The camera and lenses are light and small compared to FF and APSC cameras, increasing the odds of me actually carrying my camera around.<br /><br />If you've been thinking about switching to the M43 systems, give the G85 a try. It has everything one would want for everyday use.<br /><br />The only downside to this camera is the smallish 16mp sensor. While 16mp is more than most people will need, it was one of my reasons for not wanting to switch to M43 cameras. Having used it, it's not a big deal to me, but it might be to you.<br /><br />Anyway, Amazon has a great return policy if you find the G85 isn't for you.","One of the best value camera out there. Hands down.<br />For current users, I highly suggest to do the following: Go to menu --> Setup --> beep (page 2) --> Turn off the beep volume and E shutter volume<br />This was a huge annoyance for me at first, and I was relieved to find it in the settings.<br />Battery saving options are also within the page 2 of setup such as Live View Mode (30fps), Monitor Luminance, and Economy.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Stills quality is very nice and sharp, even from the 12-60mm kit lens. Image quality and bokeh are stunning when paired with the 25mm f1.7. The dual IS is really good for stills and even more amazing in video. Two custom settings within the dial are really helpful for saving your own shooting modes. I personally save Shutter-priority video moves to these in different recording formats (i.e. 4k30fps, FHD60fps). There are also plenty of fn buttons to customize. There are also color profiles to shoot in that may be customized. I find that the \"Natural\" profile to be the most pleasing in video. There is also Cine-D for those wanting a flatter look or for grading.<br />Weather sealed - Not much to say here other than, great!<br />Coming from a Nikon APSC camera, I am amazed at how light and robust the mirrorless form factor is. There is little fatigue in carrying it in your hands all day. The LCD screen that allows a full swivel is really neat for selfies/vlogging.<br />Finally... the video. Most buyers are probably here b/c of this and yes... it does not disappoint. The detail is amazing! BUT, the real shocker is the image stabilization. When paired w/ dual IS and E-stabilization turned on, the video is practically gliding (especially @ wider angles - 12mm). I am not joking. Walking with the camera is buttery smooth, no jittery videos.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's only up to 16MP stills, though I still find the image quality to be very good even when an image has been cropped in edits.<br />I found that the image is a bit noisy at higher iso (6400 and above), though this is not really a bother to me. I find that it gives it a natural feel to lowlight shots. You can always dial it down with a bit of NR in Lightroom and other software.<br />A slight crop to the 4k video recording.<br />This was not a con for me, but others may think it. There's a lot to learn w/in the settings of this camera. Take the time to read the advanced handbook. Experiment!<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend this. If you are on the fence, JUMP OVER!","( NOTE: IBIS noise was eliminated with the latest 1.2 update that Panasonic recently released on its website)  Lightweight and small, low profile, reasonable price of camera and lenses, good in lowlight conditions (with Dual IS), built-in bright EVF and OLED screen, versatile stills and video camera, customizable and easy user interface for a small mirrorless, weather sealed.This is the only camera I've found that will endlessly record 4k video at room temperature without overheating. Picture quality is superb, the G85 will shoot 4K as long as your battery and storage allow, in my opinion, this camera is better than the GH4 for video.Awesome camera for family! Super intelligent mode, a lot of scenarios and effect for more professional look. And also fully manual mode for more professional job","I best dollar for dollar of all of the M43 cameras.  I love mine.","I like it.","Amazing camera.  Easy to use, great quality images, incredible features.  The focus stacking feature is the best.  Can't believe the flower close-ups I've been able to take with it.  For someone who doesn't require subject tracking this is probably the best camera out there.","This camera is amazing with one - potentially deal-breaking - flaw.<br /><br />I own the G7 and have used it extensively to film my YouTube videos and to take pictures for my Instagram account and of my family.<br /><br />I upgraded because I was excited about the built in IBIS. I make some videos on the go and like to take as little gear as possible. A gimble wasn't something I liked using.<br /><br />The IBIS is incredible. Both for videos and photo. I can hold up the camera and do vlog style recording and it looks smooth.<br /><br />It's faster than the G7 too. And with weather sealing. This was enough for me to upgrade. If I was only going to create videos on a tripod in my studio, then I wouldn't have upgraded.<br /><br />The one flaw is this: the IBIS is noisy. It wouldn't be a big problem if it wasn't picked up by the internal speakers. Yes, people will say that you should use an external mic. But there are times when you don't have it on your camera and you want to record something cute that your kid says at dinner. The humming in the background doesn't add to it.<br /><br />If that won't be a problem for you, then get this camera, especially, if you're primarily focusing on video.<br /><br />If you IBIS isn't important, consider the G7. It's an absolute steal.<br /><br />*********<br /><br />I use the camera with the 12-35 mm and also the 42.5mm (both Panasonic). I mainly use the former but use the prime lens for portraits.<br /><br />For my vlog-style videos, I use the portrait style setting (search for the super tone setting) and then add color grading in FCPX. Some complain about continuous auto focus for video, but if you select one area focus and set it to AFS/AFC (change it to continuous in the menu), then it works great.<br /><br />Check out: \"Learn English by the pool To Fluency\" on YouTube to see an example of one of my videos.<br /><br />I also film in HD (not 4K) as the file sizes are MASSIVE. Sometimes, I do something in 4K, but don't feel the need right now.<br /><br />Leave a comment below if you have further questions.","This was a pretty good camera although I think it got more hype than was deserved. Still it took very good pictures.","super good!","I've had a few Canon cameras over the years, most entry to mid grade, and I was excited to move to mirror less 4/3. I was well aware of all the potential issues and shortcomings of micro 4/3.<br /><br />After shooting around 8 hours of video and 120 GB of images...I have to say, I'm very very impressed. This is hands down the best camera I've ever owned. The features and quality for the price are unmatched. This is the only camera I've found that will endlessly record 4k video at room temperature without overheating. You can charge it while recording too which is awesome. I have been using a SanDisk 128 GB u3 card and it has preformed well. I did have an issue with a regular class 10 SD card not being fast enough to record 4k for more than a few seconds.","I didn't buy the G85 because it was all that much smaller than my trusty Canon 80D - it is smaller but not that much - I bought it for the image stabilization that was advertised. In my experience Image Stabilization is more important than the lens in getting sharp photos.<br /><br />The G85 offers four levels of IS; none, lens IS only, in-body or IBIS only for non-stabilized lenses, and Dual IS which combines both together for Panasonic lenses that support it. Repeat - for those lenses that support it. The G85 has a recent upgrade, Dual IBIS 2, which uses 5 axes in body and 2 in lens.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Panasonic does not make it easy to know which of their lenses work with Dual IBIS 2. At the same time I bought the body I paid $1000 for a Panasonic 12-35mm f2.8 which turns out NOT to be fully compatible with Dual IBIS 2. I only discovered this after some testing and a very close study of the Panasonic support website. Panasonic has just (Jan 2017) announced a version II of the lens, to be available in March, which will be fully compatible. Quite annoying to find this out AFTER I bought the lens.<br /><br />In general the instructional materials provided by Panasonic are shall we sasy not as well done as the hardware. There are two manuals, the Basic Manual of 85 pages, and the Advanced Manual of 338 pages (download only). Unfortunately these are not written in good English and are both complex and confusing. Another example: I needed to go online and update the firmware; this was tedious and involved instructions such as \"the green bar increases the level by the process.\"<br /><br />As a result the whole learning curve is painful. However, I discovered a helpful set of two dozen short instructional videos on the Panasonic Canada website. There is nothing comparable on the US website, and Amazon will not let me link directly to the Canadian address here, but you will have no trouble finding it by Googling.<br /><br />Summary: State of the art hardware, compromised by poor supporting materials.","It is  a perfect camera for traveling :)","The Panasonic G85 is an excellent upgrade to my G7 which I have enjoyed using this past year. The grip and feel of the camera while holding and viewing through the viewfinder is just about perfect. The addition of. weather sealing and supplying a weather sealed kit lens makes using the camera in all settings a real possibility. Now I can use the camera in all conditions, something that was very risky with the G7. It's best to keep the camera dry and not test the weather resistance so I use a disposable shower cap to cover the camera when it rains. This works great. I did get to test it during a trip to one of the cruise ports visited last week. when cloudy skies turned to a heavy downpour. Camera and lens survived nicely..<br /><br />One of the first things I did when I received the camera was to upgrade the camera bios to version 1.1 which solves the Panning issues the initial users first reported. Panning now has no issues. Everything works very smoothly. The update process takes about 5 minutes and is very easy to do..<br /><br />The In body stabilization in the G85 is a huge upgrade that makes sharper images and much steadier video possible. It makes a bigger difference when doing video because any movement of the camera makes watching video very unpleasant. The video when holding the camera and panning slowly almost makes it look like the camera was on a tripod. It was also much easier to take sharp images at a slower shutter speeds.  I especially enjoyed using prime lenses that have no stabilization.at very slow shutter speed in very low light. This was not possible with the G7 or other Panasonic camera like the GH4 that has no in body stabilization. I have lots of Olympus lenses that have no builtin stabilization. The camera will stabilize all these lens and it works very well but a little less than what Olympus offers on it's camera bodies. .In my informal testing I think the in body stabilization is about 3 stops (more or less). Regardless it's a significant improvement that will improve everyone's images and video.<br /><br />The EVF magnification has been improved a little with the .74 magnification so images appear slightly larger and more information can be viewed in the viewfinder. The viewfinder is very good.and I enjoy using it but it does stutter when using 4K and the image viewed looks granular becaus ethe updating probably isn't fast enough. I use the EVF almost exclusively and enjoy composing the image and viewing the result without having to take my eye off the camera..<br /><br />The shutter mechanism has been significantly improved mainly to avoid shutter shock but it sounds much quieter and pleasant to listen to compared to the loud shutter sound on the G7 and GH2/GH3/Gh4 cameras. The electronic shutter is of course silent and I enjoy using that but don't use it when shooting moving subjects to avoid the rolling shutter phenomenon. I know some users use the electronic shutter all the time and it does go to 1/16,000 of a second which is amazing.<br /><br />Image quality is quite good with the 12-60 kit lens in good light. I was very impressed with the video with the lens too. In lower light I switched to the 12-35 F2.8 zoom which produced excellent results. I tested the G85 against my OMDEM1 with a 12-40 F2.8 zoom and results were similar which was surprising. Both cameras have excellent gri[ps but the OMD has better image stabilization which did show better in video clip.<br /><br />The camera uses the same battery and charger found on the G7, Fz200/FZ300/FZ1000, so if you have those cameras you are set with extra batteries. I found the camera quite efficient and rarely had to change the battery once or twice during a day trip. One nice new feature is the SD card slot has been moved to the side away from the battery holder. This is a great improvement as it allows you to change cards if needed even if the camera is placed on a tripod. This is a convenience found on most better cameras and you will really appreciate using it rather than fiddling with the battery slot..<br /><br />I haven't tried all of the fantastic features of the camera, but everything tried has worked well. The menu system is similar to the G7 and other Panasonic cameras and very easy to set and switch settings. I love using the touchscreen which works great not only for viewing your images and videos but to set the focus, change settings and to add additional settings. I love using the super control panel where you can change any setting. The two dials on the top of the camera work smoothly and the buttons on the back work well but are recessed enough not to be pressed accidentally.<br /><br />I haven't begun to test all the fantastic new features that Panasonic has added to the camera so that will come in time. Overall I am very pleased with the camera and can highly recommend this camera as an upgrade to the G7 or to anyone wanting a quality camera with a dSLR feel without the size and weight of a dSLR. The kit lens which adds just $100 to the price is well worth the price and works well enough to start new users for a while. I expected to immediately switch to primes or my better zooms but was impressed enough with the results to continue using it. I have many Olympus lenses as well as Panasonic lenses and they all work well with the camera..","I'm not a pro but not a rank amateur either. Once was a 35 mm user in my youth, but have used the range of point-and-shoots (Lumix) to DSLRs (Nikon) lugging some great but heavy hardware around. I wanted a lighter-weight, quieter camera and the Lumix 4/3 line was attractive. Once I saw the Oct. 31 release for the G85 I put in an order for it with the kit lens, which seemed like a great deal to me. Super happy with the camera, mostly have shot stills but happy with the video I've shot so far too. Took it on a trip to Hawai'i and was pleased with its performance, specially in some serious rain on the Big Island. The G85's smaller size, lighter weight, quietness and easy intuitive UI are all top-notch. The only gripe -- and it's why I gave this review four stars instead of five -- is that the battery gets drained pretty quickly. But I bought two extra batteries along with a couple of extra lenses and I'm pretty much ready for anything. I can't help but be seduced by the retro, \"rangefinder\" look of some other micro 4/3rds cameras and I might still fall for another Lumix in the future but this is my main camera for now!","I mostly use this for video and I'm very impressed with this camera. I want to shoot and then minimize editing as much as possible so that's why I like the G85 so much. The 4k video quality with standard un-graded settings is better than the GH4 I replaced this with.  The clarity and color is better with the standard settings and I don't really have time to get lost in post processing.  I also compared this to the Sony RX10iii and its 4k video quality was just a tiny bit less detailed but the overall look was better with the G85. Also the menu settings are so much easier with the g85 over the Sony.  Also the button placement is much more intuitive with the G85. Auto focus seems about the same but I mainly use manual for video to make sure it stays in focus.  Especially because I'm shooting in a controlled environment.  I'll miss the wide focus range but not by that much and I can always buy more lenses with the G85.  Another thing is the G85 seems like it has a touch less crop shooting in 4k so I can get a slightly larger angle.  That bothers me with all cameras when shooting 4k and I wish I could get the 35mm equivalent of 24mm out of it instead of more like 28mm in 4k. Also it seems that the  Pictures were much better with the G85.  It seems that whenever I put the RX10iii in auto focus to try to get some kid pics for fun 1 out of 5 pics came out correctly where almost every pic comes out correctly with the G85.  For me the f3.5 does a good job but it sure does look better with the f2.8 12-35 lens. I thought my untrained eye might not pick that up but it did. Everything looks better even when comparing f3.5 vs. f3.5.  It's pricey so it might not be for everyone.  I also tried the Sony a6300 and it was an amazing camera but it overheated very quickly weather I pulled the monitor away from the body or not.  So there was no way I could keep it and that's a major deal breaker.  The G85 can get warm but never get's so hot that it over heats and shuts down when shooting for extended periods in 4k.  I shot for about 4-5 hours in a row shootiing 5-8 minute vids at a quick turn around and it never shut down. It got a little warmer than the GH4 and Sony RX10iii but never malfunctioned so all is well.<br /><br />The one issue I have with the G85 is I wish there was a 4k 30mbps instead of just 4k 100mbps.  I shot around 40 5-8 minute videos and it was something like 122Gb.  I had to use compression software to keep it which is a bit anoyying.  Love the water/dust resistance and that is what kept me from keeping the G7.  It also feels like a better made camera than the G7 with a more intuitive layout too.<br /><br />If you are like me, an intermediate, who needs a good camera with 4k for work but doesn't want to go too deep into the post processing world it's hard to find a better camera.","I am an enthusiast and new to the micro 4/3 system. This is my own experience with using my new camera as compared to my previous and existing gear. I think it is unfair to rate it one star because of panning issues in video, besides a firmware update has already been released. I skipped the kit lens and got the Panasonic 12-35mm f2.8 instead. I did not encounter any such problems for this lens when IBIS or dual IS is on after the firmware update. My review is more on using this camera for stills.<br /><br />Primary reasons why I bought the G85:<br /><br />Lightweight and small, low profile, reasonable price of camera and lenses, good in lowlight conditions (with Dual IS), built-in bright EVF and LCD screen, versatile stills and video camera, customizable and easy user interface for a small mirrorless, weather sealed (water and dust resistant).<br /><br />Camera features I really like:<br /><br />• 4K Photo<br />• Silent mode<br />• Time-lapse option on the dial<br />• 11 customizable function butttons<br />• Customizable in-camera highlight and shadow. Cuts down work in post processing.<br />• Post focus and built-in Focus Stacking (JPEG only). I would prefer Focus Stacking output as RAW. However, with the highlight  shadow feature setting I can pull up highlights and shadows in-camera and the JPEG result is still good. Hopefully RAW output will be included in the future.<br /><br />Compared with the Sony a6000 (that I sold):<br /><br />Focusing - The hybrid (w/ phase detect) autofocus with the a6000 is just phenomenal (now more impressive with the new a6500) but I don't shoot sports often. Contrast detect for the G85 is sufficient to track pets, kids, indoor sports (I prefer using the Panasonic 35-100mm f2.8). It can also track faster movement like birds in flight quite well. Short buffer on the a6000 compared to the G85.<br /><br />Battery- Battery life is almost the same. Non-OEM batteries (Wasabi) used with the a6000 causes the camera to freeze. I had no problems with Wasabi batteries on the G85. Mirrorless cameras are notorious for sucking a lot of juice from your battery therefore you need to have at least two spare ones.<br /><br />Powering On - Instantaneous on the G85. I can take pictures soon as I turn on the switch. Similar to my FF DSLR. With the a6000 it takes 2 to 3 secs to start up. Good luck if you use cheap batteries. I missed a lot of shots because of it.<br /><br />Video - Of course, the G85 has an advantage with 4K does heats up quickly and so far after using it a couple or more times, it does not overheat. Sony a6000 starts heating up after taking video for more than 15 mins. It still plagues the a6300 and hopefully not the a6500. Diagonal panning issues and jitters have been resolved after the firmware update. Humming sound of the IBIS is still present with the G85. The humming can be picked up by the built in mic in a quiet environment. You need an external mic if you do need to record video in such conditions.<br /><br />User interface - Love the DSLR like controls on the G85. Two dials (front and back) is very convenient in manual mode. Sony a6000 does not have intuitive controls like the G85. The G85 has 11 customizable function buttons (6 physical, 5 on the LCD screen), pressing a function button (physical) for 2 sec. will let you directly assign a function, not to mention the Q. MENU possibilities. What I like about this camera is that I can retain back button focusing when in PASM modes, and half pressed shutter focusing in auto mode which is not possible with my DSLR. The touchscreen and touch focusing feature with G85 is convenient and very responsive. Careful not to touch your nose on the screen though as it can move your focus point. Among some settings that are easily accessible when pressing the Exposure Compensation button (F1 by default) are Exposure Bracketing and Flash Compensation. Still looking for other cool stuff that this camera has in store.<br /><br />IBIS and Dual IS - With Dual IS I can shoot even at 1/10th of sec. to even 1 sec. handheld and still get sharp images especially when paired with the 12-35mm f2.8 lens. The a6500 will have IBIS  and dual IS on Sony lenses that has OSS.<br /><br />Lenses - Reasonable prices for micro 4/3 lenses and other choices from Olympus, Rokinon or Sigma. Sony aps-c has limited zoom lenses and they are larger than micro 4/3. No Sony 24-70 f2.8 (35mm equivalent) for aps-c. Best I ever used is the Zeiss 16-70mm f4.0. Sony FF e-mount lenses are expensive. Main reason why I left Sony. If they have more lenses for aps-c and make it smaller and affordable, I may come back... maybe.<br /><br />Image Quality - Love the IQ of photos taken with the a6000 but the IQ of the G85 is equally good despite having a smaller sensor. Just do not crop too much.<br /><br />WiFi and Mobile App - The best I have ever used so far. It never prematurely disconnects, very capable controls and app performance is nearly flawless. Good job software team. The only caveat, as with all the other camera brand apps is that they only download images in JPEG. I only shoot in RAW and download my images to my iPad Pro using a card reader since I mostly edit my photos with Adobe Lightroom Mobile and later syncing and tweaking some of it on my PC. This is how rate my experience with the WiFi apps:<br />Very Good - Panasonic App w/ G85, Could have been Excellent if it downloads RAW.<br />Good - Sony PlayMemories w/ Sony a6000. Good controls but it disconnects. WiFi turned on quickly drains the battery.<br />Acceptable - Canon Camera Connect w/ Canon G7X Mark II (sold)<br />Mediocre - Nikon WMU w/ my D610 w/ wifi adapter, D5500 (sold). Limited controls and disconnects. Since I am an Apple user I cannot attest to how SnapBridge performs but still the app should work well with all platforms. As if Nikons software department is almost non-existent.<br /><br />Why did I choose the G85 over the 1 inch sensor Canon G7X Mark II(sold)?<br />The G7X Mark II is an excellent camera because of its portability and performance in low light, but sometimes I needed a viewfinder. It is difficult to see anything on the LCD screen on a sunny day. Could not wait for the Nikon DL 18-50mm. Still no built in viewfinder and is priced at almost $1000. Sony RX 100 IV or V? Maybe. But soon as I got hold of this camera I just couldn't let go.<br /><br />Why did I choose the G85 over the Sony a6500?<br />Price. The a6500 is $1500 . If I was thinking of getting the GH5, which is in the same price point, I would consider the a6500. However, native Sony aps-c E-mount lens selection is still limited.<br /><br />Compared to my Nikon D610:<br /><br />Image Quality - Full frame wins in this department, hands down. But if you only post photos in social media or don't print that often in large sizes then why need a full frame DSLR at all.<br /><br />Weight and portability - I would rather equally enjoy taking photos and traveling without lugging heavy equipment. I would not drag my Nikon 80-200 f2.8D on overseas trips and would rather carry a Lumix 35-100mm f2.8 lens or Lumix 45-150mm lens. For most of my travels, I will just bring my Nikon 20mm f1.8G on my Nikon D610 for landscapes and Panasonic Lumix G85 cam and lenses (12-35mm f2.8, 35-100 f2.8 or the lighter and affordable 45-150mm f4.0-5.6) for walk-around.<br /><br />Price - Micro 4/3 wins, camera and lenses! The pro grade Panasonic Lumix 35-100mm f2.8 lens with IS for the G85 is selling for $897 at this time of writing vs the expensive Nikon 70-200 f2.8G VRII for $2200+.<br /><br />User Interface - Going from AF-S to AF-C on the D610 is a nuisance sometimes. Back button focusing resolves this issue and having it permanently on AF-C. Most DSLR users know this. The G85 however has a dedicated switch for AFS, AFC and MF. Awesome. I can take advantage of the 9 fps on AF-S or MF with focus peaking at any time. D610 has no wifi and touchscreen.<br /><br />Build quality -  My D610 looks and feels sturdier, however as light as it is, the build quality of the Panasonic G85 does not dissappoint.<br /><br />Suffice to say, I am happy with my new camera system. I am a Micro 4/3 convert.<br /><br />UPDATE: Purchased the Lumix 45-150mm, 35-100mm f2.8 and included sample photos. Night and long exposure shots of Union Square shot using Lumix 12-35 f2.8. Close up of xmas tree and skating rink shot at 1/15th, f2.8, ISO 800 handheld. Bird photos using the Lumix 35-100mm f2.8 at 100mm.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: In video mode, microjitters are still apparent when using the long end of the Lumix 35-100mm f2.8, even after the firmware update. You may not want to shoot handheld at 100mm. No problems with the Lumix 12-35mm f2.8 which normally what I use for video anyway. Still a stellar performer.","Okay, everyone can finally calm down about the IBIS issues. If your G85 is still running firmware version 1.0, head to Panasonic’s website and download & install the firmware update that addresses the wonky IBIS.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: it works perfectly. DUAL I.S. II is beautiful.<br /><br />Panasonic, thank you for listening and for rolling out this update so quickly! Customer service at its very best! This camera is incredible.","I got this intending to use the video a lot for work reasons to shoot video of people giving presentations (to help them improve their presentation skills) but also use it for some stills photography. I'm super impressed with both so far, and I disagree profoundly with the \"unusable video\" reviews previously posted. In my hands (or tripod) the image stabilization seems to result in a light background \"shush\"-type noise which is certainly audible, especially indoors in a silent room, if you are listening for it, but tends to disappear into background noise outdoors. This is consistent with what I expected from DPReview's review. So, on the whole, this doesn't seem to be a major issue. Since others are reporting that it is, I'm guessing there may be some variation camera to camera or lens to lens. (Update: I see from later reviews that they have released a firmware update resolving the issue.)<br /><br />In any case, I'm really loving the camera so far after about a week. I've been with a point-n-shoot type camera since ~2008, and before that had a film SLR. Entering the micro Four Thirds space for the first time, it's like experiencing photography as I've never seen it before. Autofocus is ridiculously fast and generally extremely accurate (my first time playing with it, a low flying plane zipped overhead and I flipped the camera up and it caught it immediately, in time for me to rattle off four or five nice crisp shots of the plane with great detail). Autofocus also seems quite capable at tracking moving subjects, which is nice. The kit lens seems excellent and has a nice range of focal lengths. I also like the interesting variety of capabilities offered by 4K burst mode -- the ability to shoot at very high frame rates to capture \"just the right\" moment, or to merge shots of different focal points, etc. On the whole I am super impressed with just about everything about it so far.  Though, keep in mind my perspective -- while I'm a relatively experienced photographer, my experience with SLR-like cameras is 10+ years old so I can't compare this with other current cameras.<br /><br />It WILL, however, take me a while to really learn how to use some of the features of the camera and get the most out of it. There's just such a depth of menus/settings and such a range of features that it's not always easy to find what you want or to even know if the feature you're looking for is offered (though all that I've looked for so far are).<br /><br />One note: The box came just with the basic manual, but the Panasonic website actually offers two different manuals, one being the basic one and one being an \"advanced features\" one or something similar.<br /><br />Anyway, I think this is a great entry into the Micro Four Thirds space and I'm super impressed with the camera so far.<br /><br />UPDATE: After another week, I'm loving it even more. I picked up another lens in addition to the kit lens (the 45-150 Mega OIS zoom) and have really been enjoying using it to shoot. The size/weight of the camera works so well with this lens -- I can shoot nice stable video with the OIS, even zoomed to the 300mm equivalent, and getting high quality stills at that zoom also works great (i.e. shooting soccer). I used to use a point-n-shoot with a 25x superzoom for this, but without the OIS that this has, it was so jumpy at that zoom that it was extremely hard to even keep players in frame when zoomed far. The OIS makes such a big difference.<br /><br />I do have two very small gripes with the camera. One is that the \"video is on\" indicator is not quite as conspicuous as I would like, and the \"begin shooting video\" button is recessed and not clicky. These two combined make it sometimes non-obvious when you've started recording. I've had moments where I thought I'd recorded something and then stopped recording, but instead only turned the video on when I thought I'd stopped (because the first time I failed to depress the button enough) so I got a nice long video of my feet.<br /><br />The 4K features on the camera also add a bunch of nifty aspects aside from just video. 4K burst mode is super cool, where you shoot a bunch of 4K frames (8 megapixel) at a very high frame rate and then can select one or more to use as high quality 8 megapixel stills. It works great if you're shooting something which is moving or changing very quickly and you want to get just the right moment.","I have been thinking of buying the OMD EM1 Mark 2.  I am an enthusiast and take pictures of my family and for travel. Many years ago, I sold my Canon bodies/lenses to get into Micro 4/3’s. Like many, my investment in film lenses led me to Canon bodies in the electronic world. However, it became clear to me that the electronic world offered new opportunities as the technology improved.  It looked like Micro 4/3 sensors would be the sweet spot for most photography in this new world. My first 4/3’s camera was a Panasonic.  I loved it.<br /><br />Later I upgraded to the OMD EM5 Mark 2 for the better-quality sensor, better in-body stabilization system, and small size.  The technology was advancing.<br /><br />Update: I have used the camera for some time now.  There have been two firmware updates to improve stabilization and stabilization \"hum\" and I am using the Panasonic 100-400 with dual IS.  I cannot say enough about how good this camera is, and at the price, it is a great value. I have added some pictures using the zoom lens and 12-60 lens for illustration.<br /><br />Time passed, looking for my next upgrade.  It is not picture quality driving me, but 4K video and, frankly handling.  Don’t like the size of the existing OMD camera for handling.  Just a bit too small physically.<br /><br />Out comes the OMD EM1 Mark 2 for body only almost $2,000, but looks like better handling.  Very professional features, especially fast focus and rapid fire.  Also, higher pixel stills is interesting technology. But What. $2,000.<br /><br />I found the G85.  I bought it despite the stability issue.  I do not have a noise issue in video. Price is right.  I am using it and it meets my needs. (I expect a firmware update, but camera is entirely usable for photography, which is my focus, pun intended.  I have also made some video’s and they are passable.  There is a little “jump” at the start of the pan, but for me, I could survive. I expect that Panasonic will fix this, as the GX85 does not exhibit this behavior.)<br /><br />Handling is much better with a larger size handle for holding and taking pictures.  Still light and better than dslr’s for everyday picture taking.  This is the next generation of Micro 4/3’s.  Frankly, I like the on-off switches on the right side, and this does it. (You can set up the dual switch on EM2 2 to be the on-off switch but too expensive to buy just for this.)<br /><br />Picture quality is superb. Not the reason to upgrade or switch brands.<br /><br />I had forgotten, but I much prefer the Panasonic UI to the Olympus.  I much prefer the Panasonic smartphone apps, in addition.<br /><br />Micro 4/3’s is really where the action is, as there is strong and vibrant competition.  I wish all markets were like this. I expect features to improve and prices to fall.","I will update this review once Panasonic issues a firmware update for the IBIS.  As it's stands it's a great all around camera but I bought it for video and as it is it's not very usable with its panning issue.  Panasonic is working on a fix. If that was not an issue I would give this camera a 5. It is really good at everything and is a good value with the kit lens.  The auto focus is decent and the only other thing I would say that could still use some improvement. That is compared to my Canon 70D, though which is one of the best at AF in video.  Come on Panasonic, we are waiting patiently for a fix!","Firmware update V1.1 fixes issue! Works perfectly smooth similar to GX85. If you were considering purchasing this camera it produces some beautiful stabilization! I'd definetly recommend it! and for the slight humming sound reported, I'd recommend using an external mic or recorder anyway for any documentary or production filming. But otherwise it's a beautiful camera! I love it! The size, the sharpness in 4K,  the easy menu, Weather sealing, Cinelike D and Cinelike V.<br />I recommend this camera with the kit lens.","[[VIDEOID:be3ca88a0c26f5b6839f92e7bcf2244e]] So I've used this camera for a few days now. I've tested its 5 axis dual image stabilization and as others have already reported, stabilization and smoothing on side and diagonal movements are pretty s***ty.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if that was the expected behaviour or not, but given that other camera's dual IS like GX85 is working fine for sideway movements, G85 should not have this issue.<br /><br />Here is the video test footage I uploaded to my YouTube channel:<br />[...]<br />[...]<br /><br />I will post more in-depth review of image stabilization feature.<br /><br />For the record, Panasonic has announced/admitted that G85 has issues with dual I.S. So at least that's good to know (that means, IS for sideways and diagonal movements are to be improved).<br /><br />Other than that, G85 was exactly what I wanted, and this is a pretty cool camera that has:<br />-4k video<br />-autofocus during video<br />-light<br />-IS<br />-180 degree flip screen<br />-external mic jack<br />-very sharp photo/video even if the 12-60m kit lens is used<br />-awesome features like 4K live cropping (panning and zooming) => my video using 4K live cropping [...]<br />-solid gripping<br />-rugged metal body<br /><br />I'm pretty satisfied with the kit lens as well (except low light situation). Will buy Leica 15mm F1.8 for extra blurriness and bokeh!","This is a good \"all round\" camera. Excellent price for what you get.  High quality stills and impressive video.  Very light and easy to handle.<br /><br />If you shoot video there is one annoying issue.  The new in-body stabilization system (IBIS) makes it easy to shoot handheld stills and video.  Unfortunately the IBIS (which can not be disabled) makes a low humming noise that is picked up by the in-camera mic when shooting video. This can be addressed by purchasing and using an external microphone such as a Rode VideoMicro (the camera has an mic jack to plug it in). Not fatal but something to be aware of.","In a previous review I gave this camera a low rating because of the image stabilization issues I encountered after the unboxing and during my initial uses.  Panasonic heard the complaints and responded quickly with a fix.  Ok.  I've now downloaded the firmware update and taken the new and improved IS for a test spin.  Now it works wonderfully and I can justify the high rating that this awesome camera deserves.  Pictures are tac sharp...video is now clean, sharp and smooth, and the features offered are more in line with much more expensive full frame cameras.  Now the G85 Rocks and I believe you will be happy and impressed if you purchase one!"]}]
