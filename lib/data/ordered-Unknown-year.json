[{"name":"Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera","amazon_reviews":["Fun!","Daughter loves it.","Omg! In love with this mini cámara!!!!!! LOVE IT!","My daughter just turned 12, and I decided to buy her a Polaroid.  She loves it!  It came NIB.  Very easy to use, the film is not expensive. She is going to start a scrapbook.  This was her favorite present.  It was also a hit with all her friends.  I also purchased with one of the 11 piece sets that have frames and filters, case, etc...I am buying another one for her brother because he loved it too.  I recommend to anyone looking for an excellent gift for tweens.  It is nice to hold photos, frame them and give them away instead of having everything digitized.","Absolutely obsessed!!!! I love it so much!!!  Can't wait to take this to Paris this summer!  Very easy to use I just got it today and I already know how to use it. The pictures came out great it's not heavy at all, I also bought the case and it perfectly matches the camera. This is a fantastic camera!","They really have to drop the price on their paper to make this worth it, camera is good, a little bit on the darker side","I love this little thing! So easy to use!","My daughter loves this camera! great price!","Bought this for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it.","Daughter loved it","Fun!","Daughter loves it.","Omg!

She has not put it down since she's gotten it.","authentic item! bought over a year ago and still works great! love it!!","I recieved this for christmas as a gift and overall its okay. Make sure you know how to control and work with different exposures or else you could get crappy pics. Im still learning how to make it work and i think over time i will grow to love it. Flash is a little too bright. Cute gift for teens, more toyish and playful than anything. You can buy cool accessories for it and dress it up which is cool. I cant complain too much for the low price. Overall its cute and fun if you know what youre doing.","Love it! So nice to have pictures to hold instead of just sitting in my phone, SD card, or computer.","love this! it is exactly as pictured and arrived on time and was not damaged! very happy!","it is a gift she will love it.","My daughter loves this camera!  great price!","Good buy","awesome","I love this little camera the photos are so fun and it's a nice addition when traveling. Only thing is the lighting can be tricky even with the indicator but I probably just need more practice.","Cool and convenient","I was hesitant buying a camera off of Amazon but I decided to give it a shot anyways and I am so glad I did! This was a gift for my sister and she LOVES it! The camera came at the perfect time in wonderful condition. The instructions are in another language but it's a pretty easy camera to figure out","Seems durable and creates fantastic pictures. Instructions are in Japanese so I would recommend finding a youtube video that teaches you how to use it in English instead. My girlfriend flipped when she saw it, a fantastic purchase.","My Daughter loves this item and being 13, it's great to have instant pics you can give out and keep as memories.  She enjoys it just as much as I did my polaroid when I was her age.  Great little and fun camera!","As advertised","Love all my order \"","My daughter received this as a birthday gift, and LOVES it!! Seriously, it is one of her favorite gifts. Its not like the polaroid cameras from my day, but it is still a fun little gadget. The pictures it takes are on the smaller side, and the overall quality of picture are really really good when taken outside or even inside with great lighting. When taken inside without ample light it  is so-so quality. I mean it is clear, but darker. Still, it is a fun gadget, and it is nostalgic having one in the house again. Also, who doesn't love a cute little tiny polaroid picture? It is really adorable.","Easy to use and a lot of fun.  It's always fun to have instant pictures at a gathering. Quality what you expect from Fujifilm. Great fun and a great gift for picture lovers.","Bought this for my (then) 4 year old this past Christmas, and she LOVES it. She loves being able to keep the photos and hang them. This year we had a \"photo booth\" at her birthday party, and this camera was perfect for that. Huge hit! I'll be getting another one for my boyfriend's daughter's 7th birthday!!","Bought this for my girlfriend and it works perfectly!","Perfect! Simple and easy to use.","This is the second one I have bought and my children love them and they work very well","Bought as a Christmas gift.  My daughter loves it","Amazing!","Love love loveeeee this camera!!","Nieces love it!","I am in love with this camera! Film is expensive but it's totally worth it.","Retro, but great. My daughter loved it.","Item as described. Works great and my sister loves using it.","Fun. Instant. You'll be glad you got it.","I bought this for my son, but decided to give him the Polaroid snap due to the smaller size of the camera. I decided to keep this camera for my 6 year old and find I like it much better than the snap. These are the reasons why:<br />1. The picture on the Snap comes out of the side of the camera where your hand holds the camera and it takes a while for the picture to come out (It prints the picture on the paper like using photo paper in your computer). It creates a long wait between taking pictures.<br />2. The Mini 8 prints on paper just like the old Polaroid cameras (It even has the white border) and pops out within seconds, the picture develops over time which the kids find exciting (of course we shook it for old time's sake).","Love those mini pictures!","My daughter love it","My daughter LOVES this camera. It works better than I expected. The film is a bit expensive but we stock up when we find it on sale. Works best in natural light but she has had success with most pictures and has wasted very little film on pictures that don't develop or or too dark. I would defiantly buy this again.","Purchased it for my daughter's 10th birthday. It looks really cute but the quality of the pictures are not very good.","It's adorable!!!","The camera turned out great. We had to mess with the settings to get the best picture, but it's like that with any camera. For the price we got it at, it was a steal!","Great product perfect for party and photo booths.","Loved it","This is one great little camera","I don't usually order from Amazon often so I was scared of being ripped off and not getting a legit camera, but to my surprise it was actually better then expected! I love the color, I already took two photos and I can't wait to take it on vacation with me !","Loved this. The camera is great and I love how it came with batteries and was all set to go! (Film doesn't come with order)","Excellent instant camera! Just wish the photos were larger.","Looks awesome! Came at perfect time","My kids love this camera! Wish it wa a little smaller and/or lighter.","Love it ","Camera came in great condition and I absolutely love it!!! Defiantly recommend purchasing it!","Order this as an early birthday gift for my friend and she's been saying she loves the yellow one so I had to get her one since all my friends had one and I didn't want her to feel left out! :)","Purchased for my mom --she loves it.","Love my fujifilm camera ! It's so much fun to instantly have a cute picture with you and share them !","No words, Should have purchased a poet, To describe how perfect this camera is. It's a little hard to use at first, But once you do, It's well worth it.","I purchased this camera for my sister two months ago for her 15th birthday. She loved it! She has already taken several photos and it works great. It doesn't feel cheap or made poorly.","I love this camera. It's a little tricky to use with the different lighting settings but I took some pictures at my engagement photo shoot and they have such a romantic feel. Definitely worth the money.","Works great. Easy to use. Point click print. Feels like a throw back Polaroid camera.","My granddaughter was so happy to get this for her birthday!!","Pretty good! The pictures are crisp and clean, and the camera is easy to use. Only giving it 4 stars because when you're pointing the camera at something and then take the picture, the polaroid comes out as a picture that isn't centered, but when I'm taking the picture it is centered.","I love it!","Daughter in law loved it for mas","these are cheap. get the warranty.","I bought this for my Girlfriend's birthday. She loves it and has used it frequently. The different filters can take some getting used to, but the camera is a great buy for the price. All in all this is a great throwback and a fantastic gift. My Girlfriend took it a step further and started a bulletin board for her pictures","Works perfectly! Pictures are small and cute and very nice~","Quite the hit for Christmas.","Looks awesome! For my granddaughters birthday this week! She will love it!","Very timely delivery. Excellent packaging to prevent any damage during shipment. Excellent product. Met expectations as advertised.","So glad I could find these cameras in white! Fast shipping and great product!","This camera is great for parties and road trips with friends! Everyone is so used to having digital photos not that they forget how much fun it is to have a little physical memento to take with them. There are multiple settings on the camera which you can adjust to any lighting. There is a sensor in the camera and a little light that suggests a setting for you which is very helpful. I tried to overthink it and change the settings, but realized it's easier to just trust the camera's sensor for taking the best photos. There is a high-key setting as well that is fun for taking pictures that are lit a little hotter. It's fun - gives it a kind of vintage feel and helps accentuate whatever is going on in the picture.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the view finder is kind of clunky. When holding it up to your eye it's a little awkward against your face, not like taking a picture with a digital camera. You can still get a sense of what you are taking a picture of though and it doesn't affect the picture, so all in all not that big of a deal. Still a lot of fun to use and is a party hit!","My camera doesn't seem to work outdoors only indoors, photos come out very bright. But still, I love it","I love this camera!!!","Great camera. Super practical, easy to use, and awesome way to capture memories.<br />Could be for kids, but I'd say it's best for preteens, teens, and adults simply because the film is a little more on the expensive side and kids tend to get carried away taking photos of everything in sight.<br />Each photo has a vintage look to it, and I really like that it gives you a setting recommendation depending on your lighting situation. Variety of colors is fun, but I decided on black for a sleek and simple look. I do recommend buying a case/bag for the camera since it can fall and suffer damages if you decide to take it out with you on trips or any other situation. It would help in keeping it safe, and would allow for an even easier use as well. I've had mine for over a year, and it's suffered a couple damages because of some drops, but it's still working great and I continue to use it.","Got this for my friend for her birthday, she loves it! The pictures come out great.","Excellent!!!","Awesome! I'm one happy customer","I bought this camera to do a photo booth for my daughter's bridal shower!  The instant pictures were so much fun!","I am having fun with this camera. Next week I am taking it on a missions trip, with my church to do crafts with children. Fun and easy to use!","great","Awesome camera!  Love the pastel colors.  Only drawback is the cost of the film.  It's a great novelty item.","Product of excellent quality, service exactly as expected, simply amazing and highly recommended!","Great camera!","Very good and good price","My mom loves her new camera!","My teenage daughter and her friends love this camera!","Vintage touch for this little camera that I simply adore!","Love it","takes great pictures, love the light sensor that tells you which setting to use, & very fun!<br />  makes me feel like a kid again, having instant Polaroids are too fun, no SIM card: only a one time photo, but that's the whole point  ;)","I love this camera, I just wish the poloroids weren't so small. Easy to use!","Love it!","excellent deal. Thanks","Purchased this for my adult daughter. She loves it!","Great camera to give to a kid as a present. Got two of these for both of my kids, matched with a case, album, and film cartridges. Great way to teach them not to shoot aimlessly and wastefully, but to think and \"see\" moments to capture -- before they move on to digital camera phones and start annoying everyone with their photos on social media feeds.","Great Item. Thanks","Excellent","LOVED THIS!!","Came in the right color and on time. ","Wonderful camera! Daughter loves it!!","Bought entire outfit (camera, case and film) as a gift for my niece.  She loves it.","Got this as a present for my sister and she loves it! The pictures are pretty small, but overall good quality and really cool!","This item is delicious and fun but smells hilarious. I laugh when I bring it close to my nostrils. But great item! It brings me joy fur many various reasons that i could get into at great lengths but choose not to at this time due to a small amount of water in my sock. I love this item! It brings me a great time with my family and friends  laugh! I have so much gratitude. This item performs like no other! I have looked at it a thousand times! I feel amazing about it!","Love this camera! The shots look great, but be aware- the film is small.","The white one does get dirty fast but that's only because i don't have the case and i'm a mess. Other than that it is very small and handy! great if you want to put a picture on the back of a clear case!","Purchased for one of our daughters birthday, she loved it!","A very fun camera! Simple to use as well.","Cute retro camera. Wish it had a timer. Other than that it's awesome.","<3 it! :D","It came early and it's perfect","For some reason this didn't come with ANY film so my daughter received a nice, new present for her birthday and was disappointed that she couldn't use it.  It would be nice to see some sort of starter film package included, for those of us that make the assumption that it comes with everything you need to take basic pictures.","Good product","So fun and I still have mine from the 1980's  Love the updated film with borders available now. Kids in our 7th and 8th grade Community Class at church love using it on special occasions.","Oh mah gawd, I love it so much. It's super simple to use and really fun. It may be a little pricy but hey, it's worth it in my opinion.","Very happy","Takes good pictures, my 15 yr old Granddaughter  loves it","My daughter loves this camera. The photos are decent for what they are and it's a lot of fun to have prints right away. She also got an accessory bundle which had a lot of neat extras and embellishments.","The camera works fine but the little piece that holds the batteries in came bent on the inside and so it doesn't close to keep the batteries in. This camera wasn't exactly cheap so I'm dissapointed that it came with a defective part.","I love it","My granddaughter loves it now her 8year old sister also wants one. Easy to use","My 7 year old loves it.","love it","Great little camera.  Purchased it for my daughters birthday.  She loves it.","I love this tiny camera! I picked it up as a present for my sister, and she loves it. Definitely a great alternative for keeping a \"keep-sake\" memory in your hands. It take a bit of time to figure out the settings, but instructions are included.","Granddaughter loved getting this for Christmas. Love the pastel color. Picture quality is better than I expected.","Bought it for nostalgia reason just like the old days. It is very lightweight. The film works really well, good quality.","Love it . The perfect gift for a 10 year old. Simple and super orignal color shown in picture. Nice camera  and takes great  pictures and the setting are awsome and super easy to use!","Love this camera, just received it, taking it on a trip - will publish more later :)","Definitely very cute and fun but takes very low quality pictures. It's not a one-time purchase either, at my local Walmart, it costs $20 for 20 pictures. Many of them just turn out dark.","I wanted this camera so badly and when I finally got the money to get it, I jumped right on the opportunity. I can talk all day about the camera and how it looks, but for those of you just getting the camera, I am going to tell you how to use it. The instructions aren't exactly clear so I am going to tell you how to work it so you don't end up with blanks.<br /><br />You need to take the picture 2-8 feet away from what you are pointing at or else it wont work at all. Also, where the little light is on your camera, click to it unless you are indoors. If you are inside I suggest using the High Key option rather than the house button. Trust your camera and the senses because you'll take great pictures every time.","easy transaction - great product - thank you","Got this for my first born she loves it! ??","This camera takes really good pictures. We are pleased with the purchase.","I admit I just got this camera today but I LOVE IT. It is super cute and takes super cute photos. Before buying I suggest you watch reviews and tutorials on how it works to see if you like it. When you get it read the instructions its important because the film that goes with it contains alkine and there are specific things you can do to prevent it from getting everywhere. I really love this camera as does my family. I am a teen and I lobe faking photos so I can look back on them and I can take pictures for others to keep. I suggest buying it but like I said it all depends on who you are.","Works great! The settings for the lighting is a little dull. But worth the price ! Good buy??","Make sure to follow the instructions and set it up on the correct lighting.  Otherwise photos come out too dark or light.","perfect gift!","The camera came in excellent conditions ! very happy with my purchase!","Great product and very easy to use it. It is exactly what i expected.","Perfect time!","Really cool camera.<br />Functions well, makes some pretty hip looking pictures too.<br /><br />The only problem comes when you start figuring out light requirements. It really doesnt work outside when its too bright or too dark. I could only get it to work around sunset or when I was really deep in the shade. For inside party events though, you cant beat it for the price. We used this at my sisters wedding, just leaving it around and letting people take some pics. Ended up with some pretty funny, cute results.","Our daughter loves this camera. She can capture special moments independently.","Love it","I've always loved photography and I ordered this, it's amazing and has no malfunctions!","Awesome color, works great.","So fun to play with polaroids again! MY 10 and 7 yr olds both love these!","I am so incredibly happy with this little guy!! Best purchase I've ever made!! I'm the type who stores all her pictures in her phone, forgets to back them up and ends up losing them all. Not anymore!!! Hehe :)","Came just as expected!","Takes great pictures. We used this at our wedding and everyone loved it.","Love my mini cam!","love it!!!!!","I seriously love this thing and so do my kids!!!! Everyone is always so impressed when I whip this bad boy out!","My niece loved it","really fun to play with. takes great photos, not professional, but super fun to play with.","Should of paid the extra twenty dollars for the wide version. Takes great photos, but they are small.","just what my daughter wanted","Camera came fast and it's perfect. Glad to see the brought Polaroid back","Pictures aren't really that great of quality.","My grand girls were very pleased with this camera.","Great camera!","The kids love this. It's a fun retro thing. Lighting needs to be just right for quality pictures.","I love this camera","I absolutely love it. Can't wait to start making photo albums. Nothing like physical pictures around the house","100% Responsable","Strap not included as stated on my box.","A great birthday gift.  so fun!","Love! SO much fun! I bought this for my sister-in-law to be wedding shower and we had so much fun with all the pictures that we brought it out for the bachelorette night too!","I haven't figured out how to get the exposure just right. Wish I could zoom and adjust the aperture manually but for the cost, it's perfect.","We have been stunned by the quality of the pictures this camera produces. It has been so much fun!","I bought this for my wedding to go in a DIY photobooth. Although the film is a little expensive, it's a very cute way to entertain guests and create some shared momentos.","The camera registers the light around you to make sure your photo comes out clear but sometimes it registers it wrong and it's washed out. Still trying to figure that out, but seriously, my wife loves it.","Fantastic little camera for dummy photographers (my 12-year old daughter for instance)","My daughter just turned 7 and she loves this camera!!! Even my almost 18 year old wants the camera. They all think the old pictures are the greatest. I got the activity pack that goes with it so she can decorate, frame and write in the picture. It came with a case, little photo album and straps for the case. This is the best gift! The film is expensive and only has, I think 20 pictures in each case so in this day of technology and instant gratification...teach the kids to pick and choose what pictures they want to take;)!!!","Worked as intended","I got this camera for my sister for Christmas. She has a very nice digital camera but I thought she would enjoy having the option of instant pictures. It was bigger than expected and the pictures are about the size of a credit card. The film is a bit expensive but if you look online like I did you can often find them discounted or get 2 packs for pretty cheap. If you are looking for a fun camera with instant pictures than this is a great buy.","love it, fun little camera","Bought this for a bridal shower and got a good deal for it as well. This camera was a hit! There were a few pictures that did not develop well but I think that was due to the different settings.","Shipment was quick and product is great. I would recommend this product.","Love it ! Works perfectly fine and the pictures come out great !","In love!","excellent! it works well! i love it","My daughter loves it","Wish you could save the photos to an SD card or something,  but other than that is great.","I love this thing.The images arent the best quality but its still nice to get images immediately .We make an album no matter where we go & its awesome to have on top of my pro images","Got this for my 13-year old and she really enjoys using it. The film can be expensive so we made sure to have a discussion first about not wasting the film and doing her best to really capture something meaningful to her in the photos she takes. Its a lot of fun and now we have polaroids all over the refrigerator. Plus it's helped her hone in on her photography skills, unlike a cell phone, that lets you keep taking the same selfy over and over because you can just delete and retake. I think this a better option for a kid or adult into a fun photography and that wants something tangible that you can display in an instant.","love this!! the settings really do work (outdoor, indoor, etc). Easy to use/easy to load the film. Pictures print really fast. There are also straps that you can buy to add to the camera if you'd like. it's a hit at parties, too! film isn't too expensive.","It's so fun. It's lime being a kid again.","arrived safe and sound.","Wonderful gift, she loved it","We bought this for our wedding coming up but of course played around with it already. It brings back the old school camera feel and the picture quality is decent for instant printing. My biggest complaint really is how small the pictures it prints are. They are smaller than the polaroids were back in the day.<br />There are different settings for different lighting and such, sometimes they seemed to make a difference but sometimes I could not tell a difference, I am not a camera or picture quality expert by any means though.<br />Fun to have, will be a great thing to have for our guest wedding book this summer!","Fun, retro camera.  Depending on the quality of the film (sometimes it's a crapshoot, as a lot can affect the film quality, and you won't know what you're going to get until you take the picture), takes a very cool, decent picture.  A lot of negative reviews for the camera have to do with picture quality- it's not a multi-megapixel camera, people!  All it all, very happy with my purchase.","AMAZING. There are alot of instructions so instead of reading all of that iw ould just watch a video showing you how to use it.","I bought this instant camera as a gift for my niece.  She loves it!","It was bought for a gift and I haven't given it yet so will let you know later.  Appears to be exactly what I expected.","just as expected, great gift for my granddaughter age 11","I'm so in love with this camera!  And everyone that sees it gets such a kick out of it!","Absolutely love this little thing, I just wish the film wasn't so damn expensive.","Cute camera!! My daughter loved it!! Just what she wanted!!","Love it everything I was expecting it to be thanks","Amazing camera. Still works everything is in good shape. I got the black one. Comes with batteries and everything that it says it come with. Love his camera to death, but I just wish the film wasn't so expensive  But over all great camera love it!!!!","So cute and simple. Takes little effort to make it work, and photos come out so cute and retro.","Very easy and self-explanatory to set up and take photos with. I've never had a bad quality photo, and this is a ton of fun for parties!","seriously love this camera! it came exactly how it was supposed to","Neat instant camera!","Neat, works as advertised.","My daughter loves it. Use it often.","Great product.","Fun little camera!","Daughter loves it.","I got this camera as a gift. The photos come out great! Does not fit in most purses, so not always convenient to bring :(","It was a gift for my teenage sister, she took a few pictures as soon as she opened it and the pictures came out amazing. They are perfect for scrap booking. She loved it!","As expected an amazing product","The film is very expensive.  The photographs come out fairly dark and they are so tiny that it is difficult to see a person's features.  A teenager may like this camera for close-ups that can be printed immediately, but I won't be using it often.","The really enjoy their  cameras","Great!","very good! fast delivery ! thank you !!","perfect love it would buy again","i got this for my friends birthday, her birthday was yesterday and she loved it!","I'm loving it ","The Fujifilm was great!!","I love my camera. It works really well indoors. Sometimes i have pictures that came out terrible while outdoors, but i also failed to mess with settings. Will do that next time (: I am in love with this purchase and everyone I meet when I take it out with me loves it as well.<br /><br />Wish i knew how to poat pics...","I love this. It came right on time and captures lots of memories!","Love this camera! Got it in black. I get to use it on my spring break. Just have to get use to taking pictures in different lightings. I've experimented indoors and outdoors with different lightings. If its cloudy outdoors with no blue sky, the pictures will turn out bad and overexposed even with the right settings. And be careful with where the sun is, if its too bright it will wash out the picture.","Arrived on time and as described","I love this thing. It does take some practice to get use to how to take a picture so it doesn't come out too dark but it's the coolest thing!","I received this camera as a birthday gift, and is probably the best gift I have ever received. This camera is absolutely perfect for taking with you and the instant pictures are so nice. The camera has multiple light settings so you can get it just right, and a really quick shutter speed so I've never had anything blur. I definitely recommend this.","Cool little polaroid camera that kids like nowadays. The film features seems gimmicky but neat for kids.","Bought as part of my boyfriends Christmas present and he loves it!!","Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Super easy to use and the pics come out great!!!","Awesome clear pictures. My sister loved this gift!! Wish it came with film though.","Such a good deal, definitely buy from here","Haven't had this much fun taking spontaneous pictures since my first Polarioid!","Works great my girlfriend uses it all the time.","gift for my grand-daughter and she loves it !","Love it","Favorite camera!","My daughter loves it. Perfect for her scrapbooking.","Perfect gift for a 16 year old girl who has everything.","Works well. The first one I ordered for my granddaughter malfunction, had to send it back. The replacement works perfectly. My granddaughter loves it. Somehow she loves the fact that she can see the photo instantly.","Great camera, very easy to use.","I love Fujifilm! Such a fun way to make memories :)","got for neighbor and she loves it","100% OK","bought as a gift and daughter loves it.  would buy again","Not my first idea for a gift but daughter wanted one. She loves it. Works like it should.","Granddaughter loves it","It works great! Just what needed","I love it","We got this for my daughter's seventh birthday so she could document important events as we move very often due to a military lifestyle.  She absolutely loved it and carried it in her little carrying case that we bought separately  all day on her birthday. It's simple to use, and very appropriate for ages six and up-- as long as the child is responsible enough not to damage the item.  She used it again last night for a daddy daughter date.  I only wish the film was more affordable because she goes through it very quickly .","This camera is a must have, especially if you miss having the old school Polaroid camera. It sure brings back memories and takes great pics.","Gave this as a gift! It was perfect! Works great, everything was in mint condition!","The Pics can be fun but you should really save for the instax wide. Tiny credit sized pics aren't that great, I'd rather have a larger image.","We bought this camera just for \"fun.\" Don't expect quality pictures. I wish the pictures were bigger","Great product!","good quatility,though not good for outdoor shooting, but a quite good memory maker","Love my camera","Great camera, however, I ordered the raspberry color and it is a reddish/orange","Got mine. Works great. Only problem is that mine seemed used. As you can tell by the box itself and the stains.","I adore this little camera. I was a huge fan of Polaroid back in the day. This just sense to me. The film is more expensive than I'd like but the camera is reasonable. The only thing I don't like is the light setting. It doesn't work all that well which results in some poorly lit pictures and wasted film. That my only complaint.","Awesome addition to my camera's.","dose an ok job","Daughter loves it. The pictures are small, but it is a toy camera. Teaches the budding photographer to get really close!","My sister loves this camera. It gives such vintage yet clear pictures. An amazing buy.","Works wonderfully!<br />I've used it so much, and have my wall decorated in all these photos from the past year.","pros: adorable soft pink camera that pops out instant polaroid's<br /><br />cons:it was BIGGER than expected and its annoying to take a picture when the button Is near the camera lenses<br />it is super dark too-VERY hard to take pictures with this indoors- its difficult to take pictures with even slight sunlight showing on the subject- the contrast is off the charts- also its impossible to adjust the settings because it does an auto adjustment.","gf loves this camera and taking it out with friends. you can not go wrong getting this for a lady","Love the camera, wish the view finder was easier to use. Makes it take a little longer to get the right positioning for the photo.","GOT THIS FOR MY GF AND ITS BEEN A REALLY AMAZING GIFT. SHE LOVES IT","Great little camera. Takes nice little Polaroid pictures.","great camera everything I expected","I bought this 2 years ago and it worked perfectly for a wile but then it started acting weird. I have to wait 10 minutes in between pictures or it does not work. I tried changing the batteries and that helped a little but I am still having problems. Also the camera takes a while to switch to the setting you want so cheek to make sure that the light has moved to the right setting before you take the picture.","I was disappointed when I ordered this as a gift and it did not come with film. When ordering, the camera clearly shows film included.","My absolutely 100% real Canadian fiance adores her new Mini 8 camera. The color of the camera reflecting the living conditions of the poor snowed in caribou neighbors.","Best camera ever invented lol I absolutely love it","I love everything about this camera. I just wish that the film that goes with it didn't cost so much.","Love this instax mini!! Take it every where with me. It's super portable and fun to use. Not super accurate with imagery but it's artistic and easy to use.","Very nice product","Nice instamatic","I love it! I received my item so fast","My daughter loved this camera. However, after only a few uses, the front pieces fell off and she is no longer able to use it. Sadly, we had just invested in $30 of new film.","Awesome instant camera","Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Came on time and is working as expected.","ok!","My daughter loves it","nice","Fun","I am so in love with the Instant Camera. The camera looks so cute and I could save all my travel experience with it. It is just amazing.","this camera was surprisingly good. The photos are adorable and the color is amazing. Would recommend this to everyone I know.","Love this camera","10/10","This was a huge hit at our party it works great best price out there","Film isnt cheap and the picture quality is pretty bad. If you are going for that old fassion polaroid look on your pictures its good though. A lot of accessories are available as well.","I originally bought this camera else where (Not on Amazon) and it had printing issues. (Urban Outfitters) Then, I decided to order it on Amazon. The camera works PERFECTLY! It's a great gift idea and perfect for vacations! Just remember, It comes with batteries BUT you have to buy the film separately! (Good deal on Amazon.. I found it on here for 20 films for 12 bucks. Walmart has it for 20 films for 20 bucks.)  Make sure you insert the film the correct way!  Also, don't take out the film until you completed using it. Or else the film is no good. Just some pointers!","A great present","Ugh so awesome and cute. Works perfectly, came so quickly. Love this! Looks exactly like the picture too.","Easy to use.","To be quite honest I was every Skeptical about this item I thought it was going to be a very shirt item, but I was completely wrong. It's a really good product I recommend I had my doubts but it was totally worth it","SIMPLE neat sturdy It does what it says it does. Even a fool cannot error...I hope! I have a digital Nikon and this little guy is for the wife.","I bought this for my daughter. I just don't get it...they are selling 50 year old technology to kids that don't remember it. Oh well she loves it.","fun","Great gift!","great price.","Pics are SO small! You'll go through one package of films just to get the distance and lighting right. anything outside must be in the shade or the pic whites out. No even close to the old school insta!","I love this camera! It was a great purchase","This is a gift for my niece n she loves this pretty pink camera. It's not too big or heavy for her 10 yrs old hands to carry around and very easy to use. Very happy with this order.","Veryyyy happy with this product.","Great camera. My daughter likes to keep pictures in her room as mementos and this camera has helped her do just that. The pics have good color quality as well. It's not too heavy but I recommend you get the carrier for it. Overall, we're happy with it so far!","It is a Polaroid.... Pictures are not even 1/2 the size of the old school ones but the kids thinks they are great.","Ok","I bought this for my mother-in-law because she doesn't have many photos of her grandchildren as most people just keep them on their phones rather than print them. She loves it! Now she snapping photos and posting them on the fridge.","Very unique little camera that is low maintenance and comes with easy and straight forward instructions. Highly recommend!","So far it takes nice pics.","I had the yellow one before, until I forgot it in the subway (or may have been stolen), I was very happy with snapping the moments. I got the white one this time and gave 4 stars due to its lens, but I am still loving it. It's retro. But there are several things people should be careful of with this little machine:<br />1. Buy a strong case, and use with caution. Never drop, or hit it somewhere (or at least try not to) since the lens is loose and it may break easily.<br />2. Remember to adjust the lighting through lens and never take photos when the light is not good.<br />3. When taking selfies, make sure the lighting is good, otherwise the photos are generally not good and the one closer to the camera is generally the whitest person ever even if he is actually not white or pale at all.<br />4. Both versions of vertical-landscape photos are nice. But I prefer vertical ones if you plan to have a photo wall.<br />5. Make sure you're not touching on the photo while it is coming out otherwise it distorts the photo.","Quality of photos excellent. Very happy with the camera. Perfect for my teenage daughter. She loves it.","This is so awesome! I love the nostalgia!","at first,, the pictures were coming out dark. turns out it was the bad lighting in my room. Was I started taking picture outside , then I started seeing better results. I'm still confused on how to use the proper settings.","Perfect little camera for instant photos. bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she's loving it.  It has held up well so far.","LOVE LOVE LOVE <3 The picture didn't lie about its color, and it's really easy to use.","We've had so much fun with this camera. Used it for the first time with props at a birthday party. Everyone loved it","Brand new and perfect condition. Comes with batteries.","so cute fast delivery kb","Used this during my daughter's wedding reception for the photo booth. The guest LOVED it! It is easy to operate and the pictures are very clear.","My daughter loves it, pictures came out great. Reminds me of my Polaroid when I was younger.","My Girlfriend Love it!!<br />Pretty, Compact, love the vintage style pics!!<br /><br />Be ready!! This is Not a Hi-end camera Megapixel! dont expect to grab Hi resolution steel photos.. its not the Camera Purpose.. its Just to have fun and take really cool vintage snaps moments!","This little camera is fun! However, while the camera seems cheap, the \"film/paper\" is ridiculously expensive.","In LOVE with this camera!!! I've had my eye on this for quite awhile and I finally decided to order it. I'm so sorry that I didn't sooner! I'm a 90's baby, so I'm more than a little excited to take Polaroid photos of my children. They love it, they think it's the coolest thing ever! They get SO excited watching the photo pop out and waiting for it to develop. Definitely worth every penny. If you don't have one, buy one! You will NOT regret it!","Bought this for my 4 year old daughter. And she LOVES IT!","my 13 year old loves it","Takes great photos.","Got this camera for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it. She has used it to take many pictures of her friends. The pictures are decent quality and the camera seems very sturdy.","These are AWESOME!!! Bought two and love them.","Just what the granddaughter wanted. Too new to fully judge, but appears to be what it says.","nice,","super fast shipping camera arrived in new condition in the box. the camera works awesome. i ordered the raspberry camera and the raspberry case. the camera has an orange hue to it where as the case is raspberry colored. they do not match in color but we will live with it","This little camera is awesome!!! My kids and I are loving it and love the vintage looking photos that come out :) it's very user friendly and compact enough to fit in my purse. Just an FYI--the camera does come with batteries but no film, and at $13.00+ for a pack of film, it's not very practical for everyday use, but it makes those special snapshots even better!","Love this and love how fun it is to take pictures.","Perfect Christmas present.","Niece loved her gift!","Everything she wanted.","Amazing quality","This is a super cute camera and perfect for making special memories. There's a beauty in taking photos and not knowing if they'll be perfect or not. In this day and age photography is taken for granted, so this camera is perfect for those retro hipsters who want a reminder that all our memories should be cherished.","Cute camera and the camera and film is less expensive if bought on Amazon","I absolutely love this camera. It is exactly like the product description and it works great and takes awesome pictures!","This camera is so beautiful...I love black And this reminds my of old pictures. I love how the pics come out.","Christmas present; my daughter loved it.","Awesom deal","Love!!!! It is such a cute little camara to remember memories with.","Bulky, and sometimes exposure is way off. You'll look ghost like, but over all, great product. Fast ON TIME shipping","My fiancé bought it for me so I am rating it for him. I like it a lot. Very cute blue and trendy! Would definitely buy another one !","Great product and service!","Love it gave it to my son","Bought as s gift. Very pretty color.","great gift for kids","Color is exactly what is on the pictures! works perfectly!","Love the color and works great!","LOVE THIS! And so does everyone that I've shown it off to. I've now had three other people purchase one just from me using it. One of those being me for a birthday present. It is so fun, easy to use, kid friendly and a must have. It makes parties and events that much more fun. They even make fun photo albums now to store the photos you take. The photo sizes are perfect, similar to a photo booth. I maybe would have liked the bigger version to match more of a square size but I am ok with the quality of photo this gives you. You can adjust the camera based on your location to get better quality images. The only down-fall, is the size of the viewfinder. It is very difficult to easily see the image you are photographing so you kind of have to guess.","My daughter loves is.  May fade in popularity quickly but fun right now.","Super excited to use it.","Love it","Love this so much!","Got this as a gift and it was very appreciated. Works perfectly fine also.","Works perfect","Fabulous!","My daughter loves her new camera","Bought this as a Christmas present for my little sister and she loves it! So cute","We've had the most fun with this little camera, which on Amazon is more than 50% less!  Love all the colors!","Love this camera.  I use it as a party camera.  It makes great photos to use as memory cards from special events.  The right size photo to put in your wallet and the instant development makes it perfect.  Most photos these days are just in my phone and never get developed...lose the phone, lose all your photos, too.  I love having it develop right then and there!","Awesome","so fun","This camera is amazing.I love it the pictures come out really nice and in high quality.I love that there is a variety of colors to choose from.I have the pink one and it's a really pretty pastel color.The settings help you so that the picture can come out really nice and clear.I would totally recommend this camera to anyone.It's a nice way to bring back the old ways to take pictures into the present.Love this camera so much!!","Lovely color :3","Gift for my kid.  She says it's awesome.  5 stars based on that.","color looks dull in person but still cute. I would call it more melon.","Fun camera. It definitely does not take great pictures but it's super fun and easy to use. I got one for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas and she had a great time taking photos all day. The only big downside is the price of film for the camera : (","LOVE IT!!! I got the camera bundle ( case + twin pack)  and I am so pleased and happy about it.  I did the two day shipping and the camers and case came on time but the film took about a week  but i didnt mind the wait.  Still love it and will buy more film here again.  Great price","my 15 loves this camera!!!","Excellent product and just as described!","Very nice! Arrived faster than expected.","Love this little camera.  Bought it for my son's birthday party.  We had a backdrop for pictures and everyone loved taking home a photo with them with the birthday boy.","A+ Great Product and Service!","recomendable","It's the perfect size, easy to load even easier to use. You will not be disappointed at all!","Bought this for my daughter for her 8th birthday because she was constantly stealing my phone to take pictures. She absolutely LOVED IT! She went through so much film and loved that the pictures came out instantly! Still trying to adjust the settings for some better photos but overall, it's a great gift!","This is a super fun instant camera, it makes taking pictures fun again. In this digital world, pictures are very cheap to take and I snap pictures without having to think about the meaning of the picture or composition. With this instant camera, I have to choose my shots wisely and I'm able to share the picture with people right away. This camera is fairly easy to use, the included instructions are clear and straight to the point. The film is costly, but it can be bought at 50 cents each on sale. This camera is great for parties and hangouts because it allows instant access to the pictures. This camera has a built in flash that works pretty well, the pictures end up looking pretty good even in dim lighting. There are different lighting options that can be easily selected with an easy twist of a knob.","love taking pictures with my polaroid camera! glad i purchased!","Just as described","It so cool! Great for taking pictures with my friends to hang in my room!","Super cute and I think it will work fine. I want it for decor and occasional use so it should work out OK and the color is to die for!","Birthday present for 12 year old.  She loves it and it's easy to work","It's so cute!","Gift for daughter, she loves it!","A very nice throw back.  Back in the 70s my grandfather had his poloroid camera with the \"Instamatic\" flim.  This is such a great novelty for parties and such.  Well worth the price.","PERFECT!  WE LOVE!","cute, fun, and a retro throwback!","Absolutely love this camera. So fun to use. Pictures come out cute on the mini film","My 5 yr old daughter loves it","Really cute, but raspberry comes out more like a bright red than a berry color.","Love this little camera! My daughter is 11 years old and loves taking pics!!","my daughter loves it","Good but the files<br />Is outrageously overpriced","Highly recommended","Love this camera!","I am in love with my new camera! It took a little getting used to, but it is amazing. It's nice to be able to take a picture and instantly have it to put in a scrapbook.","Love my camera use it on a lot of vacations! At times the settings on the camera for the lighting can get confusing just something to get use to!","Great gift idea for tweens and teens. It's fun!","Nice gift for my daughter but definitely not a toy.  The pictures don't come out very clear, don't even bother trying at night.  We took it with us to Disney World in January and my daughter hasn't picked it up since because the quality was so disappointing.  More of a novelty I think since everyone has phones and taking those pictures are way easier and more satisfying outcome."," LOVE IT","My granddaughter enjoyed her birthday gift","Awesome products and got it in the bundle wit the film and case, love it!","Love the idea of it. Only thing to look out for is that the picture that is developed is not centered if you're looking/aiming through the view finder.","very cute","Cool gadget! Great for baby book pics and to make cards!","work great!!!!","Love this camera! It's so fun and nostalgic. I put these cute little snapshots up around my house. My 4 year old daughter has fun with it too.","This was gifted to me a while back before I went on a trip and as excited as I was to use it, none of the pictures were coming out good, I tried using different settings and I tried storing the pictures in the dark but no matter what I did they always came out either underexposed or overexposed. The only time it works is when I take pictures indoors in optimal lighting, but I want to be able to take pictures outside too!","My daugther love ir.  Excellent deal!!","Our daughter asked for this for her bday, she was very pleased! These are a hot item and Amazon price was much less than retail stores.","Came perfectly and quickly! Takes great pictures. Just what I was looking for.","Fun novelty. It's expensive for what you get and the film is expensive too. The thrill of it wears off quickly. Overall though it is a fun camera to have and was in top of the wish list.","Christmas gift for my grandaughter--she loves taking pics & having them to put up in her room.  No problems with the camera.","Works great ! Wish the picture itself were bigger.","Works good","Great for homemade photo booths.  Great hit!!","Purchased for 4yr old daughter so can learn to take pictures and have her own little picture collection. Loves it!","I LOVE this so much!! It's so pretty and easy to use and takes great pictures, I would definitely reccomend and I can't wait to use it more and take exotic pictures. It also didn't take long to get here only 2 days which is great!","This is so cute!","It is amazing it is so much fun to take pics with and it is a great way to save memories, i love the vintage feeling i have always wanted a vintage camera.. Instead this one is more modern and more design. It was at a very good price, $60 bucks for a camera like this is already a good price.. The ones u get at your usual store like walmart, target, staples or more get to the price of $98 bucks which is practically $100 i deffinately recommend this for everyone. It is easy to hold and it is easy to use, the mat texture and colour is also one of my favourite parts of the camera.. Its so smooth and at the same time stylish.","ITS SO CUTE I LOVE IT! ??","Every other picture turns out. I do not know if it is the film or the camera both baught on Amazon.","This is the cutest camera I have ever owned.  It's just the right size for your purse and it takes great pictures.  I am considering to purchase more to give as thank you gifts","Loved it!","Got this as a gift for my son.  He loves it and can't wait to go to the zoo to take animal pictures : )","So absolutely adorable! Mine worked perfectly and the color is so pretty and fun.","GREAT PRODUCT","The shots are okay, when you actually capture one. Sometimes when I take a shot it'll give me a blank but shadowy image.","Gift for my daughter, she loved it!","This thing is awesome. It looks like a toy, but works really well. In a world where everyone has to share everything on Facebook with all of their \"friends\", this is definitely a way to preserve your memories for those closest to you. I always found that the \"worst\" pictures tell the best story and this sticks true to that belief. The quality of the photos can range and you can't just delete a bad photo to only show the good ones. I plan to use this on special occasions since you only eat a few photos. Each picture I've taken so far looks like it was taken in the early 90s which is both awesome and strange at the same time. You'll really enjoy this.","Perfect for teens","Love it so much, absolutely perfect","Excellent item. My daughter loves it","Bought it for GF and she likes it but I guess you get what you pay for","I love it","When I bought it, it said it would come with film. It didn't.","Used this for a make shift photo booth and it worked awesome! Everyone loved it!","The camera arrived in excellent conditions, i really recommend it!!!","great","Just what I wanted to be able to have a little memories on the go","All ok","Gave it as a gift and my sister liked it. Wish it had better instructions. Film for this camera is expensive.","I LOVE this camera. I have already printed 3 different photos from this camera. I do love that there are different settings but sadly they don't seem to work. I can't seem to get the settings to switch from the original. With that being said, even though the settings don't switch the camera still works in all settings. I have taken pictures outside, inside, in the light, and in the dark. All of them came out clearly with no issues. So even though the settings don't move it's still a wonderful camera. I would highly recommend this item for anyone who is looking to save some cute memories","Fun gift! Easy to operate. Decent photos in an instant.","So cute! Feels like it could suffer a few drops without being affected... but not more than 4.","This was a gift, she loved the color!","my daughter is 8 and this is so easy for her to use","I want to love this product, but after a couple months, it started acting up and the settings would switch back and forth causing some photos to be washed out. Perhaps I got a faulty item, but for the price, I think still worth the purchase.","Works great, kids love it...","MY GIRLFRIEND LOVED IT","good","Great gift for a 6-year-old girl. She is having a blast with that. Easy to manipulate, good pictures, fun accessories.","Bought for my 8 year old. She loves it. It is very cute and simple to use.","awesome item. my girlfriend loved it.","I love it!! No problem noted. It's white and working well. I hope it lasts long","love it","Love the color of this camera. It is just as it appears. The camera itself is very easy to use for my 9 year old. She loves this thing. The picture quality isn't the best indoors but she has so much fun using it.","i'm in love","This the best camera if you loved the old polaroid camera and like to have your photo right away! Nice wallet size, too.","great camara as described","Great idea for young kids","9yo daughter loves it. My 6yo son wishes she shared it! Should have came with more film (10, i think).<br />The pictures have an old school look - I'm 35, and it's like pictures you find from when you were 5.","I love this camera, it is so vintage and adorable. I also have the old polaroids but use this one most often because it's cheaper to use considering the price of film. Some things I notice that helps me get the most out of this camera is:<br />1. Point the camera toward the area you're capturing, then look at the dial that's lit up, recommending the lighting to use. Sometimes it's different than when you first turn it on. I have wasted several pictures because of this. Give it time to adjust.<br />2. If it says sunset, but you know it's pretty dark, use the next dial of light. I've also wasted several pictures because of this.<br />3. It can't capture a lot of space, but backing up a lot doesn't always make the picture turn out better.<br /><br />Overall, I love this camera and carry it everywhere with me. I got the white one. I purchased a case which makes it easier to take everywhere with me, however, I don't recommend purchasing white. Even if you have a case. It is so hard to keep clean and seems to stain kind of easy. I often find myself cleaning it even though I never take the case off.","Easy to use, works great. The film for photos were just smaller than I thought they would be.","granddaughter loves it","My 8 yr old daughter loves this! Color looked a little different in person though","Got this for my family and myself to use. My mom wanted instant pictures instead of having to pick and chose and then have them printed. She loves this. Sure it's kinda small but definitely still great quality.","Love this little camera! It's light weight and easy to use.","Daughter loves this camera","Bought two for Christmas, our girls loved them!","My girlfriend loves the camera that i got for her for valentines day","Nice","Great item","My step sister really enjoyed this gift","Bought this to use at a bridal shower and was not disappointed.  Super cute and the pictures were great.","My grand daughter loved it!","Been having problems with exposure to some of my pictures lately.","So stinking cute! We used this for my daughters baby shower (it's a boy!) and she took pics with each guest and displayed them during the event.","great","Best Camera, I love taking pictures with it and it is so cute!!","love","Got this for my fiance and she loves it. Take great photos for an instant camera!","Works exactly as expected.","Perfect gift for my elderly mother who is scared of technology. My 4 year old son showed her how to use it.  I loaded the film for her, and she was ready to go. Simple point and shoot with instant photo.  The photos come out tiny but just the right size to put on the fridge. Everyone should have a camera to catch those special moments. My mother said it was the best gift ever. She never has to miss out anymore during family events.","My camera came quickly and on time. It's super cute and easy to hold! When I took my first two pictures on it, I was super excited and couldn't stop jumping around! I was prepared because I knew that the camera did not come with a starter pack of film, so I bought some before the camera came so I could use it. It's definitely a fun product to play with! I can't wait to take more pics.","We bought this camera for my 12 yr old daughter this past Christmas (2016). She's been using it a lot since then so I wanted to leave an honest user review. This camera is such a great camera! I remember using the old school poleroid cameras from the 80's, these new cameras are so much better quality. Every time we visit family members, they love the fact that we leave them with the pictures we take of them. I do wish the pictures were a little bigger but that's the only thing I can think of. I highly recommend this camera!","Very cute and easy to use!  We purchase this for my 9 year old and she loves it!","Good","Bought this for my sister for her birthday and she loved it! Of course I'll be borrowing it as well to use from time to time ;)","This was an amazing purchase. I cannot find a flaw! It takes amazing pictures! I'm very exited to go on trips and use this great camera!","My daughter (adult) absolutely loves this camera.  The smile on her face makes it priceless.  I'd highly recommend for any shuter-bugs.","VERY GOOD","I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS. The film is a little pricey but worth every penny. The photos are adorable. This is the best thing I've ever bought.","Great price! Great product!!! Get the job done","Photos not good","Came very fast. I'm so happy I finally have this in my possession. Thanks for great and fast service.","beautiful camera, everything I want!","Great camera. Great brand. Great price. The pictures come out great. My daughter loves her camera","Fun camera for kids","Great little camera for my daughter","Great camera. Bought for my 10 year old nice she loved it!!!","I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not but I actually really do. The pictures are a little smaller than expected but they still come out nice and the camera itself is incredibly easy to use. I will definitely be using it a lot on trips.","Very nice camera wish there were more film in the cartridge instead of 10","I brought it for my grand daughter she loves it and so do I .. I also use it for my Daycare","it's very nice","I this to my daughter,she love it.","Best amazon buy ever. Love this thing to death!","THANK YOU SO MUCH! It shipped fast and works perfect! I love it!","Good as expected","I got this camera for my brother's wedding and it was SO AWESOME. Everyone loved the photo station and the pictures came out so cute. The camera didn't stall or break and everything turned out perfect. I will be using it for my wedding coming up :)! It's easy to use (even the grandmas and grandpas could use it at the wedding). It's exactly what I expected it to be. Just realize before you buy it that the photo size is smaller than the polaroids we may all remember as kids - if that's fine with you then definitely buy it!","Granddaughter loves it!","My daughter loves this camera. Lots of fun for teenagers.","I purchased this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas and she truly has enjoyed this camera. Great product, fast delivery","Arrived on time and performs as advertised.","Great camera for a kid not a lot of features. Easy to use","Shaped funny....A little awkward.","No major or minor flaws in this camera. It works perfectly, and the film does not come out of the camera damaged, leaving me to believe that the inner parts are in excellent condition as well. Love it!","This camera works well enough, though the film is expensive and the prints are tiny. I guess I could say it works fantastic... by 1970's standards. Our two teenage girls wanted these for cameras Christmas, and are happy enough with them. In a world full of great digital cameras, I cannot say why these are popular, or even made at all. I guess it is a spontaneity thing, or maybe a thrill like gambling. I'll save my money for a Model T Ford, if I want to go retro.","My daughter loves this thing.  It is simple to use and fun.","i wasn't expecting perfect quality so i wasn't let down there but I'm enjoying every moment i catch with this thing!!! I love it to the fullest","Bought for my 5 year old. She loves this so much, and it seems very sturdy!","Great camera","Great camera, I use it all the time! It is very cheap compared to other options but works just as well! I would suggest buying lots of film because you run out fast","My daughter was ecstatic for her new camera. Such a pretty color and works flawlessly!","I got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She loves it and uses it all the time. The pictures come out as good as any Polaroid camera I've ever owned or seen. The flash works well and the photos really are instant, they only take a couple minutes to develop fully. They're small photos but are perfect for corkboard decorations or event wallets.<br /><br />The only downside is that the film packs are pretty expensive and only hold 10 photos. Besides that they are really easy to change out and the camera is super user friendly.<br /><br />We've got some really great photos from this camera! Instant memories.","Very fun camera","super cute and perfect!!! works nicely and easy to figure out and it came with batteries which was awesome and and kind of a string that you can connect so it's easier to carry around.","daugher loves it!","Love love love this camera. Shipping was faster than expected. Received my camera within two days after ordering! Recommend this camera to anyone who is lazy like me and doesn't go out to get photos printed.","just throw their batteries away, your film won't develop, insert your own batteries, trust me","My nice loved it.  It's ver popular with kids.","Bought it for my big sister and we both love it!","My new favorite toy!!! I love this instacamera! Worth every cent spent on it.","Best gift I got my granddaughter  She love her camera","LOVE IT","The camera itself is nice. Easy to use. The film is sheets are small and expensive, and the quality of the images is not quite as good as original Polaroids.","I haven't gotten to use this camera yet because it's for my daughter's 5th Birthday but it looks ADORABLE( just like the picture and exact color as shown) & it would be super easy for her to work so I'm glad I got it! Can't wait to give it to her in a couple weeks! She's going to love it!!!","Loved it","My daughter loves this camera! It's a hit at every party! Film is pricey but it's a cute gift!","nice good camera","Use it daily at work","V cute love to use.","What's more fun than a Polaroid?! The pictures are small, but they come out well. The kids are having a lot of fun with this camera.","Classic, son loved for b-day gift.","Great product!  Thank you.  Received fast","Purchased for my daughter who loves it. Shot all of the film in one afternoon.","a teenager must have!","Exactly what I wanted, nothing broken or busted, everything works even better than I imagined","LOVED IT!!!!! Best purchase ever","Good for kids","Great cam. My sister loves it.","GREAT THANK YOU","It was great for quite some time but now the photos are not as clear and film is too expensive to hope pics will come out ok. Rather unfortunate","Very neat little camera that my 12 year old received for Christmas.  She loves it and it takes very good pictures.  My 7 year old is now begging for one and I kind of want one for myself!!","Love it!","Works perfectly came in just as pictured.","Even better than I expected! Takes the cutest pictures.","Love for traveling helps for those moments you want to catch right away","I love my fujifilm instax mini.","This camera works well, exactly as the description says! I love it, and it takes nice pictures!","Such a cool camera! We use it in gatherings and parties all the time. Everyone absolutely loves it and many family and friends ended up getting it as well!","GOOD","We use it all the time. Such a great quality camera","I love my little camera so much!!! It was a Valentine's Day present and it couldn't have been better! The picture quality is amazing, a lot better than I expected it. The camera is small but not small enough to feel uncomfortable while holding it. Really glad I have this!","Bought this for my best friends birthday and she was absolutely and completely impressed with the gift. It came sooner then expected in a drawn and pink box.","Enjoying taking pics","Film is pricey but this feels like the old days which is awesome I'm a fan","Great little candid picture-taker.  Move in on your subject, especially if you are shooting folks in a group, as the lens is a bit 'wide angle' and they will end up farther away than you want.","Daughter got this for her birthday when she was 12 and loved it.  Nice for immediate gratification.","Good but I don't know if it's the camera or me because some of the pictures are coming out a little bit dark","Pictures are quite small.  Like using it, but it is very expensive to use.  Have to limit the number of pics I take, so it is only used for special occasions.","My daughter loves this camera.  Printed pics are a novelty for this generation :)<br />My only issue is how expensive the film is.  It's almost $1 a picture!","It's okay, wish I had gotten the newer one, didn't realize it was out.","The Polaroid is a warmer purple than shown in the pictures.  This camera is portable and fun to carry around although I wished they had clearer instructions on the lighting settings.","This was a gift for my daughter. She absolutely enjoys the instant photo experience. Thank you!","Was gifted this camera as a birthday present and I absolutely love it. I have an original Polaroid 600 camera that my mom gave me as a kid and this one is just as good, minus the vintage part. Easy to use and the pictures are always fantastic. If you're expecting crisp, vibrant photos then you'll be very disappointed because the pictures are in some cases fuzzy and the colors muted but it definitely adds to the photo overall.","I love this little camera...it brings a bit of nostalgia with it for me as an 80's kid. I bought this for my 11year old daughters birthday, and I am proud to say she loves it as much as I did!<br /><br />We bought several different designed cartridges since she'll be putting her photos on display in her room. The photos come out well, not blurry at all. The photos come out with a semi vantage feel.","Fun camera!  The camera itself feels VERY flimsy but takes great pictures!  Bought two and my daughters and myself had fun taking candid/fun pictures at Christmas! My daughters use them at college for fun friend pictures! Very happy with purchase.","No complaints","Gift","I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas and it was a big hit with her and her friends. It's very similar to the old instant Polaroid cameras, but with mini sized pictures.","I like this but it is a bit bulky and am starting to wish I had bought an iPhone polaroid mini instant printer attachment instead.","I bought this as a gift for my brother who is turning 16 and I already own one myself. I LOVE this camera. Its so much fun to play with and make instant memories.","Super fun camera!","Great product. My little girl loves it. Good price and great picture qualitty","Perfecto","My daughter loves it!","My daughter was happy with her camera although since its a mini the pictures are tiny","Product is cool.  Not the quality of pictures I was expecting.....but oh well.","Product is amazing","Great product! Runs really well and the shipping was fast","This is the best camera ever. I got this camera for my daughter for her birthday. It is awesome. When you get the camera, it doesn't come with the film so you need to buy some. The pictures turned out great. My daughter loves the camera! Very good quality.","Really great shipping camera works great and one of the lowest prices I've seen.","camera is great, instructions not so much.  but my daughter loves the camera.","My daughter loved it.","my daughter is having a blast taking pictures of her friends with this camera.","Thanks :))","I love this camera!!","Amazing! Absolutely love!","This camera is so fun!  I love it for just fun photos that are instant.  I miss my old polaroid so this is perfect!  it is way easier to travel with as well.","Great item","So far so good ,","My daughter loves it. Although the film is about $1 per picture, it is worth it. I tell her to not use the camera like a digital camera, and she is able to take pictures, create memory books, and do other crafts with them. It is definitely worth the purchase. I did also get it for her for Christmas and told family and friends that they could get her film for a gift, so it will be quite awhile before I have to buy film again.","Very good. Excellent delivery time. Good Amazon seller. Highly Recommended.","Camera has a glitch where it won't register the settings when I turn the wheel from indoors to cloudy to outdoors so that the flash always goes off regardless.","Awesome. No issues at all. Fast Shipping!","This camera is adorable and most importantly affordable! I love it so much. I purchased it with the camera case to keep it safe and clean & to travel with it, along with the fuji film instax instant film frames to take pictures. What I love most about this camera is that on the back it lets you know how many pictures you have left to take. It's awesome! Definitely worth it!","Love it. I'm in love with this product. It arrived on time and super safe.","Very nice camera!","I love it. Just can't zoom in. But that's ok. It's great for bday parties with backgrounds. Fun little photo booth idea.","Great gift for a teen but the photos come out a bit dark and the coloring is not bright","GREAT","I did a lot of research on instant film cameras and bought this one because of the solid reviews that I read on here.  I've taken a few photos with it and I've loved it!","very wonderful","Got this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. There's some pretty great novelty in taking photos without spending time posing and reviewing like we always do on our phones. No time for editing and all rubbish that ruins capturing the moment authentically. It's also really cool to have physical copies of the photos to hang on our cork board. The photos have much better color than I expected, but the flash can be a bit harsh on some. The film is a little pricy, but I think this is an awesome camera to quickly capture the moment.","Awesome! I love how the colors in the pictures come out vintage. Really cute camera.","Excellent camera... bought as a Christmas gift for our Granddaughter. She loves it...","Just what my daughter wanted. She's still getting used to the exposure settings which can take awhile and eat up film. Not really an automatic point and shoot camera.","This instax is great for beginners, but if you're really into photography, then I suggest upgrading to the Neo Classic.","Works great. Love the color. Got many compliments and very easy to use. It is portable and small enough to use and store in a purse and a carry on.","great","Not professional, but a good start for teenagers and such. Very small prints, but pretty good definition for what it is.","Cute color and compact..I suggest also buying the yellow case sold separately for protection.","My daughter loves it!!!","This camera was a hit with my 12 yr old granddaughter.  It takes very clear, but small pictures.  Yet the pictures are perfect for kids to hang in their room.","Birthday gift that was well received. It arrived on time also.","Daughter was so happy about her camera!","Awesome camera for any age! I am 22 and I love it! Only down side is that its an invesment because the film is expensive","Daughter received as Christmas present.  She loves using it.  Good quality.  We got the kit of frames, stickers etc.  She has had a lot of fun with it.","Live","Loved it","Great camera for people who want an instant camera, but don't want to pay $100+ just for the camera alone. I also bought an accessory kit for it that came with filters for different color photos, a mirror (which makes taking pictures easier), photo frames, a carrying case, and different stickers to put around the picture, among other things. PLEASE be aware that you have it on the right setting BEFORE taking the picture! If not, it'll come out way too dark or way too light and it can ruin a good picture and waste film. Those film packets can get expensive if you're not buying in bulk, which is the down side of having an instant camera like this one.","Love the camera. Hate the expense of the refills. $1 per picture is a little steep, so hopefully cost will go down soon!","This camera is the perfect size and easy to use! I've had this camera for four months and it has been dropped a few times but still works very well. Also a great gift for any teen!","I purchased this for a gift. It is as described. They loved it. Works great!","Awesome! I love taking pictures with it! The only thing I do wish was that the photos were bigger but I get it it's called the instax mini for a reason! :)","These little cameras are the cutest! And if you buy it from Amazon they are at such a good price! Art stores sell them for as high as $120! It's really easy to use and great for anyone with a love of vintage/retro. The film is a bit expensive and gets used up fast if you're not careful. Be sure to experiment with the settings a bit, if you are in an area that's too bright your photos will get washed out and there is no way to reuse the film! I have found that it is quite sensitive to bright areas but haven't mastered the settings, dark areas with the flash effect make for the best outcome!","Cute camera! Kids love it!","Was a Birthday gift for my grandson's girlfriend. She loves it!!","Loved the camera.  Works wonderfully!","It's okay, but man, is it cheaply made! Our daughter, not a klutzzy kid, dropped it once -- about a foot and a half onto a carpet, and the entire front lens assembly came off -- fortunately this has happened to lots of people, so you can find repair directions online . . . We bought this for our 8 year old, but had I seen how cheap it was, I would have opted to buy a nicer camera, (yes, even if it meant spending $100 on our 8 year old for an instant camera).  Photos are mediocre at best, it really does NOT adjust for the light much at all --We set it at both lighting extremes, shot the same photo, and you really cannot tell them apart.","Love it!","Wife loves it","Amazing camera!  Love it,  it works very well for a really really  good price. Really really fast shipping, it got here in about 3 or 4 days. Love the little lanyard it comes with. it's the perfect size, you can carry it just about everywhere!  I just love my camera so much!","This is very nice. Good quality. I suggest you buy as a bundle with case and film. Exactly what my daughter wanted.","My kid lives the camera ; no problem with shipping or quality or service","I have wanted one of these for a while and now I have one and I love the pictures! They look so cute and the camera in general looks super cute. Its a lighter yellow than in the picture, like a dandelion yellow, which I absolutely adore. Now I am one of those basic girls with this camera but I don't care I love it.","A little tough to get the hang of, and definitely buy a lot of film, but I think it was worth the money","I posted a review of this camera in the wrong section; [I placed it in the camera case section mistakenly].  It's a cute camera and made a nice gift, but the film is so cost prohibitive; too expensive!","This camera is cute and it works. If you are not outside in the sun or bright daylight, don't bother taking the photos. My daughter loves it.","It's great! My friend like it so much.","Cute & fulfilled my expectations","My 11 year old daughter is having so much fun with this camera.","Bought this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and she enjoys taking it with her on trips and for special occasions!","Kiddo loved it","This is such a fun product.  My sister has one, and I have been wanting one ever since I used hers.  It is a fun and unique way to capture the moment, rather than a cell phone, which we have become so accustomed to.  It's small enough to fit in most bags that you would take out with you.  I got the yellow, and the color was exactly as I expected.  I kinda like that the film is a little more expensive because I am very picky about when I use this camera, which keeps me from overusing the camera and exhausting its uniqueness.  Overall, this is a great product and I definitely recommend it!","It is just the cutest thing and the pictures are well printed and everything..!!","Love this!","I loved it <3","My GF loved it! Best birthday present!","Love this camera! It's so easy to use and the pictures look fantastic.","I love this camera and the fact that it prints old Polaroid style pictures instantly. They are wallet sized pics which is good for my kids to use for school projects or their scrapbooks. The only cons are that the film itself is expensive AND my daughter's camera broke after 2 days use. I'm assuming it was her fault and not due to a poorly built camera.  They LOVE their cameras so I bought her another one with the extra warranty. Hopefully we won't have any more issues with it. Overall, love the size and ease of use. Pictures are decent quality when subjects are in close range.","My daughter absolutely loves this little camera. The only bummer I can come up with is that the film is a little spendy and you do not get that many  pictures in a package. Other than that, love, love, love!","Fast Delivery and worked as advertised.","My daughter loves this. The instructions are virtually non-existent, but easy enough to figure out.","Made a great gift for a girl's 20th birthday. Was a blast to use and take pictures.","This was awesome worked very well I'm very happy!","pictures tend to be too dark","Just like the picture! So excited I finally got to use it and it was just as great as I expected it to be.","Pretty Cool. Look more on how to use settings so you dpnt randomly pick ones and waste film.","Good","cool","LOVE IT ??","Exactly as pictured.  I wish it at least came with some film, but it does not.  Otherwise, great value.","camera is really big...but its nice for a little girl","Got this for my 8 year for Christmas and it was his favorite gift, looks just like the picture.","Would recommend to anyone who loves photography. So easy & simple to use and produces fantastic little photos!","The camera is working good so far.","christmas gift","I LOVE LOVE LOVE the instax cameras! We had two at our wedding and guests went bananas taking pictures. It is so fun to look through them, give them to friends, and make collages with the pictures. There is just something so much fun about instant photos. I love these and really hope they stick around a long time!<br />The camera itself is a little awkward to use at times, the design could use some tweaks, but because of what the camera does it really doesn't matter a whole lot that the trigger or the camera viewfinder is awkward.","As described","Awesome!! Great product!!","I love it !","SO CUTE","Got this as a gift and she absolutely loves it! I did lots of research on Instamatic cameras and I decided the alternatives were too expensive in terms of film. After a few months of use, I definitely recommend this one! I was worried the images would be too small, but I found that the size didn't bother me as much as I expected. Love it.","Love it! Shipping was very fast! I got it for my birthday and it is awesome!","Very bulky and they are hard for smaller hands to hold","Bought this as a gift for my neices and nephew. They had a lot of fun with this.  Pictures came out great and I'm thinking of buying one for myself!","A little tricky to take indoor pictures or action pictures. Great out door pictures","Perfect for an 11 year old.  The pictures turn out super cute","When I was little, I always write to Santa for a instant camera. Never had one so I decided to just buy me self one. JOKES!<br /><br />I bought this 2 years ago and still works like a charm. You have to get use to the setting keys for lighting. It is a bit tricky when taking pictures in direct sunlight or night time. Overall, I am please with this camera. It's fun taking pictures on the go and immediately having it in my hand. It is cheaper to buy online than in-stores. I also bought a cover for my camera since I do toss it in my purse a lot. Totally worth it.","Kids have a ball with this but fight over the colored film which is a must.  Great camera so far!","Love it!!","Loved it","Really good quality Loved it","This is such a cute camera. Its great to take with you to parties and to travel with. I can't get enough of this camera!","My 11yr old daughter loves it!","Pictures comes out nice and clear just like in the Polaroid days. Awesome!!!!!","It has been the best thing in my life. I aspire to be a photographer and this is my 3rd camera. It's great to take places and get the picture instantly !","Easy to use, it's a little lighter compared to the polo round model.","Very cute and you know, works.","Loved it","It was a Xmas gift and my granddaughter was very happy.","My daughter just loves it. The picture clarity is very nice.","Perfect! Christmas gift for my daughter & she loves it!","Works pretty good. Takes decent pictures although they are a bit small.","Very good and brand new no damage and wprls perfectly","My son loves his camera and the pictures come out really clear. Great purchase!","Arrived quickly, great price, love the follow up email to ensure I was satisfied! Camera is simple and easy to use. I did watch a couple You Tube videos to learn a few tips that were very helpful.","great","Bought it as a gift. She loves it. It was exactly what she wanted.","excellent.","Not bad at all. Thanks for a good camera.","Really nice camera! It is very easy to use and the photos are super cute. I'm satisfied with my purchase.","Love my new camera. Absolutely nothing bad to say about it. The camera does come with a set of batteries but I reccomend investing in rechargeable batteries to save some money.","Really nice instant camera.  Works well and made a great gift.","love my new pink mini polaroid","Amazing for the price makes for a great gift for all ages!!!","This little camera may be small but very mighty indeed. Takes very good pics, does not require a printer that uses ink. Great little camera for kids of all ages, especially for beginners. Highly recommend!","It was a day late. But I love the camera!!","The girlfriend loves it","this is a very cute and fun camera. i have benn wanting one for a while so i was so excited when it got here  the picture quality is actually really good too. this camera is nice because the pictures print out right away about the size of a credit card. love this inexpensive camera!","works well, fast shipping","Great product.","loved it, fast delivery service too, thank you","My 7 year old won't put it down! Great gift idea","Love this adorable camera! Perfect size and great value!","My 14 year old daughter loves it!","My girls loved them","Great camera for people looking for that feeling of nostalgia. And closing the gap of the fast paced world we live in today.","This camera is seriously amazing, great photos very bright! I would like to add if you're taking photos with this camera DO NOT SHAKE THE PHOTO! Leave it upside down for the photo to properly develop. The photos will come out white if exposed to too much light so make sure you oare on the suggested setting the camera providing the front of the lense. I've noticed a lot of people having that problem and I don't want people wasting film. Hope this helps!","A last minute Christmas gift that ended up being one of my daughter's all-time favorite.  Easy to use and her friends all want one too!","A gift for my grand-daughter. She liked it.","I bought this to use the small sized prints in my Bullet Journal. They are perfect for that. One must pay attention to the dial to get the best lighting for the picture but it works nicely for my intended purpose :)<br /><br />Super easy to load and use. So easy that I tried to make it difficult. If you KWIM?","My sister loves this camera. It was a great Christmas present for her.","Great fun with this cam. My gf loved it as a bday gift","Daughter loved her Christmas gift, she is 22 and loves the instant pictures, it takes a lot better pictures than the older Polaroids of course and the mini size is too cute.","This is perfect!! I love the color and the pictures turn out great. My only complaint is that I wish you could hold more film, I do know this is a mini camera but I can only take about 10 pictures before having to switch out film!","It is so pretty and everything I expected of it ","My daughter loves it. She's decorated her room with the pictures she's taken. Cute and easy to use.","This was a Christmas gift for my niece and she loves it! She likes the bright color also, although she would have preferred it in teal.","My daughter loves it!","awesome!","I love my polaroid camera. It takes really good quality photos and they are perfect for decorating and giving as gifts.","This camera is tremendous. I mean, it's really great. Polaroid is a sore loser. Want the media to get off your back? Easy. Make your own media. I got wonderful, seriously great, pictures of my inauguration. Absolutely zero of the women's march. 10/10 would buy again, as long as it's not made in China.","Super fun, excellent product. Gives a great sense of nostalgia. Make sure to read the directions carefully before using so you know what sort of exposure is the best for the composition of your photos. On top of that order the film separately since this item is only the camera. I'm sure the seller sells both so you can pack your order into as little shipments as possible. Overall if you are considering getting this I highly recommend it.","We used this camera for a baby shower \"book\"... it worked awesomely!!","Thank You!","Good","Don't let your kids open the film compartment!","So neat to remember the good ole days in this digital age!","Nice camera","I bought this as a birthday gift to my sister. The photos are smaller than I expected, but she loves it. A lot of her friends come over to use the camera and are jealous that she has one. It is not necessarily a great investment, as the film is quite expensive, but it made her so happy. The pictures are also slightly blurry, but that is to be expected. I would recommend as a gift to anyone who is artsy and/or loves to take photos. Overall, a really cute product. My one complaint is that I wish the direction sheet was better, as she had just a bit of trouble working the camera at first.","Great product! It was a gift for my daughter and she loves it!! We have had no problems with the quality.","12 year old loves it.  Good quality and lots of fun.","Love it. Used it immediately and it's perfect.","The box was a little damaged but I love the Polaroid and all of the stuff it came with!","my daughter loves this camera and it takes nice pictures","Bought for a 6 year old and it was a huge hit.  She loves it and it is easy enough to use.","just what she wanted loved it","its very cool and I been waiting for it and when I got it it was the best camarea I ever had but everything was in different writing","very good. accurate and came on time.","Fun and easy to use","This was what my grandaughter wanted for Christmas, so that's why I bought it. I thought it was too expensive, and the film is pretty outrageous.","i purchased this for my girlfriend on her birthday because she has been wanting one for a while. i believe she enjoys the product as do i. this is a great gift to get your significant other because you can create a scrape book or photo book. i purchased this used and it works fine and is clean as can be. the product his amazing and suggest if you also want one and are thinking of sharing with your significant other, you should get one for your self because my girlfriend does not let me borrow it.","Nice she love it...","Great product","loves it","I love it, it's an amazing little camera that you can literally fit in your purse!","Friend loves it","This is an OEM product that functions perfectly, just at a much better price than in stores.","Great camera loved the quality.","9 year old granddaughter easily worked this in very little time. Told me Grandma this is the best gift ever!\"","Instructions were not in English.","Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She absolutely loved it1","The colour is just perfect and it's so cute !!","I like it","Excellent!!! The item is very cool for my daughter","My kid loves it.","This came in a secure package and everything was there. It even included batteries! The pictures I've taken have turned it very well. I love this camera!","We loved our first one so much, we bought a second one. These take fantastic selfies, be careful when you use the flash, that you don't try to take a pic of someone or something too far away or you will waste your film. You have to get very close when shooting with an instant camera, especially in a dark environment, shooting with the flash. Outdoors is great. Just always remember...get up really close to your subject for your best pictures, you won't be sorry. ","Bought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loved it! Interested in buying one for her friend, she was so surprised to hear I bought it from Amazon and for such a price! (As some stores sell it for 10 to 50 bucks more!)<br />Came completely intact and at a speedy time; absolutely pleased!","Very vibrant color.  Works great and is easy to operate.","my girlfriend loves me","This product is great!<br />It is a little pricy but well worth it.<br />It is easy to work. It did not take long to figure it out. I love the look of the photos.","Bought for my daughter for Christmas and she was really excited to use it.  It's a good camera,  just don't expect professional grade photos with this camera. Lighting has to be just right also.<br />It's great for just fun, but expensive to just waste film one.","It was what my daughter wants, good service","Super cute & fun","My teen daughter loves it so much fun!","the light that is suppose to flash green (I think to show if the battery is dying?) doesn't work. Otherwise it functions well","Great gift to someone else or for yourself! It takes adorable pictures and is extremely easy to use.","I bought this camera for my 10 year old daughter's birthday party. I had a photo booth area set up with her b'day theme and made a photo booth frame out of thick cardboard. The girls liked taking pics of themselves and watching the photo develop before their eyes. They enjoyed being able to take photos home with them. The camera is easy to use. First slide of film is the black film at beginning of the cartridge-pics start in second shot.","Got this for my girlfriend at Christmas time, she loves it! Perfect gift for someone who wants to trap a moment in time the old fashion way.","Nice","My daughter loves it. easy to use and takes great pictures","Great","Works great! I love my art-hoe-camera!","Great, super cute fun gift for a tween.","My 16 year old daughter loved the fujifilm poloroid camera for her Christmas gift.....loved how the pictures come out....","fast delivery daughter loved it","this was a Christmas gift, my grand daughter loves it","As advertised","My sister used this camera on an international trip that she did not take her phone on.  It was a good size for travel and the pictures have great color.","Great Quality.","great gift for granddaughter","The camera is so much fun! I had it at my boyfriends birthday party, and all the guests loved using it. I'll say the only downside is that the rolls don't produce as many pictures as I thought they would. I got approx. 9 pics out of each roll, so make sure to stock up on them if you plan to take a lot of pics.","Love it, as advertised","goes through a pair of batteries everytime i use it","My daughter loves this camera, but or me the picture quality is not very good a all. could have just gotten a digital. She loves is though. and that what matters!","My daughter was beyond thrilled to get this for her birthday. She's nine and is able to handle it great.","as promised, thanks!","Great gift","It works as advertised, but it's a tremendous cash-sink.<br /><br />I normally have to aim it slightly lower to get a good framing of the subject.","Incredibly easy to use. Just make sure you put the film in correctly and follow the diagram. My friend put the film in backwards and it took quite a bit of time to wedge it out.","My 8 yr old loves this camera. It is also a fun way to stay in touch with relatives. Mail them a picture every once in a while. Digital media and social media is awesome, but sometimes it is nice to get an old fashioned picture.","Christmas gift for my daughter....loves it","I got this for my wedding! Everyone took selfies and then pasted them into a guest book and wrote us notes. The guests had a blast doing it and now I get to look through my guest book and see all the beautiful people at the wedding and their marriage advice!","fine","Love the color. I gave it to my sister as a gift for christmas and she loves it. I also have one of my own, it so easy to use and a good size!","Bought this for my adult daughter , so retro and cute. She loved it. Took great pictures and the accessories that you can get like photo album and case were perfect.","Love it. Easy to use.","Awesome!","love it","My daughter loves it it is a perfect teen gift it came with everything included","So far no issues *knock on wood*<br />Really fun to use, takes nice pics for a low end instant camera.<br />Had a few issues with blank film but figured it out, really need to just play with the camera and read people's tips online first.<br />Film does NOT come with it, that should be obvious but people are still bitching about it. Ugh.<br />Definitely worth the money!","Beware...all documentation are in Chinese.<br />Camera works fine.","Excelent","Showed this to my family and now everyone wants them! It's cute, takes great pictures, and is durable!","My friend bought me one of these and I use it more than my digital camera. It's super cute and easy to use but the only downside is that it doesn't come with any film and the film is on the expensive side.","I've had so much fun with this camera! The only pitfall is how easy it is to accidentally turn on.","This thing is so much fun to have! We used this on New Year's eve and were thrilled with printed pictures.","Very cute!","Thanks for the awesome product!","Bought for my daughter and she loves it! Nice little instant camera.","this is so cute and easy to use, my only complaint is that it doesn't come with any film :(","This is a nice little camera, good quality.","Excellent","Love this camera!","This was a X-mas present given to my GS and he is quite happy with the camera.","Good Camera and takes pretty good photos, bought for my daughter who likes it.","Fun instant camera.  Not as good as the polaroids from my youth but the closest I have found so far.","Kids love these things.<br /><br />But these tiny pictures would never work for me.","Fun camera!","Great product and price!","Just perfect! Holidays have been amazing since this purchase","Probably one of my favorite things I own. I LOVE how cute this camera is. It's practical because it's not too large and I love the instant gratification of having my pictures printed right there. Amazing!!","Absolutely love my camera. Doesn't come with the greatest of directions, but pretty simple to figure out after a few trials.","Too small","Wife loves this camera. Better than expected.","This thing is BADASS! I bought this for the wife for Christmas and she is in love with it. The only thing is that you can't snap away unless you're rich. The refill film is just over $10 for 10 pics. That will definitely get pricey after a while. But for \"girls night\" or special occasions it is freaking awesome.<br />The pictures have a retro look all on their own just because of what they are and that adds to the nostalgia. Surprisingly, decent pictures as well. Great buy. Perfect for a birthday gift, Valentines...whatever<br /><br />P.S. BE CAREFUL! The film will go in the wrong way. I know because we did it and when we tried to take a picture, nothing happened. After messing with it for a minute, yup, in the wrong way.","I love this camera. Its simple and to the point. Doesnt really take great pictures indoors.","Very cute camera. It is simple to use and we got it working without even needing to open the user's guide.  The photos bring about some nostalgia. The only con is the price of the film. I am spoiled by 12¢ digital prints, but paying 65¢ per photo isn't too bad for the fun and unique way to share these quickly.  Not convenient to carry around, even with the customer case, I fond this more suited to capture gatherings at home.","Looks really good and work fantastic","GREAT","My goddaughter loved it","As it was a Christmas gift to a 9 year granddaughter I can only tell you she says WOW it is the best  present ever.","I'm an honorary auntie to my friend's daughter, she just went Gaga when she opened her gift.","So much fun! Vintage feel, easy to use, I only wish there were more pictures that could be taken in a pack.","best price I found anywhere","Such a fun camera in my daughter's favorite color. We bought the bathing accessories with it and it was the perfect Christmas gift.","I love this camera!  The pictures come out perfect and the camera is easy to use. I highly recommend it. My friends and family have one so i had to get one myself and I'm happy I did.","Gift.","Cute camera and I love the idea of the polaroid's  however the flash is not that great. When I take pictures the borders are often dark when taken inside. When taking pictures outside the pictures are often not detailed and super light. The light has to be perfect for the pictures to come out nice. This is a fun gift for a teenager. Overall a great buy for the price.","This was a gift for a 10 yr old and he really enjoys having it. He can take pictures and have them right away he pretty imputed by that. you can get different accessories for it like case and different things.","like it very much! very good product","HANNAH LOVES IT","What's not to love about infant film cameras? The instax mini 8 is nostalgic and super cute. I love the look and it fits well in your hands. The only issue I have is that my film is currently coming out with a thin greenish hue on the right side, I can't tell if it's because the back doesn't close perfectly flush or if it's the film itself","great little camera for taking pictures of my puppy. I sent them to people which they enjoy instead of dealing with cell phones","Has been a fun treat for my daughter. She loves pictures collages.","I love this camera! There is something so fun about getting to hold your picture right away! So far all of our pictures have turned out really cute!","Only issue is you REALLY need to make sure you have good lighting before taking photos.","I really like this little camera. It's fun to take out for fun with friends. However, the flash is a bit intense, and sometimes it's hard to judge whether or not to cover it. (You can't shut it off, so sometimes I cover it with my finger. Some people use tape). It also only holds 10 photos worth of film, so I always bring extra when I take it somewhere. But when I have the right lighting, the color of the photos is amazing.","Ok, so a little over a year ago I ordered a blue Polaroid (instax 8) and it broke a couple of days ago (most likely user error) but I ordered another one  (a blue one), but when it arrived, it was green(and the packaging was a little torn) ! I mean the color is cute and all, so I may end up just sticking to the green, but I ordered a blue one, so I'm a little disappointed:( other than that it's a great camera and fun to use :)","This is an awesome camera! I am a college student and I love just being able to snap polaroids and just stick them right on the wall or give them to friends. The actual camera is a good size so it can be slid right into a bag or a purse. The film comes in packs of ten but is a bit pricey. The camera requires two AA batteries but they last a long time, I bought the camera 5 months ago and have not changed out my batteries yet. Now the only thing wrong with my camera is that for some reason I cannot switch what mode I take a picture in. Near the lens there is a wheel that allows you to take a picture whether you are inside, if it is sunny outside, overcast, etc. and for some reason mine will not change. Luckily it is not a big deal and I am the only one who is experienced this problem in my friend group.","Was great","super product quick ship great quality and price!!","Great product and good pricing cheaper than in stores!","Gave it to my niece as a Christmas gift.  She loved it and started using it right away.  Very good quality photos.","Great gift!","Love this camera! Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it's the same one that is sold at retails stores for more.","Easy to use after you determine the correct lighting and settings. Takes me back to the fun of polaroids in an age of digital photos that never get printed.","It is a wonderful camera, take excellent photos, the package arrived on time.","My daughter loves this, she's 11. The quality isn't great but it's what we expected when we purchased it. We love that we can get more excessories to keep it fun.","This is my second time purchasing this camera because the flash on the first one randomly stopped working not long after I got it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this one lasts longer because I really enjoy taking pictures with it!","Love the camera color and<br />functions well. A fun throw back<br />to the time, before digital pictures.","LOVE IT","I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!! I take it to any kind of family gathering and it is always a hit! People love that they are like mini Polaroids!<br /><br />It takes a little while to get the brightness setting right but after a couple photos, you get the hang of it!","A nice gadget for get to together and game nights.","14 year old daughter LOVES it!!!","Look good","Bought it for my granddaughter. She love the color and was easy to use","Grandkids love them.  They were here for Christmas.  Many pictures already","Works great and have already captured so many memories!","Granddaughter THRILLED with this Christmas morning.  Need to order her more film--a hit item with all her 12-year-old pals.","great camera love it","Easy to load w/film. Perfect for beginner.","The kids love these","I love it.","I'm in love with this camera, it's just as pictured! Will work great for my wedding.","I a lot of reviews saying these cameras were bought for kids and teenagers but at 38yrs old...I love it...lol.  It is so fun to use and I love the instant pictures.  I think this camera is good for any age.","my daugther love it","Thank you","Excellent purchase my daughter loves it","Super fun!","My 9 year old daughter loves this instant film camera and takes pictures all over the house. It is easy to use and my daughter knows exactly how to use it. Cute!","I love it so much! I am so happy that I can immediately print my puctures and use them as memories of all my travels. This camera is amazing.","Love the camera!! Perfect for creating  home decor wall displays while preserving memories!","Got this camera as a gift and I had to say you really get a great picture for the price. While the film is expensive, this camera takes way better shots than some of the more expensive Polaroid cameras in this category. If you're buying this as a gift make sure to tie in a nice case and maybe an album to store the photos!","This was a great gift for my grand daughter I liked it so much I bought myself one","My daughter loves using this camera.  You have to be really close and it has to be well lit to use the camera.  It's great outdoors.","Easy to use, cute, and a perfect gift for our 11 year old.","Purchased the camera for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.  Some of the final pictures have weird spots and marks on them but it is kind of what I expect from an instant camera.","I have been wanting a Fujifilm Instax Mini forever!! I was delighted when I opened the box and my product was safely packaged.I do my research on a product before I buy anything. I also had a bunch of friends with the same camera and loved theirs as well. I was looking around at Nordstrom rack (since I had a gift card) &  Walmart to look for the best price! Amazon blew them out of the water by far, cheaper by 20 dollars in some case. Would definitely recommend this product!","Fast shipping. Love it","My daughter loved the color and it works great","Easy to use. We haven't used it outside as of yet, but the inside pictures print dark. She has had to throw quite a few pics away even with using the recommended setting for inside!","My daughter is 13 and loves this camera! Said it was the best Christmas present ever. It's a fun little camera for her parties and little get together with friends. The pictures shoots out right away, no raking and having the film developed.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.","The color is definitely more red than pink, but it's still so cute! This little camera fits right in my purse so I am able to take it with me where ever I go!","My daughter loves her camera","i bought it for my sisters baby shower, we all loved it! works great!","So much fun to use but I just wish at least some film was included and that packs weren't so darn expensive :(","My daughter loves it. The only thing is make sure the settings are understood or you'll waste photos.","Works well and the pics have the nostalgic feel. Couldn't find pink color in stores or online so was happy to get it here. The Polaroid film is half the size or so but I like that as it makes the pic look more intimate and sentimental. Each Polaroid shot will cost you about 70 cents so choose your poses wisely!","In love with this! So convenient that it uses AA batteries. Purchased one as a gift for both my mom & sister & they love them.","Came in way earlier than expected. Looks so pretty, haven't tried it :) thanks!","Bought it for my Wife and she loves it!<br />Got it in pink because my wife is basic<br />If you are getting this it's because your partner loves taking pictures and hanging them on the fridge or wall.<br /><br />I'm surprised how well the photos come out!<br />Battery has not been changed since I got it almost 1 year ago.","This product is great I gave it to my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved it we have captured some amazing moments and are excited to make more memories with it.","CUTE AND AWESOME my girlfriend loves it! Pictures at long distance don't seem to work though, they just come out grey if the thing you're taking a picture of isn't within ~15 feet.","Love it","I forgot film.","Kid loved it","GREAT!!!","Very good seller!, Everything as expected!!!","Nice camera!","Love it","My daughter enjoys her camera, its great starter for a kid. The only thing she wishes the film size was a lil bigger","This is a huge hit every time I take it out with me.  I'm so happy with it.","Bought this for my wedding guest book and it worked like a dream. It is easy to operate and takes pretty pictures. I decorated mine with purple washi tape because why not ^_^","Bought it as an anniversary gift for my girlfriend and we love it!","My daugther loveee itttt!!!!","Love this camera. I got it as a gift for my girlfriend and we use it all the time. Easy to put in her purse and take pictures. It was really hard to find a store with film in stock though.","Love the camera bought accessories package on amazon  film at Costco taken a bunch of photos something about having an instant hard copy just makes me happy I have a photo printer but this is just something else","Great love it","I bought this for my Granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves it!","this was a Christmas gift and my grandson had a great time taking pictures","This was a great gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.  I also purchase the case and a picture wallet and they all go together very nicely.","Kids couldn't be happier. Love the soft powder blue color.","I get SO many compliments on my camera! Love it!","Easy to use camera, great quality photos. BUYERS BEWARE: THE FILM IS NOT CHEAP!","The camera is quite bulky and the pictures are small and hard to see. I thought it would be more fun to use and easier to handle/use. The film is expensive too. I wish I had returned it, but that's not the sellers fault. The seller was great. Packaging was good.","Got this for my son's girlfriend for Christmas. She loved it!!! It's her favorite color and she's been wanting a camera like this forever!!! I highly recommend this camera to everyone.","I love it. Simple, straightforward & instant photos.  No complaints here.","The camera is great, I love it.

So much fun at gatherings having little Polaroids to hand out!","Really good camera for pictures, you can adjust the lighting.","Good camera that makes nice pictures. After using one day, I wished I bought the newer model with a few more features.","Love the camera, love the color. My 10 year old can grasp how much each picture costs so that is helpful. (1.50) so much fun","Great price for a popular gift this year.","the product is great my daughter didn't like the color but we got the light pink and she loves it!!!","I love fujifilm and when I saw the instant mini I had to own one. Over a year now and still works great. I have taken it to travel with me and everyone loves it too. I have purchased 2 more as gifts because it's just a great camera and so fun to use.","awesome","Purchased this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she is rarely without it.","awesome","My kid loves the camera ,  she begged for one for Christmas and we teased her for weeks about not getting it.  She has blown through about 100 photos with it and they look like vintage polaroids.","Bought this for 14 yr old daughter as gift and she was ecstatic.","Awesome Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it!","Stores did not have this and we knew our grand-daughter so had her heart set upon taking pictures with her own camera.  Delivered on schedule for one happy grand child.","Bought as a gift for a young teen that had it on her Christmas list.. She loved it! Her list only stated a poloroid kind of camera but I liked this fugifilm instax mini 8 camera better than the Poloroid brand because there were so many accessories for the fugifilm camera whereas I didn't see much for the other. Her favorite color is blue and though she liked this camera, I thought it was too pastel for my taste and wish fugifilm would've made the darker royal blue like the poloroid did.<br />But all is good and the teen is happy with her new camera!","I love my mini 8 its perfect for taking tactile pictures that I can have instantly! i have a wall full of them and it really makes for amazing decoration and memories! makes everything look so chill! have to mess around to figure out the different lighting and techniques you can do but its all part of the trial and error and learning process. I recommend buying the bulk 60 shots film box. it really saves a lot of money.","Nice camera. Works good. I love it","Got this for my 10 year old cause she loved her bff Brodie's so much.  I can't wait for her to fill up her album of memories like I did back in high school with my Polaroid camera.","My 10yr old girl love it & so I. It is simply perfect.","Bought the camera for my 5 year old daughter and she loves it","A gift for my daughter and apparently a big hit. She fancies herself a gifted , young photographer and this camera has provided her a viable instrument to further her hobby.","My daughter loves it.take great pictures. I recommend you but it for your kids.","Love it love the yellow as it's hard to find yellow things","Love it!","Great!","Just as described. Good product.","Beautiful color and camera. My daughter loved it!","A++. Just as described.. Thanks!","I bought it for my sister and so far so good. She is happy with it.","amazing","This little camera is fantastic! It's so unique and I love the photos that it creates! I bought my little sister this for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. It's super simple to use and a ton of fun for the whole family. The pictures look vintage and honestly pretty retro! This was %100 a great purchase and I'd recommend this camera to anyone that loves taking pictures or crafting or that loves to scrapbook!","My Daughter absolutely loves this camera.  Used it for her 16th birthday party an she had a blast.","This is the best little camera. It's perfect for an 11 year old and she really loves it.","The perfect holiday gift for the teenager type :)","Super cute and exactly what I was looking for. It's lightweight which makes it easy to carry around (I haven't got around to buying a case yet). It's easy to use and perfect for anyone who wants that old Polaroid feel but with a fresh set of color.","Love it","Ordered for my daughter.....she loves it!","Love it","This camera takes awesome pictures!!","It was everything I expected.

But with that being said, I still really do enjoy this thing!","My daughter loves it and has been very happy with it!","Worked well. Provided good instructions. Pictures came out straight and clear!","Great camera","Amazing camera, very fun, easy to use, I recommend it!","Such a cute and fun camera. I really love this so much! Vintage looking pictures.","SUPER FUN CAMERA.  MY DAUGHTER HAS HAD HOURS OF FUN WITH FRIENDS WITH THIS.","I really recommend this camera for fun activities and to make memories the camera is soo cute and you can take it on the road its also very light too this is the perfect camera for me","I bought it to use it on my wedding and everyone loved it!! Every guest took several pictures and wanted to keep the camera! lol and the color is exactly as in the picture","For the price this is as good a product as you can get. You get the same quality photos as the Polaroid except more affordably. Granted the film is a bit pricey for both cameras you can buy in bulk to save. It's perfect for the spontaneous little wallet size family picture you can put up on the fridge etc. Almost like a hand held photo booth.","I absolutely love this camera, it's easy to use and the results are wonderful. I certainly will buy these as gifts next Christmas season!!!","Another great Christmas gift!! Great product!","Wonderful camera,  wonderful photo quality, and inexpensive film.  Love this!","Nice camera","Love these cameras and the pink is really cute.  Always a hit at any party!","It is not a raspberry color, it is a coral orange red. It looks nothing like it does in the picture.","I love this camera. I received it as a birthday gift from my husband. I've already gone through dozens of photos. I use it for parties mostly. The kids have fun with it and so do the adults. The pictures come out wonderful. It took a few photos to get the hang of the lighting, but I would definitely recommend this. It's a great gift for anyone really.","We LOVE this camera! It's so fun at parties!","I bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter.  The was thrilled!!  Easy enough to operate.","My wife used to love it although it was not very resistant","Just what I wanted","great buy - came exactly how it was advertised. works perfect. my daughter loves it.","It's great it just arrived! ","my teenage daughter loves it.  It was her Xmas gift.  easy to use and load film.  Retro instant film development.  See if before your eyes. Fun for Teens. Happy Purchase","Great camera! Love the mini instant pictures, great quality!","I'm so completely in love with this camera!! I got it for myself for Christmas, and it might just be my favorite Christmas gift ever. It takes super cute little vintage looking photos that pretty much always come out great! I couldn't have asked for more!","A Christmas gift, perfect! Beautiful color, very nice camera! Just wish it came with film!","My 8 year old loves her camera","Loved it","So much fun and so adorable!!! Be careful with color lenses attachments though, they will try to take the plastic around the lense off your camera.<br /><br />I love having instant memories to keep in my planner, can't wait to use this with my little one on the way","Doesn't come with any film.","I love love love my instax mini! It's easy to use and the color (baby blue) is adorable! I'm new to the photography scene so this camera makes it easy to take pictures and understand how to use it. Love!","Got this as a present for my brother and he loves it! Works great.","Best camera I've ever used. It's so fun. Wish it had more filters though","This was a birthday gift for my 12 year old daughter. She really loves it and has had a lot of fun taking pictures of her and her friends. Really cute concept. I almost broke the lense trying to remove the selfie lense the very first day she got it but thankfully she was able to put it back together.","I boughed for my daughter and she love it.","Works well!","Really nice!! Love it!!","This was purchased as a gift.  Fun instant camara","My granddaughter ;loves it.  It is very popular with her friends at college.","Great product and my girlfriend loves it. Brings the thing everywhere haha","great product! as described","Great camera. Works fine. Fairly easy to work for my 13 year old. Pictures are pretty small but she loves it!","I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH. Photo quality is so good and the picture size is so cute.","Super cool camera!  I love that this one takes AA batteries vs. some weird watch-type battery that you have to order special.  Also, loading the film is super simple.  I mean, you pretty much just match up the red arrow on the inside of the camera with the red arrow on the film and push the film in.  Super easy.  The pictures come out pretty nice, definitely not Ansel Adams quality and you'll end up with some duds that just don't come out right for whatever reason, but overall, its a cool camera that is alot of fun.  Get one of those photo albums designed for pictures of this size too, otherwise you'll have these little pictures all over the place!!","My granddaughter loved it!","Bought for my niece and she absolutely loved it!. Great item and pice to match!","Granddaughters loves it.  Easy to use","Awesome camera for the money","works great, nice pictures, bought for a child, really enjoys it","Love this camera for my son.","My daughter loves her new camera!","This is a nice camera but we ordered the wrong film.","My granddaughters, two of them got instax cameras, enjoyed very much our Christmas trip taking their own pics.","Works well and my kid loved it! That's pretty much all that matters.","The raspberry camera seems to be a bit more RED in color than what is shown on Amazon (even using different computer monitors and phones). I thought I was sent the RED model but the box says raspberry.<br />Other than the color issue, the camera works great and provides my girlfriend with awesome instant photos of friends and family during events.","Got here fast. Love this","Grandkids really liked the camera!","nice works great","great little camera. nice to still be able to do polaroid style photos for scrapbooking","I bought it for my daughter and she loves it - I'm glad she realizes how expensive the film is and doesn't waste it. It would be nice to have a way to take selfies with it (the reason it got a 4...an off selfie is a waste of film and the film is pricy...another reason for the 4).","Good product. Bought as gift.","Our grand children love this little camera. They get to see the pictures develop right before their eyes!","Really happy with this camera. This camera is for making memories stick inside a picture. Nice quality and the pictures look really good.","So much fun!","I bought this to took photos at my 32nd birthday drinks and found it a fun way to give people a memento of the night. The colors are a little washed out (but inline with the Polaroid style) the film is also quite pricey at between 50c and 75c a print. That being said, it's a fun occasional novelty.","We bought this camera for our daughter, she enjoys it very much. It is a bit bulky but worth carrying around for the instant images. :) She gets lots of use out of it.","Great gift for my 7 year old. She loves taking pics and getting them instantly.","GOOD QUALITY, COMES REALLY REALLY CUTE!!!","Great camera. Easy to use","Given as a Christmas gift.

She only wished there was a way to save the pictures too","Absolutely love it! Very entertaining and the photos make great wall décor.","Mini camera arrived on time and as expected!","This camera is amazing. It's easy to use, it's affordable and it takes amazing pictures. It has 5 settings and I would recommend purchasing film stickers because they make your polaroids pop :)","Thank you.","I really like this camera! I am still trying to figure out the best setting to put it on but it works pretty well. It is not the same as the photos you take on your phone but it is cute to have as photos you can put on your wall.","Thank you!","This camera is great for taking in the moment pictures. It is sturdy and easy to use. Definitely worth every penny.","So fun! Easy to use.","Kind of disappointed that it didn't come with a least a little photo paper.  Didn't realize it until it was opened Christmas morning.  Bummed when she couldn't use it right a way.......","Nice product. Works perfect.","16 year old step daughter loves this. Great gift. works great.","Takes awesome little pictures!","Bought this as a gift for my 13 year old niece and she loves it! Pictures come out with a vintage kind of filter. Really cool camera!","She loved it","Love my Instax! It is super easy to use and the pictures turn out so quickly. I would recommend using natural light when taking photos and try avoiding shadows because they will show up really dark in the photo. I am very happy with my camera so far. I have always wanted a polaroid camera and this one fit the price I was wanting.","Perfect!","I purchased this camera for my 12 year old. She absolutely loves it. The pictures look like the old Polaroids from the 90s . It's very easy to use. Would like if the viewing window was a bit bigger . Shipping time isn't a month it's 2 weeks.","This camera is my life!!! Totally worth it","I bought this camera for my little sister for her birthday and thought it was too cool so the next day I ordered the exact same one for myself. I really love it and it does what I expected it to do. Overall great little polaroid camera.","Gave as a gift. So far so good.","This was a smaller then I thought it was gonna be, but you know what..... Its to cute I love it.  It takes great pics.  This seems like it was a hot seller because i hard i hard time ordering it, it was always on back order, but I did get it before christmas.  Great camera","Gave it as a gift","my daughter loves this camera","My daughter LOVES her camera!!!!","Love this camera. Reminds me of one I had when I was younger. Photos look great hanging in a room from string lights. :)","Perfect Christmas gift. Life Is Not Measured By the Number of Breaths We Take, But By the Moments That Take Our Breath Away.","I love this camera so much! Maybe it's just the novelty of having a physical copy of the photo instantly or maybe it's how precious each picture is (even if it turns out badly!) because the film is limited. I find myself appreciating even the simplest photos. It really feels like capturing a moment in time, somehow more than regular cameras. Beyond loving the concept of camera, I've had no problems with mine. Everything works great and it's simple to use. Selfies with friends can be a little difficult but I don't mind. The only thing I will say against it is that it may not be a great gift for a younger person with no income or allowance as film can get expensive.","I bought this camera before Christmas as a treat for myself.  I didn't get a chance to actually use it until this weekend.  I absolutely love it!  So easy to use and my kids think it's pretty neat how the pictures come out.  My kids range in age from 5 to 18 and they had a ton of fun with it. Would highly recommend if you're looking for something fun and different than just your camera phone pics.  We won't use it all the time, but it would be a great camera to have on reception tables or parties for fun.","I absolutely love this camera! Blue is my favorite color and this shade of blue is perfect! Got it just in time for the holidays, couldnt be any more happier.","Excellent!","Great Product!","My 10 year old loves this camera!  Great product.","Purchased this camera for my niece as an xmas gift and she loves this camera. Easy to use and it comes in a lot of different fun colors.","This camera made the holidays even more fun with family. Easy to use, fast printing,  good quality.","My daughter loves hers but the pictures are very small.","My daughter loves it! Perfect for a tween! Easy to use!","my favorite camera. Takes great pics and is so cute","Happy 9 year old.","So cool and instant! Mini pics for treasured memories. I remember the big poloroid camera, as a kid. This is a pretty cool option for those who like holding a picture instantly! :)","Huge hit with my 7yo daughter. Great pictures! Everyone loves using it!","Used at my daughter's wedding. The guest loved the pictures and took great unexpected keepers!","Was a Christmas present for a 6 year old really loves it","Granddaughter was very happy with this gift. She is loving all the pictures.","Bought for a friend and it's very cute! Came in perfect condition and took great pics!","Very cute, easy to use, and produces nice little pics! I am planning to use this quite a bit :) Also a great picture for anyone who looks the more traditional feel/look of pictures and albums vs. a digital camera.","Ended up buying 2 of these. Kids love them and pictures come out great.","so far, so good. getting the battery compartment open was like busting into fort knox, and i was afraid i was going to break the cheap plastic body... but, we took a test photo and it worked great. got this specifically for a party coming up, can't wait to really put it to use.","My Daughter her Christmas gift, it was delivered as promised.  Couldn't be happier.  Thank you.","This is definetly the cutest thing that I have ever bought for myself and I don't regret it one bit. For the people complaining that the pictures aren't coming out right , make sure to read instructions first before claiming that it's the cameras fault. Everything is through trial and error. Look up video reviews or video manuals and maybe you'll learn something. I would definetly buy this again !","My daughters favorite Christmas gift!","My second time buying this camera (lost the first one on a bus -_-). It's simple and easy to use, a big hit among my family and friends, and I love how the pictures come out!","Expensive to use.","Just amazing!!! Love it!!","great camera","Takes really nice pictures","This was a gift and they love it.","Got it for my fiancé and she loves it. At first I wasn't so sure about it because it looks a little cheaply made but definitely an awesome buy.","Bought a couple of these for my 10 year old girls.  I think they are kinda of cheaply made for the money.  The pictures haven't been that great either and the explanation for proper adjustments aren't very good at all.  Also, the film is not cheap and most retails you will be paying $1 each picture.","Love it! Perfect for the little beginner photographer. Eye lense is a little small but for the price is great.","Love it","I love this. It creates instant mementos that are small and wallet-sized. It is definitely for snapshots of people, not vistas. The small pictures are also great to include in cards and letters.","cute camera but the film or the camera was damaged so all the pictures on our trip that my son took where horrible quality","This camera is awesome!  I'm so pleased with it !  Pics turn out great and very easy to use.","This was a Christmas gift for my 9yr old daughter & she loved it! Color was amazing!","Love this camera. Received it yesterday. Please note it doesn't come with film so you'll need to purchase that separately however they will ship together if you order them at the same thing. It's not great in low lighting but that is to be expected. Natural light works great but the right artificial light works well too. Very easy to put in film and film comes in a plastic case. You should not take film out of this case because it won't work right and will also expose the film. The first shot you take will not be a pic it will be part of the casing but after that it is all film until it runs out. Very happy with this product.","So much fun!","My daughter likes it.<br />Pictures I saw are overexposed.","My daughter loves this. Her favorite Christmas gift. She is 13","Was a gist, sure made a hit","Granddaughter loved it!! Ordering online and delivery could not have been better.","great camera","works as advertised so far no problems.","Wanted to find my daughter a camera that she could keep, and that gives a sense of my childhood. This camera is perfect for my little shutterbug. She's constantly snapping pics of her friends and family, nature, animals, or whatever she wants to remember. She has all of her friends wanting one now, and 2 of her friends took back Christmas gifts to get one of these cameras instead. Yay! Great product, so glad I bought it. It has a 4 settings for the lighting conditions, long battery life, very bright flash, very comfortable in your hands. Would totally recommend to anyone.","Fun little thing. Don't take pictures at night outside..They don't come through","Teen daughter loves this camera!! Only wish the film wasn't so pricey! :)","Love this camera! Present for my daughter. We just ordered another one in black.","Gift for grandson and he was thrilled with it.  Pictures are small (credit card size), but very good.","This is a great camera","Wonderful camera for what it is, I'd have to say the picture in the first review is BS, this camera is an instant camera and works great for what it is but your not going to get a crystal clear image like the picture from Africa like that one review, sorry. However this camera is a great complementary for all those younger photography enthusiast. Got this for a 15 year old who takes photography in high and bought this as an addition to the course required camera. I would read the reviews for tips and safe handling and care, I had my daughter read some and it helped her to know what and what not to do. This camera is not small but not bulky, use the strap that comes with it, this is important, you do not want to drop this camera....Or any camera. If you don't find my personal review helpful you can kiss it! I do not care!","It's perfect, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.","I LOVE THIS! I had the older model for this camera but it was time for me to retire it. I decided to get the Instax 8 and its so much better than the older models. The light settings is automatic so you don't have to check if you put it in the right setting. The quality seems like its the same as the older model though.. but I'm not sure.","Bought this for my son and I love it as much as he does! The film is hella expensive though.","Love this camera! It is so fun to have instant pictures!!","Love my camera. Highly recommend to anyone thinking about getting one!","Fast shipping, consistent with the description. I love it. It's excelent.","She loved this camera!!!  Especially the color!","My daughter loves this.","Pretty Cool!","Amazing camera! Make sure you read how to use the camera functions before you take pictures!","Love this....fast shipping fun item would purchase again from seller...","Exactly as stated","My 12 year old daughter requested this as her Christmas gift. Its easy to operate and she loves the \"vintage\" look of the pictures. There's different flash settings too, so tha'ts good.","This was a gift for my granddaughter, she loved it and it seemed to work well. She went through all her film Christmas eve.","Granddaughter loves it, no idea why.","Great fun camera for teenager. Pictures turn out pretty good.","Got this for my 12 year old niece and she loved it! It was really easy for her to use and get set up. She started taking pictures right away and the pictures were great. The camera really gets a nice wide angle.","The cutest Polaroid camera I have ever seen and SUPER easy to use! Our daughter got this for Christmas, and has loved it since day one!","My daughter loves this camera! The pictures aren't very sharp BUT she has SO much fun taking \"polaroids\" and we used it at Christmas, when she got it, and everyone just had a blast shaking the photos until they were clear. We will have to do some more playing with it to figure out the best lighting, but I think I'm with everyone else who has said outside daylight will probably be the best. The pictures just LOOK like they are from 1980, which is a super cool effect. Love it!","its ok I really wanted to return it but was told it is ineligble for return","My 11 year old granddaughter ask for this for Christmas & Loves it!<br />The trend is pre technology nostalgia!","Perfect!","love this camera. bought it for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it","I came super fast in the mail looks amazing and works perfectly!!","Very good product.","Amazing and the the pictures it's takes are beautiful! My girlfriend loved it!","Extremely happy with this camera. It was easy for my 11-year-old to work","Shot out of the picture is very clear, you can also take pictures side edge of the photo","Bought this for my younger sister for Christmas. It was a hit! Takes really awesome and clear pics, the size is about a credit card. I loved it so much that I just purchased one for myself moments ago. Worth the money and good to remember it's mostly for novelty so do not expect professional photo quality results. This camera is a lot of fun and a good way to capture those random spontaneous moments.","Good product","Pictures don't come out great!","Awesome little camera","good way to preserve memories","Granddaughter loves it","Perfect condition, very happy with my camera ","i love my poloroidddddd !! the eyes screen is kind of off a little, but other than that its awesome.","This is my second Instax camera purchase, I bought the first for my 11 yr old and her older sister was<br />always \"borrowing' it so I got her own of her own.  Picture quality isn't great but hey its a polaroid!<br />Can't expect high resolution. I dont like how expensive the film is, averages about a dollar per photo<br />but Ive found some great deals on Amazon for it for less.","Grand daughter loved it","Overall the camera meets expectations. However, one concern is this is an Asian market camera; so, the instruction booklet is not in English.","It works well. Pictures are good quality.","Excellent...my granddaughter loved all of this","Good product!  Kid likes it","This was purchased as a gift. It's a great little camera and will be used.","Product was as described.  I can't wait to capture our 2017 memories with this little gem.  The photos are small (about the size of a credit card) but quality of the photos is better than I expected and what you'd expect with a polaroid.  Its unfortunate the film is expensive but will plan on using coupons to purchase it.","I've really enjoyed using this camera over the last year or so and would definitely recommend it as a fun/novelty purchase.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- photos you can hold in your hand, or in my case - put on your fridge!<br />- battery lasts a long time, still haven't had to replace it<br />- flash is surprisingly good for indoor photos<br /><br />Cons:<br />- slow to warm up<br />- film counter broke in the first month<br />- clunky to carry around","Awesome little camera!","This is the first time I ever received a box that had to have some explanation on directions ..self explain, look, hope for the best!  The box with camera had papers, plastic card for film? I don' t know?? NO ENGLISH on NOTHING but my name on box it came in,felt horrible to see all these languages and I sure dont know what all this papers are for CAN,T read it.glad my father did not see this,he fought in the war for our freedom of speech for one ENGLISH!  going to keep camera, I think I will my buy electronics,cameras in person make sure I get ENGLISH","Too cute and a wonderful \"hands on a photo\" experience.","My daughter likes the camera.","Great product!","I bought it as a gift for my sister, and she loves it!","My kids have enjoyed these cameras.  I will say however you must understand that the pictures are very small and the film is expensive.  I purchased these for my kids for Christmas and they ran through their 20 pictures each in a little under 30 minutes.  So as long as you are prepared for tiny pictures that are not the best quality and spending the money for the film it is a lot of fun.","Awsome with so many age ranges. everyone wanted it at christmas from 6 year old kids to adult","Love this camera for getting quick shots to hang up on my wall at school.","my granddaughter loves it and thank you!","awesome","Gave to grand daughter as gift. Got big hug for it,  she loved. She is 13.","fun like the old days","Purchased this for my step-daughter for Christmas!  #1 She LOVED the color! #2 She'd been wanting this camera for awhile. #3 She's already has had so much fun with it!

Easy to use, and takes great pictures!","Perfect gift for my granddaughters","Love the compact design and ease of use.  We are planning to use this for our \"photobooth\" at our wedding!","as long as you know how to use it you will get great pics! I love this camera!","So cute, i love it!!!","These cameras are so cute and fun! We are enjoying them to the fullest. Great pictures!","Absolutely love!! It is very simple to setup with film. Only down side is that ALL the information manuals are in a different language. Overall the best investment I'ver ever made.","Love this! I was worried with how fast the batteries would drain on this, but even after a whole night of using these and 30 pictures later they are still strong! I don't have any complaints this camera works great!","Perfect for taking my travel pictures","It looks great but it's missing the film I got the base package it's supposed to come with 10 photos","got for my son as a fun camera since he into cannon and nikon. he loved it and had made a selfie wall for his friends","Picture quality isn't what I expected, but this was a gift for my 9 yo grandson and he thinks it's awesome.","Great little camera ! Takes good, clear pictures ! Teenagers Love It ! (Just wish Film was not so expensive ...)","nice toy","Very cool. Works great. Reminds me of polaroids we used to have just a little smaller.","Love it","Gave this as a gift for someone who wants to see their pictures instantly. The pix, while small, were sharp and clean, and most importantly...instant.","Such a great camera for the tweener years.  It is so fun and with the different films, and borders and frames.  It really is great.","Fujifilm Instant Mini 8 instant blue great camera I wish I known they had them sooner. Amazon is were I fined what I need.

Her friend was so happy to have an instant print of their fun together. I am sure it will go into a special box of treasures.","Great camera!","Shutterbug daughter loves it! Only drawback,  I just can't keep up with film refills.","Big hit for my granddaughters (8 and 10)! Easy to learn how to use the features and I like that they have to learn to be thoughtful about what they're taking pictures of, since unlike digital cameras, the film can run out! They also like having something \"real\" to hold after taken. Pics are small but kids like \"miniature\" things! (they have better eyesight than g'ma! haha) Very fun! Great gift!","I love it!!!","I LOVE my camera. I use it all the time. The pictures look so cute and vintage-y!","Love camera love price clearly stated .. Highly recommended ..","I was really little when my great grandmother carried around the original polaroid & I was so fascinated & obsessed that I wanted my own. My best friend was so kind & totally surprised me with my very own as a christmas present & I absolutely love it. This is great for photography lovers & if you are really sentimental about your photos. This product is amazing xx :)","Daughter loved it!","Loved by the two 14 yr old girls I gave it to for the holiday.  Takes good photos, though they are very small!!!","really nice camera. seems really sturdy and the picture quality is really good. My daughter loved it!","I love it! Works wonderful!! :)","Got as a gift. She loved it","It came a week early with all the film and accessories I ordered. Looks great with the white bunny selfie mirror and in the galaxy case. First picture turned out perfect, easy to use! Very excited to take pictures this winter and hopefully it snows here, I'll be outside a lot. Very pleased.","This was a gift for my granddaughter; she is very happy with it.","I was glad to make a little child heart happy","My 8 year old daughter loved the camera. It is super easy to use and lots of fun. Would recommend to all.","I bought this for my niece as a Christmas present and she loves it!!","Came as advertised takes great pics.","I love it original packaging and arrived on time","my grand daughter was thrilled to get this camera and the accessories for christmas","excellent, it was a present to my sister and she love it!","Bought it for my 11yr old daughter and actually takes great photos.  She loves it!","Love it!","Perfect item and my daughter loved it","Works great. Love the color!","received as expected","This arrived on time, and it works great!","Came arrived on time and works great.","This camera is adorable for teens. My daughter loves it. I do not. The film is incredibly overpriced($1/picture) and the camera has some faults that keep it from being awesome:<br />-film overpriced<br />- no zoom<br />-crappy light filters, sunny day pic looks awful, on the sun option, inside the house looked awful also on the house option.<br />It's cute, the teen likes it, but as someone who knows what photos should look like, these all look over exposed or under in some cases.<br />Disappointed mom","This is a really good camera for the price for my daughter.  Excellent deal and worth the fun for her to see what I had to use growing up. haha.<br /><br />Just wish it had English instructions included!!","My Granddaughter loves this little old school camera. Photos are smaller than the old ones","Bought this for our wedding. Guests had fun taking pictures and we displayed the pictures on a decorative board. It still gets good use, the kids love to play with it.","Who said Polaroid is dead :). Just kidding. My daughter loves this camera. It is great for Hobby projects, selfies, etc. Especially since you don't have to get them developed. Also great for school projects. Being children can't get pictures developed regularly anymore depending on where you live or if the parents have to remember to do it with there pictures. Digital has is issues too :).","Bought this as a christmas gift. She loved it!","Very cool! All works exactly as you want it to. Pictures are smaller than I thought (was thinking old school polaroid pictures) Gives that older picture over exposed look. Happy with the camera for sure!","This camera is so much fun. Bought as a grad gift for my sister and she loves it.","It was a gift and she loved it. Pictures are nice quality but very small. Just for fun kind of camera.","I bought this to take pictures of all my shoes and tape pictures on the outside of each box so I can tell without opening the box. The picture that comes from the camera is a perfect size for this.","https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009ZM9R4O/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0","Nice camera for my 8 and 9 year old.","Haven't gotten to use it yet because it is for a certain occasion but its very easy to handle and is cute.","It's the modern Polaroid camera.

She was thrilled! Beautiful color and unique.","Simple to use. My 6 year old LOVES it!","The instructions and other paperwork were all in Chinese. I could not understand any of it. It also did not come with film.","Bought this to granddaughter.  She loved it and and tried it out Christmas Day.  Good Pictures but the are a bit smaller than the old poleroid brands were.","My best friend loved it! She was so happy I got one for her she uses it anywhere and everywhere. I bought film from elsewhere and it worked great.","Its great but there should have been a side note on there not being any sheets to use for the camera so that was disappointed.","My niece so sooo happy to recurve this camera for Christmas. She loves it and says this is the best gift ever!","I got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. It's a really nice gift for anyone that likes taking pictures, and it's pretty cool how this camera prints out the little photos- it adds more meaning to them. I would recommend!","My daughter loves this camera. Works perfectly.","awesome cam","He loves the camera!  Photos smaller than orginial polarid cameras.  Camera is perfect for my 8 year old.","Love it!","Love the camera. Just have to get use to the settings and getting better images.","This is my new favorite camera! It's bigger than I had hoped, but it takes great photos and I look cute taking them! lol","Great size for carrying around. Love to use for scrapbook pages.","This was a gift for my granddaughter, and she loved it. She had so much fun taking snapshots with the camera","It came the day it said it would.I love it couldn't ask for more.","No problems","This a really great camera that produces neat pictures the way only Polaroid can. We got it for our daughter and she loves it. It did come with some glue wrapped around the bar that helps push out the picture so our first few pictures had a line down the side. But my husband was able to get it off with tweezers.","Worked well - we put it to use at a work Christmas party. It's a fun update to the old Polaroid camera. Has a good flash and provides clear pictures. If you use this camera for a party or set it up as a DIY Photo booth, I would suggest getting film with 60-100 pics per cartridge. Although the film with 10 pics per cartridge is cheaper, it is a bit of a hassle to change it out frequently in the midst of a line of people waiting to take pics. The camera itself worked great and was a lot of fun. Would recommend it!","Love love love this little camera!","Such a fun camera. Just be careful to set the camera depending on the conditions (sunny or inside). But other than that, a great product to bring to gatherings.","Great product! Delivery on time!","Got this as a gift and my girlfriend loved it. Bought it with the 60 film value pack so we would have plenty of pictures to take. Photos are better when taken inside. Outside photos tend to develop with lighting issues. Pictures are small (about the size of a credit card) so don't expect them to be as large as the ones the old polaroids took back in the day. They still come out great though and I would definitely recommend it!","Purchased this for a Christmas gift for my daughter.  BEST price anywhere.  Arrived in plenty of time and it works GREAT. she loves it.","I received this as a present and its wonderful","My daughter loves this camera however the batteries that was included was dead","Happy","Bought for a Christmas gift","Bought as a Christmas gift for my Daughter. She loves it!","Cute for taking pictures but the pictures don't have alot of focus but would rather buy one that was professional for and instant camera!!!!!!!","Works great and good color choices. I think it's kind of expensive for what you get though.","I bought this as a gift and the picture quality is great and she loved it but the film is expensive","Throwback to the old Polaroid instant camera, but smaller photos. Easy to use.","Works so well!!!! If your thinking of buying this do it. These are soem of the photo's I took with this camera.","good","I was really excited when my mom and dad got this for me for Christmas, and a friend of mine got the exact same thing. The camera is really cute, it works well. I love the fact that the camera can develop it's own film!!!! Really happy that this was what I got for Christmas!!!","I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she can't put it down!","Perfect","I gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas. She was so happy!","Our daughter, 5, got this and she loves it. She is quite good at looking through the view finder to center pictures and i was concerned that she would have some difficulty. Once shown, she easily figured out the controls to open, snap the picture, and close the lens. She was also told to use the film sparingly and only for certain special occassions as it was quite expensive to have 10 pictures of her stuffed bear. She has managed well and now has a good album started of her holiday with family and friends and only a couple of her bear and a few of the family pets. Even our 80 year old grandmother wants one after she saw her use it and the ease of operation. i enjoy using it and must resist the urge to use it to frequently. It's just so easy and the pictures turn out in decent quality. For young kids this is definitely more fun than the kidizoom digital camera as long as the child is mature enough to understand they cannot take pictures of the floor and ceiling all of the time, that it's for real picturesque scenes and subjects only and if they are quick learners and able to adequately use a viewfinder with a squinted eye.","My package came in ripped and beaten I was worried that the camera would be broke. But it turned out okay. Camera itself is really cute love the white","We got both our girls one of these and they love them! Great activity to get them outside and enjoy it! Our girls are 8 and 9 and have no problem using these and changing the film!","If you are wanting a bit of nystalgia, this is something to get! I also like the fact that everyone isn't seeing my pictures that I take. It works very well and takes good poloroids.","this camera is awesome, doesn't come with film. the film is ridiculously expensive so make sure you take that into consideration.","My daughter loved it.","Happy Happy Happy","Great","Would give 5 stars if it came with film","After some research on FujiFilm's website (ultimately buying from Amazon with Prime, we decided to go with the Mini 8 instant. It is a nice camera for my daughter to start out with regarding the size, pricing, and she loves the fun color, cute size pictures, and the idea of the the pictures instantly printing out is fun to her. Of course, I remember the old Polaroid style pictures and this is a fun reminder of those camera. The camera itself came well packaged without any damage.","This is exactly what my grandaughter wanted and she is very happy with it.","Wish the pictures were larger","my grand daughter loved this","Cute. The pictures turn out well but make sure you have the right lighting. My 11 year old daughter loves it. I wish there was more then 10 pictures per roll of film but that doesn't reflect the quality of the camera","Bringing back the era of the instant photo.  Fun for a new generation of kids who can experience the instant photo phenomenon all over again!  This instant camera works well, and is pretty much idiot proof!  Takes great wallet sized pictures.","film too expensive","It's cute, but low quality. My daughter liked it my though.","I brought this camera for my daughter and she loves it.","Instant hit!","Got it for my girlfriend for Christmas and she has been absolutely thrilled! loves it. Time will tell if it holds up but for now no problems","Just what we wanted!","I got this for my daughter.It's easy to use and she loves it","Slightly larger camera than we expected. I think it will be great fun- however we did not get to use it as planned over our Christmas vacation because it comes with NO FILM to get started! We were not near a store to buy film on the holiday (which was why we ordered from Amazon to have it delivered in the first place....) but overall, I think it will be a great camera for instant pics on our next get together.","Camera fits nicely on this case","Really like it ","My granddaughter loved it!  I was disappointed that it did not come with film.","Perfect","Excelente","Very nostalgic little camera. The quality is fantastic, it's easy to use, very portable, and a lot of fun. Makes a great gift for anyone any age","This was a big hit with my kids, especially on our vaca and when they are around friends or just around the house.  They have fun just taking impromptu pictures and then hanging them around our house.","Nice for making instant memories. Good quality too","Christmas gift for 7 year old daughter and she absolutely loved it. Easy to use and cute pictures. There was a slight defect on the one she received and Amazon replaced it with no problem.","It said in the description that it was new but box was not sealed. The box was kinda yellowish and looked old. The different modes it had do not work. It's stuck on its default mode. I can't argue that it takes photos and they look great. Amazon was out of stock so I had to go with this 3rd party seller. Not disappointed though.","Great","Excellent little camera for price. Takes a bit of practice to get used to the old style photo taking  though. Film is a bit pricey so trying not to waste any shots. Works out to $1.00 a click. But the instant photos are great entertainment. Fun for a party or large group. My teen is making a collage of photos for her room.","Bought this as a gift for my 7 year old son for Christmas.  He really enjoys it and it is easy for him to use.  Affordable buy for those who are or have photo enthusiasts in their lives.","my wife love it","This ia a good gift for a young girl of the age of 9 or so","my granddaughter loves this","Fun to play with this camera. A few things I didn't care for. There is only 10 pictures in one pack and they aren't that cheap. The other problem is you have to sometimes cover the flash or the pictures come out white. I've only taken 10 pictures and maybe 6 look okay.","granddaughter loves this.  thanks","Was is Christmas present and step-daughter was in love with it.. great product .","Great little camera!","Yasssssssss! I love it so much!","Great for teenagers","10 year old daughter loves it","great","My 15 year old loved this gift.  It was her favorite present!  The film is not cheap but its fun and you get a one-of-a-kind memory.","Love it","Grand daughter is happy with this camera.  She can see the results immediately.","Ordered 4 granddaughter. She is very pleased.","Daughter loved!","Excellent camera","Bought this for a gift to give to my sister and she loves it!","You have to read the directions before you load film and try to use it. But the picture quality s great under optimal conditions. Such a great gift. We got some great pictures out of this on Christmas day and will hang them on the tree next year.","Love it","LOVE! So much fun to use","Really good i ran out of fipm in one day got it to day","Love the camara, love the color.everyone loves it<br />It is too cute, love how the pictures look. I love the fact that I can hold a picture in my hand. 100% satisfied!!!!!!!!","Fun and awesome","Excelent for my grandchildren! They enjoy all day !!","such fun for the youngest - who would have thought this style of cameras would come back and that the kids would love them.  Put they love to hear that sound as the picture pops out the top and they shake it to let them dry.  Brings back memories!","This was at the top of my 10 yr old's wish list and now that she has it, she loves it! Works great so far!","My daughter loves this camera.  The pictures are nice considering it is instant. If comparing to a new digital (or DSLR) then the pictures will not be as nice.  But for the type of camera the pictures are very good.","Awesome and beautiful came as described. Love it","my grandsons got them for christmas","Great product and service, Thank you","Was super happy to have what I think is One of The must have \"Christmas gifts of the Year\" Love love love my new Instax!!!!!

WorKS great<br />Price was amazing<br />Got it on time<br />Thank you so much.","my daughter loves her new camera.","Works fine, just small pictures. Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas, and she is very happy to have it, so whatever I feel matters not.","fast, fun camera. Takes more of a retro,darker picture.","Purchased for my niece and she hasn't put it down. As she said, \"best Christmas present ever.\" Works great easy to use. Pictures are reminiscent of older photos from 1970's cameras.","So happy! Received this as a Christmas gift! The instructions take a little while to figure out, because English is not on the first page. Oh well. The camera is easy to use, just point and shoot. Film seems easy to reload.<br /><br />Pictures that I have taken so far come out looking like I shot them back in the 80's and just pulled them out of a drawer a few days ago. Not a deal breaker for me.","This was a gift to my granddaughter, who says that she loves it.","Love the color, picture quality is actually pretty good. Seems like a good quality","much fun.","Expeceotional price!","The teenager loves it!","My granddaughter requested it and loves it!","Nice camera for price","Super fast love the camera!","I got this for my daughters 12th birthday this December.

She loves it and can't wait to use it when she gets back to school.  They love the old school way of taking pictures.","So far go good. Gave this to my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.

On time","Got this for my sister and she LOVES it! Pictures tend to come out a little dark, but there's tutorials on the Fujifilm website, and on Youtube to avoid this.","Daughter loves it.","My dad got me this camera and I screamed out of joy all the pictures have turned out excellent and I taken such good care I would definitely recommend this to a friend or buy it as a gift","Love it! So many good photos.","It is a great first, simple, easy instant camera to have. Order came quick. Takes very cute, small pictures. Keep in mind the not so cheap film you have to keep buying but even a child can operate this easy camera. But careful, because besides the fact that the flash doesn't turn off, it won't go far for dark places when taking pictures. Because all you will see is darkness or a completely black film. Just keep in mind that for the price, it is a cute start for very simple photography as a hobby, other wuse look else where, but overall I do like it.","This is such a fun gift for girls! My daughter (12) loves this! I know several of her friends that have one also. I wish the film was cheaper for it but otherwise, no complaints! Great camera!","The color is a bit lighter than seen here it's more of a hot pink but I love this camera! The size and design is super cute and the photos are really cool. The photos aren't like 1,000 camera type but more of a retro not as defined featured. The film takes about 2 minutes to expose which is pretty fast it's a great camera for someone like me just learning about and using instant cameras. I highly recommend this product to anyone 10 or up is a good age range. Also, the price is great too, I got the white case it's snug and very pretty and the selfie lens helps a lot hope you guys have fun with this camera!","I loved this camera! I got it for a friends wedding reception so people could take pictures and write on the bottom, and it worked perfect! All of the pictures turned out great and they have that vintage Polaroid look to them. Very easy to use and figure out.","I love it! Showed it to my boyfriend and he sure enjoyed taking pictures with this camera! I was surprised he did. (:<br />I've had this camera for about a year and buying film is the only thing that you'll need to be buying once in a while, but I would say it's worth it.","Great camera! Purchased as a gift. Receiver used it immediately with no issues and enjoyed it.","This camera along with film and case were a Christmas present for our grandson. The shipping was fast and well packed. My grandson loves it and is having a ball taking pictures.","Easy to use, cute pictures","Camera works great and my 10 year old granddaughter loves it putting all her \" memories \" in a book made for the small pictures","Cute little camera. I bought this for my 15 year old for Christmas and she loves it.  Shipping was fast and I like that. Thank you","Great camera. Good retro fun!","This is one of the most fun devices a teenager (or adult) can own. Both my daughters and nieces have it and have taken hundreds of photos. The best part is they keep it as a moment for life. They display them everywhere... even on a Christmas tree","This was a gift for an 8 year old boy and it was quite a hit. Picture quality similar to old polaroid cameras, that retro instant film soft look. The only downside is he can quickly run through the film packs.","Nice","It worked okay, but seemed to be a \"Fad\" the kids were into. She doesn't even use it anymore, and the film is expensive.","Super cute!!! Comes w a strap. Works perfect!!","Point and shoot but photo quality is poor :(","Christmas purchase for my wife. So far so good. She was excited and is enjoying it so far. You get instant quality pictures and she is having fun with it. Great purchase!","This camera was a gift for my Granddaughter. She loves the camera and it takes good pictures.","Love It!","perfect","My daughter loves it","LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera.  I purchased two, one for each of my girls (12 and 10 years old), for Christmas and it was a huge hit! It is very easy to get going, the instructions are also pretty clear. The pictures, though a bit small, are great. Again, an amazing present! I also purchased the accessories and film separately. I am getting ready to purchase more film.<br />Love that my girls are able to take pictures and immediately be able to see them printed. It also helps them be a bit more \"cautious\" on how many pictures they take. Makes them be more thoughtful before taking the shot. :-)","I think they're a waste of money, but they're all the rage right now. The photos are tiny and the film goes fast, but super fun novelty item for my daughter to take on outings and capture memories with her friends. Good quality, good packaging and fast shipping. The yellow is great. Retro feel, but still soft and pretty.","good","Amazing!","My niece loved it!!!!!! Glad she approved since she is very picky!!!","Granddaughter  loved it.  The  picture are small but looks good","This was a really fun gift for my sister.  She is in her late teens and Polaroids are all the rage.  I purchased film separately (hint, hint: it's not included) and was a little surprised at the cost.  Still looking for a cheaper film, but love the camera.  It is really easy to use, but keep in mind that it is lower technology.  The photos are more grainy and less focused than we are used to.  A novelty gift, but very fun!","My daughter thinks this \"new\" creation is genious","MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES IT.","Useful and vintage","Use this for my wedding selfies. The pics are small but it was a great idea. People had fun with it","Great camera! It's been fun!","MY DAUGTHER LIKE AND SHE IS ENJOYED USING.","I love this camera. Such a great purchase.","Happy with product","Pictures aren't the greatest, but your youngster will like the whole set up.","All good!","Love it! Light weight, easy to use. Great pictures","I purchased this item as a gift and it was well received","I bought the camera for my granddaughter and she loved it. It was a perfect gift.","Amazing camera that captures a moment to save it forever. Many people like it. It's a great gift.","We got this camera for ur daughter and we all enjoy using it and taking photos. I wish they were bigger tho. The photo quality is good and they now have a special attachment that you can take selfies with. Very cute and user friendly. Compared to the Polaroid Snap (we returned that one!) that we bought for our other daughter this one took much better quality photos of the same size and it has the border.","Great ,kid loved it","So easy to use and such a fun way to capture memories!","As pictured.","Fun for kids!!! My daughter loved it!","This was bought as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. She absolutely loved it.","fun camera !!!","My daughter loves it, the polaroid is resurrected!<br />Cool! Just be sure to watch some youtube videos to learn how to use the lighting settings, will save you some film.","The one word I would use for this camera is 'impractical'. But, my 16 yo daughter loves it and shares the pictures will all her friends (to our chagrin because that film is so darn expensive!)","Very easy to use. Light weight. Daughter loves it","So happy that polaroid is coming back in style. The yellow is such a cute color too. Film may seem a little expensive but what do you expect. Came on time and is a great product. I just wish the film size was bigger like the original polaroids.","Got this for my wife and she had been happy with it. It's very easy to use. Add batteries, load film, point and shoot. Like the old school feel with the instant film.","My daughter loves this camera !!!","Nice","Fun little camera to take with you on special adventures.  I love it!","Perfect condition.","We bought for our 10 year old neice - she loves this camera and the ability to write on the pictures","Bought this for grandaughter and she loved it.","NEICE LOVED THIS","I had the job of setting this up for my 10 year old.  He had his heart set on this camera--the thought of having a camera that would spit out the photos right away amazed him!  The camera is pretty light weight and the lens part is VERY light-almost to the point you wonder if it will fall off.  Learning which lighting settings will work best in certain conditions will take some practice, we took two pictures last night and while we are sure we didn't have the settings right, the pictures still turned out nicely.  This camera comes with the batteries needed to make it work, however, the battery spot on the camera has VERY hard to read writing telling which way the batteries go in and so much of the directions are in another language, a very small part in English.  For those two reasons alone I give it four out of five stars.<br /><br />*** My opinions are my own and we're not influenced by the seller in anyway.

My 12 year old likes to take pictures with this camera but the film was pretty shotty so you have to cross your fingers and hope you don't get bad film. Apparently this is a big issues... we learned this after the fact.","This was a gift for my daughter.  She absolutely loved it!  Takes great pictures!","My wife loved this as a Christmas gift.  It is super fun and extremely easy to use.  I am thinking about getting one for myself as well.  Would highly recommend to anyone who is considering purchasing it.","Great camera my daughter loves it","Cool product.","My granddaughter loved it.  It really makes beautiful pictures","My wife loves it","A Christmas present for my daughter she loves it","Daughter (11) loves this camera! Very easy to use.

A+++++","Daughter loved it.","I ordered this for my mother in law for Christmas and she went crazy! She was so excited and we had so much fun using it for the duration of the day. I saw this for sale at other places like Best Buy for more expensive so I am so glad I purchased through Amazon.","My 14 year old daughter had wanted one of these for a while and we used the opportunity of a Mexican vacation as an excuse to get her one. We took hundreds of photos with our DSLR on the trip, but honestly the ones she took with her Instax on this trip ended up being our favorites. Now she is wanting to upgrade to the higher end versions of these Instax cameras with more manual features. This camera was great for travel since it was a durable plastic and you werent really too concerned with damaging it because it is really affordable.","Takes great pictures","This was bought as a gift for my 6 year old son, he enjoys watching his older sister take pictures so much.  We thought we'd get him this, a lot cheaper and for him to be able to see the picture immediately.  My family and I had more fun with the camera than my son, we used all the film and I've had to order more film.  The pictures are so old school, but adorable.  It's funny two of the adults now want to purchase this camera.","My daughter-in-law loves her new camera. She was taking pictures soon after opening it. Very easy to use.","Fun and easy to use","Great camera that does exactly as described. Would recommend. Also, good communication from the seller.","Easy to use","classic awesomeness. Don't shake it \"like a polaroid\". Despite what the great Hip Hop artist Andre 3000 said, it is better to let these photos just chill out for a few minutes for your instantly developed photo to appear with that wonderful nostalgic display.","BEST.CAMERA.EVER.. it's just FUN! ok so the pics aren't as good as your smart phone or your high tech iPhone, BUT, it's sooo much more convenient.. i don't know when the last time i went to a kiosk and printed pictures was.. with this, i want a picture, print it out, and it's available IMMEDIETELY to look at, or whenever i choose.. i bought an album for it as well, which was another score.. GET.THIS. and the white is such a great color","Bought this camera for my daughter for her Christmas gift along with an accessories kit. She absolutely loves it! I loved to see her so happy that  she finally got the camera she has been wanting. Works great, does exactly what it is supposed to and my daughter and her friends love to share the pictures, put them in frames, keep their memories of those great moments.","This was a gift for my hard to buy for 12 year old daughter and she loves it!!","I bought this as a gift for my neice and she loved it. Just a reminder to those looking for the selfie mirror, that feature does not come in this model but in the mini 8+. She was a bit disappointed there wasn't a selfie mirror to facilitate taking pictures of herself and friends. ha! she's 12 so, that's a must for any pre-teen, teen looking to take pictures. Other than that, it was an instant hit- no pun intended.","The colors aren't as vibrant as you would expect.  And the pictures are a little fuzzy. The actual pictures come out smaller than the old time Poloroid cameras.  It is a fun camera but the quality is about the same as those photo booth pictures.  I gave it a higher rating because my kid still LOVES it and that is what matters the most to me.","My daughter loves her new camera.  Just as shown.","My granddaughter loves the camera. But I need a replacement strap as the metal clip was broken. Can you send a replacement? Otherwise we loved everything. Thank you.","Daughter loves it, but the price of film is outrageous.","Granddaughter loved it.  Pictures are real clear","All pictures came out over exposed, guess it takes some practice...","My daughter loves it...well pleased..fast shipping","Camera color is exactly as shown in image and came with batteries.  Flash and zoom are easy to operate, film is easy to load and picture feed comes from the top of the camera.  Display of number of photos left is on back and a good feature.  This camera  is light weight and an ideal gift for the teen we purchased it for.","Great camera, really fun and easy to use","Well worth the money. I love the fact that you can have an instant picture, it makes it all the more special of a captured moment. I did have some issues with shipping but Amazon's customer service was very friendly and upgraded my order to one day shipping for free! Thank you Amazon. I love my camera!","It was a BIG hit with the family.  My granddaughter was taking pics all day on Christmas day.  The pictures come out clear and the older family members truly enjoyed remembering the polaroid cameras when we were younger.","Perfect my girlfriend loved it!!! Nice to have something tangible and to hold, and perfect for parties.","as advertised.  works great.  kids love it.","A very cute gift, I'd love one for myself. However, there should be a clear message for the type of film it requires to save any trouble for buyers.","Cute.","My daughter was totally stoked with the camera and it is PINK!!!  I think she read all of the instructions included and went on youtube to find even more tips. It was a great gift choice. Score for dad!!  I hope the camera holds up for years and my daughter uses it forever.","Excellent camera for kids.","Huge hit! Works as advertised! Stepdaughter LOVES it.","Made a Great Granddaughter very happy","This camera was on my daughter's Christmas list, so she was thrilled when she opened her gift...so far, she's loving it:)","Love the camera, only comment is that the color, \"raspberry\" is less hot pinkish and more dark red.","Fun","Perfect gift for my 8 yr old; she loves it","Kinda disappointed that no \"starter\" film came with the camera.  I did go out and buy some...but being this is my first Polaroid purchase, I didn't know what it needed and purchased wrong.  So we couldn't use it Christmas day.  I kept it hidden in the box til Christmas morning and didn't gey to read the box.  So it was my fault...but it would be nice to have a 10pack of film to learn how to use it.  My opinion.","Only has been used for a couple days.  But no complaints from my 14 year old that I bought it for.  Seems to be well made.","Very cool item. Came fast. Very happy","This camera is exactly what I expected.","My daughter received this for Christmas and loves it.

Just like old school polaroids!!!!","I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter for Christmas and she loves it, it takes good pictures. My only complaint is the battery cover seems to keep falling off.

Never really seen a 17 year old so excited over a Christmas present.","Ok","Got this as a gift for my 9 yr old and she loves it. The pics are just the right size for her little hands","A fun mini polaroid camera that takes great pictures. It can be difficult to figure out the lighting as I've had a lot of wasted pictures, but when ones do come out they are simply magical.

Our daughter loves this.","I bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas as she asked for one and she was thrilled to receive it","Awesome, my daughter loves it.","My mom got me this for Christmas. So excited when I first opened it!<br />There were a couple of downsides, but those were easy fixes!<br />SOME TIPS-<br />·Dont do close ups. They turn out weirdly.<br />·If you take a photo of yourself in front of the mirror, it will come out all white with black. (Like...ew.)<br />·There is no way to turn flash off. But, the flash makes the photos better, so no worries!<br />·When the first photo is taken, nothing comes out, except for the top of the film cartridge, so don't freak out!<br />·The photo takes about 1-2 minutes to fully be done. (The photo comes out white, and then slowly comes to life!)<br />·No shiny things! :P<br />·DONT EXPOSE FILM TO LIGHT!<br />The camera is amazing with great quality, and I hope this helps you! :)<br />Have fun with the camera! :P","This camera is so fun. This was a gift for a 9 year old and was a hit. It's easy to use and great for and tween, teen, or any age after. The picture are around the size of a credit card.","Cutest camera ever.

They immediately opened it, loaded with film after installing the batteries and began snapping pictures. They had just seen someone using this kind of camera the night before we gave it to them, and so knew exactly how to use it. Later their mother sent me a text saying they both told her it was the BEST Christmas present that they received!","Made a great gift!","Inside pictures are kinda dark. But it's fun to use.","So Much fun! I got this as a Christmas gift and it's so nice to be able to give photos to friends and family right there on the spot.","So much fun!!

Just so you're not surprised. ","Works and looks great.","Pictures develop quickly! The different settings for low or full light is great!","My daughter totally loves this camera. Takes great pics.

Love the pink color & it works great. Make sure you check all your resources to make sure you get your product for the best price. Amazon had the best price & then I found out walmart had the same camera for $10 cheaper so you never know.","my niece absolutely loves it","LOVEd it","I bought as gift for my 17 year old daughter.  She loves it.  A year later and she's still using it.","So fun! There are a few lighting settings available to you but it has a sensor as well to help with the flash. I wish the film was a little less but this a great intro to the basics of photography for a young teen/older child. My daughter is 11 and she would rather use her camera than her phone to take photos now. The film has a very interesting high contrast tonal quality to it that is somewhat unique and looks a little retro. This isn't a way to take gorgeous, perfect, bright, colorful pictures but it does let you take pictures with character that highlight people and have a way of being very forgiving. We bought her some of the accessories like a case and some color filters for the lens and a photo wallet to help keep her interest while she got better with the camera and the film. They also do make film that has colors and patterns instead of plain white around the photo. I would recommend it to anyone with a creative minded kid looking for something new for them to explore.","Only giving 3 stars. This camera does NOT include film. That is the dumbest thing!","My daughter loved taking pictures with this camera. It even brought back old school memories for me when she started to shake it like a Polaroid picture!!","My granddaughter loves it","Braylynn","Wife loved it pictures are small but very clear ..good work<br />Fujifilm Thanks","Broke after 6 pictures :/","So far so good.

I soo recommend it!","granddaughter was happy","I like this a lot it's super cute. Cheaper to buy them on Amazon.","I ordered this camera for my 8 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  Thankfully I also ordered a  lot of extra film because she has not put it down since opening it this morning. She really loves the fact that she can see her pictures that she took immediately. The casing feels pretty durable and appears that it will hold up during extensive use by a young child.  It is really  pretty easy to use and we have found no issues with it yet. The delivery of this camera was on time. I would definitely recommend this product as well as the seller","Some pictures don't come out right. But it's easy to use and cute. So it could be user error.","Gift for my 10yr old. She LOVES IT! Pretty color. So much fun to use.","Great item","My 8 year old loves it!","gift for my daughter..she loved it.

Not very expensive either.","Please note, for customers purchasing this device, the camera does not come with film","Bought this for my daughter attending  art school.

Everyone loved it and it's super easy to use. Takes cute little nostalgic instant photos.","I am in love with this camera from the way it looks to how it feels in my hands. I don't have to worry about taking multiple pictures hoping for a decent pic because every single one turned out beautifully with this camera. Highly recommended :D","NOT BAD","I bought this for my niece who is 10.  Very fun for her to take pics of her friends.  Batteries are included.

I love it :)","Good product, happy with purchase.","This is a very nice camera.  It produces quality pictures!","I prepared to give my boyfriend a Christmas present. Happy Christmas","Love it!

It takes very good pictures.","Hi, I purchased this camera for a Christmas gift.  I was under the understanding that included with purchase would be a certificate for some free photo's. ??? I did not receive the certificate :-(Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (White)","Pictures are a little smaller but works great and would be great for parties. I plan to take this on my trip to capture some of my travel mates and give the actual picture to them. I am a picture person versus always taking with a phone. This way they will have a physical lasting memory as they have a tendency to change phones and somehow lose some of the pictures they took in their last phone or don't have time to have it developed.","I love this camera, really easy to use and pictures comes out great!> great gift!","MY god-daughter loves it","It arrived as fast as I expected it to, It very cute and light weighted.","Haven't used it yet as it is a Christmas gift for my 10year old grandchild.","When I have parties I always put out this camera and a few packages of film. Guests can take pictures and hang them on a clothes line throughout the night and it's a great addition! I love keeping a collection of the photos from each event and hanging them up around my house. The film can get a bit expensive, but overall I've really enjoyed this purchase.","It's a nice camera, easy to use and has some options for taking pictures in differents modes.","nice","I won Christmas with this gift!!!!

Came with batteries and works perfectly. I LOVE IT!!!!!","I'm writing this review for the blue instax. I bought it in June and now we're in December. That's how long it lasted me. I took really good care of it. Never dropped it, always had it in a case, no water damage. But the other day when I was wanting to take a photo with my friends the button that takes the photo just wasn't working at all. It could be pushed but no photo was dispensing out of the camera. Also the small red light that's supposed to turn on when the camera is on to show what filter to use was completely out. I checked the batteries but that wasn't the problem since they were new and the small red light next to where you're supposed to look to see the photo was blinking red. I'm really disappointed that the camera only lasted 6 months. Unfortunately I'm not sure if returns can be made or some type of recomposition. I will probably buy another instax just because of how much I loved it but I'm still really disappointed in how long it lasted. The camera itself is really easy to use, the photos come out with beautiful hues and it's a fun camera to have when going on trips or just out with friends.","This is a great purchase - super cute and I bought it for my male friend as his favorite color is red. Unisex!","Bought this for my 10 year old daughter. She loves this camera. It takes good pictures and is easy to use.","My daughter loves it","Just what my daughter wanted","Good!","Love this camera. Simple set up. Super cute and stylish. For any age! Never think you are too old for this!! Highly recommended.","Very cute instant camera.  My daughter wanted one for her 9th birthday, so we purchased this one.  She loves taking pictures of her friends/little sister and all the accessories you can get to go with the camera and for the pictures.  Fun camera.","Christmas gift!","So much fun and retro coolness!  People are just fascinated by these photos and they make great party giveaways!","Nice camera! It's just hard to take very far away and very up close photos","Purchased as a Christmas gift,  I have no feedback at this time.","My fiancee loved this! I bought it for her for her birthday!","Gave it to my sister in law and she loves it. Great for scrapbooking and selfies I guess.","I received this for Christmas and it is wonderful! I've already taken so many photos and they are just gorgeous!!! The camera is so so easy to work and setup. Only con I had is that film is separate and a bit expensive but whatever, I'll keep buying the film for the Polaroid cause I'm stunned by these results","Amazing quality!!","pictures small","Excellent pictures!","Great camera for party photobooth, also a great learning camera for hobby photographers.<br /><br />The quality is so different from spoiled digital photographs, and we have to be more selective of what we shoot, but it has a nice authenticity and vintage feel to all the pictures. Loving it so far.","Fast delivery, low price. Great camera.","Daughter loves it, but film is a little pricey.","BUY THIS ON AMAZON. THEY ARE THE CHEAPEST HERE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS ANYWHERE ELSE.<br /><br />Perfect gift for anyone for christmas. I love it.","this is just perfect, great quality picture!","Price was standard and I was really disappointed that it did not have ANY film with it! Good thing that I ordered backup!","Bought this for my sister as a birthday gift and it works amazing! She really loves it and everything works great. Looks exactly as the photo shows above.","Gift for 8 year old grand-daughter, she loves it..  But film expensive so she is selective on pic she takes.","Item arrived quickly and as expected","Happy with the camera.","I love it  but this is a  gift","Bought as gift for my ten yr old grand daughter.  She loves it. Her mom put film in for her and she was snapping pics like crazy.  Perfect tween gift.","Bought this for my daughter for her birthday....She loves it!","Love it!","excellent","I bring this when I visit friends, when I go to conventions, and to holiday parties, and everyone gets the hugest kick out of it. It's fantastic for creating instant mementos and everyone has a lot of fun taking photos.","Love it and it is so cute and convenient!!! Gonna make a lot of memories with it!! ?? Just blinged it up a little! ;)","Fad or trend my daughter was insistent about this as a Christmas present.","My daughter loves it, she finally found a hobby.","Very good quality pictures, very durable","this is a gift and my granddaughter will love it","Absolutely love this camera. Love the color and the cute caramel bag I got to protect it. I love the way the pictures turn out. Just have to make sure that the setting is switched for the lighting. I love having a physical print instantly.","This camera is so much fun! The film for it only comes with 10 photos per film pack I would by a couple off amazon they are way cheaper on here then walmart, or target! Such a fun gift for a tween she really is having so much fun taking pictures and having them right away","Perfect for parties and/or gifts!!!! Love it!","I LOVE this camera so much. I bring it to all my parties and people love it. The camera and case are a great buy, the film is where it can be a little expensive. Buy in bulk if you can. The pictures turn out great, but note that you won't get a picture like you would on your phone, as all the settings add a sort of \"vintage\" look to the pictures. You need to figure out the right setting as well, which might take you a couple photos to get. The only other thing is that sometimes the camera will turn on while it's in the case and might run down the batteries but I haven't had to replace them yet. Overall, LOVE this camera and it's a lot of fun.","Good quality","Great product and fast shipping","Very easy to use. Great photos","great¡¡¡ the camera is fancy","This camera is loads of fun.","Came brand new and in perfect condition. It worked right away, and I absolutely loved it.","Good price","Fun,  This camera is Fun, Fun, a blast at parties to take quick little shots of friends  moments in time!

It looks just like the photo","Great gift idea.","Purchased item for my wife and she loves it. Every time she takes it to parties everyone wants there picture take. Personally feel like it was a great investment. Only down fall is the price for the film. But besides that we love the item.","it was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.","works as described","I got this for my daughter, and she loves it. The camera does a surprisingly good job. I bought some extra film so I can give it a try!","I really love my fuji camera.  I even got one for some friends as a gift.  I take it for camping trips in my 1970 VW bus to take pictures of people I meet along the way to remember them by.  I also take pictures of people I meet and give them the print.  It is a fun way to spread happiness.  My only wish would be that the film were more economical.  $1 per picture is pretty pricey.  I would use my camera more if the film wasn't so expensive.","Love it. shipped quickly. will make a great gift.","This deal was amazing! Everything got to me in perfect conditions and i loved it, easy to set up with the film","It was exactly what I ordered! The camera itself works smoothly and is true to the color in the picture. 10/10","works great and a fun color","Great quality , came within a good time frame","The aperature button doesn't usually work the first 1-3 times.

The product came in good condition and arrived on time.  I can't wait for her to open this gift, she's going to be so excited.","Looks red :(","Such a cute find for a cheap price! I've owned a couple of old polaroid cameras, and this has been the easiest to use. Very portable and fun!","Absolutely loved it! I used it for my wedding it was a hit everyone wanted to take a Polaroid picture","BEAUTIFUL!","cool..","Great camera for scrapbooking!!!","it is the cutest thig!","OK Camera<br />I just received this as an early Christmas present so that I can take picutres of this Christmas Season. It took a while to get it working because the batteries that came with the camera were dead. I received the yellow one because yellow is my favorite color.<br />I would like to remind people to take a few practice shots because the viewfinder is off center and so your pictures won't be centered. Practice and get a feel for where your subject needs to be in your viewfinder so that you can center your pictures a little better.<br />But a good camera none the less.<br />My first camera was a Kodac F15 and I loved that camera, i have had several cameras since then but can't wait to actually purchase a better digital camera.","Great quality. Better than pictures. Looks shophisticated","Nice to get printed pictures quick, love it!","Nice camera, easy to use!","Great","Used this for a Wedding guests book & sign in. It was Fun! Taped pictures in guest book.","I wouldn't classify myself as a photographer but I like to capture memories with pictures. I only had my iPhone camera for picture-taking before but recently received the Fujifilm INSTAX as a gift.<br /><br />Easy to use, flash works well, not too heavy and pretty compact. It's convenient to bring on a trip or to a nice dinner when you want to capture your memories in a cute vintage-y frame. Only con is that buying the film can add up, but I save them for special moments!","This is a fun camera, the film is a little spendy but compared to other sites I used amazon had the best deal","good","I loveddddddd it!! I would so buy another one with a different color.","This camera is amazing. It produces the cutest, instant pictures and is a great source of amusement for everyone I show it to. The pictures are about half the size of a Polaroid picture. It took some effort to learn how to get the settings right for pictures. But I don't read directions so it's my own fault.<br />I highly recommend this camera.","Pretty neat camera, very nice-looking pictures!","Great experience","It works no problem. It is what the description say it is. Its an awsome little camera and if you're not convinced search up video reviews on youtube, you won't regret.","Fun yellow color, works as explained in the description. Very easy to figure out. Note: The lighting has to be just right, or the photos will be very over exposed. Be sure to listen to the camera's \"advice\" on which lighting setting to choose. Otherwise, great product, fair price, and very entertaining for family gatherings -- for young and old alike!","Easy to use and fun picture taking!","Love it! Works great and arrived quickly. Be sure to use the right settings or else the photos can turn out too dark or too light.","My 9 year old daughter loves it.","It looks more pink in the picture, got it last night and its RED. and ugly red at that. Although my daughter wont care. I DO","Easy to use, Fun to use, Eats Film, Picture Quality good and so far seems flattering (maybe because we are tiny in the pictures?)  In any case, it is a fun conversation starter and so far has taken reliable pictures in low, natural, indoor and fluorescent lighting; of inanimate objects, landscape, people, animals.","A great gift for anyone!","great camera!","My girlfriend loves it","Absolutely looveee using my camera ! It takes great shots . I googled some about it and if you switch the settings sometimes you can get a better picture","awesome!","These cameras are SO much fun. Always a crowd pleaser and a great way to capture memories.","My daughter loved it ;)","Love to use to capture fun moments","Perfeita! amei!","It's a real beaut.","Love how sturdy, and cute this camera is. The picture quality is decent. Not hd quality, but for instant pics, i love it.<br />We bought this for my little sister in law. When we asked her what she wanted for her birthday, she had said shopkins. But she has so many we didnt know what to get her.  I thought this would make a great gift since she doesn't have her own cell phone for pics. And the pictures come out right then and there, so no need to develop or upload to a PC. She really didnt know how it worked. But once i set it up, she loved it and started using it right away. I didnt even know how to use it, and the set up was pretty simple.  Didnt even really need instructions. She said she was going to take it to her field trip this week, and be able to use it for the holidays around family. We're just glad she loved it, and took a little risk. Now thinking of buying one for myself, so I can use it for my new baby girl on the way! :)<br /><br />Only thing I wasnt too fond of is it only works on batteries.  But thats about it.","excellent !","I love this camera. I received it as a birthday present. I don't use it as much as I would like but it takes great photos. Definitely pay close attention to the light settings on the front. Some pictures came out to bright due to being on the wrong setting.","I bought this Polaroid camera for my daughter for her bday ! She loved it . Works great. Easy to use & good quality pictures ,My daughter loved how big it was she could take it places & it wasn't too big.","My sister bought this as a Christmas gift (and gave it to me early, so I could start taking pictures and enjoy it throughout December!!!!) The color (raspberry) is amazing. It was well packaged and arrived on time.  I can't wait to use it!","Perfect","Really Nice shipping was fast! I'm not sure why they call it a mini because it is huge! Nice pastel blue as shown got the package deal with case and film twin pack! Christmas gift for my daughter she is going to love it!","Beautiful and works like a charm. Perfect condition!!","Works great,did a bundle was cheaper.","Camera works great! the pictures come out clear and take less than a minute to develop. My sister loves the color","I bought this for a makeshift photo booth at \"Parents' Night Out\" at our church.  We had kids from 1 to 12 years dress up and enjoy taking home a photo.  The camera was a blast for everyone & very easy to use!!  I would definitely buy this again & have told others how much we liked it!  The photo quality is as expected for instant film- just okay quality, but you are so excited about the photo & watching it develop it is lots of fun.  I did like having a flash on this camera for our indoor setting.<br />I liked this enough that I want to buy this for my 10-year old niece now!","Compact, good quality!","Love it, pictures are crisp and clear","Wow! This camera is awesome and so much fun! Easy to setup and use! Bought for my daughter's 13th birthday and she loves it!","I bought this as a Christmas Gift.  I'm sure she will love it.","Granddaughter loved it, she is age 11","Everithing perfect!","Thank you","I love this so much! It's easy to use and it works amazingly! I couldn't have asked for a better Polaroid myself! It's perfect for a teenager!","Brought as a gift this product arrived on time and was exactly as described","I understand the Polaroid Camera is making its comeback.... certainly well worth the money to buy this lil guy for some fun nostalgia!!","Great for kids and super cute. Decently priced as well","My niece love it. It a kid toy to be honest. Don't think you are getting a pro pic with this because it won't happen.","I just adore this camera. It is so cute and takes great little polaroids! Everyone loves the photos. The camera itself feels a little cheap and not very sturdy but it does what it is supposed to do at a great price point.","Got it for my mom last year for xmas & she loved it!!","Love it, gift","got this as a gift for my sister for her birthday. she loves it. arrived quickly and works perfectly.","Awesome camera!","Daughter loves it.","love my little camera","I bought this as a birthday gift for my fiance and it did not disappoint. The box included the camera and simple set up instructions with pictures that I found very easy on follow. Loading the camera with film was very easy. We were taking pictures 3 minutes after opening.  The camera automatically detects which setting is ideal for your environment which is very useful and convenient considering we know very little about photography.  After taking a picture the film takes about 5 seconds to discharge from the camera (holds 10 at a time btw) and a minute or two before the images fully appear. The pictures are a miniature version (about half the size) of the classic Polaroid film some of us grew up with. It's a cool throwback with some modern tech thrown in. We can tell already that this will be a hit at parties and hollidays. As if now I cannot find anything to complain about other than the price of the film, but it's not like we will be taking hundreds of photos at a time with this. Overall the quality, design, different color options, price, and ease of use warrant a five star rating in my book.","So far so good! The pictures came out fantastic!","I LOVE IT. Its really worth the price. My pictures come out great. I also love that there's no charging just batteries needed. Which come included !","Purchased this as a gift for my niece...she loves it!  Seems to be easy for young people to use, and they love seeing the results right away.","Purchased two for our engagement party. The price is great, but the button placement is completely opposite of other cameras. Had to design a How-To-Use sheet for the party as it's not user friendly.","Perfect for my teenage daughter.","Cute and vinatage, the Quality of the photos is beautiful! I take it out themeparks and everybody just looks at the cute little camera.","I WOULD PAY 10 OR 20 DOLLARS MORE TO MAKE SURE I GET IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS ,.I WILL NOT TAKE A CHANCE TO BUY IT<br />FROM A SELLER THAT IT READS TEMPORARILY OUT OF STOCK!!!<br />This instant camera is amazing! just the idea that the picture comes out instantly is so much fun and I love the colors , I would buy one of each color , they are all so unique!","Perfect!","This camera is simple, cheap and fun. The lens is all plastic and you can't turn the flash off. Not manual controls at all.<br />Each photo is like a hail mary, But there is not cheaper way to enter instant photography. It's a very fun experience and you don't need to carry around $600 cameras.","AMAZING !!!! VERRY FAST DELIVERY.the pakage is verry clouse .and the camera inside is protective.thank you .my daughter so verry happy this christmas.thanks.","The camera is good but the print films (that I bought separately) that fit in it are pretty small in size. I wish I had bought the regular instax and not the mini.","This is awesome! I have so many cameras its crazy but this is fun for parties and easy for quick snap shots!","awesome","Would Highly Recommend!  Make sure you buy the extra film!","Purchased as a gift for my sister, she loves it so much. She had a blast taking pictures with her friends and creating a wall collage. Perfect Christmas / birthday gift. Instructions are very simple and camera is very easy to use. The only downside is the cost of film, however I think its definitely worth it, you can purchase film on amazon for a great price.","This camera is a great, relatively inexpensive way to get printed photos back in your life! Great for sticking them on the fridge or on your desk. Just remember these photos aren't the size of old poleroids. They are pretty tiny, but great, high-quality keepsakes.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA.","So happy with this camera I've been wanting it for a while and finally got it! Such a great price and product also shipped quick. Here's a tip though if it's really bright outside cover the flash. If not the picture comes out dark.","My daughter loves it!","Loved it","perfect and on time","Purchased for my niece and she loves it..it's cute and small and easy to use..","Love it!","I bought this for my daughter as she wanted to go retro style in taking pictures.  But the photos are very small.  Not like a Polaroid from the 70s.  The camera is large and the photos are small.  It should be the opposite.  The camera does work if you put the film in correctly by reading the instructions.","The camera should measure the light automatically, but you have to select that in every photo… very stupid system.","Very nice camera, worked very well. Take vey nice pictures","Thx: as described, fast shipping, good paking","Good price, strong, and it does what my kid expected from it.","I love to hear my child say #FREEZE","super fun camera","great product","Bought this for my 5 year old for our summer travels and he loved it. Felt like such a big boy with his own camera and it was cool to see him begin to develop an eye for framing a shot and just capturing images of the things that interested him. Fun to be able to take multiple photos with new friends and leave a photo in their hand when we said goodbye.","Super quick delivery,  excellent condition...<br />Same color as shown in pictures....<br />Thanks","Purchased this for my wife as a gift. My only complaint is that the raspberry color is more of an orange. It looks like a dark pink or a coral color in the picture but is definitely not one of these colors in person.","ITS PURPLE LIKE THE PICTURE.  ITS A XMAS GIFT SO HAVEN'T USED IT YET.","Bought as gift,  looks great","Since technology has taken over I'm sure anyone can agree for the most part we take pictures on our phones or otherwise. For me anyways, that was the case. All my sons pictures are in a computer on a hard drive etc. I am busy and never get to ordering prints or printing myself so I resort to looking back at my memories via phone. I honestly regret not buying one of these sooner. Any camera really. These are so easy to use. Reasonably priced. Easy to use. And I'm so excited to start filling scrap books of these. Instant photo prints. I'm so happy with my purchase and I'd truly would recommend this to anyone. Aside from my joy of it my son will thankfully know these types of pictures are possible he was amazed I couldn't just \"delete\" the bad pic haha treat yourself or a friend. A parent must have.","Bought this as a set with the case for my younger sister. She absolutely loves it, says it's the cutest thing. An excellent buy.","nice","Great for my 13 year old niece.  She loves it.","great camera prefect birthday gift","She loves it.","Very happy. Christmas  gift. Came fast","I love my camera!!!!!","Nothing but absolute fun and gives ya a great sense of not constantly being on the phone. Polaroids are actually more fun.","Great price","My daughter loved it very much!","I love it! Perfect for anyone who has an interest in photography","It's a cute gadget but I was a bit disappointed in the size and quality of the photos.  Not the 'old' polaroids of yesteryear.","This camera worked out great. I have no complaints about this product. I bought this camera for a friend and she absolutly loves it.","This cap rack is the best thing ever.  My boyfriend use to have his caps laying around any where in da house.  I've always told him he needs a rack for his caps and now we are organized.  Thank you!!!!","Daughter loved it","Fun little camera for get togethers with friends. The picture quality isn't that great. (Faces look washed out) but I'm satisfied for the price.","WHAT CAN I SAY.... MY LIFE JUST GOT A WHOLE LOT BETTER!! I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS CAMERA IT'S A PERFECT WAIT TO CAPTURE THE MOMENTS! I'M HORRIBLE AT TRYING TO GET THE PHOTOS OFF MY PHONE TO PRINT SOMEWHERE TO MUCH DRAMA. I LOVE THIS CAMERA IT TAKES ME BACK IN TIME AND SO SIMPLE SO EASY! UGH I'M IN LOVE!","It came just as expected.","IT IS AMAZING!! It makes good pictures as long as you follow the instructions. Also to develop the picture put it in your armpit (i know it is weird but it works) and NEVER EVER shake the picture it will make  the picture blurry.","this was a perfect gift for my sister she loves it !","This camera is just awesome! I love it so much and the price it totally worth it. The whole style of the camera is amazing and simple. I love the vibrant colors and the sizes of the photos are perfect. Just beware everyone will want a picture so use your film wisely! Some things I wish it had was maybe a little compartment for the film (not sure how that would be designed or possible) and something to let you know how much battery it had left. I mean I could guess and just change them every so often, but that seems like a waste to me. It's also important how far you are away from taking the pictures because sometimes they come out really really dark if your far away. But it does tell you in the directions to stay close. I'm also a little confused on the photo settings and if they actually work, but I'm not a big camera person so I'm sure it's doing something I'm just not noticing a difference between settings. I would definitely recommend this camera! It also got to me very quickly which was awesome! I take this thing everywhere I go now :)","My Granddaughter loves it!","absolutely love-no doubt","Really cool camera!  The white looks really nice.","Very good buy everything was exactly how it was in the description thanx again !!!","Easy and fast printing! If ur lazy just like me on going to store jist to print preciouse pictures, buy this one","A++!","best gift ever ! all teens will be happy receiving this item as a gift ! so much fun with so many possibilities!","It is not seller's fault. It is Fujifilm's fault.<br />Mini 8 is not good.","Awesome item","My daughter wanted this after a frien had one!

It's easy to use and it takes decent pictures. Using it in a classroom for student celebrations and immediate printed pictures has added an \"wow\" factor.","Such a cute color and takes clear and cute photos!!

And for the price I'm not worried if he's rough with it.  I got a protector case for it and strap.","For paranormal investigating you cant mess with a polariod","Divine","Used this camera for the selfie blows at my baby shower. Everyone loved it! The pictures are instant so the quality isn't as good as your phone of course, but an amazing upgrade from the throwback picture with the same nostalgic feel","Got it for my niece for xmas. She opened it today and took a bunch of pictures. Great camera great price and fast shipping","Works great and I love the color","Got this as a present for my sister! Very cute and wonderful! I'm thinking of buying one for myself. Works great, instructions are a little confusing so just proceed slowly and cautiously when setting up for the first time. Is about the size of two fists, if not smaller.","Cannot turn on wifi,battery life is just an hour when fully charged,I can't send it back because I am going hone this week and I am working in ship ( pls check my shipping address),I ordered for my kid now I am going home with nothing,I trusted your product and I loss my money,and now I don't have time to order andi before my vacatio","I just realized this model is lower than a mini 25 which I owed so I returned it. If you have a mini 25 and wanna get a upgrade, don't buy this one. This should be the entry level. It has less function than mini 25.","Love it!!","My polaroid is amazing with great fast shipping and perfect instructions. Thanks!","Perfect","So much fun.....bought this for a birthday present for a male friend and it was the hit of the party.  Be sure to get lots of film!!","Worth every penny. The quality of the photos was great. And it's been a hit at every holiday party I've thrown so far.","Fast shipping works great.","Bought it as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. She constantly uses it to many holiday events, parties, and outings. I recommend buying one and recommend not opening the back if you know there is film because film estimates to a dollar each.","I brought this couple year ago, and this is still in great condition. I love to use it to capture the memories.","I'm having so much fun with it love it","I bought my 19-year-old niece and 11-year-old nephew each an Instax Mini 8. Instant hit. They had not seen an instant camera before and were surprised by the concept. They used the cameras right away (I gave them film too) and really enjoyed watching the photos develop. Photos taken with the Instax Mini 8 look better than those from instant film cameras of my day--better contrast--but still have the nostalgic look of photos taken with  a '60s instant film camera. The credit card-size photos lay flat and don't curl like those of the '60s/'70s. The photos are also dry. There's no need to \"shake it, shake it like a Polaroid picture\". The cameras are nice looking, light, and compact. They are smaller than I expected, which was a good thing. Not too big for little kids, and not too small for adults.<br /><br />I recommend visiting YouTube before you get your Instax Mini 8 to get tips from owners about loading film and the details of using the camera. It's really easy, but because I studied up I was able to help my niece and nephew use their cameras immediately with good results, instead of reading and puzzling over directions.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I didn't buy an Instax Mini 8 for myself. Santa, are you listening?","Kid loves it","Perfect","good","Great product! the photos have a great definition!","wonderful for capturing the candid moments in life","Beautiful","Lots of fun! We bought this and then a package of extra film and scrapbook as well as a case and a bunch of fun until you run out of film!","My daughter has had this camera for a day and already loves it! Hoping it's durable and can last her awhile. So far so good! I guess we will see in the future if it lives up to our expectations.","perfect for what we wanted \"a free-style photo booth\"","A gift for my daughter.  She loves it","Amazing camera!","So adorable. This really is a must have for everyone that likes cute things. I've seen so many people of different ages enjoy this! I can't get over the amazing color and it looks and feels like a toy which is not that bad because it works great but without the too delicate part. I recommend this to literally everyone.","It's so cute ! i was so happy ! the pictures came out lovely ! so glad i bought this!","Used for wedding guest book","My daughter loves this! Pretty easy to use, but make sure the correct settings are on before a picture is snapped so u don't waste a film. Film can be expensive. Love this tho!","Bought this for my wedding for my guest book, it worked perfectly! Everyone loved it and it was something different. Exactly as pictured and would 10/10 buy again.","Great gift for all ages.","I'm barely opening it... and this is how the box looks and it seems good maybe like a little mishandled but it looks fine over wall... now I'm gonna open it ... instructions batteries and all good so far! I already love it!!! The instructions are all in Chinese but theirs pictures to show me how it works so that's good! I'll update this when I finally use it! ... welcome guys!","Fast shipping and great quality!","Great camera, but \"raspberry\"  is not an accurate color discription. It's red.","Love these camera's! I have bought several as gifts for my kids and nieces and nephews. They are very easy to use and the pics are really cute. They have a vintage look that I love, reminds me of polaroids from when I was growing up. The only down side is that the film is expensive. Only 10 pictures per pack and unless you find it on sale can get really expensive, especially if your kids takes pics of every random person and thing. I have found the 2 packs on Amazon at a reasonable price, much cheaper than buying it at the store but I still need to remind the kids to ration their film. The camera works great, kid friendly and so far durable. It makes a great gift and the kids love them.","My daughter loves this and it's definitely a throw back to when I was little. Works great and came fast!","Getting used to the camera.<br />It's cute.<br />Small pictures, but, it's light weight and<br />it's cute.","I used this to take pictures for my sisters bridal shower and it was a fun keep sake for people to take the pictures home afterwards.","I love it","This camera is amazing! It was a huge hit at our reception and is very sturdy. It survived an excited young guest dropping it at a full run on the dance floor and still works perfectly!","Super like the camera and i order film they all work good together","Bought this for my cousin's birthday and it was defective, but I sent it back and they gave me a new one and it works great! They're so cute!","Got it as a birthday gift for my sister she loves it!","This is a great, cheap camera.  I wish I could take more than 10 photos at a time, but it's not a deal breaker.  It's easy to use, easy to change out film, and the photos come out pretty nice!","Very nice","great for  partys and photo booth  party  film is a little pricey but good and unquie compare to the normal smart phone photo<br />its more memorable with these photos then just another picture on your phone<br /><br />wife very happy with this  gift","Great","cute.","purchased as a gift and couldn't be happier! Arrived quickly and with all expected accessories.","This camera is adorable. The color is not exactly a pinkish red but more of a read. I was a little disappointed in that. There is no way of turning the flash off either. But after looking at the pictures without the flash it Needs a flash. Best to take pictures outdoors where there's lots of light to get the best photos. Super cute and easy to give pictures out","Very satisfied with the packaging. Camera works well. Thank you!","Super excited to give this to my daughter. I know she is going to love it. I watched several videos of people that owned one and let me tell you it looked like they were having a blast sharing memories immediately with friends and family. thumbs up","It is a super fun camera...I got it as a gift for my 12 year old. Can't wait for her to open it. I love the color!","Awesome product my niece loves it she visit me for 1 week from PR she loved the price it came next day spent her vacation taking wonderful pictures she is very satisfied also surprised it came next day. Recommend either for self or gift. Don't forget the assesories like the carrying case and extra film.","This is a great camera! I purchased it for my 10 year old. We live in a world of instant gratification, and the camera fulfills that need! Instantly she has pictures. She received it for her birthday, at her party she took pictures with each of her friends, she gave one picture to the friend and kept one for herself. This was a cute way to send something home with her friends, but she also has the printed memory as well.<br /><br />It's very easy to use. Changing the film cartridge is also very easy, even my 10 year old can do it with no trouble.<br /><br />The pictures are good quality. They have a slightly muted color, but that gives it the vintage feel, which I think is the purpose.","I am absolutely in LOVE with this product! So very cute.","thank you","Excelente","works perfectly, bought this for my sister and she absolutely adores everything about it and has been wanting one forever!!","Purchased this for my 16 year old daughter. She loves it! Takes me back when I was a kid and had the original. This one takes a lot better pictures than the original. Highly recommend this camera!","I love my pink Instax Mini!  And I'm not even a pink kinda girl!  So easy to use, and a lot of fun!  I've gifted a black one, a purple one (the grape color is fantastic!), and a blue one.","Camera has a nice matte feel to it! Very small and cute, easy to use. I love it!! <333","Great camera! Was a huge hit at our wedding. Quality of the polaroids was good","Very easy to use. My 11 yr old daughter absolutely loved it.","This was a birthday present and our grandson loved it....works great, took a lot of pic.","Is a gift for my 7year old, but the size and ease of use seem perfect. I'm certain she's going to love this.","14 year old girls loved it as holiday gifts","On time and good quality","Love this camera!  The film is expensive but I love this!","This is awesome!! It actually came on the fourth day of the delivery instead of the 5-8 days in between. I really like it and my little sister will love it.","QUICK","Getting hard to find these cameras in certain colors. Going to be a big hit for Christmas for lots of kids.","Great camera! took me a while to figure out what setting to use to get the best lighting, but worth every penny.","Perfect","nice pics for the value one day ill move up to polaroid.....but this totally works for now!!","Great camera loved it","There's something about having a physical copy of a picture that makes it 10 times better. These cameras are great for capturing special moments and getting a physical proof of that. Love them!","As expected","I love mine so much that I bought 2 more as gifts!! Very easy to use, and so much fun. Plus they are adorable in all the colors!","I'm so in love with this camera, i'd been wanting one for so long and I definitely don't regret this purchase! I've seen it at Urban Outfitters for $70-80 WITHOUT film, and I purchased here for $66 WITH 20 film + FREE same day shipping. Huge steal.","LOVE this camera!!!","So much fun. Fun fact: Amazon basics batteries do not work with this camera. Had to buy disposable ones. Also, the package I got didn't come with instructions or anything in the box except the camera and string. Be prepared to google instructions","love it","Best price, fast service","I bought this as a  gift for my girlfriend. She loves it. The picture come out very nice. Its just like he old school Polaroids but the pictures are half the size.","Love this camera and the color is so pretty. Takes excellent poloroid pictures!","Great item!","I heard great things about this camera. I decided to buy one. And I can't put it down. It's hard not to waste your films. I was glad that the pick wasn't a tacky pink. It was a very cute rose pink just like advertised. LOVED the fact that the batteries were included. Was not expecting that. Overall great way to spend my money!","Cute little camera. The pictures are so cute in it's small frame. Love the vintage look & it's stylish. Small, therefore meaning portable and it doesnt bug to carry around.","It's perfect!","This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and I'm sure she will love it.  I am curious as to why pink cost more than other colors, seems weird.<br />Happy with delivery and the order.","I got this as a gift, I absolutely love it!!!! Definitely recommend for those small photos to decorate or keep for memories. One of my favorite gifts","Cool product.  Sometimes in bright sun, its hit or miss.  But all in all, the camera is alot of fun","Used this for my wedding guestbook... love how it all turned out...","Great quality and beautiful colod","I purchased one of these as a gift for my sister and had to get another for myself! Please be warned, this is a poloroid camera. It's very straight forward and you have to expect nothing more than face value. Don't expect or compare the picture quality to anything near new technology. But if you're looking for the poloroid style this won't dissapoint ! I purchased the pink one for myself and the colour is as pictured. It comes with batteries and is a easy to use and works quickly to produce a picture.","Just right","Great Product! Fast delivery! I'm very happy with this purchase!","my daughter loved it!","It came super quickly and packaged securely! I bought it as a gift for my friend and it's perfect. Really impressed.","Great gift for my 12 year old niece!","It's a lot bigger than I thought. You have to take pictures up pretty close since they are so small. But, it is easy to use and comes out with some cute pictures!","Great for close up pics and attempted selfies. Need to test the flash options first before comitting to scenery.","Very fast shipping good price","So fun for my 9 year old and her friends. The film is a little pricey but it's great for parties and other occasions.","Bought it for my daughter. takes decent pictures. Sometimes the pictures come out a little too bright.","We were disappointed with the quality of the pictures.","Super fun to have.","Lovely colour and pretty light. Easy to use and no complicated instructions. It came with AA batteries too.","I did so much research on this product and it is everything that i expected and i would do your own research on this product before buying it to make sure this is what you really want. Only buy this on amazon because it is the cheaper on here compared to other places and same goes as the film. You do have to learn which setting you want it on, but after a bit of use you get the hang of it. This gives the photo a natural retro feel which is really nice. I would recommend this to anyone, its such a nice camera to own and love. You won't regret it!","Amazing. Got this one for my sister and she couldn't be happier. Mine's Fujifilm instax 210 and obviously is a great experience to.","Great deal for this product- bought it as a gift for my friend and she loves it. Couldn't find it this cheaply priced anywhere else.","Great product good price","I love the camera, it's really cute and it takes really beautiful vintage pictures. My complaint is that it's hard to know what setting to put it on so it can take a nice picture. two of them were too bright, one was too dark. If any one can just help me understand the settings that would be great..it just really bums me out that I have to waste film because it won't take a good picture at times.","I REALLY love this camera it's just truly amazing and a very good price too.","I had purchased this item as an early Christmas gift for my girlfriend. She really enjoys it and has already gone through 2 packs of film in just 2 days. She really likes how it looks, one thing she just doesn't like doing is looking through the eye piece. It's not a big deal. It's not too heavy to carry around and with the case we purchased with it makes it even more easier to bring around and take quick shots on the go. I am very happy that she is extremely happy with the product.","I bought this camera to take fun pics on vacation, and I couldn't ask for something better! Our pics turned out great once we got the hang of the different light settings! I wouldn't recommend taking pics on SUPER sunny days, as our pics came out very light and washed out even on the full sun setting. I would like to note that if you are taking the film for this through airport security, it is recommended that you ask for a hand inspection because the x-ray machine could damage the film. I took all of the film out of the foil packs and placed them in a ziploc bag, and I didn't have any problems.","Love this camera!","In good conditions","Awesome camera","A dream come true <3 Absolutely adorable","My daughter loves this camera, Just like any other polaroid but in a smaller package as well as the film.","Small size","The pictures came out great. Super simple to use. I love mine. Don't second guess buying this, order it now!","For all of those particularly stuck in the past, and those who love the simpler things, this a perfect product for you. It brings a new feeling to the nostalgia of Polaroid cameras, and it has amazing quality! Definitely worth what it costs, and it wont disappoint. The film is somewhat expensive, but understandable. If you're interested in photography, vintage items, or anything in between, I would definitely tell you to consider this product!","The light settings about as fickle as my landlord is on being a good landlord (very fickle). Sometimes pictures turn out, sometimes they don't. Sometimes it auto adjusts, sometimes it doesn't.","I bought this for a wedding. We wanted a photo booth but they were way too expensive so we bought a few of these and put them on the tables. The guests loved the cameras and pictures! I loved how it told you what setting to use for best results since we had people inside and outside. By the end of the wedding people had so many pictures to take come and pictures to put in the guest book!","For taking instant shots, it works fine. Photos aren't the sharpest in the world, but that's not why you buy one of these.","Love it! The yellow color is perfect as well, very pale just how I like it","I love this camera. It's a cool little thing to carry around that usually catches people's eyes because of its uniqueness. You should buy it and enjoy. Don't expect to become a professional photographer as this is usually for people who enjoy the little things in life or just like near things. I use mine all the time and have no complaints about it.","The camera is great! I love it, and it has lived up to my expectations. The only issue is that the box came yellowish, as if the camera had been kept in inventory for months / years. Not a big deal, except that it was, because the camera was a gift for my gf. 4 stars for the seller, 5 stars for the product","Our granddaughter love it!!","My 12 year old  niece loved this so much!","amazing","Works great except for it developed yellow stains on the plastic. Cant be washed off","Nice","This is the best thing I have bought in a while. Totally worth it.","Perfect! Works amazing! No complaints! BUY HERE ITS A GREAT DEAL & A LOT CHEAPER THAN MOST STORES","My kids and I absolutely love this camera! My daughter has now asked for one for Christmas, only problem is I probably couldn't afford to keep her stocked in film! haha","Works just as advertised! Make sure to check your light settings before snapping a picture! Film is expensive and no sense in wasting film","Daughter loved it","This camera is awesome! Dont try to take photos with things such as a ferris wheel or christmas lights in the background because the background will just be pure black. :( Tried to use at Disneyland in front of the castle and it didnt work. Otherwise very satisfied","I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!!","I have no complaints,  and I'm very picky!  I love this camera, and people swoon over it when I pull it out.<br />Very easy to use, and the pink is prettier in person than the picture shows.<br />I was expecting it to be just duller than a soft pink,  like in the picture,  but it's not.","good","This is the second one I've purchased as a gift. Personally I use the Instax Mini 25, but this is a more popular model and is priced well. Everyone loves this, it will make you the life of the party.","Mine seemed like it was okay,  but the door to open to put film in was warped and let light in, ruining a lot of my photos ","Bought for my niece, she loves it and has had no problems!","so adorable!!  It's a bit larger than the other instax cameras but its very easy for my 10 year old to handle!  Very easy to load the film cartridges!!  The entire package came with a neck strap, extra hello kitty film paper, batteries, stickers and a view finder piece!  Vry easy for selfies with the mirror on the front!  So far it's a Christmas gift, so I've only played with it once, but there were no issues.","My 9yr old loves this camera! Takes better pictures than I thought it would.","Love my camera! Have had it a little over a year with no problems!","Pictures are a little small but overall quality of the picture is good. I like the convenience.","Super cool just the film for it is super expensive","Will use the camera at Christmas.  Looking forward to taking great pictures to share.","Works perfectly and I'm very happy with the pictures I'm getting.","Love this guy. Fun for all","Great camera came just as described","Love this camera! And with the promo I had to get shutterfly credit I couldn't pass this up!","YOU NEED TO SHAKE IT AFTER IT COMES OUT. Sorry for all caps but it would catch your eyes better. It'll stay black unless you shake it. OutKast even says repeatedly \"Shake it like a polaroid picture\" in his song Hey Ya!","My wife loves it","My niece loved it. I gave her this camera for her birthday.","My Wife really likes using this camera but we are having some difficulty taking any really good quality pictures.","At least I enjoyed for 1 day, but I loved it.","Feels flimsy in your hand. Does what it is advertised to do.","Received in perfect shape and at a good price.","It is a very cute and lovely camera.<br />But the film is expensive and the printed pictures are not as good as I thought.<br />My daughter likes it.","It works great, picture quality has that vintage look and feel. I have had this for a few months and it has held up well. The only down side is the cost of refills. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to just take some fun pictures to live in the moment :)","My daughter love it.","Love this camera! The pictures are super cool and vintage","Love my little camera and the instant pictures. Easy to use and maintain, it takes a little bit to learn to use the different setting to get your pictures right.","The pictures are a little smaller than I thought","I am beyond in love with this Instant Camera. It takes good pictures. I got it as a present for my self and because I wanted to have instant pictures for the day of my wedding. Instead of paying for having a photo booth, I used this instead! It works great. Price was decent and the film can get to be pricy but all worth it. I simply love it.","Love this camera!","I bought this for my 14 year old daughter for her birthday. She loves it and all of the accessories that came with it.","I'm so glad I got this for my daughter's birthday! Amazon's price is about half what the stores here are charging for this camera. It's a great little camera that is easy to use and the picture quality is pretty impressive considering the fact that it's an instant camera. Couldn't be happier.","This was a gift to my daughter.  She is having fun with her new found hobby!!","Good","Great product","bought this for my daughter, she loves it!","so fun","adorable!","Brought for a party and it was a huge hit.  Memories that are not stuck in a phone . Giving out the pix is even better!!!","image quality is very poor and dark","Recently I bought this Polaroid camera and I thought it might have bad quality or it want going to come with batteries or something was going to be wrong with it. But when it came in the mail I was sooooo excited to open it as soon as I got it I got home and I opened it and it was in a brand new box and it still had the plastic on it. I opened it and everything was all together and it even had its own batteries so i didn't have to buy any. When I finished opening the camera I put the batteries in and I had also purchased a case and so I made sure that the case fit and it fit just right. I was so eager to take my first picture that I told my mom and my sister to come in my room and we took a picture. I wanted to see how long it took for the film to develop and it only took like one minute or a little more. i was really happy to see how good the quality of the picture was. I love this camera and when I bought it i also bought sixty film to go with it and I loved it so much i ended up using all of my film in a little less than two months. This is a really good quality really functional camera and I am really glad that i bought it. I even ended up convincing two of my friends to buy one. And i would recommenced buying the case to o with it especially if you like to travel and take pictures with it because it provides enough protection.","This is great when you don't get to see family often and you can snap a quick pic! LOVE love love!","The picture quality is just okay. The flash either washes out the image or the background is blackened out. I had an old Polaroid back in the day and think it was better. But the kids got a kick out of it at the party so it was a good novel effect.","This camera is really nothing different from an old fashion Polaroid with new modern tech added to the lens to allow you to get a clearer and closer picture. The camera itself is fairly priced but the packs of 10 photos to me personally seem a bit expensive for a small photo. It makes for a lot of fun if you're into having an immediate photo to give to friends but I would much rather get a portable picture printer and a digital camera so you can get the picture you want printed and not feel like you wasted a dollar if you get a bad picture.<br /><br />Its fun for the nostalgia but ultimately I wasn't too impressed to want to keep using it.","Perfect product and everything!","Apparently this is a super trendy/popular item for the teens and teen-adults out there. Got this for my sister and she went snapping away. Granted that the photos will probably hide in boxes forever, but she's putting this to use.","bought this for a friend and she loooooves it!","We bought this as a little fun stand at a wedding. All the guests took photos and had a fun time.","love the color","great","Good price. Really great bundle price. Daughter loves it","Great for making quick memories! Makes people focus when taking a picture since they know they only get one chance to get it right. I love this light blue by the way.","My boyfriend bought this for my birthday. It's very cute and takes very good pictures! I recommend buying a carrying case for it because it's a bit awkward to lug around, and you wouldn't want to damage it. The only con is that the film is very expensive. However I think that it captures a moment and it's so real to hold the picture in your hand! I think at some point I'll buy the Polaroid printer for smartphones. I also bought a mini photo album. Urban Outfitters sells a lot of Instax products.","Awesome camera..i love ittt????","Package arrived quickly and in great shape. Love the product. Would buy again as a gift!","love it","It is a great camera and works as expected","WOW!!! This camera is so much fun and can literally be a great purchase for anyone from age 4 to 99. I bought mine in the light blue color as shown. Although the film you must buy can get a little pricey, it is well worth it. I took pictures with my great Grandma who is 99 and she loved having the instant photos. It is so simple to use with a slide in area for the film and one simple button for a picture that you can't hardly wait to see. I would highly reccomend this product to anyone who enjoys almost instant results with a click of a button!","For some reason the pictures don't come out very clear but for the low cost it is overall a good product.","Luv it!  Bought this for me extensive shoe collection...  Now I know what shoes r in every shoe box in my closet...","It's so awesome I love this but film is so expensive","Love this camara! It's hard to use though. Make sure you pay attention to the kind of lighting if you don't want to waste a bunch of expensive film.","great, love it.","Purchase this item for my daughter for Christmas. Such a cute rendition of the olden day Polaroid cameras. I'm certain that she and her friends will have such great fun taking them printing out their own pictures","Great over all. Don't really like the fact that it looks like it's night time when I take pictures during the day.","Great for scrap booking","I love it, so adorable","A seven year old girl's birthday present. She loves it of course, is framing her shots and making an album.","Great product. Excelent service and fast shipping!! Very Satisfied!!","fun and easy to use.  perfect for the going away party we had.","Loved it","good","I love everything about this camera the cokor, the size and especially the shipping! I didn't pay for shipping just the free standard and i ordered it on saturday and it got here on monday! AMAZING","Got this for a gift. Once they have opened it up I will leave a detailed review.","It was actually a gift for my daughter, and it was perfect. She got exactly what she wanted, it arrived right on time, and works awesome.","While I love my Mini 8, it can be hard to get an idea on how to properly use it, and testing it is really expensive because you need to buy the film so you need to 1. Learn how to use it really fast (or buy a lot of film) 2. Understand its options before taking your first photo 3. It forces you to consider your photos instead of just randomly taking tons of photos.","Just as described and super fast shipping!!!! A++++++","Daughter loves this!","I got this in the mail on November 13, 2016. I messed with it last night, but it feels super cheap. You have to put the printed photo in a dark place so it comes out. If I were to take this outside in the day time, the film wouldn't develop. So far, this is super over priced. I wouldn't re purchase . It is a good idea though. Just kind of a lot of money for a cheaply made toy.","My daughter loves it. Great gift for a 10 to 12 yrs old.","it's really good! I love the blue one","Bought this camera for my grandkids and it provides hours of fun they take selfies and pics of their friends and hang them in their room with close pins.  Great fun for the price.","Love it!!!","absolute good","Thank you! Love it!","Fun to use","bought this camara for my daughter's 14 bday.. she has not stopped using especially when she is with her friends..take awesome pictures","Bought for my sister. She loves it! Sometimes hard to get picture to come out clear. Some pictures come out all white or all black, even with the correct setting. She is 11 though so she loves the camera.","Awesome item for weddings and impromptu pics with friends.","Bought for a wedding photo guestbook, super easy to use, looks great and makes really nice looking photos. The printing and developing film is really quick too. Ordering a second one just in case of any breaks on the day.... for $50 seems like a great deal!","My husband and I got this for my daughter's birthday, and all her friends wanted one. It was a big hit and works get, easy to put film in.","Excellent","So perfect ! I bought it for my wedding and it honestly couldn't have been easier to use and play with. I purchased this with the big box of film and it was way more than enough and totally worth the price !","Greate camera. Bought this as a preset to my sister and she loved it!","These cameras has really good reviews, so I purchased a little more easily. The camera is well worth it the money, it takes great pictures and works amazingly.","I bought this for my wife and she instantly fell in love with it, we have photos from the mountains in Nevada & Arizona, Las Vegas and California... It's compacted and fun to use...","When you take photos outside, there should be a light on the dial around the lens to tell you which setting to put it on. I recommend covering the flash because with the bright sun and a flash, itd be too much light exposure and the film comes out almost blank. Make sure you change the dial to the correct setting. The camera is amazing and prints photos out in a really nice vintage style. I would definitely recommend buying this camera.","I love the color !!! so easy to use","I LOVE THIS CAMERA!","I got this for my 21st birthday.","Use it only if you're about to die. Let's face it: we all have a smartphone that can take better pictures than this piece of trash. It's more of a novelty than a practical camera. The printout quality is terrible but it's convenient I guess...","It is a typical instant camera - photos are on the small side - doesn't do to well in lower natural  light conditions - but depending on the price you get it for. -it's a fun camera to have around. Film is expensive  though","My granddaughter ordered this for her birthday!  She loved it!  Good color and cute little sized pictures.  Looks like a better size for scrapbooking.","So cute and works well","So instead of a guest book where everybody can write something we created a photo album. The pictures are credit card size and might not be as good as from your professional camera, but they are so unique. If you just have one shot to get it right, you put more determination in your pictures.<br />The pictures will turn out better the more light you have. Yes, you do have a flash and some settings, but the key is light!","It's very cute I got it as a graduation present for my cousin and she loved. It takes pretty good pictures and has already survived a few drops.","Best gift i had ever bought.Great quality. Easy to use","Originally was looking for a digital camera but since I have been noticing these around more often among my college friends I decided to give it a go. And boy was it a good idea, I love it! It's beautiful, the right size and does all that is needed to do. It's simple yet chic. I love bringing back the old way we took photos and yet with a modern twist. Yes this camera is no digital, no does it not have any ports to \"download\" the picture, and you don't have to replace any ink. It's just simple. And I can express it anymore of how I would buy it again for someone else. It came fast and packaged well. This is a product that you would buy when you need to \"treat yourself\" :) .","love it","Works amazing","Good condition, box was slightly damaged but the camera is brand new and perfect.","Well it is good but some pictutes you take won't show and they waste the papers for the camera fast","I love this little camera. I seriously love it. It's one of my favorite purchases ever.","I love this camera, is easy to use.","LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURES AND WORKS GREAT !!","Love this! So cute and super fun!","Perfect size. Easy to use and the mini films are fun size.","MY first polaroid camera and I was instantly in love. I love the fact that pictures develop right on the spot and i can change the settings depending on where I am.","Such a fun camera. Pictures are good quality outside, with lots of light. Indoor photos turn out pretty dark. Easy to use, definitely worth it.","To be honest I was really excited about this product but even with the settings for taking pictures in different envionrments my photos always came out blurry or dark - really sad it didn't work out!","Perfect ! I loved it!","Great takes really good photos and even knows what setting it should be on to take the best quality photos","Great purchase. I bought this camera for my sister's birthday hoping it was a solid Polaroid with a modern touch. It's functional, stylish and prints out great quality photos. It even came with a matching carrying case which was a nice bonus. All in all I'm happy with the product and definitely recommend.","so cool, and easy to work!","Such a fun camera for a party! Pics aren't the greatest, but it's like what you expect from the old school Polaroids- I call it \"baby-roids\"!","Great for parties. I use it all the time.","Always wanted this camera! I love it.","Awesome little camera, first time using it and I love the pictures","it was a bit hard to understand which setting to use was better until i figured out the light showed what was the best setting for now. I like the weight of the camera too and its super adorable!","It's just like the picture.  I love it.","Like it soooo much...","Super cute ! I've used it since the day it came in the mail. Not difficult to set up, batteries are provided (thanks), and perfect size - not too big/or small.","Thanks, love it.","It's a great product.<br /> I Love the camera.","Great!","just what i needed for my camera","These cameras are amazing!!","gifted this to a friend. she loves taking happy snaps!","bought one for myself and one as a gift. both loved it to travel with.","Best purchase ever! This camera was a huge hit at my sister's wedding! We're going to use it for my wedding at a photo booth station. I love it!!","This is the cutest little camera. I love to take this on vacations with me. The Polaroids are smaller than traditional size. Great gift!","Absolutely love this camera ! It was everything I hoped & the pictures come out beautiful !","Great camera for my kids! They love polaroids","Just what I expected and it came with batteries! Great product and perfect as a birthday gift.","Bought this for a friend. It is basically a toy camera, but she loves it. The prints are quite small. Be sure to adjust the exposure dial manually, or your images will be useless.","AAAHHH-MAZING camera made very well and the pictures come out in seconds it's a wonderful little camera to have got it for my daughter but I enjoy using it too !","it was perfect","This is such a fun camera. It not only captures one of a kind pixes, but it it such a conversation ice-breaker (the pink color may be the initial eye-catcher).  Besides, I am soooo old school and using this camera is nostalgic, and giving some pixes now and then to random people is heart-warming  and is accompanied by smiles galore.","This camera works great not one complaint.  I do wish that the pictures were a little larger but the quality of the pictures was great.  I used it as a photo booth guest book for a birthday party it was a big hit.","It was my daughter's 9 bday present. It couldn't be a better present. Since then she has been taking pictures al the time with her friends, brother and us.<br />My nephew (11yo) just saw it and have asked for it as xmas present.","This came in great same and I love it!! It takes such good pictures","Very very good","A great product, I just regret the color I got, not my style but cute. Great quality, takes good pictures. TIP: when you buy the film and start using the camera DO NOT do it on a mirror because the picture is black with a light, something useful I didn't know. But a great product if you are looking for an instant camera this is the one.","I love this camera! The old fashioned polaroids bring back the nostalgic memories of my childhood. There is just something about having a physical photo in your hand right away that is just so magical. Every trip or anywhere I go I take this with me in addition to my DSLR. The physical aspect is just great, especially to give away to friends or family, etc. The quality is quite good, depending on how you take the photo. It can be a bit too bright sometimes in broad daylight, even at the lowest settings however. But otherwise, the flash is decent during indoor photos when it can be a bit dark.","Excellent vintage camera. If you want watch an unboxing here you can do it (Spanish) [...]","Excellent","My Family loves it !","My granddaughter loves it","I've only had it for like 18 hours but I love it. Pics come out pretty clear. Gotta be careful with lighting. If it's too bright the film will just be white. But that's how Polaroid cameras are.","My daughter loved getting this camera from me for her birthday.  It's adorable.  The pictures are credit card size and what you'd expect in quality.  Definitely a great gift.","This camera is so cute! And love the fact that the camera it self is pretty inexpensive, however the film is kind of costly. But hey at least there is film for it. It's hard to find film for the old school Polaroids (my husband has on of those and he would know!).","Perfect for what we needed! Used it as part of our guest book for our wedding. Everyone seemed to be able to figure out how to change the film and use the camera without any instruction. Pictures turned out great from during the day and night!","I gave this to my daughter for her 10th birthday--she loved taking pictures of all her friends at her party and the girls got to see the photos right away.  Also the price on Amazon is MUCH better than out in the stores.","This a perfect gift for a teen, brought this for myself to try it out, planning on buying another one for my 16 year old granddaugher for her 16th. birthday.","Very new and good to use.","My 4 year old grandson tried out his artistic talents.","Love them!","I bought this camera for my daughter and she has enjoyed it tremendously. It is very easy and fun to use and take places. The price was very reasonable compared to other stores I had looked at.","Works perfect :3","Absolutely love this little camera! SO fun","Love, love, love...a hit at my wedding reception.","While this camera can be a little bulky, it's a lot of fun. It reminds me of taking Polaroids as a kid.The images are about as small as a credit card, so they can easily be stored in a wallet or in a change purse. The image quality isn't super fantastic (it's a lot like older Polaroids), but it's more for fun than anything. I'm considering using this at my wedding as a guest book. The film is about $1 a picture or $0.50 depending on how cheap you can get it, so I wouldn't suggest it if you blow through film a lot because it can be costly.Overall, I enjoy it. It was just what I was looking for.","This polaroid-type camera is my go-to gift for those i love, and they jump for joy. it's appealing, available in several candy colors, and unusual--a throwback that's totally new. i also give the plastic tiny colored clothespins and a string to hang the photos as they dry, ready to show off at a party or at home. it's not for great photos...it's for fun.","Raspberry is not true to color! Don't be deceived by the photo that they show. It's more of an orange tint/coral/burnt red. That's too bad, false advertising. The camera feels light and cheap, you have to push the lense back in with your fingers. After adding batteries and film it may feel more sturdy. It's a cute concept and price is unbeatable for an instant film camera.","Great product.  Price is good.","I got this for our wedding photo guest book! It worked great and was super user friendly! Everyone loved using it!<br /><br />Please let me know if this was helpful!","Fun! Spits out teeny tiny photos like Polaroid.  Pretty good quality for such an inexpensive camera.  Fun with groups and parties.","Bought as a Wedding gift. Crazy cute.","Its great","Absolutely love this camera! My friends and I always have a blast using it at parties and get togethers! I bought the bundle with the camera and the case because I love not having to carry it around when it isn't in use! The camera itself does come with a little strap you can attach to the camera and can fit around you wrist if you are looking to not buy the case for it! I would definitely stock up on the film because you will run out fast! Happy snapping!","I'm really disappointed about this product. It doesnt work well like I expect","Great portable camera brings me back to the old days of instant photography. However, Fuji has master this technology bringing excellent quality on every shot. I'm really impress with the consistentcy of colors and light revealed on every take.","I love this camera but you cant get pictures at night or in darkish places.","Takes amazing pictures with great quality, although very delicate take good care of it would greatly consider your buy","This was so fun for my wedding reception! Love, love love! Would highly recommend.","Great camera in terms of \"fun\" but the pictures do get washed out if you dont have the flash settings on the right way","Love it !!","Good camera my daughter loves it","i freakin love this thing!! i think it is extremely helpful that the camera suggests which setting to use based on lighting. super easy!","Great camera - purchased for a teenage girl - she loves it.","I love it so much! It's easy to use!","Such an adorable camera, got it in pink and I couldn't be happier.","Picture is smaller than I thought it would be, but not bad. Color and feel are good.","Great gift for a teenager! Arrived nicely packaged and works great!","I love my Fujifilm insta mini 8! It is so easy and came with batteries! I only gave it 4 stars bc most of the directions were in a different language except for a small part. I ended up having to look up how to insert film and work it on YouTube.","Best thing next to ice cream! What a flash back and these little camera's are fun to use for quick easy on the go photo's.","Was a lot of fun at the reunion.  Thanks!","My daughter absolutely loves her camera , we used it for a party and had so much fun","Very satisfied.","Works great. Easy to use.","Great fun for the grandchildren! Very entertaining for the older kids. All 4 of my grand-daughters (ages 9,11,11, and 12) loved it. I do suggest buying extra film and maybe some accessories to add a little more fun things to do with the camera and pictures. I think you definitely need a case for the camera especially with kids being a little rambunctious. The only negative thing is the quality of the pictures is not as good as I think it could be, but still a lot of fun.","AAA","Totally fun camera!","Perfect tween gift.","good","good quality, simple, easy to use, instant printing after clicking the photo, preview of the photo is from the viewer","This camera is a huge hit in our household!","This camera is so much fun! Easy set up...like 5 minutes. Photos came out clear and with a \"natural\" filter. Looking forward to snapping tons of shots!","I've ordered 2 for granddaughters and they both loved it!!!","Thank you!  My 10 year old is going to LOVE this camera for her birthday!!  Thanks for sending ON TIME!","Love this camera!  Although it takes much better pictures indoors than in bright sunlight, it's so perfect for instant photos and is exactly what I needed.","Photo quality beloe expectations","very great birthday gift for myself love taking pictures and how this camera takes them just absolutely love it would buy it again for someone to have","Wish It came with the film. Otherwise, its great.","If you're old enough, you remember using a Polaroid camera. This blast from the past is similar with a few differences. First, the picture size is a rectangle instead of a square and that rectangle is only a little more than half the size of the classic Polaroid square prints. Think business card size for these prints. Also, the resolution leaves a lot to be desired. It's not as sharp as the old Polaroids. If you know the old Polaroids, you know there wasn't room for a decrease in resolution.<br /><br />The film doesn't have the extra layer over it like those old Polaroids. Remember how you used to have to wait two minutes before peeling off the developer layer? Not with this film. You get to watch the image slowly appear over that two minutes or so. Speaking of the film, it's pricey. A two pack of 10 prints per pack costs about $10 from Amazon. That works out to around fifty cents a picture. Like I said, pricey.<br /><br />All in all, this is an expensive toy camera. Like my title said, this camera takes good pictures about as well as an Easy Bake Oven baked a decent cake. Of course, if you know someone who really is enamored with idea of this type of camera, you're going to be stuck getting one, so save your money as much as possible and get this one.","Super easy and fun to use! I bought it for myself and i think I will be buying it as a christmas present this year for a younger family member! Would be fun for a youngr child that doesn'5 have a phone to take awesome pictures they can save forever!","Great camera, daughter loves it :)","Good product",":)","This camera is so amazing. I love taking pictures and this is great for collecting memories.","Perfect for a photo booth addition to a party. It was a big hit","Perfect camera ''''","It's so cute and nice. I love it :)","I purchased this for our wedding guest book. It was easy for everyone to use, including children and the elderly. Our pictures turned out great. It's a good size, not too heavy and very simple to use. The film is easy to load (my flower girls did it) and with the rare exception, the pictures always develop beautifully! Would make a wonderful gift.","This camera is so fun. Great quality of the pictures too! Easy to take it anywhere. It has different modes for pictures, only thing is, no matter where you are the flash will always come out, you cant disable it.","Love love love this camera! Cute and adorable!","Product arrived in a timely fashion and is as described.","I LOVE ITTTT BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER","Great value","Bought this product as a bridesmaids gift. Great Price, packaging was great! Show the camera on the front!<br />This product is awesome to use and prints in great time. I love these cameras! Doesn't come with film - just FYI.","Purchased it as a gift for my older sister and she loved it! The camera takes great pictures and would highly recommend it to anyone. I will actually buying another one for myself","Thank you!","got on time as promised thank you","Great and as expected","Good","So cute!!","I love this camera, and it arrived super fast!","Awesome. great quality","Love it","They had so much fun snapping photos!! You do have to buy a lot of film but they enjoyed the results.","I used to have a mini 7 before and it was easy to use. So I decided to by an 8 because of the attractive raspberry color. But it pissed me off somehow. How ever hard I try, the color of the pictures I took is either too dark or too light. The pictures look quite vintage but sometimes I need to show how colorful the life is, but I can't. I try to adjust the light but there is no use. Any helpful tips?","I feel like I went back in time. :) but love the instant convenience of having a photo","Great quality, and it works perfectly","Pretty good little camera!  We used it at a party and people loved it.  The pictures print smaller than the old Polaroids that I grew up with, but the camera served it's purpose!","Great instant camera!it's the best","Great camera! Love the fact that you can capture the moment! Super cute and vintage! Good quality photos:)","Absolutely Love my Camera!!  Best purchase every.","Cute camera, still working to get used to it so my pics turn out not so washed out.","My granddaughters are going to be so happy on Christmas","This is a birthday gift to my 10yr old daughter.  We all love it so much and already took some pictures.  It is not as clear as the normal ones.  But the convenience and fun to take is totally worth it.","Instructions all in chinese, and no film included.","My preteen girl LOVES this.  I  thought it may be something that she wasted a lot of film on, however she didn't. She's pretty frugal about what she takes pictures of. Not sure everyone's child will be that way but mine was. It give really cute pictures.","I take pictures all the time. It's the best.","Great instant camera. You need to adjust the dial sometimes to avoid getting very bright pictures, but usually the light selects the right position.","Excelent","Great condition very nice my daughter loved it","Fast delivery & received exactly what was described. Love this product wish I bought it sooner!","This is actually a Christmas gift for my daughter. I'm rating in a 4 star based off of what others rated it. I opened it, I'ts heavier and bigger than I expected. It looks like it a good quality camera. I'll update after she uses it a few time.","This is awesome!!!!!","My daughter loves her camera, just what she wanted","I love my camera.","This reminds me of the old SX 70 camera, only cuter!","This takes really great pictures for an instant camera. My step daughter loved it for her birthday.","too soon to tell, used only once","I love my fujifilm camera. It worked out great for a birthday party. Everyone loved it and the photos that they got to take home.","very good product!!! A+++","As expected!","I love this camera. I love it. So Much. Have I mentioned I love it? This thing is the most awesome little fun device. I had it a while, took it on vacation and got some really fun keepsake pictures... but the BEST part about this camera is that I used it for my wedding as the \"guestbook\" where guests would take selfies and post them in a scrapbook. IT WAS A HUGEEEE HIT! Everyone was raving about the little camera and photos and we got some amazing shots. I would recommend this camera hands down.","Love my camera. fast shipping","Very easy to use and great price. It's fun to use waiting to see what the image looks like.","This camera is very cute, works great, and I'm definetly gonna be using it all the time.","I really like the mini camera, take out the photos are very clear, recommend!","Great photos and we had lots of fun taking them too.","Super cute and takes surprisingly good photos!","Fun camera","Came on time and was loved as a gift!!","great price, saw this same camera at local craft store for double what I paid on Amazon. love the raspberry color!","Was a perfect accent for my best friend bridal shower, but be warned, and take special attention weather and settings or else the pictures will not come out as planned","LOVE this product","Love these cameras!! Easy to use I bought one for my 10 year old, 7 year old and 9 year old niece and they all love it.","Colour as pic, small and cute. Haven't used as yet though","This camera works great and is very easy to use! Instructions were super helpful and explained things great! I love the vivid color of the camera and the quality of the pictures !","great item !!","My six year old niece loved using this camera to take photos. Small size was perfect for her.","Sucks that the film is expensive but the camera is the perfect gift for that special someone.","perfect","It cute and very adorable and even came with batteries! I bought this with a case (much lighter case color though) and a twin film pack!! It came two weeks early I'm super excited!!! I kinda dropped the box out of excitement ","It was exactly as described, my kids have enjoyed it so much we had to order a second one.","After having a Fujifilm Instax for several years, I decided to gift one to my sister-in-law for her birthday. She was absolutely delighted and I was pleasantly surprised to see all of the updates the newer generation has. It allows you a little more control with your differently lighting settings and it's nice how the front lens pops out and you can just push it back in. The one thing I have to say that is nice on my version that hers didn't have was the little selfie mirror on the front when no one else is around to take your photo. Overall, a quality product. I used both my camera and hers at our wedding reception to help fill our guest book with impromptu photos. It turned out to be one of the things I've cherished most after the big day.","Super fast Delivery! Great product!","Perfect size for our 4 year old who loves to take pictures.  She loves carrying it with her everywhere she goes.  It's easy to use and takes great instant pictures.","The best portable camera with the best instant photos since my childhood!","Works well! Very happy with the purchase.","Looks more purple and less blue in real life. Pretty though","awsome gift for my 6 year old. She loves it! she used it to take pictures of her friends on her birthday and give them the instant photos.<br />This is also a useful camera. I wanted to take passport pictures and i used it to take the pictures and cut it out to right size. Saved myself a trip to a store.","Such a fun and cute camera for parties. My daughter loves it!!","My 17 year old daughter and budding photographer has been eying these since they came out and we finally got her one. She really enjoys taking and displaying the \"hipster\" pictures. The film is a little high but it is a novelty item.","Bought camera as a gift for a little girl's 10th birthday party. It was a hit! Girls had a lot of fun taking selfies and pics! :)","more red than pictured","This item was a quality item, ,worked well for my purposes.","I've been wanting a Polaroid camera for SUCH a long time, but they were too expensive. This is an amazing and more adorable alternative :)","Cute and easy to use. Took me half a dozen times to get the pictures right, but after that it's been a blast! I would not recommend it to be used outside as I never succeeded with photos taken outdoor with this camera. Indoor photos are quite good. Also, the actual picture features the center area of what you see in the viewfinder, so what you see will not be what you have. Also, this camera is not good for close-up shots as the instruction mentions. Make sure you keep the minimum distance away from your target object. But after one get used to it, there should be no problem.<br />Replacing film is also very easy, more like a no-brainer.<br />I've had mine for 2.5 years now, and I am excited to record more life moments with it!","Very fun purchase. Not the greatest camera but also not too expensive. I'm going to be using this at my wedding to take pictures of all the guests.","Amazing Camera, works perfectly.","Great Camera !!!","I love it! The pictures come out great!","One word: PERFECTION!!  When i had my daughter i wish i knew about this camera. I love the picture quality. This vintage look and feel. I really love that i can hold a picture in my hand instead of looking at it on my phone or pc. It really captures those special moments.","I LOVE IT.","If it weren't so expensive, it would get 5 stars. Love this camera for a fun twist at parties and school events. Used it at an end of the year Kindergarten celebration and the kids couldn't get enough. Too bad film is so expensive! The kids had fun taking pictures of each other and trading them with one another. Got the idea of buying this camera at a wedding where they used this for their guest book with props, etc. Definitely a hit for all ages!","Yes","very sensitive to light","I bought this for my daughter's birthday it is a great camera the Polaroids are small but they are cute and something my daughter enjoyed so much as she love's taking pictures i would recommend other's buy this for their teen aged child or for their selves as well because i had wanted one right after .","awesome camera","It's cute, I wish the photos were bigger though","We bought this as a birthday gift for a 7 year old. She was obsessed with these at a recent wedding and we thought it might be fun. Not only is it adorable, but it's not digital. NOT DIGITAL. It's amazing the quality that these types of cameras still produce, she has great fun with it, and it's teaching her a lot about photography. Not to mention... her birthday party photo booth = total blast. Highly recommend.","She loves it!","Love love love it","love","I fell in love with this camera the minute I saw I t<br />I was looking for a onestep Polaroid camera when I came over this cute fujifilm<br />I would recommend this for all ages and as well as for a gift i  guarantee the person  receiving this fujifilm will be thrilled ones they take their first Polaroid picture<br />So I recommend too all you won't regret buying this fujifilm for yourself or as a gift","This was a birthday gift for my 8 year old daughter.  She and I have taken 30 pictures with it, 8 turned out with the remaining being blacked out.  Before you say check your settings..., I personally have photographed over a billion dollars in real estate photography, I've checked every possible setting in every possible lighting situation.  I'm really against this type of a camera because this film is so ridiculously expensive and the quality is not good, but it's what my daughter asked for.  This will be going back to the seller tomorrow.  The reviews were mostly very good.  After experiencing our issue, I looked at the 1 star ratings and many of them talk about the same problem we had.  Maybe yours and our next one will work as intended.  Good luck!<br /><br />UPDATE<br />New one came in and works as it should, thankfully!  For that, bumped it up to a 3 star.","This was a gift for a young girl.  Tons of fun!  Be sure to include film and necessary batteries.","This camera is so nice! I have both the white and the baby blue one. Great to use for special occasions and to take on adventures  I love my new handy dandy instants.","Exactly as photo described, great seller thanks","Love it .!","Very good I liked so much??","I can't say how much I love this thing! I wish there was a better manual out there to explain the flash and such.","bought it for my grandchild who loved it","Fun camera for a party picture taking","Perfect!!!!","Bought this for my daughters 9th birthday and she loved it! Everyone at the party wanted one!","My girls love this camera, they love the fact that it prints out instantly. Overall, I am happy with this purchase. The camera does have a learning curve, though, trying to get the right settings so the picture turns out good. I wasted several pictures because the settings weren't quite right, which is a little frustrating because the cost of the film. The pictures also come out looking like they were taken at a farther distance. When the settings are right, I love how the pictures look, they look very vintage. I hope that with some practice, we can learn which settings work for what. The girls loved taking it to the zoo, every other kid was looking at them, like wow, that camera is cool, wish I had one! This seller had the best price, and the shipping was very quick. Would definitely recommend this product and seller, just be patient, it does have a slight learning curve!","Gift for 12 year old perfect good times using it !!","I bought this camera to take polaroid photos at my friend's wedding. It was so fun being able to take pictures and hand them out to other guests immediately. The camera is so cute, and it takes really great quality photos!","Ordered two for wedding guestbook - they were a hit! My family fought over who was going to get to keep them after the wedding. Of course I had to let one go on the honeymoon :)","Exactly as described and the kids love them. They are very easy to work great teen gift as well","So fun and cute! It's perfect for my 8 & 10 year old daughter's. I got one for each of them on their bdays. They love them! I think they're fun for any age though. Even I want one and I have a 70d Canon with all the bells & whistles. This camera is just fun and takes great pics! Adorable little  keepsakes! Thank you!","My daughter loves it ??","Very, Very Nice","I am a photographer, and got this along with a case for my 7 year old. She adores this camera. Film is pretty expensive at stores so definitely make sure to buy the film on Amazon.. it's the cheapest place I've found.","Great","Amazing Fun Filled Camera!  This is so much fun.  I bought it for my daughter, but the whole family has enjoyed it.  It is well made and has major Polaroid childhood nostalgia.  I absolutely recommend this camera.","This camera worked as describe. I couldn't wait to use it as soon as it arrived. it has a very sleek and modern look. My photos came out absolutely gorgeous and stunning. On the camera there are different modes with different icons. If shooting indoors I pick the one with the little house and if its a cloudy day outside there is a setting icon for that too. This camera is very reliable so far. I find it very efficient that after I take a picture the photo cames sliding out of the top of the camera. It takes about 60 seconds for the colors to developed. It works best used outdoors. When indoor it can be a little tricky depending on the range you are shooting from. There were a couple of pictures I took in Vegas indoor trying to capture a water fountain in the background with my gf but since I shot it so far away; the background of the picture came out dark. Although you can still tell it is us in the photo.<br /><br />When we took a photo of ourselves outside during daylight, it captured as much details as it needed too. Overall I am a very satisfied customer. I know our smart phones can capture photos too but I like the idea that as soon as a photo is snapped, it is instantly developed. I can not even remember the last time I went out of my way going through my photos on my phone to pick out ones I want to go developed and print.<br /><br />The cons of this camera that I would have to say is the the film can be a bit expensive. But you can not really put a price on the memories you cherish, especially if I have a phone full of photos and one day I lose that phone. I can never retrieve those photos again. Which has happened to me before.<br /><br />The camera comes with a strap, and 2 double A batteries. You won't regret buying this camera.","This was a birthday present for my little girl, she loves it. It's a pretty cool camera. I'd recommend it.","Loving this camera ","I've had this for a week and so far it's worked very well. The lighting takes a little to get used to manipulating correctly, but aside from that I love it.","It is a very fun and easy to use product. I like how it resets the flash settings when you turn it off (although that takes a while to get used to). Just be mindful that the flash is very bright. Very bright and harsh.<br />It's a fun little toy and if you don't mind that the film is almost a dollar a piece you will love it.<br />The things you have to remember is that the film has to be completely excluded from the light for three minutes (otherwise the film will not fully colorize and that can be frustrating) and always check your photo settings (or the picture might be set on indoor setting when you are outside in the sun)!","Cool stuff  Guests had lots of fun with these on our wedding day","It met all my expectations. The picture is clear and the price awesome.","Great deal!","Loved it would recommend it and buy it over and over again","I LOVE this camera, is amazing to see something from so long ago come back and now I can hand it down to my kids for them to enjoy. Having something simple as a picture to preserve for a life time means so much to me, it's easy to loose so many photos no matter what program you use to store them. LOVE LOVE LOVE it! The blue of the camera is very baby blue, the features to adjust the \"type\" of photo is the best part of this camera, it allows you to have different photos based on lighting. The fact that you don't have to \"fan\" the photo is another nice quality of these cameras.","LOVR LOVE LOVE IT!!<br />I'm all for taking polaroid pictures, and this fits right in my bag.  Sometimes the pics come out a little darker on tone than you would think (accentuated shadows) but otherwise their good quality photos.  Just don't stand too far away from your subject because it'll come out to be kinda small.  Like if you'd zoomed out on the pic as you were taking it.","Im inlove with it ''''","Such a cute camera. Loveee!<br /><br />The pictures are a bit smaller than expected, and the quality photo is definitely vintage. The photo cartridges are expensive to refill. But I still loveee this camera.","This item was a gift for my daughter and she loved it and continue to share it with her friends","Son loves it! And he's glad I didn't get the pink one! har har","Everything is great, it's exactly what my daughter wanted","Works great!","I did quite a bit of research into current polaroid cameras before finally deciding on the Instamax 8. If you're looking for a affordable entry into the polaroid scene, this product is for you.<br /><br />If you're curious about polaroid photos and want that instant feeling of excitement when your photograph is printed in front of you, this camera is for you. Sure you could pick up an older polaroid camera but the price per photo if you purchase the Impossible Project film would be nearly $3 per photo. With the Instax and the instax film, you're getting photos for 50 cents a print. Granted the instax photos don't have the same distortion or print size as the impossible project film, but you still get the satisfaction of a polaroid product.<br /><br />Unfortunately the flash for the camera cannot be switched off. You can remedy this by purchasing some white or black electric tape to lay over the flash. Furthermore the viewfinder is less than accurate up close, so in some circumstances you're better off judging the subjects position without the viewfinder.<br /><br />If you want to get your toes wet into the world of polaroid photography the Instax Mini 8 is a great first step. You'll develop a feel for the limitations of instant camera and there is always an opportunity to upgrade to a \"real\" polaroid camera if you find yourself in love with instant photography.","Love it! The camera is really something. Can't wait to use it for the holidays! Very happy with this product.","I love my instant camera my only concern is that indoor pictures are not coming out as bright at they should. I have been using the HI-Key setting and the picture looks way better maybe a little to bright. but I prefer that as opposed to not being able to distinguish their faces. I just bought a camera recently from best buy for my cousin and her pics come out better than mine. could it be my camera and the fact that i bought it from amazon? if anyone can help with this I would really appreciate it.so the instructions say to adjust flash setting according to where the light is indicating. but if you read the instructions again it says to take lighter pics place the setting in high key not where the light is indicating. I would like to know if this is a camera issue because my cousin has the same camera and she doesnt have this problem.","The Girls Loved them for Christmas and still do.","Such a cute camera. It is very easy to use as well. We bought this for my daughters 11th birthday and we have not be disappointed. It is so cute and the pictures are a great quality too!","Made a great gift for my daughter.  Her and her friends had so much fun making instant memories that they could take home.","Granddaughter loved it!","I bought this camera for my daughter's sweet 16 birthday.  She loves it.  Very cute, especially go with the camera case which included in the bundle of accessories being purchased separately.","My daughter loves this","I wish I could use this more, but the film is so expensive. Really, it is above and beyond my expectations. I just wish I had the extra dough to shell out whenever I feel artistic or have an event.","good color but difficult to use","Bought as a gift! Not necessarily for the professional photographer in your life, but a very fun, nostalgic way to capture moments on the fly, and comes in such a cute modern style (plus anyone can find a color they like). Arrived quickly, no problems with seller, fully intact with no damages or marks, and the price isn't bad.","Honesty, this is the best camera film i ever had. I don't know why people complain about its exposure and all. There's nothing wrong with this camera. Before I bought this camera, i look at reviews and questions. Most of questions are common and repeatedly asked. I'll just say it and be done with it. This is a film camera which mean everything is not digital, everything is kind of old fashioned way. You take a picture and it automatically print a film picture. It will seem clear white as a paper but, wait for about 20-40 seconds. The color will develop as the film picture itself too. This work through 2 AA batteries. Before you buy this, this camera is gonna be an different experience for you if you're digital photographer or use digital camera because this camera is a F I L M camera. This camera  actually only focus on exposure which means you'll need to take pictures at the right lighting. Never take a picture with light behind you indoor unless you change your setting to \"Hi-key\". i tried it and it works. I have not try other settings since Hurricane Matthew issue. There are five settings: Cloudy, Sunny, High Sunny, Indoor and Hi-key. Ok, i have already discussed this so now the film packages. Most of people complain about the cost of it, my suggestion is to buy film packages on AMAZON ONLY! it will save up your money so much. I actually bought 100 sheets of film for $60. AMAZING RIGHT?! Anyways, another tips for this camera is once your pictures have printed, please do not shake the photo or touch the picture itself because it will damage the quality or ruin the pictures. Yes there are other accessories you can buy with this camera in BUNDLE! mirror selfie is not included. any of other accessories is not included with camera itself, unless it's in bundle. you have to buy it separately. please read the label before you add it to your cart. make sure you have the right item that you wanted. Yes this camera go by many colors. If the flash isn't required for the picture you're planning to take, please have something cover it like tape or something. do not use your hand, it will bring out the colors in the pictures in weird way. I hope you'll love your camera as I have loves mine! :)","Exactly what she wanted and it got here fast","it was great","Take all such cute pictures!!! Gives it a old time look. I couldn't stop taking pictures with it.","Great Product","This was a gift and much liked by the person I bought it for. I already had one and they liked it. It is difficult to see your object because to viewer is so tiny. Recommend to others, just be prepared for the price of the film.","My daughter loved this camera! Good pics!","Perfect","Yay!!!! I love it ^.^ Now they are every where though. I don't know how the price compares now.","Perfect All","Great purchase for a teenager boy for vacation! Exploring pictures from everything from waffle pictures to silly pictures of cousins! The camera was light and could fit in his back short pockets and easily in his hand. Best gift! Whole family had a blast looking and laughing at pictures!!!","My son bought this camera for his fiancée as a birthday gift! She really loves it and has gotten a lot of use out of it in the two weeks that she's owned it.<br /><br /> It's really neat to see Polaroid pictures coming back! The pictures reminds me so much of pictures in the 1970s! These Polaroids are smaller than the 1970s version, but are just as fun.<br /><br /> She says the camera is easy to use, fun to operate, and very durable. My future daughter-in-law highly recommends this camera.<br /><br /> The film for this camera is expensive, and unlike digital, there really is no do over. That being said, it's still fun to have tangible pictures that you can hand out to people.<br /><br /> Remember, the pictures don't actually have to be shaken to develop. In fact, the directions say not to shake the picture. That's disappointing, since shaking the picture was such a part of the 1970s Polaroid experience . But  shaking the picture didn't do anything then either.","Awesome camera.","Kid loves it but the quality of pics is terrible!  Over exposed i believe - really washed out","I'm rating this a five star product because it was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it. I haven't seen it myself so you'll have to take the word of a twelve year old!","Very cute! Persons are always complimenting this camera.","I bought this for my daughter she was so happy ,  the camera is amazing ?","10 year old LOVES this. Its adorable and we bought a case with shoulders straps for her to carry it around. It is the cutest camera and the pictures are so fun.","Perfect unusual gift!!!! i love this Instant Camera, it is really simple to use with intuitive controls! good enough picture, but the refills are too expensive.","great camera, great gift for the daughter. Works great","OBSESSED with this camera. Clean and easy to use!","Excellent gift","Can't wait to have fun with this camera.  My kids love taking pictures.","fine","Very very good","I honestly love polaroids because they we're something that I always enjoyed playing with and shooting pictures with. This was so affordable and it came in very quickly. Everything came in tact and it's ready to take pictures wtih! It's not too heavy or bulky to put into your purse. I personally love this camera!","Bought the pink one as a gift for my sister to take to on her bachelorette weekend. She loved it and it was a big hit! The pink color is very light and pretty much looks like the color in the picture. The camera was very easy to use and the polaroids came out great. Bought the fuji film to go with this camera.","My daughter loves it. But picture comes out small and not as clear.","It's such a great camera. I was so excited when it arrived and it takes awesome photos","Love it! So cute and way cheaper here than in any stores. Easy to carry and has several settings including indoor and outdoor!","Awesome quality! Great seller!","Just as described","My daughter loves it. The perfect teen gift.","Works great my girl loves it","Great camera, especially for the price. Just know that the view finder does not align with the lens so if you use the view finder to take pictures, they will be off centered. It takes a bit of experimentation to figure out how to not have photos that are too dark or over exposed. I used this camera to take pictures on my wedding day and have the photos in an album. It was fun to get the photos instantly and the album serves as great memories of the day.","Lots of fun! Only close up items show up in the photo. Film sometimes jams and does a double exposure. Used for a wedding photo booth and was perfect for the event.","12 yr old loved this for her birthday!!","This one was for one of my granddaughters and she loves it. I had bought a blue one out of curiosity for myself, and I think Fuji got it right. It is much like the retro Polaroids, except they made the pictures smaller (wallet sized) which significantly reduced the cost. The cost is about $1 a picture. If you have to ask why buy this camera when you can take pictures with a smartphone, this item really is not for you.","Great cameras, I own 1 myself and love how it takes clear pictures","I love it","Camera works great!","Gift","Used this at a photo booth  and had lots of fun. The pictures are small, but they come out clear.","I absolutely love this camera! the photos are so cute and perfect for my journal! you won't be disappointed.","Started taking pictures right away..","Gife","Perfect gift for my 13 year old daughter who lives taking pics of anything and everything.","Was a gift given but I heard no complaints!","Love it! Just as described!","definitely worth it. comes with great packing","A great little camera for instant fun. We had a blast using it for a family party - used it all afternoon with no problems. it arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition.","With this camera we were able to capture great moments at our wedding. We have used it since then and I has brought fun to our memories.","Love the camera!","I love it!<br />It works as it should.<br />The high-key option is a fun addition to the other lighting/flash options.<br />I'm very glad that I got this camera, and cannot wait to use it more!","The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is by far one of my best investment! Wasn't sure it was possible to fall in love with this newer version of the Polaroid camera. The camera has sensors that tell you the best setting for the camera, leaving you with great results. It's very easy to load and operate. It's a great camera to use with friends and family, you get the best memories of life with this classic look","A fun thing to have on hand, and it makes great gifts.","I bought this camera for my sister. She fell in love with this camera. This Camera is worth every penny of it. It also takes amazing pictures.","Omg it was a hard choice choosing between this and the pink one but I don't regret the extra money I paid for the hello kitty one","My best friend got me this camera as a present, ordered it on Thursday, 09/27/16, it arrived Sunday, 10/02/16 - without Prime or expedited shipping or anything, so it was super fast. I ordered Fujifilm INSTAX Mini Instant Film Twin Pack (White) myself on the same day, and it arrived on Sunday as well, so the first 4 stars are for excellent turnaround time. The fifth star this cute little camera deserves comes from just excellent quality, unbeatable at this price point. It is so adorable, I cannot stress that enough. The pink color is definitively pink, it's not peach or anything if that's a concern, it's a soft, baby pink color. The setup is super-easy, and the pictures come out great. The flash is omg-bright, it can be a bit startling, lol. This camera is my New Favorite Thing, I'm in love.","This is a fun little camera, takes ten years off its subjects. Using it to take pics for my sons baby album and it's so much fun!","I thought this would be a fun, retro sort of gift for my seven year old daughter, and I was right.  She loves this camera!  She loves to photograph her younger brothers and her friends.  She didn't put it down for days.  The only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five stars is because the replacement film can get really expensive!  I had to tell my daughter to be a little selective in what she photographs.  She's used to the camera on my cell phone where she can take essentially an unlimited number of pictures.  I guess that's also part of the retro experience though!<br /><br />There are some cheap options for photo albums to go along with this.  I bought one of those as well, and it has been a great little add-on.  It's cool to assemble all the pictures together in the album and page through the pictures.  Otherwise, the photos get spread all over the house and end up lost!","Cute little camera,  everyone had lots of fun using it, just wish the pictures were little bigger,  but overall this was a good purchase.","This is a really neat camera for a kid!  Takes Instant Polaroid pictures so your child can capture all those fun moments with their friends.  Easy to use","Easy to use and takes great pix. Luv it!","Daughter loves her birthday gift","I love my camera! It's cute and handy and impresses everyone who sees it. Everyone always wants their own photo to take home! Gets dirty easily though so get a case with straps for it!","Love this camera. Quick shipping as always from Amazon. Thank you.","worth having one","It's a little larger than I had hoped, but other than that, it's amazing! It brings back a lot of memories of polaroid cameras from my childhood. The photographs develop nicely and fairly quickly. Overall, this poroduct is everything that I had hoped for, it's adorable and I am so happy that I own it.","Perfect, and everything you'd expect it to be. I recommend buying rechargeable batteries for this.","Fun little camera! Film is cheap on Amazon also. My sister and I took a bunch of pictures at Christmas with it, it traveled on a plane with me, and still works just fine.","AWESOME IDEA! THANKS FUJI. FUN FOR ALL AGES TOO ESPECIALLY WHEN FRIENDS AND FAMILY GET TOGETHER. ALL ACCESSORIES SOLD ON AMAZON . . SELFIE MIRROR, ALBUMS TO PUT THE PICTURES IN, FILM AND EVEN FUN FILM WITH CUTE BORDERS, CAMERA CASES. THIS WILL MAKE A GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT ESPECIALLY FOR A YOUNG PERSON THAT  DOESNOT HAVE A CELL PHONE TO TAKE PICTURES!","It is great for quick, fun shots!","Best Birthday present I've given in years!  Went thru 100+ pics over the weekend.  Had a blast and everyone has a pic they can put anywhere!","ok","Should've came with at least two extra batteries not one it takes two","I love this camera, bought it to use for special things we do as a family! It works great and I love how it prints out little pictures so fast and right on the spot! Would absolutely recommend to anyone who wants a good instant print camera","Bought it for my daughter's birthday present and she loves it! Easy to use and she could use it w/o needing help of an adult.","perfect","My 11 year old daughter loves to take pictures so this camera has been excellent for her. Even my 4 year old loves the simplicity of it as she used an entire thing of film by herself...oops! We now have lots of pictures of the dog :) The color is great too! Very easy to use and instant which is good.","excelent","Very happy customer :) thank you so much !","Cute camera but picture quality not as good as I would have liked.  My 11 year old daughter is really into photography and has been using this camera quite a bit","My daughter loved it! Christmas gift","it takes amazing pictures","It is fun, easy to use, quality is perfect, re like","Works fine, but pictures are so tiny it is hard to get a good picture.","Got it as a present for my girlfriend and she loves it","We have two of these cameras they are awesome and the pictures turn out very clear","Love it","It was a present for my daughter HARLEY at Christmas. I  haven't heard any complaints.","I take this camera everywhere and people love when I give them the photos I take. I bought it after my sister brought hers to the hospital when I had my baby and the Polaroids ended up being some of our favorite shots. Pros: cute little Polaroid pictures Cons: Sometimes it's hard to adjust for the lighting and the film is a little pricey.","recently it stopped working","This thing is so fun. I ordered it for my birthday last January and it still works like a charm. My only problem is with the price of the refills.","I absolutely love it! It's super cute and stylish. Everytime a bring it around my friends, they all say they want one! The only thing is that the system for different lighting is a bit off and confusing to work with, but I'm getting the hang of it!","very cute and very fun. but don't use it daytime outdoor otherwise the photo will look so white.","So cute ,Love it ,came a day early and I just need film to try it out.","amazing","Amazing little polaroid camera.  Takes excellent pictures.  Compact and easy to use.  I would definitely purchase this item again.  I bought this item as a bundle with the twin pack of film.","Awesome!!!","Husband and I enjoyed out little camera at our honeymoon and now always use it for other get away or memories in general when we go camping, vacation, trips etc <3 great size pics for scrap booking!","Bought this for my niece's birthday, I had no idea these things were coming back into fashion. It's completely old-school, no digital camera or anything built in, they point and click and a single picture is printed, whether they meant to or not! She had to learn to make her pictures count (in an age of taking as many on your phone and throwing out the rejects, this was foreign to her), but loves being able to instantly share her pictures or put them in scrapbooks and such. I wish the film were either cheaper or contained more pictures per pack, but she enjoys it none the less.","Great camera! Bought it for my upcoming wedding and I can't wait to use it.  There's not much to the camera, it's simple to use.","This camera is OK if you are just wanting to take selfies but I bought it for a trip hoping my kids could use the pictures and journal about their days on the trip. When trying to take a picture of buildings or scenery, the pictures just didn't turn out. I wasted a lot of film because of this.","Awesome fun camera!!!","Best to keep those so luscious moments","Cute camera","I ordered this camera as a present for my girlfriend and she loves it. She takes it with us when we go hiking, to festivals, and on vacation. We have captured some pretty good pictures on it. It took a minute for us to learn and understand the exposure settings but after getting a hang of it we started to get more clear pictures. She loves that it prints the photos instantly and she can throw them up on our fridge or walls. I was worried about how expensive the film refills were going to be but amazon has double the film for half the price you can buy in store so I ordered her that and we will continue to order from amazon. Overall we are very happy with this camera.","So fun! Love this! Works best with close-up photos!","I really like using this camera, it is fun.  But of course the quality of pictures are low res and the directions for the settings aren't very clear.  We still love to have fun with it.  My 8 year old daughter got one too, and now her twin brother wants one for Christmas.","Great design. Photos are what you'd expect from an instant camera.","Amazing product.  My daughter of 7 can't get enough.","Daughter loved it! Bought her the purple!!","Perfect, just as expected.","Easy to load and easy to use","Works great!","Cute and lightweight","Love it!","Product is great!","I bought this for a beach trip and while I had to play with the settings; like I researched you had to for a perfect picture; I absolutely loved the pictures that resulted. I also loved the color I got, which was raspberry. It's a very neat little camera that brings out the very special moments you want to use it for.","grands loved the concept of instant pictures","grands loved the concept of instant pics","Daughter loves","Great.","My granddaughter loved it.","Have wanted this forever but it's so expensive in stores. But online you save a lot buying it, even the film for it is so much more affordable online! Recommend buying this ??","haven't had a problem with this product yet! i really love it as of right now!","Great cameras for teens. A little pricey in my opinion but takes good pictures. Pretty durable and color is exactly as pic shows. Was available for prime so that was a plus.","So much fun especially now being in a digital age I love actually taking real photos.  We made a fun little album of our trip to Portugal.  The price is great too.","works great with great pics. Awesome product! Going to get some as christmas gifts.","Girlfriend loves it. Prints out pictures quickly. Only drawback is poor low light picture taking.","Was a little larger than I thought it would be.","Love this camera, perfect to have at parties. My grandpa visited it and it melted his heart after we took a photo together that now he gets to keep in his wallet! I have never used a camera like this before. Please do not expect HD pics coming out of this camera.","Love this camera!!","I accidentally reviewed this camera under the 'case' review. I gave it a good review and the case is equally good. Cute package to carry around.","Definitely would recommend to everyone, Everything was PERFECT! I absolutely love this camera!","The best","Lots of fun, we like it","For a while there, I had a different model of this instax camera, and while I loved it, it took up so much space and most times, I'd be too lazy to lug it around with me. After getting this, it makes it way easier to carry it around with me and I've since then started to build a little collection of pictures.","On top of the birthday list...and it delivered happiness!","This is a fun little instant camera. Don't expect amazing quality photos, but its fun for the nostalgia of polaroid style pictures.","simply the best out there","There's something about vintage pictures that is amazing, and this camera does exactly that. No more paying $5 for a single picture, the Fujifilm is awesome!!!!","Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Grape). I love this little instant camera. It has been a long time since I was able to take a picture and instantly hold it in my hand. There is something really special about it. I have it so much fun with this thing. It takes good pictures and is very well made. I can't put this thing down. I love it.","This works really amazing and it is very easy to use(:","Was a gift for someone, and they really like it","I got three and they shipped three days earlier and im so excited to try them!!","Love this camera","I purchased this for my wedding in order to keep at the Guest Book table. I also purchased a small photo album in which guests could take a picture or selfie and tape it/throw it inside the guestbook/album with a little note.<br /><br />The camera was a hit! And it's so simple and easy to use.<br /><br />PROS: Easy to use, relatively inexpensive, instant satisfaction, almost idiot proof<br /><br />CONS: Film can get pricy (buy in bulk), doesn't come with camera case (I bought mine separately)<br /><br />TIP: There is OPTIMAL settings for taking photos with the camera. Be sure you align the orange light near the FOCUS RING on the proper setting depicted by symbols. If you're like some people WHO DO NOT read directions (guilty), this will save your expensive film and make sure your photo comes out the best that it can be with the current light conditions.","So fun","This was a huge hit with my granddaughter!","The pictures turn out great, really easy to use and practical.","very good product. fast delivery and good quality.","Just what I expected.","Gift for my 17 year old. I think I may love this camera more than my teen daughter. Perfect present! I recommend getting the accessory pack along with it (case and multiple colored lenses, selfie lens, stickers and frames).","I love this camera!  Easy to use and makes such cute little pictures.","Simply best bang for your buck Polaroid camera you can buy. The films are reasonably priced too. Would recommend it to anyone that's interesting in a Polaroid camera.","Love this little camera Flash's super bright so watch out","Super cute camera, love the color light pink! Works great, don't forget it doesn't include film.","Amazing camera for teens. So Tumblr and fun. Film is expencive but if you buy it it is worth it.","The camera is beautiful and the pictures are even better.","My 10 year old daughter loves her camera.  Easy to use, good quality.","There's something truly special about being able to capture a moment, a feeling, and then to have something tangible to remember it by in your hands within a few seconds. With smartphones and digital cameras, it's easy to take photographs and to be able to see them instantly. Having this film camera in your hands changes your perspective on how you take photographs. With every pack of film, you're only able to take 10 photographs. It makes you really capture what is important to you, and makes you think about how you use your film instead of taking a hundreds of photographs.<br /><br />The photographs make great gifts or DIY projects. You can even take the photographs and turn them into magnets to put on your fridge! This camera is so easy to use and fun too. You insert your new pack of film into the back of the camera to start using it. There is an on/off switch near the lens that turns the camera on. The flash makes this camera perfect for either day or nighttime use! You don't have to worry about whether or not it is too dark for your photo to show up. To take a photo, all you have to do is press the round button under the viewfinder. There are so many accessories and cases you can decorate your camera with and to keep it safe. The camera is also light enough to carry with you in your bag, when you don't want to lug around a big camera! So fun to bring with you on vacation, trips with your friends, concerts or anywhere else you would want to remember.","This camera is so cool! Bought it for my wedding. It was a smash hit!","Love love love it! Everyone should invest in a Polaroid camera.","Love this product","Camera is pretty darn good. Would have given it 5 stars but I think the pictures are a bit too small.","Heavier than I expected. Still figuring out how to take good pictures with this, they all come out a little darker than I would like. Cool little camera though, fun hobby... just wish the film wasn't so expensive. Camera is very easy to set up and included batteries.","dope","we really love this camera","My girls loves these  cameras...only down side photo paper goes really fast and and photo paper kinda expensive","My daughter absolutely loved this camera. This is like a new polariod version with extra little features like designs and you can take selfies with it. It arrived when promised. Happy with this purchase.","Camera works great!","Awesome camera!","Love love love","I love this camera! I've always loved polaroids. The purple one is pretty. I get lots of compliments.<br />The only down side is that there is not way to turn off the flash; or at least I can't find a way to. So far I just use my finger to cover it.","Shipped quickly! Absolutely love it!","Gave this to my daughter and she loves it! She is a teacher & wanted a camera to take picture of the kids that she can give to them.","Outstanding , and funny!!!","Met my expectations","works like a charm","Awesome camera!  My daughter LOVES it!","This is a great little camera. Easy to use, easy to set up, easy film loading. For the price and the instant satisfaction of seeing your photos, it's worth it. This is the second one I've purchased, both were for my teenage daughters. They use them all the time. Film can be expensive, but worth it for the physical, vintage style memories. I've toyed with the idea of getting another for myself.","not very practical, expensive, doesn't take perfect pictures if you mess up. This thing is everything I wanted it to be.<br /><br />It's cool I love that you can still even get these things. They're just something about having a physical camera that prints a picture for you before your eyes.<br /><br />This thing is not for photographers it's for fun!","Brought it for a gift  The person was so excited and too happy","Great gift!!","Good product. The complimentary films run out very quick though","When this came in the mail, I opened it instantly, and once I opened everything up I was so so happy! I am very satisfied with this.","my daughter loved this camera!  so fun and pictures are great.  traveled with us on road trip and was a hit with the kids!","Bought for another.","Super cute camera, coolest thing I've ever bought on Amazon. Good price and great quality pictures. Don't take pictures too close they come out blurry","I love the quality of the photos. Also, it's easy to use and super cute","Really small and cute.  Would not buy for myself but i got it for my son and he really enjoys it.  It's more for kids than adults.","Girlfriend loves the vintage feel the pictures come out as.","Sometimes I require instant gratification, and this fulfills that need, plus it's gives a nice little memento that is fun and a conversation piece. I feel like I'm holding a huge egg yolk in my hands (since I got the yellow), but it's like holding happiness because everyone smiles when then see the picture pop out instantaneously. I trust the Fuji brand for quality so I believe I will be enjoying this for years to come. The only negative is the expensive film, but I went into it knowing the cost so I really have room to complain.","Granddaughter loves it","love this mini instant camera I am using this for my daughter 4th party will be use for the photo booth. Great pictures","Beautiful! my niece loved it!","Works as described and is a great travel size!","This was a tween gift. It was well received.","Although I don't prefer the color pink, this camera works well and has not caused any issues. Now having owned it for a year the camera has been used a lot and continues to work as it did when I first purchased it.","Got this for my niece and she loves it.......she's taken at least ten packs of film with it.  Mostly pictures of her cat!!!","I love this camera its perfect for party's","Great am in love my friends went crazy over it wanted to know where I brought it and price so I guess they about to Order pretty soon","beautiful","Was first prize in our lucky draw and everyone went crazy for it. Thanks for getting it to us in time!","Having lots of fun with this","Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 (White) + Instax Mini Twin Pack Film + Instax Groovy Case (White) I recently bought the camera and it was a great value. The camera takes wonderful and cool pictures. It is a low cost for how great the product is. I recommend it for buyers interested in purchasing a polaroid.","Amazing! Just received my Instax Mini 8, and it is AWESOME! I bought it originally for my sisters bridal shower, but I'm going to start taking this everywhere I go! The quality is great. Everything is overall in shape. Great quality.","Great camera and my grand daughter loves it.  Simple and straightforward to use.  A fun camera","This is a great camera! We have used it ever since we got it!","Daughter loves it!","The camera is amazing and extremely easy to use! I love getting physical copies, so cool!!","It works perfectly. Definitely a good buy.","Pretty alright i guess","TO HAPPY TO GET IT TAKE GREAT PICTURE GOT IT FOR THIS CHRISTMAS JUST TESTED TO MAKE SURE IT WORKED AND SO FAR SO GOOD HOPE IT HOLD UP THEN. DIDNT  OPEN EVERYTHING AGAIN ITS FOR THIS CHRISTMAS 2016","Have purchased this in the past and is perfect for young adults on the go.","My daughter loves her camera. It's a perfect size and she takes it everywhere.","Love this camera, easy to use. Important to use suggested focus","So fun - I had a poloroid camera as a kid, so love this version for my child. We used different color photo papers for a photo booth at a birthday party and it made great memories AND souveneirs! Amazon's price for this camera was really great.","Such a fun gift idea!","Got this camera for my girlfriend, she LOVES it!<br />recommended for everyone, great present for anyone! (especially your girlfriend(; )","this camera is great.. brings some nostalgia back to taking and saving photos.  Outdoor photos are perfect.  Indoor are great as long as there is a light on. Some of the pictures taking in the dark were not very easy to see. In other words, the flash is not made for professional photos.  This camera is fun, there are lots of photo albums, frames and accessories to include with this item.  I purchased mine to use at a baby shower.  It was a huge hit.  People got to take home photos of themselves with friends etc.  I included small frames and photo albums in the party favor bags  I will use it again and again.","I'd always wanted this camera..but it's not great..poor quality pics..hard to adjust to lighting.. Not what I was expecting based off of other reviews","So excited about this! I love using it, and it's small enough to carry around with me. I love it!","Great!","Its fun and cute, but every single time I turn it on it waists a picture, and that gets to be a lot of wasted film when you turn it on and off a lot.","Love love this Polaroid! It takes awesome photos and is adorable.","I have been using the camera for a while I have only taken about 7 pictures so far but I love it!! The color is so cute and it's sturdy. I got a matching case for it (with polka dots) and it keeps it safe. I am still trying to get a hang of the viewfinder but if you go on youtube there are a bunch of tutorials and tips and tricks to help you with that. I just love the fact that it's instant and the pictures always make me look nice lol. It's probably the vintage-y type of filter that's on there. Also, be mindful of the light settings because the flash will go off no matter where you are. I made the mistake of not checking and one of my pictures was overexposed cuz there were too many lights on. This is definitely an expensive hobby but oh so worth it!!<br /><br />Quick tip: If you don't wanna spend too much money on buying a photo book to store your instas in. Get a cute binder (super cheap ones at walmart or target), fill it with card sleeves (like the ones you buy for when you're collecting trading cards) and put your pictures in there! the sleeves are credit card size which is the same as the pictures :)) I learned the trick from a Youtuber!","good quality and great buy.","Super... I love it!!!","I bought this for a friend and she absolutely loved it! We used it right away.<br />It came with the original box, free batteries and a blue strap. The camera was in perfect condition, no flaws and dents. The color was pretty, too.<br />It is very user-friendly, it came with manuals written in English and Chinese with pictures making it easy to understand. We used it at the party and it worked fantastic! I wish it also came with free films but other than that it is perfect!<br /><br />Also, it is prime eligible so shipping was fast. Got it two days after I placed my order.","Excelente","Great camera and a lot of fun.","Bought it for my niece on her birthday.  She is adores it. Great product all around","Great camera! takes super cute pictures but I don't have much to say for the camera details since it was a gift.","So much fun! Everyone loves using an instant camera.","As usual a good purchase. The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is great for people who prefer actual physical photos but don't like the obnoxious photo sizes of other cameras. These are even good for people who love the very old film cameras. Would buy again (Of course I bought a 2 year warranty) Great price!","Bought it for my 10 year old and she LOVES it.  I just had to teach her to change the settings if you are outside or inside otherwise the picture does not come out","I love this camera and it is user friendly and was a great time using it for my little girl birthday","We got this for our wedding guestbook and it was a ton of fun.  The camera itself seems sturdy and well-made, was easy to get running, and takes adorable Polaroid-style pictures.  The photos tend to look a bit faded but I think that's part of the charm, right?","good","an excellent little photography treasure! the blue is very true to color. the matte smooth surface resists scratching, unless you really claw at it. i've had it for years with only faint smudges to show for it. i love how it comes in multiple colors. loading the film is very easy, there's a small window in the back that counts down to let you know how many sheets you have left before it's time to replace. the only minor gripe i have is that the lens extension button is very easy to accidentally press while in your purse. i solved this by buying a case with a front flap, so it doesnt get jostled while being tossed around in my bag.","Takes cute pictures. Smaller than the older polaroids but still have that old school feel. Just make sure to read the instructions. Put it on the setting the camera recommends (the one that has the blinking light) or your pictures may not coming out very good.","gift for my 6-year old daughter. she can easily load film and take pics. bought the bundle (camera, film, case)...great deal.","Great!","[[VIDEOID:31fe1b1a137d872a0aa8f9208f9e794]] There are not a lot of instant picture printing cameras in the market yet, from what was available. I found this with the good and highest reviews. I decided to buy this as a gift for my best friend. Please view the unboxing video to see what is inside the box.<br /><br />NOTE: Please make sure you buy the instax films as well as shown in the video because there are no sample films included with the camera.<br /><br />First impressions: The looks, design and build quality are amazing. It is funky looking with vibrant colors which actually suit the camera. Pretty easy to use for starters. I see there are about 5 settings which you can use depending on the light. It is not too big, but yes, buying a camera case would be better to carry it around rather than throwing it in your backpack. It is a little delicate so be careful.<br /><br />The camera comes with 2 batteries which are easy to find in the market and a wrist strap. I feel they should have also included a camera case with this product.<br /><br />The films are about the size of your credit card and the pictures are not HD. This camera is just for fun, but there is something different about this pictures. When you look at them you actually relive the moment.<br /><br />I will update this review with more pictures and details on how to use it once we actually click some pictures.","my daughter loves this camera we have had so much fun with it.  thanks","My granddaughter loved it! She has to fight off her sisters, So much fun!!!","GREAT!","Great product","Perfect gift for the girlfriend who loves to take pictures","Arrived very fast. Got a twin pack of film and the camera in the color of my choosing for only $62, extremely happy with my order. Thank you!!","It's a very nice cool camera and it's so easy to use the pictures usually come out great, it's great to give people these pictures instead of just taking them from a phone, I think it adds a bit of sentimental value. I wish they weren't so tiny pictures so you can see a bit more detail but all in all it's great.","I got it as a gift and she likes the camera. The camera takes good pictures depending on the distance. Too far and it starts to be blurry. And the flash does give extra lighting (doesn't look like too much light), so it can be used for dark settings. But don't expect it to have special effects like most cameras have now. If you're looking for really sharp pictures, this is not the camera for you. If you're looking for one that you can use for souvenirs, it is a good one.","The box is a little mushed up ... But the camara works fine, the problem was with the package","so nice for the price so nice all together","Love the camera! It's great for parties I tell my guests to take a pic and leave a pic so that I can make a photo album from the event.","A BIG hit for our 11 yr old granddaughter's birthday","the purchase was perfect","My wife loves the simplicity of use, and the baby blue color","It makes an amazing pics.. Recomended!)!)!","Exactly what I wanted. Way cheaper than in stores","Great item. A bit bulky but the newer model which this is, allows different exposure settings so they come out not too overexposed.","Exactly what I was looking for!!","Used it for my wedding. Total blast","I bought the camera with film for my mom's birthday present and she absolutely loved it (along with the color choice too!!). Thank you for your wonderful service and I look forward to ordering a lot more items from your company in the near future!!","Loved this camera for my 9yo birthday.  It's perfect for giving her some creative ability.<br /><br />HINT: Make sure you buy film when you buy it... otherwise you will have some disappointment that someone cannot take a photo immediately.","I love this camera! I bought it to take pictures at my sister's Bachelorette party and wedding. I figured the women would enjoy taking pictures and are able to keep the film for memories. As soon as I opened the box my 6 year old son fell in love with it. He took it with him to the grocery store and snapped pictures of people as we shopped. Of course we asked before snapping a picture, and some of the customers were quite fond of our camera. My son convinced a few to buy one as he handed them their picture. Even though the film is wallet sized, I'm still happy with the product. I might have to  order one for my son, along with plenty of film.","Great little camera to bring back some old memories!","Love this camera but film is expensive. This was a hit at a party. Fun to have. Gave photos to guests and they loved it!","I've been wanting this camera for so long I decided to save up and this is the best gift u could give To yourself if you're wondering about  getting it go for it !!!","My friend has the tan one and our first picture turned out great! I ordered the pink one that offered prime shipping! I plan to order plenty of folk, the instax case, and the mini photo album to match!","Arrived very fast and in excellent Status","I LOVE these cameras!! They are so awesome! and the film is really a great price compared to older polaroid cameras!","We ordered this super cute Instax mini instant camera for our granddaughters birthday and she just loved it.  I takes instant mini Polaroid like pictures.  We purchased this in blue and paired it with an accessories kit that had a galaxy cosmos print synthetic leather case.  It looks amazing together.  I like that this is a little compact but still very easy to handle camera.  I think it can handle a few bumps from an active lifestyle of a teen which is part of the reason we chose this model.  It is easy to use, easy to install and reload film.  Overall, this was a wonderful gift for the granddaughter and she was off taking photos before the end of the day.","Received this about 7 min ago I absolutely love it. Easy to use and so much fun.","Light, cute, and easy to use. Downsides worth mentioning are that the film packets only come with 10 sheets and getting used to the camera took me pretty much an entire pack. Another thing to note is that using the viewfinder makes the pictures come out off center. If you're looking into buying this product for the first time, I'd definitely recommend buying extra film to give yourself some leeway when trying to figure out how to take the best pictures you can.","Nice","I am a 90s kid who loves to photograph, growing up I had the original polaroid so I had high expectations for this camera. I give it a 4 for the simplicity, quality, enjoyment, and price. The size is a bit awkward when photographing, but who does not love pictures printed in an instant. I love the size of the photo, very imstagram-ish. All in all, I think it is a great gift for a girl/ woman who is looking for a camera to have fun with. (:","obsessed, I literally carry this thing with me everywhere I go, it takes BEAUTIFUL pictures.","Love it!","Got this camera for my daughter's birthday. So much fun! She is 8 and is having a blast with it. But be warned that the film adds up quickly!","Great camera","Captures photos as expected, I olny think that the Photos are too expensive","I purchased this camera for my niece.  She loves it! Amazon has a great selection of different photo papers. I think its a great toy to get kids into photography and to be more creative.  She loves to take pics of her friends and gift them photos.","Bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it.","This was our 3rd one because we love them so much.  They are for our kids, but we use them too.  Fun cameras to have around.","goooooood","Great. Thanks.","I bought this for my niece, she loves it.","I love it, I love it, I love it!","I got this as a bday gift from my husband and it's verry cute..i just adore them so much..i haven't quite learn how-to use it just yet..but my husband is teaching me how..the camera and Thw accessories are just so cute..love love them?","Love it so much, I take tons of pictures and stick them on my wall.","Wonderful price for a wonderful camera! The color is super cute and the camera itself is very easy to hold and great to take fun pictures with","My daughter enjoyed using this camera. Pictures develop immediately.","I love these cameras! I have bought 3 as gifts and everyone I have given them to love them. The pictures come out so cute and are a great way to capture memories. I have had mine for almost 4 years and it is still working great.","I didn't buy mine here but I have one. Mines dark blue. I like it although there is no way to turn off the flash. So every picture you take no matter how bright the flash is on. And it messes up the picture as it comes out. Its too white and it messes up. Disappointing.","I thought the color was brighter, but still Pink, and still an Instax! Love it ...","Takes amazing beautiful pictures.","My nine year old loves her new camera!","Super fun camera! Great to use to teach kids to take pictures. It has a circle in eyesite to help center the pictures.","Love love love.<br />Great for keeping memories and it's so easy to use.","Received exactly what I wanted in a timely fashion very happy with my purchase","The camera came very quick and works perfectly!","I really like the idea of this camera.  However, I would note that if you take a photo in the daylight (even under shade), the photo that comes out becomes overexposed.  When in the sunlight, the photo is completely white (i.e. totally overexposed).  Not exactly conducive to use.","Everyone loves the pictures and the quality is awesome","Photos definitely turn out best in normal lights or sunlight. Photos in low lights/filtered lights don't turn out the best (or in mirrors because the flash ruins it)<br />In cloudy weather colors aren't as saturated and the sky turns out a little grey rather than the actual blue you see in person (at least my experience in San Francisco)<br />All other photos though turn out great and how I expected :)","Birthday gift and she loves it","It's a really great camera!!! Pictures print out really fast and come out pretty clear!!  Love it!","Love the pics and kids have great fun.","cute, but to me seems overpriced.","my eight year old grand-daughter loved this camera.  the only draw back is the cost/amount of film sheets.  my granddaughter immediately wanted to take pictures of everyone at her party and very quickly used up all the sheets she got as gifts.  the camera however, works great and is easily operated by an 8 year old.","Thought this would be a fun \"toy\" for teenagers who love instant images (vs using their digital camera and waiting to upload/share).  Either the camera or the film (Or both) are not quality as only half of the pictures seem to come out at all.  At first we thought it was \"first time\" user adjustments and we kept it and kept using it and then the time to return/exchange it passed.  It's fine but I think there are better ones out there and they won't disappoint the teens as often with the production of grey film every other photo for no reason.","Very fun, great novelty for party","This is a great polaroid for the price (not taking into consideration how much the costs of film will pile up in the long run). However, don't expect perfection. I had high expectations for this camera due to the thousands of positive reviews, and it really does add up. But in the end, it is more or less a toy. It's cheaply (but well-) manufactured; the viewfinder is not connected to the lens, so if you center the subject you want to capture with the guide in the viewfinder, the picture will not come out centered. Think of the lens and viewfinder in the sense of how it's physically positioned; the lens is positioned about an inch to the left of and lower than the viewfinder. The picture will come out this position if you use the guide of the viewfinder, so adjust accordingly after some practice shots. This means that, yes, you will waste some shots out of your expensive film cartridge.<br /><br />Another reason why I gave it a three-star review (on top of it feeling super delicate like a toy in your hands) is because the camera itself will not always print the last film of your cartridge or the count will be off. I've practiced with a few cartridges, and the count is incorrect more often than not, leading you to believe you have that last picture to use when you really don't, or its count will be off and not print the last film that you have. I've seen other Youtube videos where users have had the same issue, so I think with such a cheap camera, this will happen every now and then.<br /><br />But all in all, I'm super pleased with the vintage look and shots that I've captured thus far. It's not a perfect Polaroid camera, but it does the job, and you'll look cute while you're at it.","I will be using this for my wedding guest book. Product shipped quickly. I took a test pic and it came out great!","Love it! Very cute","Bought this for my daughter! She loves it! She takes it with her everywhere!!","Bought 2 of these as gifts. Both recipients loved. Highly recommend","I love it! The product it's exactly like the picture. And the photos are great!","Works great, looks great, pictures come out fast and look awesome!","Product came quickly and exactly as advertised! However, the box came damaged and it was for a gift. Not as appealing but gift was still in working order.","So cute! I use it all the time!","my kids love it they say there making  memories","Fun camera for kids...except the film for it is expensive","Gift for my daughter and she loves it","Excellent Service, Excellent Product!  Absolutely love it!","Super cute camera...great for any Hello Kitty fan!!!","Can't be leave these things are cumming back!  A product that really was not that great in the 70's but my daughter (15) thought this was the greatest thing ever.  Big hit with the friends.....I don't get it...but she's happy!  You don't get many pictures out of film packs","Great camara. The pics are a bit smaller that i touhgt.","Love it!","So cute","Wonderful product. Nostalgia galore! Takes great photos!","I absolutely love my new camera! The pictures come out instantly and the quality is great. I love that the lens automatically adjusts to the setting that I'm in. My family and friends all want one now. Lol. This is the best birthday gift I could've given to myself!","I still have my original instant Polaroid camera from the late 70's - 80's.  Nicely updated.  Awsome to share pictures instantly with family and friends at events.","Great camera:) no complaints. Love the little pictures.","Great camera and the photos come out great.","My Granddaughter loves it.  Thank you.","Absolutely adore this camera. It's so retro. The pictures come out very clear. It's nice to have especially if you have children. They get to experience a small part of the past & that's always a good thing. I think the film is a little expensive but I understand why that is. It makes a wonderful present. I love all the color options you have with the actual camera. It's durable & easy to carry. I would highly recommend !<br /><br />Please take a second  after reading my review and let me know if it was helpful or not","At first I couldn't get all the lights to stop flashing in the front and had to go through 3 different batteries to fix it. Seems to be working now","Awesome camera! Love having the photos print out instantly.","This camera is great! I just wish it came with a strap or something. I feel like it's a cheap plastic and will break if I drop it!","Nice","Really nice products, my GF have lot of fun with it. I bought this camera for my GF bday, with Fujifilm INSTAX Mini Instant Film Twin Pack.  I'm not a big fan of instant camera, i'm more digital, but this one change my mind. For digital camera you took a picture and save it on computer, i guess that you still have to picture but to me, instant camera that capture the perfect moment, and you can take it with you better than go on computer and printed.  Instant camera seem more memorable than digital, in my opinion.  Great product and highly recommended.","HUGE HIT!!!!  Purchased for my daughter for her birthday.  She is in love with this camera.....she is now bringing it everywhere with her.<br />Easy to use and perfect size not huge like the Polaroid cameras of my youth.","great","I absolutely LOVE this camera!  It's sooooo cute!  It takes very good pictures and prints them out immediately! It's compact yet not too small.  It is very user friendly and was simple to operate.  You have to look directly into the view finder to take pictures.  Make sure you change the settings for the lighting before you take the picture because it resets back to sunny.  I would definitely purchase this again.  The item arrived quickly, as described, and with no damage.  This would make an awesome gift!","It's great but the first day I got it it broke :( . It does feel cheap and plastic-y.","A cute little camera! I used it for my wedding and the guests absolutely loved taking pictures with it!","I loved it came fast and it's what I expected I loved it ","Inlove it","I want to love this because the pictures that do turn out well are really artsy. I'm the new world Polaroid Picasso. I can't get it to take good pictures that turn out well outside though. They are all so white that you can't tell which side of the cat it is. I guess I would recommend just taking pictures inside if you get this or figuring out how to take pictures outside (the directions aren't in English).","Favorite camera EVER!","Loved it.","This camera is lightweight and easy to throw into a bag and take on the go. I opted to not buy the case and I haven't had any issues thus far, but I also haven't tested this in rugged conditions. It's really a perfect gift for kids, teens and even college age students. I'm in my 30s, but I love it as well.<br /><br />The big downside is that the film is expensive, but I did not let that affect my review of the camera itself.","Very convenient for traveling! I definitely recommend getting the carrying bag/purse for it, as it can get bumped around a lot. I carried mine in my bag, and I would occasionally hear a hum coming from my bag, just to find that I had turned the camera on and popped out the lens by accident.","Girlfriend loves it.","If you are considering getting a Fujifilm Instax Mini, do it! Our niece had one and we used it for my father is laws 75th birthday for a DIY photo both and it was so much fun. Then we barrow it from her with the birth of our son and took picture with everyone the first time they held him and those photos are on a cork board in his room. We loved hers so much we got one for ourselves. The film is easy to load, the batteries last a long time, and the picture quality is great. The film is pricey so it’s not like the digital where you can just take and take picture so we use it sparingly. Each time I bring it more people are impressed by it and ask question about it. Also love that it comes in so many colors.","Present for granddaughter<br />She is very happy with it","I bought this for my daughter and she was very happy with it, she likes things that are old timey and this was as close as I could get to the one like I had growing up. I really hated to buy it because the film is so expensive and she really likes to take pictures. I also thought the pictures were dark and the quality was not very good.","My daughter loves it!!!","This is a nifty little camera.  I only gave it 4 stars because if you are looking for high quality pictures, this is not it.However, it is really a great camera for my intended use and I couldn't be happier with it.  This is a gift for my 11 year old daughter and after testing it, she will love it.  It was incredibly simplistic to use.  I did not need the instructions to figure out how to load the film or use the camera.  The pictures came out easily and with a decent quality.  It does look as cute in person as it does in the picture.<br /><br />The camera itself seems to be very durable although I am not willing to drop it on purpose to find out.  I know she will though, and will come back and report how it held up. I would absolutely buy this again as a gift for another girl and I recommend it.","My daughter totally loved getting this for her birthday! The product is well-made and super-cute! It's exactly what we needed to put a HUGE smile on her face and well-worth the price!","Super fun camera.  We use this all the time.  Great for keepsakes.","I love this camera! It has become my go-to for memorable events!","Bought as a gift and the recipient was very happy !","Cute camera and perfect for memories. The film is pricy but worth it. Really recommend and it's still a popular camera","5 year old takes perfect pictures with this!","It's so fun capturing life's little moments with one of these cameras! I am not at all disappointed with my purchase and if you're debating on purchasing one of these, I would highly recommend it.","I take this camera everywhere with me, it was quickly shipped & it's so cute. Hello Kitty is my favorite! Thank you!","love it...","Worked great really fun camera my daughter has a blast with it.","EVERYONE loves my camera! I get compliments every time I take it out and about with my friends. So glad they are making a comeback","Christmas gift for my sister, had some issues getting it to work the first week but after some time on the phone with the manufacturer it was resolved.","some time work and some time is not work.","I love it so much","I love my camera, it's gone everywhere with me this summer including hiking trips to bachelorette parties. Great buy and great memories.","In love with this camera! So glad that I bought it. If you are debating on if you should buy it or not, I'd say to go ahead and do it! I couldn't be any happier with this purchase. It's cute, takes great pictures, and is the perfect size for on the go. Also, it conveniently comes with the batteries it needs so you don't need to worry about buying some before it arrives. I would recommend this product to anyone!!","That's amazing pack","Absolutely love it","Love it! Very happy and pleased with my purchase, I wish I can have all the colors","Girlfriend loved it! Only down fall is film is expensive and goes quickly and easily.","Bought this for a bday gift for my lil girl. She loved it. Film is quite expensive avg $1 a pic. so tell them to practice their shot with their phones before goin trigger happy on the shutter, and start askin you for $20 every couple days to refill their stock.","I love this camera!!! Its so fun and I love taking it where I go. super fun to hang up all the pictures you take and put in albums, the pictures are good quality, totally worth it!","Exactly what I wanted! Sure, it can be difficult to take the perfect shot, but that's part of the fun of instant film! If you keep in mind that the viewfinder is to the right of the lens and take into consideration the lighting around you, you'll get the hang of it really quickly. For a cheap, fun novelty, this camera is fantastic.","LOVE THE COLOR","I enjoy the camera and the pictures are decent quality. The one downfall is that the pictures are not the \"normal polaroid size\" you would think.","Was a present for step daughter she loves it","great value","very happy.","Great camera for my 5 yr old girl, who had wanted instant camera for a while now. She loved taking pictures AND getting the prints right away, as opposed to all the digital stuff we have. Word of a caution: be sure to let your kid know NOT to open the back of the camera where the film goes. My kid opened and wasted the full film pack","Excelent product and delivery!","I have ordered this camera 3 times for birthday presents and it's been the hit of the party. Clear and beautiful pictures all the time.","Ok","I want to thank Amazon for the great delivery. I received this from my boyfriend as a bday gift. And I couldn't be happier. It's a beautiful camera.  I cannot wait for the wonderful Memories to be captured","A great gift for my sister on her birthday, but was annoyed it did not ship with a pack of film in the box.","love love love this item. so happy i got it.","This a great camera and love the fact that they are keeping the polaroid in style. awesome pictures right at your finger tips. Camera is awesome","Excellent camera","I bought this as a birthday gift for my 11 year old daughter. It was a hit, and it is a lot of fun. I did some research on different brands before purchasing, and chose this one after reading good things about it, and seeing that the film for it was reasonably priced. It is easy to use, and she figured out how to insert the film and use the camera on her own. I do recommend the selfie mirror, as there is no way to see yourself otherwise, and that's how they take most of their photos these days. The photo quality is a little higher than the old style Polaroid's. They are for fun and memories, not for your high quality photos. I'll admit, I'm a little jealous and wish I had one as well. I might have to borrow it from her once in a while. It does bring back some good memories, and it is a lot of fun.","It was as expected.","Santa sent this camera to my 5 yr old daughter. She figured out how to use it in minutes but I have to load the film. She's obsessed and uses it constantly for her artistic expression. Silly girl even took it to Walmart to capture her day.","Got this as a gift my gf loves it the pictures come out cool","Love it!!! Best gift you can get to a girl or mother.... Great memories it a pretty way.","Item was perfect","I love it","This camera is great for children and adults alike.  Instant photos are unique.","These cameras are so much fun.  Similar to an old Polaroid.  The film is kind of expensive, but it is just a fun and retro way to take pictures.  I bought one for each of my kids and they have a blast with them.","I have only had my install camera for a couple of days and I AM IN LOVE!! I have used it in bright sunlight at the beach, in a dark restaurant, in the house photographing a wiggly puppy, and near sunset. All the photos turn out perfect, never blurry, and have the perfectly charming vintage look only instant photos can have. I have carried it in my purse without any case or protection and haven't noticed any problems, but I do want to pick up a case with a shoulder strap for when i'm carrying a small bag","The best gift my daughter receive","it's a little cheaper than I expected but looks just like the pictures","exelent!","I've been wanting this since a friend had one for their wedding guest book! So glad I bought it.<br />Amazon has the best price I've seen and we tried it out at my daughters birthday. It was a hit!","Bought this for a gift for my mother, she loves it and uses it everywhere she goes!","Got this for my grand daughter she takes great pictures...9 years old","Wow!.... I was so excited when I finally recieved this Fujifilm Instax Mini camera. I purchased this for my grand daughter for Christmas. I opened it up and the color Raspberry is beautiful. I thought it came with film so I looked everywhere for it. No film to take photos with. Must purchase separately. So, I just couldn't wait to give it to her. Her cousin from England just arrived and I wanted her to be able to use it. I purchased film and she went crazy with it. The first picture was super light and blurry. Then the second one turned out much better. I think this is the greatest thing since the old Polaroid cameras.","Great for travel. I love the picture modes and just the over all quality. I would recommend this to anyone.","YES!","Great camera","This arrived quickly and works amazingly! The instructions weren't in English so it took just a second to figure it all out but it is pretty simple and common sense. I love it and use it all the time, and it looks exactly as pictured.","Easy to use camera and really fun at parties. Solid item for the money.  Love this mini 8 camera!  Everyone at the party loved it!","Love this! I bought the Fujifilm Insta Mini to use in home-made photo booth at my mom's bday celebration. People loved the idea and were able to leave a short message for my mom at the bottom of the photo. Then I collected all the pics and created a mini photo album with the pics. Overall I got my money worth. See the pics below.","I kept debating on which I should get, the Instax, the Polaroid or the Instax printer for smartphones. It came in today and I'm in love with it. I've only taken 3 photos indoors so far and they came out great. My 8 year old took the photo of our dog and she had no problems using it. I was so happy to see that it takes a few seconds for the photo to develop just like the old ones did. I think the size of the photos are cute and NOT too small. I went with this brand mostly because I wanted the look of the original Polaroid film with the white boarder. Next on my list will be the Instax printer so I can print pictures that are on my phone. Very happy with the product. Going to Lake Winnie tomorrow and can't wait to try the different settings and see how they turn out!","It is awsome but the pack it comes in little PhotoKit","It's a nice, simple camera. Despite its deceptive, almost child's camera looks (I like it, maybe not in everyone's taste), it produces excellent results on a small, credit card-sized film. It fits perfectly into wallets due to its size. Operation of the camera is very user-friendly, simple push the small button to the right of the lens to power on and wait until the camera decides what light level to use. Once it does, an LED will indicate which setting to use. Then line up the shot and push the button below the viewfinder. When taking shots that are close, make sure to remember that the viewfinder and lens are offset, so aim slightly up and right when close. Far shots it doesn't make a difference.","It's easy to use and small enough to use for going on adventures. You don't have to worry about the battery being charged and just bring it and go! Very stylish and vintage-esque. The light settings take a bit of practice at first to see which desired results you want, but other than that everything works amazing! Definitely a universal gift!","Product does what describes and functions fine, disappointed that I ordered grape and the box came as grape but the camera is black. Will most likely have to return now ","good","It works perfectly, no scratches, no cracks, works like as if it was created yesterday!","This camera is super trendy and takes awesome pictures. It's like a blast from the past when you're using the instax mini. The pictures that come out are super vintage looking and make for Great Wall decorations. The camera is a simple point and shoot with different light exposure options. The pictures can be alittle confusing just looking at them but the instructions have it all laid out for you. The family loves taking picture with this to make it feel like the good ol days. You do have to buy film for this but that's an obvious because it prints them instantly.","I bought this as a gift and it came on time and it was everything I needed!","my daughter loves it.","worked well","I bought one of these cameras about a year ago for one of my daughters on their birthday. She simply loves it because while a digital camera is a modern marvel, the polaroid technology is still a big hit. A big hit because you get the picture right away. No wait time to load the picture to a printer and no printer ink to buy. I bought another, this pink one for another daughter and it still has the same effect.","Love it!","Bought it for a friend and she loves it.","Cause my daughter loves it ,so it makes me happy.","Simple and easy to use. I love that the photos are easy to load and the film for it is great and vibrant. I like that that the photos that come out look more like they did way back then, but still look more updated. If that makes sense.","Love the camera and the color the only problem is that the indoor outdoor settings twist knob doesn't work properly and when that happens the picture color quality isn't great. When we are outdoors we change the setting to sunny but it flashes the knob twists settings on it its on and pictures come out really bright with a lot of glare. Other than that when it's working it works great and it has taken great quality pics but sometimes it doesn't. So you will waste more film then anticipated.","My 11YO loves this. Only wish the refills weren't so expensive.","it was what i thought great price, pic quality was not quite what i had hoped for but it is an instant camera. It was bought for my 11 year old and it works for her to mess around with and learn about costs of hobbies, film is pricey.","Polaroid is back!!! 10 times better!!!","So far it's a really nice camera! Takes really vivid pictures and my mom loves it!","Good Delivery Service<br />No Damage Items<br />No Missing Items<br />The Picture 10/10","Nostalgically fabulous!!! SO cute. And retro looking... Even though no old camera ever looked like this.<br /><br />I love this \"little\" thing. By today's standards NOT so little, but adorable. This thing is not going into your pocket. Maybe not even your purse... Consider purchasing a case with a strap. The light pink color is perfect. It is easy to use and thankfully pretty intuitive... Since the MANY sheets of instructions are fairly worthless. (Particularly if your eyes are over 20 years old!) I never could find exactly how to load the film so I kind of guessed, and it worked...<br /><br />TO LOAD FILM: (Have batteries installed before adding film... THAT I got from the instructions) Simply drop the opened pack of film in the back, with the 2 little indention areas facing OUT towards you, and the plastic-wrap-ish strip facing the top of the camera. Shut the back, now press the little button under the lens, which opens the lens and turns the camera on. Push the shutter button one time and the cover piece to the film will come out the top. Discard this. Now DO NOT OPEN THE BACK until the film canister is empty. You'll expose the film (got that from the instructions, too).<br /><br />Now just point and click. The photo comes right out the top... Pull it off but try not to touch the image. Within a few seconds you can see the image start to develop (always been the fun part of An instact camera!!)<br /><br />The one thing I hope they can improve in the future... The viewfinder is a little small. If i turn the canera for a horizontal photo, i have trouble seeing through the lense with my glasses on. It needs to be bigger.<br /><br />The photos are small (see my photos here for measurements... Darker ones were at twilight) and what you'd expect from and instant camera, but maybe better than I remember mine being, just a bit. Not digital quality but fast fun and fairly fabulous really! Not blurry. But i suggest you be pretty close to your subject... Play around with it a bit.<br /><br />I'm still planning to use my digital camera for most memories, but my hope is to take one or two instant photos on each trip and add those little photos into my scrapbook with my memorabilia. Then use my camera and computer to see the bulk of them.<br /><br />I suspect I'll buy another as a gift, too.<br />:-)","Love this camera!  Easy to load the film and use.  The pictures are adorable and pop right out of the top of the camera.  The blue color is very pretty.","I got this Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 instant camera for my niece for her birthday.  I purchased the raspberry colored one and the color is a little bit darker in person, more of a red than a pink, it's still a really cute color.  This camera is easy to use and a lot of fun. I got my niece a selfie lens to go with it, she's turning 11 and so of course she wants to take a bunch of selfie's.  The camera is easy to use, and the pictures are about the size of a credit card. I think that my niece is going to have a lot of fun with this camera and I see a lot of film being purchased in the future.  Overall we are very happy with his camera and she loves it, so I would recommend it to anyone looking for an instant camera.","I love it","We bought this for a photo booth at my daughters graduation open house. Everyone loved it. Holding up picture frames in front of you and your friends,and taking silly pictures, was a total hit. You just have to realize the pictures are smaller in comparison to the old Kodak One Step, for those who remember that. I still have one with film, but with the new style and all the different colors, there was no way my daughter was going to let me bring that out. Lots of fun and works great.","I love this. I took it to a wedding and everyone was enjoying it and asking to have their picture taken! SO much fun! And take cute pictures. I can't wait to take this on vacation with me! Everyone needs an instant film camera. Totally worth every penny!","My son loved it.","great camera","Such a good price for a good camera. Really liked this one.","The most fun (and cutest) way to take pictures. I took this with me on my trip to Washington to visit one of my best friends. I made a whole scrap book (over 60 pictures!). I took a whole bunch of pictures of my friends and family and hung them up around my room, it's a nice decoration. People always think its really cool when I take it out. I took some pictures with it when I went to Disneyland yesterday, it got an indirect compliment from Kylo Ren (he was impressed by the photographers use of \"the force\" when to picture rose out at the top and told him to join him in the dark side)!","My wife loved it","I wasn't really aware of how small the photos would be. I thought they would be more like Polaroids than postage stamps. But it does take the photos.","So fun, so awesome. There is something about the candid feel of instant photos. My wife and I think it's nostalgic, our teenage kids think the pictures are lame but the function is fascinating. If you like the old school Polaroids, this camera will bring you back. Rated a 4 out of 5 because the film is so expensive.","Very cute little camera with a fun almost vintage but not quite feel. Easy to use and takes pictures that aren't very high quality but are fun to take at parties and give them out to your friends as gifts. This camera works very well and was much less expensive on amazon compared to other places I've seen such as urban outfitters (it was about 70 dollars and did not come with any film)","I used this for a photobooth for my girlfriend's bridal shower and it was adorable!","This is an awesome throwback! The picture takes a little while to pop out but everything else is great! I love instant cameras!","It does not work great at night what so ever. As well as outside in the sun. Pictures came out either black or super light unless it was taken indoors","I ordered this for my 6 year old photography lover. We got it with Amazon Prime, therefore it was delivered within two days. He was so excited! We opened the package loaded the film cartridge and he's been snapping pictures ever since. I would recommend this product to anyone, and would re order as well. Thank you Fujifilm for a great product.","very fun! I bought for my girl friend she aboslutely loved it.","Perfect for capturing life's moments. Love my instax camera!","This camera is very cute and brings back many great memorys of instant cameras. I like this Mini 8 and I like the quality of pictures it takes. Their small but their the right amount. Now a days with cameras in the cell phones no one develops pictures . I like this instant film camera and I like having the physical picture instantly and its great. I like the flash and the camera itself. It is easy to use and understand. Very few instructions. The only issue is that I will have to be buying a lot of film. The film is not that cheap but its a lot of fun taking pictures and I will be starting my scrap book adventures. I recommend getting a case because you do not want the lens to scratch or get the camera damaged. The price is not too bad.","Had great fun with this camera at my daughters birthday bash.  Hung pictures on a board her friend had made her during the party","I absolutely love the camera. It takes amazing pictures.","I am so happy I purchased this camera, the item arrived quickly & promptly. It is definitely worth it! I am so happy to capture memories in this form. I plan to make a scrap book soon! The camera is light weight and certainly met up to my expectations.","pictures not as good as a regular camera -- fun for my granddaughter","Absolutely love this camera! It is a little larger than I expected, its definitely not compact by any means. Prepare to have something to carry it in unless you dont mind carrying something around with you. Overall great product, super happy with the purchase.","LOOOVEEE this camera! It's cute, the color is LOVELY, and portable. It was exactly what I was looking for. The pictures is smaller than I expected, but it's a wonderful keepsake. Totally recommend.","I bought one and it worked well. The problem is that you have to buy film. But it still is a good camera","Super cute camera! Perfectly good condition love it so much!","Product was shipped quickly, came in perfect quality. Great price. Wasn't disappointed whatsoever.","I love the photos I can take with this. The only disappointment is that I can't take too many pictures outside because the sunlight messes it up. Oh well. It's still quite lovely!","Great quality pics. It was a gift. My niece loved it!!","Absolutely love it, so much fun and easy to use.","Always Ben a fan of the Polaroid cameras growing up & this new version still brings me back! Love love love it!","absolutely love !","I am so happy I purchased this camera, the item arrived quickly & promptly. It is definitely worth it! I am so happy to capture memories in this form. I plan to make a scrap book soon! The camera is light weight and certainly met up to my expectations.","I have taken this to nearly every single trip I have gone since its purchase. It is an expensive camera at first, not really since I bought it at around 60 dollars. But on the long run, Film can be quite expensive. This camera just requires 2 double A batteries. You pop them in and wait for it to light up an automatic indicator telling you what lens to use and boom a great memorable polaroid. Although sometimes the light sensor can be tricked if you cover the sensor or other light is being shined at it, so consider your surroundings before setting the indicated lens. Also the only thing that would or should be changed would be where the preview lens is. It is awkward being on the side. No one tends to know where to look at first.","Exactly what my daughter wanted and works great!! Perfect for the tween amateur photographer:) Love this polaroid.","I love this camera , it isa peice you really have to own and the pictures are magnificent but make sure to put it on the correct setting","Good","I absolutely love it ","I purchased this to use for our Polaroid guest book at our wedding. It was GREAT! We bought extra batteries but only need 2 sets for the whole night. Photos turn our clear and everyone had a great time with it. My grandmother used to have a Polaroid camera and we loved getting the photos instantly! I'm excited to keep this and use it for other parties!","My daughter thinks this thing is great.  Why anybody wants a modern day Polaroid camera is beyond me; and, just like the Polaroids, the photos are not nearly as good as what you can get with a digital camera or a smart phone. I guess instant photos are still fun.  Poor old Polaroid, if only they knew.","I love the camera, just like how imagine it would be and it came wayyyyyyy fast. Arrived at the same time my case arrived.","Bought for my friend and we had fun using it right away. So cute, makes a nice decor piece as well.","Nice little camera!","I don't know if it's how I'm taking pictures or if the camera is faulty, because the settings never seem to work for me. Other than that, the camera works perfectly.","I love this camera and I am so pleased with this purchase! It is very compact and lightweight so it is perfect for traveling to any location or event worth capturing on film. The color of this product is very true to the picture which was nice too! The settings are very easy to understand and there is a manual that comes with the camera which provides clear instructions on the best method for use. I would highly recommend this camera for anyone who is contemplating this purchase. You will love it and have a blast while capturing your memories! The price is awesome and I think it was definitely worth spending my money on!","My fiance loves this camera,  and was telling me she wanted this camera months in advance.  She was so excited when she got it.  She wish there was a mirror to take selfish but she actually found a accessory online and will be ordering soon","This is my favorite toy! It's a blast to bring anywhere. People get a kick out of it. Not to mention- that price is so low! I highly recommend.","Great product and an excellent price. Cheaper than big box stores when purchased as the whole kit. My daughter loves it.","What a great throwback to earlier times!!! Gave this as a gift to the wife and she loved it! In a digital day and age how cool to get the instant gratification from a physical photo to pass around and then throw on the fridge. Don't expect high quality photos but what it lacks in quality it easily makes up in fun!<br /><br />I knocked off one star for functional issues while trying to use the peep hole (what your look through to take the photo) and then trying to take the photo. They just don't fully work well together. Maybe it's my larger hand/fingers that cause the problem but none the less it was a little cumbersome. No biggie though as I'm looking more at the experience and not so much the final product.<br /><br />Great find and huge kudos for gift creativity!","Used this for graduation, takes longer to produce a picture than expected, but works well.","Bought this camera for our 5 year old girl, she adores it. Takes it everywhere","Love these things, thanks.","This takes great pictures.","Love this! We used it for our guest book of photos. Easy to use and adds some fun.","Love!!! Super fast, easy for kids to use!","I bought this as a gift, but the tags expired on my car in july and i barely got them updated","My grand daughter loves the camera! She has to get use to how to set the settings......as the film is a little pricey!<br />I haven't received the two year warranty protection that was suppose to come via E-mail that I paid from!!!!","Just what I wanted to get into film photography. Although buying film get be annoying and spendy. Actually holding the photo in your hand makes it even more special.","The quality leave's a lot to be desired.  Very Easy to use and if you aren't expecting more than a novelty fun device, this is great!","I love that polaroid pictures made a comeback. We took ours to Africa so we could leave photos for the orphans we were working with. You want to see a kids face light up give them a polaroid! :) But seriously it works exactly like you remember it. any easy load cartridge is inserted, you line up the shot in the window, and out pops the picture. I had to shake the picture for about 5-10 minutes before it fully developed. A couple never fully developed. Not sure what caused this exactly but I think that is normal. It obviously had to survive a lot of handling and adverse weather, and it handled it like a champ. I'm sure these are already a huge hit at weddings but they would also be great for parties if you setup one of those photo booth areas. You can buy this and be happy with the results. If this was helpful please Like the review. Thanks!","love it","First off, I've been wanting one of these for FOREVER. So when I finally got one for my birthday, I was extrememely excited to get my hands on it. The estimated arrival date was spot on, no earlier, no later. The camera itself is ADORABLE, and I paired it with some Hello Kitty film to boot. By far the easiest camera I've ever used! Definitely recommend to those thinking about purchasing.","It's a MUST BUY! My aunt ordered this for me, and I absolutely LOVE it. First test on my dog lol. But it works very good","In love with this camera! So glad that I bought it. If you are debating on if you should buy it or not, I'd say to go ahead and do it! I couldn't be any happier with this purchase. It's cute, takes great pictures, and is the perfect size for on the go. Also, it conveniently comes with the batteries it needs so you don't need to worry about buying some before it arrives. I would recommend this product to anyone!!","Love the hello kitty film! The film is about the size of a credit card. Our daughter loves watching the film develope.","I've been wanting one of these for quite a while and I'm really glad I finally decided to buy one. They take very nice pictures and in the instructions it has a lot of tips to avoid out of focus or poorly lit shots. It's really nice to be able to take a picture and immediately have the physical copy!!","such a fun camera, and super easy to use","A party favorite amongst college students. Really meets the instant gratification young adults are looking for.","It gets all stars cause it's so great. Two of my friends had this at the last party I went to and I bought it while I was there. Came the next day (may not be the case for everyone) and I can't wait to use it. I got it in the Grape color and it's perfect.","Awesome camera!!! I bought it for my 10th year-old niece and she loves it!!!! Picture quality is great and loved the color!!!","my daughter is very excited","I love it so much. Mine doesn't give me any problems. It takes amazing pictures and is easy to handle.","I will cherish this camera forever. It works great and pictures come out really nice.","I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.","I love this Polaroid. I bought it for my graduation party but it is sturdy and looks like I can use it for much more. The white isn't tacky or plastic-y. Super cute and will make for some great memories!","I LOVE my little camera. It's so cute!","Bought this for my little sister and she LOVES IT!! Comes with everything you need to start taking some awesome instant photos! Jut make sure you buy the one that comes with film! Film is easy to install, photos are easy to take and the camera is great quality!<br /><br />I like bringing back the vintage vibes with this camera as it gives a nostalgic feeling when your photo instantly comes out of the camera!<br /><br />Great product!","Purchased for my daughter's birthday and she loves it!","The color of this camera is ugly, not as pictured and I returned it.","Love love love this camera! Only giving 4 stars because after taking 3 pictures with it the film started developing into just an all black picture. I did my research and this is a somewhat common defect of the Mini 8 cameras. I returned this camera to Amazon and they had sent me a new one in only 2 days!!! Amazing customer service I am beyond pleased!","Great little camera. Love the photos","I bought this at a local store. Really great camera, make sure to read the instructions. The lighting is an important factor in the whole capturing process, so be on the look out for that.","So glad I bought this. It is such a great deal to get all of this for around $70. The case is very helpful. Now when I travel I can bring my camera with me. Definitely an amazing product that I would highly recommend buying!","This camera is super cute and takes great photos. Very easy to use, easy to load film, pictures turn out great. Had one that was black after taking it.  Love the grape color...all around great buy!","good product","takes better pics than I ever imagined. With pictures I like instant that I can hold in my hand and this is the camera. I absolutely love and the price of the camera and film are very reasonable...I love the blue color","I have been wanting to get a polaroid camera for SO long and this camera has truly fit the bill.It has a cute color(I chose yellow), user friendly functions and all round, a load of fun! If you're sentimental, definitely get this. The thrill of instant photos can never be replaced!","Absolutely love it!!","Awesome!","It gets shadey in the eyehole thing. When I bought this i was excited to take a bunch of pictures. It gets old after like 4 pics.","So fun !","Still having trouble using this but I know when I read the \"how too\" book I will learn.<br />I love it","Great product","Everything met my expectations","Super cute! As soon as the pictures come out I pin them above my bed. Lots of fun to use for all ages. Great gift","I ordered the raspberry color. Installation of film was simple and easy. Package comes with a string handle and 2 AA batteries. NOTE::film is sold separately unless stated its a bundle. The only con is that it's only 10 photos per film box so it gets pricey after awhile.","Works great!","Perfect!","Okay, so I really like this camera a lot, my only issue being that it doesn't come with any film at all if you get the base version. Okay, shame on me, I should have read all of the customer questions in detail, but nowhere on the page does it actively say \"film not included.\" Well, hopefully you're reading the reviews before you buy because the base camera does not include ANY FILM AT ALL. I didn't expect much, maybe just a starter pack of even five pieces just so you could at least test out the camera a few times without wasting film.<br />Besides that, I think this is a wonderful camera! I've gotten so used to taking digital photos, that I almost never print them out anymore. This camera is the key to physical, tangible photo memories, perfect for a scrapbook or (in my case) my bulletin board at college. I can't wait to use this to make memories of my junior and senior years!","Got it as a gift for my 6 year old. She was overwhelmed and excited to receive this gift. Very easy for her to use straight out of the box.","Thought it would come with the papers but looks lovely","I got my girlfriend this as a birthday gift and she loves this product and has been taking pictures non-stop! It's a little chunky, but she has a purse, so no worries there!","Overall a really great camera for 12 and 13 year Olds but there are a few downsides to this camera. The quality of the pictures is actually pretty decent but they are slightly blurred. And you have to center the lense not the viewer on the side. It cuts off half of the image. The color is almost exactly to what you see in the pictures and this is a really great birthday present for the price but if you're looking for a camera that will center the picture get the Polaroid snap the picture quality isn't very different but there are no worries about how the picture will turn out.","Love it!! So glad I got it, super fun","Love the color! Easy to use and works great. I've had it in my wishlist for quite a while, and finally happy that I decided to get one","I love my camera. It takes \"fun size\" photos at two different positions.  Just remember to set the lense for the proper lighting or you will be wasting a Polaroid as I have done.","Love it! Disappointed that turning the flash off is not an option. It washes out the photo in some lighting. Good for the price :)","Gift. She loved itm","love it","LOVE this camera! Brings back memories of being a kid! Fun film options & camera colors! Works perfectly and the image quality is amazing for an instant picture! Definitely grab one of these for instant memories! Shipping was fast & the item was well packaged and protected. Simple instructions for loading film (which you purchase seperately! Came with a wrist strap too.","Daughter loves it","Fun and affordable camera for kiddos. We purchased this camera as a Birthday present for an 8 year old. What smash hit. The camera feels sturdy in your hand, not like a piece of cheap plastic. The buttons are larger so easier to push for smaller hands. The instructions were a little complicated but like any 8 will sit and read the instructions. A quick explanation of the camera by an adult and they were off taking pictures, nice ones too. The film brings back that nostalgia. In the camera case came the camera, the instructions and a wrist strap. It did come with two AA batteries. There was NO film with the camera as it says. We have had great clarity with pictures, even when the 8 year old is taking them.<br /><br />This is a super fun camera and you can buy a bunch of accessories to go with it, even a selfie lens! This is a very fun camera for younger kids and a would be a great camera for weddings, birthday parties, or any party.","I bought this for my daughter for her 8th birthday and she loves it!  Its good ol' fashioned fun.  A little sensitive to lighting, it took her 5 pictures or so to get the hang of it, but she loves it.","Kids are enjoying it..","In love with this camera! So glad that I bought it. If you are debating on if you should buy it or not, I'd say to go ahead and do it! I couldn't be any happier with this purchase. It's cute, takes great pictures, and is the perfect size for on the go. Also, it conveniently comes with the batteries it needs so you don't need to worry about buying some before it arrives. I would recommend this product to anyone!!","My daughter loves this camera, especially the color.","excelent , thanks","my third one! gave the first away because I wanted a different color and the second one just broke this weekend (after so many years!). I love instant cameras!<br /><br />no filter was used for the pic. it's a true raspberry color not so much hot pink like I originally assumed.","Love this camera. The color is so cute, looks exactly like the picture and it's the perfect size","This come is so awesome !","SUPER fun & amazing. Came a day early","Good","excellent!!","The camera is beautiful and my teenager niece loves it (she's 12). It's very easy to use. I recommend to buy it along with the purple case, it protects the camera perfectly. Arrived as promised, which is something to brag about since international shipping tends to be an ordeal. The color is exactly as shown in the image.","Seth the sails a assesses xxvh,is the St xy","Fantastic","It was great quality and did what I expected it to.","My preteen loves it! Well made product too!","Awesome gift","Fun! I bought this in a nostalgic phase. Reminds me of middle school. The pictures come out a little small for my liking, and the light setting can be a little tricky to figure out, which means you waste a few pictures trying to get the picture to come out right. That is annoying to me, as Polaroid film is expensive and it can add up quickly. Overall its a fun idea. I love the color and I use it occasionally. I don't use it as much as I would like because of how expensive the film is.","The camera was inexpensive compared to other places where these are sold. The pictures about the size of a drivers license. The camera takes good pictures except for in sunny areas.","Simply adorable","Love this, bought it for a friend.","This camara was above my expectations it's been working perfectly. I've already had it for a few months now and it hasn't had any problems. I put some of the pictures in my daughters lo jet and she loves it","Came in perfect condition and works very nicely!","My daughter has only used it once since I purchased it and the pictures are very nice and clear.","This is really fun for my 16 year old daughter.<br />We gave it to her at her birthday party.<br />She and friends liked taking pictures and having them readily available and watching them develop before their eyes.<br />I think I am going to buying lots of FUJI film over the year and better invest.","We had so much fun with this camera!","Love this","A great camera for instant photos! Fairly easy to use and the picture quality is decent!","I wish I could give this a 10 star review.  I LOVE my instax. We bought it for our guest book for our wedding and I'm hooked.  I keep a constant supply of the film to take pictures of my daughter from the time she was born to every month picture,  her baby book, fun event,  birthday party,  i just can't get enough of it.  The only down side is that I wish I had spent the 10 extra dollars and gotten a colored one because white gets dirty so quickly.","This such a fun camera. I love having so many polaroid pictures.","fun fun fun","I absolutely adore this camera!! Works great, so cute, exactly what I was hoping for.","Very good, good shipping, thank you.","Loving my new Fuji Instax mini 8 camera!!!!  Perfect for parties, Selfies with old friends, etc.  I recently went to a baby shower where they had a pink one, because the mom was expecting a girl.  They created an album of photos people shot from it at the party!  How cool!<br /><br />I also bought the carrying case, so the photo shown has the bottom half of the case showing.  It is not included with the camera.  I will be having lots of fun with this baby!","My granddaughter loved it","My wife loves it!","It's a wonderful camera","This is a fun camera and as someone who has always had some instant camera this one is perfect and fun","Very easy to use, pictures are great, the color is beautiful(i have the rasberry one)<br />I recommend!!!","Awesome camera !!! loving it !!","Size and color of the prints is my main complaint.  The prints are not very big and the color that comes out isn't too impressive.  I remember color with the old Polaroids being a thousand times better and the prints were larger.","This is a wonderful instant camera. I have tried out other ones but the pictures do not come out that great. I love the size of the pictures and the style of the camera. Very easy to use.","BEST CAMERA EVER!!! Love this camera! Its the cutest thing i have ever owned! Its seriously the best and takes great pictures!!!!","its really cute and fun to have","Super cute camera to have; I think my favorite thing about it is actually having tangible photos for memories, also did include batteries !","I love the idea of instant photos for my scrapbook, but the photos where poor.  Seem like you can only use it in daylight if you want to see who is in the photo and If i took it in direct sunlight the pics where blurry.","I bought this as a baby shower prize. But it was given at the end so I used it with the film to give every guest a chance at taking home a picture. It was a hit. Mini, maybe a little small but people vied for the prize at the end. It got its use, a winner was happy and guests had a take home momento. It was much cheaper than a picture booth!","some pictures ended out coming out blank and the lens was still open, and even if the camera is on it shouldn't let it take a picture.<br />all though the pictures that worked came out pretty good!","I am so glad I bought it on Amazon, it comes with a protection plan but even after that, the total was still cheap. The camera is not too bulky but not thin as modern digital cameras. It does the job of taking pictures but I am still not used to working the flashes.","It came in perfect condition and it works great!! I highly recommend this camera!!","Amazing totally recommend buying best thing ever !","I bought this as a present and honestly it exceeded my expectations. The price and quality of this camera is amazing. The only downside is that I wish the film wasn't so expensive.","Nice little camera in a time where instants are harder to come by. The design is nice, with smooth sides and hand grips that make it comfortable in your hand. The photo quality is good but not excellent because it's sometimes hard to decide which lighting mode to put it in, but that's to be expected with an instant camera as they're more for the novelty than practicality. I've had mine for a little over a year and it still works as well as the day I got it.","My daughter loves it. Very good quality.","Simple, easy to use....great little pictures.","Can't wait to use on my trip, love how these photos come out","great gift","When I first saw the camera I knew I wanted it because I love polaroids and it's just adorable. I didn't think the picture quality would be all that good but it actually is. I just took my first picture and it's so clear. I thought it would be really grainy but it's not. The picture also looks vintage and cool. The camera is really easy to use too. I would definitely recommend buying this camera.","Soooo cute!  ","Good gift for teen","Bought this for my wife. She loves taking pictures and place them in her scrapbook. The camera's color is cute too. She loved everything about it!","The most adorable camera I have ever had! first of all the packaging is so impeccable and the quality is amazing. I love the way the old school pictures look . This instant camera is the best one on amazon! especially if you are looking to have amazing portable small camera with great quality. I was looking to do some scrapbooking to capture moments that are either the simple things or important days and this works for me. To top it the price is awesome! and affordable! I would even get another one in different colors:-)","Very neat!<br />Great color and cool design!","I loved it, it works perfecly","So cute and fun to use.","I love it so much!","Love the thought of instant film again!","I had my doubts about this camera based on some of the reviews I read, but it's actually pretty awesome. You hardly need the instructions to figure out how to put it together, meaning put in the batteries, put in the film, put it on the right setting for the lighting and shoot! My picture came out clear and of good quality for a polaroid. This is going to be so much fun to use at weddings and family trips, I'm really excited to have added this as one of my accessories besides my cellphone camera. The film is a little expensive, but it is not meant for taking as many pictures as you would on your iphone camera, I really will only be using this for special occasions anyway, but it would be nice if they could lessen the price of the film! Especially since it is so tiny (like others have said, the size of a credit card) but the camera is SO worth it for the price, and for the overall joy it brings to you and your family. If you have kids, they will absolutely love it too! Great buy. I will make sure to add photos later!","I love this camera","Love this camera!","Cute, compact, and super fun to use!! Love my new camera!","I am totally enjoying my camera","Super cute camera! Absolutely love it! The picture quality is not so great, but I guess that is kinda expected with Polaroid pics.","Beautiful camera, in great condition and the shipping was extremely fast!--Can't wait to use it.<br />UPDATE: I love it so much! The Polaroid pictures are really cute and it's so easy to take them! Works like a charm.","This Camera did the best for me. Yes it might be confusing at first but once used it can just become one of your favorite things to do in your free time. If you're a person planning to want to get in taking photos and or want another camera to have fun taking pictures with this Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant could be right for you.","Used this for the guestbook at our wedding. Guest loved it and I haven't stopped using it since. Something unique compared to all the selfies.","SUCH A FUN CAMERA!  QUICK PICS FOR MY 8 YEAR OLD WHO LOVES PHOTOGRAPHY","my daughter love this! Thanks for a smooth transaction!","Awesome !!!","Good quality, cool throw back to days gone buy with the original Polaroid cameras.","Great product!","I bought this as a baby shower prize. But it was given at the end so I used it with the film to give every guest a chance at taking home a picture. It was a hit. Mini, maybe a little small but people vied for the prize at the end. It got its use, a winner was happy and guests had a take home momento. It was much cheaper than a picture booth!","BUMBEB it didn't come w film but it's wonderful","I got this for my birthday I was really pleased with the fact that bigger than I expected .","Love it!","got this for my wife. she loves it","Ok this camera is everything to my daughter. Old school fun. Easy to work and not to big. Great fun!!!","My daughter adores this camera. A great gift option for tweens. Wish the film was more cost reasonable, otherwise great item.","Perfect, just as described.","JUST A HEADS UP FOR PEOPLE HAVING ISSUES WITH PICTURES GETTING THE PROPER LIGHTING - -<br />IF YOU CHOOSE AN OPTION ON THE DIAL THAT IS [[ N O T ]]  LIT UP YOU WILL NOT GET THE  CORRECT EXPOSURE.<br /><br />** I did not buy my camera off of Amazon, I received it as a Xmas gift 2 years ago and I have never had any issues  **","Great deal and came so much faster than expected!  my daughter loved it im ordering my other daughter her for her birthday to","Very good camera, I totally recommended.","Instant cute memories. Was a hit on vacation when I was able to give one of the locals photos to keep. They loved and appreciated it. Priceless.","Good","I love it!! easy to use and super adorable.","Perfect for traveling and for scrapbooking! I just love this camera.","just as expected","My daughter loved it!!!!","I love it.","SUPER CUTE ! LOVE IT! TOTALLY RECOMMEND AS A GIFT OR A PERSONAL CAMERA  DELIVERY WAS SUPER QUICK, SUPER EXCITED the color is beautiful as well","Awesome camera.  Wish it was a little bit smaller and wish the viewfinder was I little bigger and easier to see.  But overall it works great and takes great pictures","I gave it as a gift and she loved it.","This camera is AMAZING! I just got it, and I'm in love with it! Takes great pictures!!","Bought this for my 13 year old granddaughter -- she was THRILLED!!","Good camera","It's awesome....my daughter loves it!!!","Sometimes, the camera acts up but it's so simple and easy to use!","love this little instant camera. its so cute and works as well as the large size just in mini size.","it works","Excellet produtc, working perfectly and is the cutest thing ever! Complete and easy, arriving before I expected (in half of the time) is perfect in every way~","Takes nice picturess","I had a little hard time to figure it out, but it was good and instructions were clear.","So cute!! Love it!!!","great product A++++","Love this camera the color is super cute! Such a better deal to buy it from Amazon! There are only 4 settings for the picture and it's inevitable you'll mess up a few of your pictures starting off but that's the process of learning. I'd recommend getting a fitted bag for it so it's easier to transport and you don't have to worry about the camera going off in a bag.","I bought this camera for my teenage daughter for her birthday, she didn't think she would use it due to her frequent \"selfie\" photography habits but I was gladly mistaken when she quickly re-ordered more film from Amazon the next day, film with some special effects and a regular batch.  I'm glad I introduced her to this retro hobby and she has some photos to display of her friends and animals, not just her \"selfies\"","simply amazing..My daughters where actually amaze being that they have never seen a camera like this one ,,now we all use cell phones and if we wan to develop them its actually a button away ,,,with this beauty pictures come out instantly...","I love love love.","I love this camera.  The pictures come out crisp and vibrant (more than I expected) we cant wait to use this at our wedding!!  Works great.  Packaging was damaged as described but none to the camera inside","I bought this on a whim. Me and my boyfriend have been together for 9 years and living together for 3. One night I woke up and realized that we did not have any pictures of us or the dogs!!! [we never take picture with our phone since we both have the bad luck of getting our phone stolen or lost and digital cameras are so expencive to have pictures printed out.<br />This camera is small and awkward and you can't turn off the flash or else the picture comes out distorted. If you wear glasses it's going to be a bit of a pain. I keep clacking my glasses against the eye hole when I try to take a picture but it works! The pictures come out decent, like those old time photos. Would recommend if your just looking for a few wallet size pictures to keep around.<br />Or some cute dirty pictures you can have around without the fear of someone finding them while looking at your phone!","Great.","Better price","Very good my dtr loved it","Happy with the performance for what it is.  But plastic melts easy. Cord melted into the camera and it was not even in the hot sun. We are not sure what even happened. Was very odd.  Battery case was fine.","Works like it should! I just wish I could double expose.","Love this camera","Nice quality camera, pictures are perfect. low price!","Bought this for my daughter's 10th birthday on a whim and she absolutely loves it and the idea of the instant photos.  I decided on the Fuji over Polaroid based on the cost of the film.  The accessories available are very fun too!","I bought this for my daughter's 15th birthday and it made her sooooo happy!  It takes great pictures (but be warned, they are MUCH smaller than the old polaroids we used to have).  She has so much fun with the accessory pack I also purchased with it (Mudder 11 in 1 Camera Accessory Bundles Set).  My friends and I (we are in our mid-40's) also had fun during a reunion.  I highly recommend this for any teenager for sure!!!","So the package came on time and it was nicely packaged and great condition! I'm usually uneasy with online purchases but this was worth it. I got the raspberry color one and it looks exactly like the first image. The color is like that image. Also, I can't stop looking at the camera! It's so nice and smooth and almost too perfect to use. I'll recommend this if you want one of these cameras!","Love this color,and the camera is really fun, my class loved it","Pretty color camera and it takes good quality pictures!! Used this at our wedding and it was a big hit!","It's super cute, and the pictures are fun to take! The one drawback is that the pictures all have a misty filter. The filter can cause some features of someone's face not to show up in certain lighting, which happened to me. When taking a picture, don't face the sun or away from it. Try to take your picture from a well-shaded area. Film is kind of expensive, too. $1 per picture.<br />Fun: 5/5<br />Function: 4/5<br />Price: 4/5","Good","LOVE this camera. wanted to do a Photo Booth for an event, but couldn't afford the nearly $600 to rent one for just 2 hours. So I purchased this and had guests put their photos into a guestbook. It was a huge hit and so much fun!","cool and fun","The camera worked fine. The lights on the lense did not work.","Got four of these for my bridesmaids and they loved them!","Used for a wedding photo guest book. Unique and fun way to honor bride & groom","Bought this for our 12-year old daughter, and it's a really neat camera. She's in love.<br />The instructions to set it up and start operating are easy to read and follow, which we appreciated, so she could do it on her own.<br />Also, it came WITH BATTERIES. Unheard of, and completely awesome. Thank you for making this really easy to get going with -- what all kids want with their new presents :)","The coolest little thing I've ever owned, absolutely love this camera!","The cutest little thing ever. Lightweight and fun to use. I have had it for almost a year, got my friend one as a present as well. Both have been working great. Just wish film was cheaper to buy as you go through them so fast. Great for travel journals.","fine","Bought this as a gift for my 15 year old's birthday and she LOVES it! Who knew these cameras would be back in style?! Small, compact and easy to use","I bought this as a baby shower prize. But it was given at the end so I used it with the film to give every guest a chance at taking home a picture. It was a hit. Mini, maybe a little small but people vied for the prize at the end. It got its use, a winner was happy and guests had a take home momento. It was much cheaper than a picture booth!","Chic and cute","I really love it , pictures are very clear !","My daughter received the camera as a Christmas present. She loved the idea of an instant film camera and she loved it. Fast forward to this summer, where the instant pictures rarely turn out. .","Great as a beginner camera to get you into instant photography! However I've only had it 3 1/2 months and I already feel like I need to upgrade.","I have looked everywhere for this camera. Went to NY but was a lot more also Michael's is pretty pricy and so is the film. Can't go wrong with Amazon prices!","This is a classic polaroid camera. So many times my pictures hide on a memory disc and I forget to print them. There are light settings in front which are pretty self explanatory. I took this to the beach a few times and even in that brightness the pictures turned out great. You can get 4 people in a selfie easily: just have the person with the longest arms at the end holding the camera. Have someone else peer through the view finder and adjust then squeeze back in the picture!","Lovely addition to my photographic gear. Everyone loves the pictures and the size is perfect to carry them in your wallet. It is somewhat hard to take pictures when there is to much light, but other than that, it is a great camera.","this was great ! it came right when it was supposed to come.","Sometimes the shutter doesn't open and you have a wasted photo -- About one in fifteen. Everything else is great!","Bought it for my 7 year old granddaughter & niece. It was a big hit!","I love this camera! It works perfectly and it's so adorable!","Great camera.<br /><br />The only sucky part is that the flash goes off even when it's not necessary.<br /><br />Still trying to figure out how not to let that happen...","Cool little camera for young photographers. Easy to operate and fun!","Bought this as a gift for my 24 year old daughter.  She says it works perfectly, and she loves the small format print size.  The only drawback is that the film is a little pricey.  Also, there is no digital copy of the photo made.  Once the picture is taken, you only have the instant photo.  But my daughter really likes it.","This instax camera is really cool and am happy that I made the right choice when I bought it. Made from high quality materials. Thanks a lot!","Love this little camera, I can't wait to use it for my wedding guest book!","I brought this camera for my little sister who is 9 and she loves it ??","It is great but the film is very expensive","good","Don't expect the quality to compete with smart phones but used properly, this thing is actually wonderful. My old polaroid has very expensive film so this \"new\" fujifilm works well for me. The price is right, the memories are capture, it's in my favorite color, and I love learning the varying exposures to this type of photography. Excellent product.","This camera is worth buying. It is amazing that you can capture a moment and  immediately have it there to look at.","My teenage daughter loves taking pictures on this digital camera. Fun and retro.","Daughter loves it!  Film is expensive so she doesn't get to play with it as much as she would like.","I bought this is a gift, so I didn't really used it myself. But I took picture with one before. It is a nice camera for an instant photo. It is really fun also.","Love it!","Camera is tons of fun for teen, preteen girls (maybe boys too, I don't know!)","Love it","Got this for my 13 year old granddaughter who is enjoying it very much. She loves to see the pictures develop in front of her. The pictures are small, but evidently this is what she likes about it.","Super fun and easy to use, the film is a bit pricey but the pictures come out super cute!","I loved it I loved it I loved it !!!","Takes nice pictures.  Smaller than expected though","Good","I LOVE IT!!! I love the black color but keep it out of the sun because it will get really hot, and make sure you put your finger over the flash if your taking a picture of something white or it will all be white, and to get the best results put in a dark place","In love with this would but again","the delivery was on time  , and nice product for sharing memories","This camera is a lot of fun! Super easy to use & great quality photos.","Exactly what I  wanted! Super cute little Polaroid camera, not high quality pictures, but adorable and a good deal for the price.","Love this!!!!!","Works great!","We are so happy we used this at our wedding! And that we will have it forever. Great picture quality, easy to use!","This little camera is just the most fun thing! It's a blast to use, but even more exciting is the quality of resulting images. The colors are deep and rich, lending the photos that much more authenticity. This is so much better than Instagram.","works good","My daughter loves this camera! Perfect for young teenager girls!","My son loves it, gives him a chance to express his funny side!!!","Love the camera, feels cheap but actually takes nice photos if your close range","awesome! love it :) came right on time","Adore my new camera! Much nostalgia! Love having actual pictures in my hands again!","Cool camera, quick output. Too bad the viewfinder is so small.","Awesome product","Super cute, lightweight, and so far takes great (at least as great as I expected) photos.  Easy to load film, nice indicator for which light setting to use.  Plan on taking this to Burning Man to \"gift\" photos, and will likely use for fun party giveaways over the holidays.  Would be great for kids, birthday parties, or if you wanted to spring, on each table at a wedding reception.  Saw someone said they used this with their guest book...would be very cute.","great","Amazing camera! Just as described!! I love love it! Cute and so much fun!! I'm very pleased with this product!!","SO much fun to use!!","This is a coolest little camera like the old Polaroids! All the directions were in Non-English but pictures were well enough. My 10 year old got this for her birthday and loves it! The pictures turn out pretty good too!","A very very good camera, worth ever penny!!!","Very Fun","My six year old daughter wanted a camera for her birthday and saw this one and it was perfect although film is rather expensive it was worth the price and she loves it.","The camera is easy to set up. My only issue is that the \"Raspberry\" color is not a raspberry/pink tone as shown (and described). The box states \"Raspberry\" but the color is actually an ugly orange-y/coral color. Not even close to raspberry...a problem since I cannot stand orange colors (which is why I ordered the color raspberry - or so I thought).","PERFECT Camera!!","LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CAMERA! The color is beautiful, the camera is easy to work and even includes different light settings. You turn it on just by pressing the button on the side of the lens and turn it off by pushing in the lens. The camera feels extremely durable and my pictures come out so cool!","I'm in love with my new camera. I now need to get a carrying case for it. I was hesitant because I've never used one before. It was the best! The price is absolutely amazing. It's way expensive if bought in stores. Get it here now!","Love it. Really clear pictures and great price for how much you can use it","Cute and very novel. The pic quality is less than the \"polaroids\" of old. They are about 3 inches tall but if you are looking for something that is a fun little gift, this would do it.","I loveee'","Everything was perfect!","So in love with it already! ?????? Just wish the eye hole was a litttttle bit bigger but oh well I still love it :)","Good item, lots of fun","cute and fun.","I bought this as a baby shower prize. But it was given at the end so I used it with the film to give every guest a chance at taking home a picture. It was a hit. Mini, maybe a little small but people vied for the prize at the end. It got its use, a winner was happy and guests had a take home momento. It was much cheaper than a picture booth!","A hit at every party! So much fun, and now my fridge is covered with great party photo's. Its light and small enough to take out as well.","Daughter loves it!","I love my new camera! It's so fun and the pics come out looking very vintage! Great for using in art journals and collages!","bought it for instant pictures and so far it has not disappointed me. learn how to take pictures in different lighting first. there are lots of Youtube videos on how to take best pictures. Buy the films in bundle from Amazon and you will save big on films.<br /><br />Happy shooting","I had to get a new one because my first one shot out film whenever I turned it on, but I love it and they take great pics.","perfect !","My family's over the moon when I purchase this camera ON MY OWN. They didn't know that I have enough gift card to buy it. My family love polaroid, but in Indonesia, this camera cost us arms and legs. We basically couldn't afford it. So yeah, I love it. The camera came out new, no problem at all, as I expected. Work perfectly well and trust me, I will not lie. So yeah, if you're planning to buy this camera, just buy it already. It's worth it.","Amazing cheap polaroid","Love it","Takes a few tries to get good shots. Still a fun little gadget to have. I highly recommend this","Love the pictures it takes although some are a bit blurry","Its awesome","It was a gift to my daughter. She loves it","Gahhh, this camera is so cute and small! I was given many compliments the first day it came (which was early today). The camera came a day before the estimated time arrival, so I'm so glad. I had bought a bundle which included the camera, a film pack (20 films), and a clear plastic case with an adjustable colorful strap. Film can be quite expensive; ranging from 11.59 to 12.48 just for a pack of 20 (also called the twin pack). You should be wise about taking a picture unless you have ALOT of film. I just purchased 2 more boxes of film which are coming in the first week of August.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very cute<br />-Small (the smaller, the better it is to carry around!)<br />-Can be used with lots of accessories; stickers, carriers, etc..)<br />-Quite simple to use!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-If you're not familiar with these types of cameras, you would probably need to go online and find directions/tips because the instructions that came with the camera weren't that clear<br />-A little fragile, so you have to be extra careful when using it<br /><br />So far, the camera was so worth the price! I hope you enjoy your new FujiFilm INSTAX mini camera! :)","Fast delivery and just what we wanted.","So happy I bought these cameras for my daughters their 5 & 6yrs old and its super easy for them to use! I love the picture quality and the size is perfect for a our little memories we share.  You have buy film separate but u can get good deal on AmaZon 40 pics for $26! So it's great deal for us . Everything works great , if I were you buy this camera you won't regret it !!!:-)","Fun gift for teens.","Great camera!  Takes great pictures . My daughter loves it .","Just what my granddaughter wanted!","My kids love it.","Doesnt take the best bright day shots even while on the correct setting. Better pics are taken at dawn, dusk, clowdy conditions, or at night in a lighted area. I still love it and the aestetic. But film is also wayyyy too expensive. But other than those small things, it was great!","Okay, but doesn't take good pictures at night.","Love it!!  Worked great!!  Wonderful memories!!","I've been eyeing this camera for the past year on another site (a popular clothing store) and when I found it on Amazon, I decided to buy it. The camera arrived within two days and it was exactly what I was expecting. Everything was in the box and in perfect condition. Beyond being happy with the shipping and the overall condition of the item, I just love it. The white Fujifilm Instax Camera is cool, adorable, and reminds me of the cameras we had as kids in the 80s. I haven't used a non-digital camera or smartphone camera (iPhone) in years, so it's fun to have a camera that (1) isn't digital and (2) prints out real, tangible photos instantly, which can then be displayed, placed inside an album, or shared. Added bonus is the white space where one can write info about the photo like who, what, when, and where, just like we used to on Polaroids or on the backs of photos. It's a great way to make memories and I love the style of these mini photos. I know these cameras are popular among young people, but I think they have a timeless quality that anyone can appreciate.","In love with this camera! So glad that I bought it. If you are debating on if you should buy it or not, I'd say to go ahead and do it! I couldn't be any happier with this purchase. It's cute, takes great pictures, and is the perfect size for on the go. Also, it conveniently comes with the batteries it needs so you don't need to worry about buying some before it arrives. I would recommend this product to anyone!!","Works perfectly and came on time ! Thank you !","I love the little camera, just what I expected but 1st day I got it the lens cover popped off. I put back on but is not fitting securely.","Great camera. Easy to use. Daughter loves it.","loved it!","The best","Takes decent pictures inside, not so good outside","Excellent camera for a photo booth. We used this at my husband's birthday party to let guests take pics as sort of a photo guest book. The photos came out well, and it made for a fun time as well as a nice keepsake.","love it! true to color. takes good pictures and fun to use.","Cute camera.  Really does the job.  I use the photos to make photo groupings.","Love this camara. Cheap and good.","Adorable and works very well. I like the auto flash and all the settings. It seems durable and everything is in working order (the lights, film countdown, flash, etc). I hope it lasts!","10/10 exactly what I expected takes clear and pretty pictures","Nice and cute","Fun and easy to use, great for fun potraits","Bought this for my teen daughter, she is loving it.","I love this camera! It takes some time getting used to how to properly use it, but I was surprised to see the quality of the pictures. I have taken more than 30 pictures so far, and with the exception of a couple of pictures, they turned out great. One thing I have noticed is that the light settings indicator above of the lens can be sensitive in times of clouds and high light. So make sure you have the dial turned on the right light before the picture.<br /><br />It's fun, fashionable, and very light to carry. I do recommend a purse/case to hold your camera and some extra film. The purse my girlfriend has been using for the camera is the \"CAIUL Instax Mini First Generation Zipper Universal Camera Case\", and it has more space to hold other belongings. One last recommendation is the wallet album  for the photos; unless you plan to have the pictures organized in some type of collage, the wallet album is a perfect way to store them.","I love this camera! It's cute, it's the perfect size(not too small/not too big). I love the color of the camera and the different settings on it. It shipped faster than I expected, (5 days). I recieved this as a gift and I fell in love with how adorable it was packed(I tried not to rip the wrapping paper but I accidentaly did XD)<br />Anyways, you guys should buy this camera, you won't regret it!","fun","It's really good and I love it","Like","It was aright","I had a Poloroid camera as a kid that I loved, so I decided to give this one a try. The pictures are slim and smaller than the old school instant cameras. The picture quality is heavily based on which light setting you select. The fickle lighting setting is truly the only downside the the camera, but after some practice I have gotten better at selecting the right setting.","Great product! One of my friends had this during a bachelorette party and it was a major hit! That weekend I went online and purchased this Polaroid camera! I have had it now for about a year and a half and still use it without any problems!! At first it took some figuring out as far as which setting to use to get the look of the picture I wanted but after playing around with it am very satisfied!!","I had always wanted a polaroid camera. The camera IS SO CUTE AND HANDY when you're traveling. I love how you can take pictures anywhere and it comes out right away. The cameras really cheap but the only bad thing is how the film cost so much. I recommend buying 100 packs of film so the films would be cheaper. But I STILL LOVE HOW THEY DEVELOPED THE PICTURES SO FAST","fun camera.  easy to use.  wish the film was less expensive.","We bought a couple for a party, we had a photo guest board rather than a book guests sign.  It takes a bit of time to get the photos lined up but within a couple shots we had it down.  When outdoors during daytime don't use flash as they may look overexposed and you'll waste film.  The power button is not obvious but overall we were very pleased with these and they were very convenient.  The film, size is small so not like the old 70's polaroid's but yet small enough to put in your wallet if you wanted.","LOVE this camera!  I grew up in the 80's and 90's and used a few different versions of the Polaroid camera -- which were such a phenomenon in the days when you couldn't see the photos you took before getting a roll of film developed.  The instant photo hasn't lost its thrill, even though digital cameras are now the norm.  Love this for taking fun, spontaneous photos and still getting to be surprised at what develops!","Perfect camera for the perfect moments. I recommend to take pictures during the daytime when the lighting is great, dark pictures still come out but not as great as day light ones.","Awesome camera. My son loves it. It works just like the old Polaroid cameras from when I was a kid, but the pictures are about half the size.","The camera itself is very cute, about photo quality i been able to take very nice photos when the day light is good but the sun is not very strong, even though it has the filters and flash i wont recommend using it when is too dark or at night because it only captures the nearest and lighters objects, other than that we need to remember is a instant photo so the resolution is not perfect but you can get very nice pictures.","I love this product!","Super cute camera! I get a ton of compliments! I adore the color of this camera","I bought this camera for my daughter's birthday for her and her friends to take pictures in a \"photo booth\" with props. It was a HUGE hit! Using the camera is beyond easy, and her friends could take their pics home. Definitely recommend!","Fun camera to use and works great! I wouldn't buy this camera for any serious photos but it is perfect for taking photos with family and friends.","I love this so much!","Nice product for the price.  Pretty and simple...good design.","The camera was a hit at my kids birthday party.","The kids love this at camp.","I love this camera! There's something very nostalgic about using a \"instant\" camera and the bright yellow color is so cheerful!","I'm absolutely in love with this camera it meets all of my expectations I actually got this camera on the 21 of July and its stunning takes great vintage looking photos perfect for all occasions its a great price my total was nothing to what retail is  and I got the camera the case and two packs of film so it's so worth it","Loved it was amazing to plenty of pictures with it going to need more film but definitely really good product to use my friend loves her camera best product ever have to say.","My daughter loves this.  Hard to believe the insta-matic is coming back. In the age of digital, the excitement of taking a picture as an instant tangible memory is contagious.","Great Camera ~ love it to pieces","my son loves it","Totally worth the money! Pictures come out clear. Although the film is the most expensive in the long run it still is worth the money!","granddaughter loves it","awesome old school but new school Polaroid camera best buy also comes in different colors","Bien cool","The camera came defect where the exposer light isn't changing to a different setting. Everything else is perfect though!","Got this for my 26 year old daughter. She liked it but it isn't really practical. She had some fun with it but got bored with it. I bought one for my 15 year old also and the same thing...fun for a while but bored with it fast.","Film not included","Absolutely LOVE this camera","Thanks!","this is rarely out of my daughter's hands...a great buy.","Big hit at my daughter's first birthday party! So much fun!","LOVE this camera! It takes a little getting used to the different settings, especially in the sun! This is my favorite new toy!","It came in very quick in two days of me ordering it looks perfect","great for kids","I bought this for a friend's 18th birthday to surprise her (along with packets of film) and she LOVED it. It's perfect for summer break - to capture memories with friends - and can become a really cute DIY wall decoration too. Definitely purchase this for a teen's gift if you don't know what to get them. High quality too.","Best thing I have investided in, you're pictures come out Instantly instead of having to go somewhere and pay to take them out of a different camera","I purchased this camera for my 14 year old. My daughter and her friends love it! I admit I want one too!","Real cool for those of us who had the original in the 80s.","The pictures are smaller than I imagined, and the film is expensive at my local store, but it's great and I love it.","This was a birthday gift for my 10 year old granddaughter and she absolutely LOVED it!  Her little face lit up like a Christmas tree when we gave this to her! It was exactly what she was hoping for!! Great little camera for kids - young & old","Love it!!! I was so excited to get it! It came in way faster than it was supposed to, but I'm not complaining!  I love how the pictures come out. They look like the old polaroids. Worth my money and its cheaper here than it is in store","Granddaughter loved it","I adore this camera! It's so much fun and very easy to use, as long as you read the directions and properly understand how to use the automatic light sensor. I got it expecting to take basic pictures with it- nothing fancy, and it has exceeded expectations. My 4 year old can use it with no issue, and I love that I can teach her basic photography skills with it. The pink color is super adorable too.","Love it!!","I love love love this camera.. Always a hit no matter where I am people love getting little photos as a gift=)","Very cute fast shipping","I gave it to my cousin for her birthday and she absolutely loved it!","Make my wife really happy and the vacation was much more fun with the memories!","NA","All is well and I'm so glad my camera is finally here. I'm going to have so much fun with it.it also came super fast!","REcommend 100%","So easy to use! And impressive not only with speed of capture but clear crisp quality of photos! Our tween loves it!","I received this as a present last Christmas. It's a cute Polaroid camera. It's a little bulky so beware.","was a gift but she loves it! Love the instax series.","Love using this camera. My husband and I used it at our wedding (the guests had their photo taken and then placed it in the guestbook along with their message/signature) and several times since then (honeymoon, graduations). It's always a popular hit.","obsessed. completely suggest getting one of these","Oh you hipsters and trying to bring the polaroid back to popularity. I actual like it. Finally something that is cool but not pretentious. The camera works great and the build quality is good. It was easy to use and a huge hit at the party.","I just love this so much!","The camera worked so well for the dyi photo booth at my sister's wedding. The guests loved the camera, and the pictures looked great.","One of the gifts for a granddaughter's graduation.  She really loves it.  Some of her friends already has it so she knew exactly how  it works.  Also picked up some film packs to get her started immediately.  It's kind of a fad throwback thing in her girl group.  Easy to use.  She is 13 and was taking snaps in 5 minutes.","Perfect","I bought this camera for my grandaughter.  She loves it and has recommended it to all her friends.  I would highly recommend purchasing this camera.  It was a great price and fast shipping.","I purchased for my 12 year old niece who requested it for her birthday.  She loves it, so I guess that makes it perfect!","We gave this to our granddaughter as a birthday present to use in camp.  Seems like so many of the kids have one.  The prints are credit card size and good enough for use a fun camera.  Don't expect crystal clear prints -- that's not what this is about. Keep in mind that the film is not inexpensive but neither was Polaroid film.","Was a birthday present for my 14 year old niece. She loves it, but goes through film like crazy","Takes awesome pictures! Easy to load film, easy to use. I am in love with this camera! Cheaper to buy here than in the store! Amazing shipping! Got here 2 days earlier than expected :)","This has been fun for my daughter to use. Cute!","I absolutely love my new Hello Kitty instax camera !!! I got it in time for my birthday tea party and it was super beautiful !! I was a little bit concerned about the size, but trust me, when you receive it, you stop thinking about it because it was so adorable !!! I received so many compliments on it, I know you will love it !!!","Got it yesterday! I had a polaroid before but when the film was gone it was too expensive to get more, I'm very glad i decided to get this, it's perfect for art journaling!","Very cute present and looks great. It's a different shape from the regular instax cameras.","My family's over the moon when I purchase this camera ON MY OWN. They didn't know that I have enough gift card to buy it. My family love polaroid, but in Indonesia, this camera cost us arms and legs. We basically couldn't afford it. So yeah, I love it. The camera came out new, no problem at all, as I expected. Work perfectly well and trust me, I will not lie. So yeah, if you're planning to buy this camera, just buy it already. It's worth it.","I adore this little camera. I took it to the zoo today and got some amazing, offbeat photos of animals. I'd call the photos I take with this 'perfectly imperfect'. No smartphone crystal clear snaps are these. They come with darkness, light particles, dust, lens flares, and amazing, vintage-looking results. It took a bit to get used to how this camera works- definitely use it on close subjects, make sure there's decent light, and be sure to photograph subjects with some contrast/vivid color/strong silhouettes so you'll get better results. The camera itself is adorable, lightweight, and feels sturdy. It's very simple to use but doesn't feel like a toy. I got so many compliments on it and I sense so many cool pics to come.","I was more than satisfied with this camera!! The color is super cute and high quality the pictures come out super duper cute! I also bought the matching case!! Love love love!!","I received this camera as a gift for my birthday, and I absolutely love it. The authentic feel of physical photos within seconds is very fun and nostalgic. The film and other accessories don't burn a hole in my pocket either! I may even order more colors. Love!!","Good - just what I wanted!","Fun camera works great","Totally obsessed with my Instax camera! I use the Mini because I use the photos in my Midori Traveler's Notebook and these are perfectly sized! I also like that the camera auto-detects what lighting I need. The film is really easy to install as well, just open from the seal and pop it in-- make sure the yellow little marker is faced upwards!","This was her favorite gift for her birthday. She loves having pictures to show instead of just on her phone.","Classy way to revisit nostalgia! I love this camera!","Absolutely beautiful!!!","Nice camera.  The kids enjoy taking their own pictures.  Of course I gave them the speech about not wasting the film and they have been great with it.  Takes nice pictures.  They are kind of small but perfect for the scrapbooks they are making.  Highly recommend.","Love it! Thank you!","I love this camera. I didn't realize it was wallet size.. my fault. The pictures don't come out that great in bright sunlight settings.","So I'm completely in love with my camera. The pictures are so cute and it works great for little gifts at parties and stuff. The only downside though is that I've had this camera for 2 years now and I don't know why but the red light on the back that is supposed to go away and the orange one in the front is supposed to turn on so you know it's ready to take the picture? Yeah...it stopped working. So now every time I want to take a picture I have to constantly open and close the lens until the red light finally leaves. This is very heartbreaking for me because you know when you want a picture and that moment is kinda you know very special? Well this defect ruins that moment. Hopefully I can send it to the company in FL to get it fixed :(","I bought this Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 for my 12 year old granddaughter! She absolutely loves it and hasn't put it down since she got it 4 days ago!<br />This camera reminds me of the 'Polaroid' camera days when you couldn't wait to see the photo develop! This is the same premise but this camera is so much smaller than it's former counterpart! It fits in my granddaughters hands perfectly, it has an automatic exposure measurement feature that  signals the camera to the recommended aperture setting so the user can manually adjust the dial to the recommended setting so your photos come out perfect!<br />This camera seems pretty durable, is easy for her to use and it takes small, but nice photos. We both love this camera and would recommend it to others.","Perfect","It's is not a pink as it looks online and on the box. It's a more faded pink. If the flash is broken all of your photos will turn out black. My flash was broken and I had to return it. The pictures it takes are smaller than the size of your palm. I wish the photos were bigger. I ended up purchasing a new one from Michaels because I needed it before I could get the return processed. It takes decent photos, when the flash works, and it is a lot of fun to have.","Cutest thing ever! Works great. I love it. Comes with wrist strap and instructions","My teen loved this gift! A nice little flash back to old school Polaroid.","I liked the camera, I think it's a little big but works great","pros: easy to use, simple film loading, pictures (when working) look great and old timey. attached photo to show quality<br /><br />cons: from what i can tell so far, seems to be an issue with both the camera and film, as ive tried multiple different film packs and less than 50% develop..majority come out just black.","ITS REALLY CUTE. Bought this because I'm going to Otakcon in August. It's a lot bigger than I expected but that's cool.","Did not buy from this seller but this seller has what appears to be the best price on this camera for the consumers. It works great and takes wonderful pictures. Not many issues other than problems with ejecting film and flash.<br /><br />Any problems with how film shows picture does not correlate with how camera works and reviews about film should be left on film products.","I bought this for my wife, it's cute novelty item. The films can get expensive. It's basically prints out a smaller cuter version of the old school polaroids. My wife likes it and that's all that matters","I'm obsessed with it. Absolutely obsessed. Perfect size to take places!","It's amazing and  it came faster than expected to arrive I love it ??","My daughter loves it","Pictures are small but otherwise good","I love this camera. Every time I take it out to snap photos I receive lots of compliments. I love the vintage look of the photos it produces. The varying flash settings are also pretty awesome. It takes a little practice in order to produce a photo with a centered subject, but once you master it you'll be good to go.","Nice","Such a cute camera and a great product for the price! Just make sure to buy film with it because I made the mistake of not doing so and now I have to go pick some up ","I didn't take any photo, but it's beautifull..","It came in good condition, it's been 8 months and it still works :) I'm very happy I bought this camera. My biggest fear was having to find the film but it's a great little camera :)","Perfect better then I expected loving it","I can't stop saying how much I love this camera. I've always loved photography as I went to an art school but I was getting bored by digital photography. A friend of mine bought this one and as soon as I saw it, I knew I had to buy it too. The film is expensive (50 cent per film average) but totally worth it. I love this camera and the pictures it takes.  it's a easy and fun way to be remember by someone: Just take a picture of them (or with them) and writes a little note on the white blank space. The size of the pictures is awesome too (as big as a credit card) and it fits perfectly on a wallet. Best camera ever!!","Instant fun, great for parties.","Pros: Easy to operate, good quality photos, durable<br /><br />Cons: Hard to reload film, loud picture taking","useful","Good quality , sturty design. It has even held up to a couple accidental drops. Does best with close up photos.  My only complaint is that the film is pricey.","Made a great graduation present! My niece absolutely loved it and started using it almost right away.  Was so much fun watching her use it.","Purchased this for my daughter who loves it. This is a throw back to the 80's to me before we had smart phones everywhere. My wife wants one for her class as school teacher. Its fun to have.","Amazing camera for creating kids album, u will save time.","Love this camera. Works great.","Got this for my daughter for her 16th birthday (she wanted it) and she LOVES IT....as do I. The price is better than anywhere I've found and it takes super cute little instant pictures. Very happy customers","Love everything about this product","Pink is so beautiful!!!!","I have no other words for this more than \"I freeking loooove this cameraa\". It's so beautiful, and takes great shots with great quality at a great price. It reminds me of old polaroids shots.","I love my little would be \"Polaroid\".<br />I use this whenever i want to capture memories. Most recently, i used it at my sister's baby shower; i took a lot of great shots!","Perfect girly picture","My daughter loves it. The film is a little pricey but it is better in the bulk packs. There have been no problems with it. We bought it 6 months ago. I wanted to wait to review it untille we had it for awhile. Its been great with 6 months of hard use.","I really like it. Simple to use and sturdy camera body, most of all, picture quality is much better than I expected.","Guys ITS WORTH THE MONEY! The camera is so pretty but the quality is amazing. It comes with batteries and a strap. It's super easy and cute i honestly love it, if your looking for something cute with a little bit of a vintage style this is perfect. I got the blue one and it's amazing","Got here so fast! Really amazing quality?. Also comes with batteries!","Great for taking quick snap shots to share with friends.","This camera worked great and was a lot of fun to use for the first year and a half that I owned it. Since then, however, I've been unable to get it to power on. I've bought multiple packs of batteries and tried different brands, but have not been able to use the camera for about 6 months now. It is of course now out of warranty. I wish I had known that the Instax Mini has such a short lifespan, because I've got a box of the pricey film now that I can't use.","Saw this at a birthday  party, it's very user friendly. Bought one for my very young niece who's enjoying taking instant pictures. Especially  on her Disney vacation. The accessories  are adorable. The film has cute edges, there are albums, cases, I'm thrilled with it.","I love this toy-like camera! Color is cute and easy to carry.","Fun little camera. The flash is a bit bright so I put masking tape over part of it. We used it to make \"put passes\" for pur Cub Scout Pinewood Derby.","I think this camera is great! It's a great way to keep memories. I saw some bad reviews, which I don't know why because it works perfectly for me. Just make sure the camera is in the right light setting or it won't turn out great! You just gotta know how to use it.","I got the light blue camera , at first I was disappointed because I thought it was broken. It was just me not reading instructions . I highly recommend reading the instructions before use , get used to the light settings , and have fun ! I love mine . Once you get used to the light settings you will take beautiful pictures .","I use this camera every chance I get and it hasn't disappointed. It's fun and turns out great pictures. The only thing I recommend is that the photographer get closer to the subject. The viewing lens tends to make things appear closer than they are and when the picture is taken, things are farther away. I would highly recommend this product. I get compliments and everyone loves it when I use it. It just seems so curious to everyone.","Love it","We gave this camera to my wife (then girlfriend) and it has been one of the best gifts she has ever received. This camera is fun, spontaneous, and has led to a lot of fun trip ideas and activities.<br /><br />The FujiFilm Instax Mini 8 is small and durable. We chose the color blue because it is her favorite color, and it has retained the same flashy appearance despite heavy use. It is easy to grip, and with the included strap, is lightweight and can be brought along on any trip. The camera is so simple that a child can use it. It takes good photos, no matter the environment, although I do recommend using it in lighter areas. We have pictures inside of auditoriums, in our apartment, outside at the park, in front of landmarks, and the list goes on. Best of all, we can keep the photos and show them to our children. In an ever-evolving digital world, it's nice to have a more traditional camera experience. We have constructed multiple craft decorations using the film from this camera.<br /><br />I regret not having one of these cameras during my proselyting mission in the Philippines. It would have been a truly rewarding experience to have this camera with me and instantly give photos to those I served or those whose lives have impacted mine.<br /><br />Buying film for this camera can be a little pricy. We normally spend around $20 every few months on film. It has been money well-spent though. Kids love this camera! We bring it whenever we babysit and give the children pictures so that they can see themselves and have a good laugh.<br /><br />I recommend this camera for anyone looking for a more traditional photo experience. It is a great gift for children, teenagers, and in our case, even adults. It makes taking photos much more enjoyable and adds an entirely new dimension to personalization. Now you can take your memories with you everywhere you go in small, light pieces of film.","This camera was a hit at my mothers birthday party! Everyone was asking where i got it from!","Cute but only for indoor uses.  Overexposed in bright outdoor areas.","Super cool and exactly what I expected it to be. Now, I can pretend to be relevant on the internet.","I love my new Fujifilm camera so much!! But I have one concern.  When I look through the little window, before taking a picture, I make sure that I have, what I want to be centered, in the little black circle.  But, when the film prints out, the picture is not centered at all.  When I took a picture of a small dragonfly and printed the film out, the dragonfly wasn't even in the picture.  Any suggestions?","It is great.  I love it","Great Purchase, Fast Service","I like the cute little pictures but I miss the old polaroids better. The photos it prints are tiny and there's only 10 photos per pack of film. Not a real money saver considering how pricey each roll of film costs.","My daughter absolutely loves this little camera. The pictures are pretty good quality and the camera itself is pretty sturdy and well made.","con: the film is expensive","I purchase this camera for my wedding to do my own photo booth booth idea. It has work great i have used it before the date, just to get a familiarized my self with it. The pictures are the size of a business card with white borders. I like the quality overall i think i would continue to use it long after the reception. I really like that you have to think out the photo, before you just aim and shoot at anything like the old days, and you instantly get a print of it, great for sharing or like in my case, I chose the color white it looks very chick, The only think i wish the fils were a bit cheaper.","It's the real deal. Everything was perfect. Nothing came broken or beat up.","It doesn't really take good photos.","Bought as a gift for my daughter.  My daughter loves it.  Product was exactly as advertised.","Bought for my daughter's 8th birthday and she's in love with it!","Love the product exactly as explained!  Got it in 2 day very good shipping","You can not take a photo outside when there is sun.  Overexposed.  OK for indoors.","Beautiful camera! The color is slightly more pastel than the photo, but it is lovely. It came with batteries and a user manual for instructional use.","Love this camera. It's really fun and great for trips. The picture quality is a little bit unreliable at times but otherwise great! Love the yellow color. It's a soft pastel color.","great","I received this as a gift (pink with case) and I absolutely love it! It's so cute and the pictures come out nice. It's easy to set up, as well as use. The bag it came with is also the perfect fit for the little camera. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves taking pictures :)","Super","Love this camera .. So much fun and photos come out awesome","I bought this for my 9 yr old as an early birthday gift. So that she could take pictures on our vacation. She loves it. I the pink bag and it has left her shoulders all day. She's sitting on the couch cluching her new camera.<br /><br />Wish the film cartridge would hold more then 10 films. But hey she doesnt seem to mind.<br />Wish i wouldve see this a few days sooner. Wouldve ordered the hello kitty version instead of the white one from amazon now. O well. Maybe I'll do that when we come back from vaca.","This was a present for the grand daughter and she loved it.","I purchased this for my daughter for her upcoming birthday.  I also purchased a accessory bundle and film so that she had everything for her little photography start.  I love the color of this camera, it's her favorite color.  It's easy to use and fun for instant photos.  She is going to love it!","Got it for someone as a gift and they loved it. Highly recommended.","Fun camera for my 5 year old. User friendly","love it! hit at parties!","This camera was perfect to document \"Cigi Camp\" with my granddaughters!  On the last day they were able to make a scrap book with the pictures they took!  I love this camera!!!<br /><br />The film is hard to find in stores at home but I was able to find them here on Amazon! :)","great camera, very cute and easy to use. it is slimmer than the mini7 but I find that it is actually harder to hold because they took the large rounded grip off of the body in order to slim it down. Still I haven't dropped it, I just feel less confident holding it (because I'm not always graceful) but it does come with a wrist strap so if you did drop it, it will just dangle from your wrist. because its an instant camera with flash it is prone to over exposed photos so just be aware of lighting before deciding to take a photo. That being said it takes better pictures in the daytime than in the nighttime even with the exposure and flash. still very happy with it!  it is less expensive, cuter, and easier to carry than the instax wide. the photos are a little smaller than an old school polaroid but till big enough.","So pretty and I works really well! Super cute","My teenager daughter loves it! Quality is good.","I love this camera. It is so much fun to have an instant print when spending time with family or friends. The color is a little bit on the pink size than on the red which is a bummer because I love red but other than that I love it!","I bought this for my 14 year old granddaughter's birthday.  She loves it!!!!","Its a really great camera.","Thank you","It's dope","i freaking love this already. just buy it. do it.","Love it!","SO CUTE AND EASY TO USE!","Bought this for my girlfriend as a Christmas present. Loved it, we use it all the time. Great quality.","I LOVE my instax. It is super cute and fun. I take photos of my kids all the time, using it to capture little moments that I don't care to share with the world on social media. I love the reddish/pink color, and it has been lots of fun figuring it out. It has various settings, which I really need to learn because the one photo I took in noon sunshine was completely washed out and showed nothing. It's a fun camera, though, and I am loving it.","I can not rave about how much I enjoy shooting with this camera. I am in school getting a bachelors in photography and this camera comes everywhere with me. I love using it with friends so at the end of the night we all have a physical photo we can hang on to. I can't say enough about how much I love this camera. Just make sure you use your settings correctly and you will get some nice shots!","Bought for my 13 year old daughters birthday and she loved it!","I've been wanting one of these for a long time and I finally got it! It's amazing, great pictures, camera is small and light, color (grape) is super cute. It came in perfect conditions also, I got 0 complains on this product. 5 ?well earned!","Great item","Love the vintage feel to this camera. Used it on 4th of July and although the fireworks I captured didn't turn out so great, the people I captured did. The key is to use it within the range of the flash during night time pictures. The cost to replace the film can get somewhat expensive, but I think I'll keep this for special occasions.","My friend got one of these and we all loved it so much that 5 of us also got it! Something so magical about Polaroid cameras. Takes surprisingly nice pictures. The only problem I had was taking pictures in the bright sun- there are light settings but if it is too bright or you are taking a picture with the sun in the back it won't turn out. You get a knack for it<br />Buying film in bulk is absolutely the way to go. The smaller the quantities- the more you pay. That being said, the film for this camera is cheaper than any other I could find. It comes in a bunch of cool colors and you can find accessories like cases, fancy film, photobooks etc to fit too!","Great camera! Simple and easy to use. No instructions needed really. Comes with 2 AA batteries and a wrist strap.","Great camera at a great price! Thanks so much","Am so in love with this camera the color and everything it is the best thing I ever gotten","I thought this was a great camera, ive had it for 3  months+ and still have not had any kind of issues with it. It is fun to use and captures great memories","Purchased this camera for my grand daughter, she loves it!!","This makes making memories special, and it instantly prints which makes it awesome!","Cool camera!","It was a gift for my daughter!!  She loves it and enjoys making her photo collages!!  Great price and shipped quickly!!","Good camera","My favorite accessory to every party!","Works great and is a lot of fun to have!","So cute! Works perfectly fine","Good product would buy again.","My girl loves it!","We used this for a DIY wedding photobooth and it was perfect. So much fun, good pictures too!","Its great!!!!!","just as expacted","Love this product!!!!","Very nice product","Definitely the best thing I've bought in awhile. This camera is not only super easy to use, but the greatest thing to take along when you go on vacations or are just hanging out with friends! Everyone is always so fascinated by it and its great to capture fun memories with. It came just as pictured, and with all the instructions you need. I'd recommend checking out some Youtube tutorials on how to use the camera just in case! But it's super simple to use and to put film in.","It's great for fun!... DOESN'T WORK OUTSIDE.","It's so convinient, it's small and so pretty'', I really liked it! it came in 2 days and is pretty self explanatory, if you're like me you'll read all the reviews before buying it, don't bother I'm telling you right now, it's amazing!","Nice","I love this camera. It came quick, packaged well and works great... Easy to use like back in the day Polaroids","I love the product and the way you came in the package was great, it was bubblewraped and it was just perfection! Would definitely buy again!","I got this for my 7 years old girl and she is in love with this camera. She is able to carry it easily anywhere, she can use it without any problem and is fascinated with her pictures. Great gift for any photo lover.","First time user and loved it ! great way to capture the moments","Great for events and vacation mementos.","Cute, Fun to use","Easy to operate and load film, provides great pictures within minutes. It took us some time to figure out lighting but this thing snapped 40 photos in one night and got passed around so everyone could use it. Make sure you're holding it correctly!","It works fine and the 3 pack film was a good deaI really like the camera but I think I would like wider pictures so I'm giving this to my daughter for Christmas. It seems to be really popular with the young people.","It is sooooo cute! It takes surprisingly good photos and I have no complains so far. Buying the film in bulk definitely saves a lot of money and also buying the case is very useful.","First all I love love my fujifilm instead mini 8. It let you have your picture right then and there. It give your photo a vintage look. Since the pix comes out small it makes great for putting pix in lockers, desk, wallets. They come in amazing colors. I love the clearness of the lens. Its great for kids to use and a fun way to make memories!","It was amazing.  Didn't know my granddaughters knew how to work the camera.","Awesome little camera. A note for when buying this, you need to remember that you have to buy film and it's almost like each picture you take is one dollar.<br />But you get an instant and cute keepsake.","amazing","Nothing","It works wonders and is super cute","Awesome camera!! We love it soooo much!","I love this camera","Works Great, fun to use, and batteries last","Fun little point and shoot camera. However, you do have to play around with the lighting as the pictures can easily was out.","Basically an updated old school Polaroid camera! Love the small size. You can keep pictures easily in your wallet.","I got it for my cousin's birthday! And she LOVED it!","I bought this for my daughter as an 8th grade graduation gift. She loves it!! She takes it everywhere!","Came in the mail on the first day of possible expectancy. Product was just as advertised. Cute and portable, perfect for every moment that a snapchat picture just isn't enough.","Amazing camera get it if you want nostalgic moments of times past.","This is a gift for my 7 y/o daughter. The idea of physical photos being printed directly from the camera is completely novel. She loves it. Big hit with the friends too. It's pretty cool to see all of her photography stringed around her bedroom.","I luv it 10/10","We are using this camera as a part of our guestbook, and so far we have taken a few trials before wedding day, and it is just perfect! Easy to learn to use. We will be taking this on our honeymoon too to get some unique vintage snaps!","This was a gift for my bffs bday. She loves it!!!  I can't wait to take pics together!!","Love love love this little camera! It's small and easy to fit in a purse or bag. It's also super easy to use and the pictures turn out great! Plus they come in so many great colors, I had a hard time choosing. Love the quality of this product as it's super durable. I've dropped it once already and while it needed a little tweaking, it still works! It also withstood the sun, wind, and sand of a day on the beach.","I love it","Every time I take this out with me people love it and have so much fun getting real momentos. The photo cartridges are expensive though","I wasn't aware that Polaroids had made a comeback but apparently they have!  This is what my 17 year old asked for her 11th grade graduation.  She loves it and won't stop snapping pics!  It is very \"plasticy\" and I'm probably going to order the case for it because I'm afraid if she drops it, it may smash into a hundred pieces.  I'd say just order the film and the case while you're at it!  She's delighted with it!","Simple, light weight, very easy to use. I bring this camera to parties and family gatherings - people love using it! The pictures are quite a bit smaller than that of a Polaroid 600 camera but the images are sharp and they develop much more quickly. Super cute - I would definitely recommend it.","I love this polaroid!! It takes decent quality pictures and color comes as pictured. It's easy to use and small enough to carry around in my purse. The only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to get the lighting just right and unfortunately a couple photos taken outdoors were washed out. However, I just purchased this two weeks ago so I'm still playing around with the settings. This polaroid is perfect for different events such as grad parties, weddings, etc. or just for daily use! I took it on vacation with me and got some cute photos that I'm excited to hang up.","great quality images","This camera is great for the price! Cool function that lets it detect the proper light setting, but not always accurate. Still a great little camera. Recommend this for trips; they create great photos for scrapbooks!","Love this camera one of my best investments","Perfect!","This is just an overall good time. Wanna be the life of the party? Event? Just like instant gratification?? This camera gives it.","I bought this for my wife and she completely loves it and so do I. It's great!","Very fast shipping great product","very vintage, very fun","This camera is a great addition to any event in your life. It is small, light weight, user friendly, and makes great prints. I've brought it everywhere with me and people always love the adorable prints it makes. After searching around for this camera, this for sure the best price you can get it for.","A birthday gift for my 9 year old daughter, she loves it but I noticed mamy of the photos are overexposed.","This is a really fun camera!! The pictures are the perfect size for attaching to my planner, keeping in my wallet, or sticking on the fridge. I like being able to write a caption on the bottom of each picture, too.  The camera itself is easy to use and compact enough to fit in my purse.","This camera is so cute I love the size and the color! I've been using this camera to document my summer and so far it has taken beautiful photos if you're into polaroids. The camera is easy to maneuver and I love how you can change the light settings based on where you are taking the photo. Simple but great camera!","I got the for my daughter for Christmas. She really enjoys being able to print her pictures out. The pictures are good quality. Both the indoor and outdoor pictures come out very well.","Obsessed! It's amazing and the best price I have found!","This is the best!!. Clear photos, great fun. LOVE the PINK!!  Ordered the case and album too. Ready for capturing a fun<br />filled summer!!","I bought this for my sister for her graduation. She absoutely loves it. Its super easy to use and the pictures look fantastic. Its the perfect gift for someone going to college.","Bought it as a present for a friend. She loves it","fun and easy to use nice quality pictures as well","Works really well.","Best gift ever to myself. No problems at all after 6 months of usage. Will buy for gifting purposes.","Great product! Love it and still use it all the time","Great instant film camera. Amazon has these at the lowest prices (I shopped around). Overall, the product has performed well - just be sure to have it on the right setting when you are outside or else your pictures will come out too dark!","Gave as a gift.  My daugeter loved it.  great choices of color and this reminded me of years ago when we use to take instant pictures with our camera.  Brought back memories and now my daughter is creating her own.","Love this camera. Super cute and affordable. Taking good pics can be tricky but all you need is a little practice and a lot of films. Took me about 3 packs of film to get the hang of it and get clear pics.","Thanks so much! Cute, tiny, but well worth it!","I had a defective camera from Michaels, returned it and saw this one on amazon for a couple dollars cheaper. This one was not defective and works great! The black is nice however if you have any oil on your face or hands there will be marks on the camera.","Does this camera come with the film","Really cute & portable","cool camera","I absolutely love this camera! The only thing is that it only can hold 10 shots at a time. Other than that it is awesome!","Loved how the photos came out.","This was a gift for my grand daughter and she absolutely LOVED IT.  She had so many people asking about it, that she told me she felt so SPECIAL.  Highly recommend it !!!","Love the color!!","I love this camera so much, great price too","So much fun for parties! Very easy to use. Just have to play with it to figure out the best settings and lighting.","Absolutely love this camera! Works well.","So cute and easy to use. The size makes it easier to transport.","good","Got it for my daughter for a grad gift.  She loves it!","Good price.  Arrived quickly.  Great little camera.","My children love this camera! Makes them feel like they have a vintage camera","I absolutely love this.  It is just a small polaroid camera from a time ago.  The pictures are small, like 2\" by 3\" or so.  You set what environment, (such as outside sunny, outside cloudy, inside) on the camera to help ensure a good picture each time.  The only setback I have is the film is not cheap.  The cheapest I could find was a 10 picture pack of film for $12.97.","This camera came in super fast and the color is perfect! I highly recommend this product:)","LOVE IT! works great","Absolutely love it! Super light in weight, adjustable settings for \"indoor\" \"outdoor\"...etc. It came with 2 AA batteries and a wrist cord. Fits inside the clear case I bought for it. Pictures come out great!","I love this camera so much! I've wanted one for a long time and it does not disappoint. It's definitely worth the money","Okay I absolutely love my new Polaroid camera! It's so cute/small and takes pretty good quality pics. Definitely would recommend this product.","I intially purchased this for a music festival but I have used it way more than I thought I would. It's easy to put in a purse or backpack for vacations or day trips. I love the light pink color and how easy it is to work the camera. I like that there are different settings around the camera lense. This makes it easy to get the best picture possible in any environment you are in. I've had no problems with pictures not turning out. Overall I'm very happy with the camera.","I love it when this thing works.  Very hip and the pictures turn out very 70's.  Unfortunately, even when changing the settings appropriately, the lighting is very sensitive and we have been unable to get a decent picture in anything but broad daylight.  Sometimes it's too bright and the picture turns out nearly white, sometimes it's too dark and the picture turns out nearly black.  I still think this camera was worth the investments even with the light difficulties because the pictures that HAVE turned out are splendid and we love them.  They look really great hanging from a string with mini clothes clips.","Got this camera and have hardly used it primarily because the picture quality is very average and the film is ridiculously expensive.  If you're looking for something that takes average photos with muted colors  (not super clear and bright like your phone or digital camera) this is for you.  I think the photos in the ads must have been digitally altered because mine certainly look nothing like those.  This is definitely more of a gimmick than anything else.  Fun to have fairly immediate photos in your hand but it would be nice if they were of a quality that is something to write home about.","Great camera and cool color. One of the best birthday presents I ever got for my daughter!","Good","This a very cute and awesome to use and it's very easy to use overall great camera","In love with this camera! So glad that I bought it. If you are debating on if you should buy it or not, I'd say to go ahead and do it! I couldn't be any happier with this purchase. It's cute, takes great pictures, and is the perfect size for on the go. Also, it conveniently comes with the batteries it needs so you don't need to worry about buying some before it arrives. I would recommend this product to anyone!!","Came just as expected! I adore this color and look forward to using it :)","Love it. Great Sellers. Item arrived exactly as promised, all the items were in the box (as they were meant to come).  My niece was thrilled! Couldn't have pictured a happier kid. ---Thank you.  5 Stars","I got this for my daughter's 10th birthday and it was a huge hit!  She LOVES it and so do both kids and adults that see it.  Super easy and fun to use!","Got this as a birthday gift, friend loved it. Great pictures and easy to use.","ABSOLUTLEY LOVE MY NEW INSTANT CAMERA.","I haven't had any problems with it so far. I do need to learn how to use the settings, so far I've made a few mistakes but thats on my side for not reading the instructions. It has been a challenge learning how to take pictures (specialy selfies) with it because of where the button is and how I was used to my phone and compact camera.","Works well. Pictures are mediocre quality. Nice feel of old style Polaroid pictures. Don't shoot anything at a distance as pictures come out white.<br />Had to learn it the hard way  But I blame myself as it does says the distance.","This is a great, fun camera.  I used it for a birthday party and used the 64 page book (sold separately) for the pictures I took.  I gave the filled book to the birthday girl at the end of the party.  She loved it.....  Also, some guests requested to keep their picture because they liked them so much.  Fortunately, I bought enough film to accommodate some requests......  Highly recommend this camera.","Color was more of an orange/red.","Wonderful little camera. The pictures are very small but the quality is great!","Great Product,,,,Small And Fun For Everyone","Was a gift that is continuing to make the recipient happy!","Exactly as the description says!!! Perfect! Couldn't ask for better","Beautiful! Love the vintage look of the pics","Fun for grandkids","Bought this for my daughters 8th birthday cause she's always wanting to use mine. She loves it and we got the matching case as well","This is honestly the cutest best camera ever. So great for parties and what not. I love it and so does everyone else","Cute, awesome camera!","Super cute I use it all the time !","Kid loved it but only evry third photo developed","It's fun, it's cute, one of the better impulse buys you'll make. Let's be real, the photo is pretty damn small but lends itself nicely to portraits. It's a novelty but in the best sort of way. It's a party pleaser. You will have fun. Buy it.","I bought these for my tween-aged granddaughters.  They LOVE them.  I bought extra film and the completing accessories, too, and they were a hit!  Now, these are not going to be high resolution pro pics.  Just the really fun instant photos we enjoyed back in the day.","works great, everybody loves to see you bust it out. awesome!","It received what I was looking for! I needed something to give pictures to the children down in Mexico for a keepsake, so this is great!","It's ok. I'm not very excited at the quality of the pictures that this camera takes. They are drab and sometimes too dark. I don't expect an instant photo to be photographer quality,  but I also didn't expect them to be this poor. I wouldn't buy again.  I wish I bought the full size instant camera.","gift","Best camera ever! I had originally paid 80 dollars for this in the store so this is a much better buy.","I love this. I took it to a wedding and everyone was enjoying it and asking to have their picture taken! SO much fun! And take cute pictures. I can't wait to take this on vacation with me! Everyone needs an instant film camera. Totally worth every penny!","Simple to use. Photos come out very cute. Camera is relatively inexpensive","There seemed to be nothing wrong with the camera.","Very fun and easy to use!","Love it! And it's so easy to use and convenient!!","fun for little shorties","A cute little camera for on the go.. Takes great wallet size pics! My 16 year old Granddaughter loves it!","Love it","The package came great!! But in the description it said there will be batteries included. And there are no batteries.","Love it !!!!! It's so fun!!!!","Great camera, so much fun to use.  Takes great polaroid type pictures.  I love that I can take a picture and have it print instantly.  Easy to use and light weight.  High recommend to take fun photos with friends","awesome?","Easy to use","My daughter loves this camera!","I like it","I am in love with my camera! I use it to keep physical mementos. The size of the photos are as big as a driver's license and that fit right in your wallet. There are lots of DIY's to do with the developed photos as well! The vintage look of the photos is very asthetically pleasing.","Love this camera! Our kids love it too. Brings me back to my dad's old Polaroid camera but with a much updated look.It's a snap and shoot kind of camera. I'm still getting used to how to set the flash to the correct setting since we've had a few pictures come out kind of dark but it's been so fun. The actual pictures are smaller than what we had back in the day and you have to purchase those separately. Quality of the picture actually surpassed my expectations. When I have the settings set correctly the picture comes out really nice.We wanted something that would produce pictures instantly, reasonably priced and something our kids could use. We found it with this fun camera.","The Fujifilm INSTAX Mini 8 automatically focuses for your shot. It captures photos like a point and shoot digital camera. I'm 27 with a 16 month old toddler. I haven't had film developed for about 10 years. With that said being a 90ied kid this is a throwback to those small sticker picture cameras! It's lot of fun to point, click and have a real photo print out! It's very easy to use I didn't even use the directions to figure it out. Anyone who's used any electronics in the past 5 years can use this easy. The Pictures themselves look like my families old photo albums of the 50ies-80ies. They have a beautiful nostalgia to them and are tangible to hold. They also fit perfectly into the drivers license window inside my wallet. I literally ordered over 200 shots of film and like 10 albums. They come out like the old Polaroid floppy photos just smaller! Great buy and affordable price!","Absolutely love this!!! I bought it for myself for my birthday last year and I use it all of the time. I adore how the pictures turn out and it is perfect when traveling. I took it on my trip to Cancun and was able to get gorgeous pictures by the pool and the beach. My whole family loves it as well!","Got this as a gift in August 2015. Still amazing quality as when I first bought it! I absolutely love this camera and all my friends have one and love theirs as well. The film is cheaper than that of its competitors products and affordable too. The excitement of watching the film slide out and develop takes you back to the era of film cameras.<br /><br />It also came with a strap to attach to the camera! I bought one for my friend with the twin-pack. Because it is so popular, it has a lot of complimenting accessories that I also purchased off of amazon! Definitely recommend as a gift and for yourself if you love taking pictures that last a lifetime.","very cool camera, but you have to  be carefull with the settings, if its too bright dont forget to turn the light setting to the sun preset,otherwise you'll get blank photos)","I love it! The camera is very self explanatory. The directions are easy and clear. I'm really pleased with how quickly the film processes too. I do wish the film wasn't so expensive but if that's the only downfall there is that's fine with me.","Love this camera!","Good","This is a great Polaroid camera. The camera is very attractive and looks great. It is very simple to use with one button to turn it on and one button to take the picture. There is a dial on the lens for different settings such as sunny, cloudy, etc. To close the camera, all you need to do is push the lens down and it closes. I got this as a pack with this, the film, and the carrying case. All three were a great purchase and this product is absolutely something that I will continue to use down the line. The only con is that the camera is quite bulky. However, this is to be expected from a Polaroid Camera.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Attractive, easy to use<br /><br />Cons:<br />Quite Bulky","kids love it","Love the color","I LOVE this camera! It's so awesome how the pictures come out right as you take them and you get to watch them develop. The picture quality is as good as printing out pictures from your iPhone. Quick and fun experience.","Love it. Purchased for a photo guestbook for a wedding. Easy to use and fun. Add a selfie mirror and easy to load film and you are set to go!","I love this camera! it is super light and the bow does come with instructions on how to get ready. the camera does not come with film so make sure you buy some when you buy it. super fast delivery i got it two days after I order it.<br /><br />helpful link: [...]","lightweight and easy to use!","I bought this as a gift for my niece birthday and she loves it! The only bad is that the films are expensives. Really good camera","when you buy this, be realistic in expectations, its for fun. I got this as a fun little gift for a friend and she loves it but quality is terrible and the exposure levels and everything about it isn't high-quality, do expect to get shots that are just whited out because of lighting and the exposure. I've had better luck for instants on older polaroid's but this is a fun toy, it does cost a lot in the end do to the instant film.","Love it!! Works great!!","Cute little camera! Works great","My girlfriend loved it! a bit of a learners curve","Bought for my baby sister (16 y.o) and she LOVES it. Apparently these are the new fad so it worked great for her.","The camera is really cool looking & easy to use. The film is very expensive. I've tried many different methods of using the camera but I still find the actual photos it takes are hit or miss. Some look good, most are too bright because the flash goes off no matter what. I've tried to cover the flash, but it's a shot in the dark (pun!) whether your pic will come out good. Even my good photos are not that great, and the price of the film makes me want more from my shots.<br />Someone told me it's just a \"selfie camera\" and I shouldn't expect much from a polaroid camera. Maybe that's it but I've used older polaroid cameras & found their photos were much more charming. I wanted a tangible alternative to cell phone pics, which I never look at after I've taken them, but this isn't it for me. That being said, if you want small pics for fun this is a pretty cool camera.","Works great looks great","My daughter absolutely loves the camera! Bought it for her graduation party so guests could take pictures. She wouldn't give the camera up Lol","My daughter loves this. Very easy to use. It is a lot of fun for kids.  Take it out of the box put the film in and you are ready to go,","My daughter loves it.","Great camera but pictures are not so clear!","Nice product","Good enough for kids trying to have fun with instant pics - quality of pics is ok.","Great","This camera will not print out properly if you are too much in the sun.","Well made camera. Should last as long as you want to buy the expensive film!","Absolutely love this camera! Still getting used to the settings, so, my pictures outside look a little dark, but that was my fault. I love the way it works. Definitely recommend it. Great for the price.","Love this camera! It's so adorable and a wow feature where ever I go. My only issue is now everyone wants a picture and film is crazy expensive! So NO you can't have a captured moment that I want to keep because I'll never see it again! Be prepared for the \"omg that's so cute! Let me keep this one!(yea not a question more of a demand lol)\"<br /><br />Great flash a couple times I forgot to turn the dial to the right setting so it made the picture a bit dark but still beautiful. Seriously though this camera brings me back to my Polaroid days and now my kids are taking it to school so they can snap pictures of everyone...and coming home with 2 pictures.","I really enjoy using this camera! The only problem I've noticed is that it doesn't take super great pictures in bright lighting. Other than that, it has been perfect! I love the way the photos turn out, the quality of the picture, and how easy it is to use.","I love the product itself! However I was disappointed to find that there was no film included. Besides that, love it!","Exelente","I really enjoy this camera -- if you've never seen them, the pictures ARE quite small, but you can capture a huge area.","I like","Works great! Only problem is that you have to remember to set (despite the glowing indicator light) the setting dial on whatever works best (for example, if you are taking a picture outside but it suggests the indoor setting, you have to turn the dial to indicate that you would like the outdoor setting instead if you want the photo to develop correctly) Awesome product!","It's really nice! Film is super expensive, but if you buy it in bulk it isn't as bad. Also figuring out the lighting for everything is a little difficult, everything seems a little bit too under or over exposed. Though with that, put it on the setting the camera tells you to. Also get a case if you can afford it, it makes carrying around the camera so much easier.","pictures are a little small but my daughter really loves this and has had a lot of fun with the camera so far","Love this camera. Fell in love with it. I'm so happy I bought this. I totally recommend to anyone thinking about buying this","It's such a pretty camera! I love the little Pictures.","I can't say enough about this camera. My granddaughter can't stop taking pictures. It's the cutest thing ever. I was the coolest grandmother on her birthday.","Lov","Oh I love it so much it's doing so good I had another one but it's actually broke. No one's fault but my own I love this camera and I would recommend it to just about anyone. However keep in mind it is a toy camera so in a way and should be regarded as such although performance is totally top notch for the price.","Like the idea, but it's difficult to get the right settings in order to take a good picture.  The lighting setting isn't always the right setting for the shot.  Sometimes you just get lucky.","So fun in Mexico...we laughed at all the mischief we were exposed...very cute...we are now giving them to out grandchildren","I got this camera back in January (currently June) I was very excited about it. when I received it, it did not include film which I was very disappointed about. u have spend $10 to buy film sepratly. I ended up not using it and selling it at a garage sale. but overall it looked beautiful and included a strap.","Very nice!!!","Very cute","Perfect!","Excellent camera. I would highly recommend it.","Oh my gosh! I can not even say enough about this product! I am in love with it. I bought it for my wife's birthday, because she has been wanting a Polaroid camera for a long time now. I did a lot of research on it and found out that the majority of the consumers liked it, so i decided to get it for her. I am SO glad that I did buy this for her. We absolutely love it! On the way out from dinner, we popped in a film pack to take our first picture, and the picture turned out so amazing!!! We have used it so many other times in just a short period of time. The pictures are amazing! they give you that old rustic feel to them, but they just printed. It's really amazing to me to see how the pictures develop! Words can not describe the awesomeness of this camera! I love it and want to take pictures with it all the time, even though I originally bought it for my wife!","great product","My girls are having a ball with this camera.  Now I am spending all day picking up pictures around the house and in the car!!!","My daughter loves it but, of course, just like I told her, the film costs a fortune and this would end up being a novelty item. However, she wanted it so bad for so long it was worth it just to see the look on her face.","Great product and fun. Film does cost a lot but it ones with the territory. If I could do this over again I'd purchase the wider version. Still a great piece and a lot of fun for the moment","Bought mines at bestbuy, wish i would of bought here instead.  It's a lot cheaper lol . Great camera,  I love capturing moments with it.","This is awesome! Love the color, the quality of the picture it produces and the whole package. This one's a great buy!","obsessed","I love it!!!! My camera just arrived within a few hours. I literally ordered 10AM and received it 7PM.. So happy! Of course I did same day delivery since I'm like the most impatient person on the planet. Can't wait to use it some more!!","I love my Polaroid!","Cute camera, love the concept, but the film is a little pricey. Also hard to get good photos indoors. I find that I rarely use it.","thanks","Deberia haber traido fotos incluidas.","My granddaughter really wanted this camera.  I bought with the extra accessories and she loved it.","My daughter loves this thing. Haven't had any of the technical issues I read about so far. It's been 7 months and she uses it often.","Color is a little odd. More coral like then raspberry.  But it shipped quickly and my daughter likes it.","Used it for a class project for my 8 y/o Daughter.  My Daughter was able to use the camera and load the film with no problem and the kids loved that they got to have the picture immediately.","My 14 year old LOVES this camera. Disclaimer: not selfie friendly. Since she's figured out the settings, she has been taking some fun pictures! My only gripe is the that the film is so pricey!","Works great, daughter took it to college. loves it","Fun and functional (with the instant gratification factor) camera for all ages.","Great product for an instant camera. Obvious draw-back is that you get one shot at your picture. No redos","I have always wanted one of these cameras! I love that Amazon has a wide variety of color selections for the cameras. It's easy to use. My son loves to take pictures on it!!","Arrived on time and works wonderfully. Everything I expected.","fun photos are back in style","Not the best quality camera.","Well.... IT IS REALLY CUTE! I thought i will fall in love with white, but i didnt. I shouldve gotten the grape color. But then thats just the color of the camera. All is working really good and i really enjoy taking pics!","It looks really cute in actual. I am so happy that I got the prettiest color. I love it.","really nice! came really fast and works really well!!","This is a gift for my niece, she loves it, and said the photos are beautiful. It is also easy to take with while traveling around.","Great little camera for my girlfriend. She requested a camera for her scrap booking. I found this online and though it would be great. She loves it, the photos are great and are perfect for scrape booking.","Purchased this camera as a gift for my daughter. She loves it!","Cute camera but the color of the photos isn't great","I looooove this camera!","I thought I purchased this camera for myself but my toddler daughters have taken it completely over! Will purchase another one for my grandma soon!","I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!!! I love all of the fun settings on it and all of the pictures that I have printed from my camera. I had loads of fun printing all of my fun pictures and giving them to my friends. i love my camera!","Amazing camera!!! It's so fun to take physical pictures. Make sure to buy film also.","Bought for my daughter for her 13th birthday. Takes great quality little pictures with instant gratification of the instant print. The camera is sturdy and durable for older kids. It sure made my teen happy!","Terrific. Item as described. Works great and my teenage daughter loves it. A lot of fun.","I got this camera to take pictures of the guests at my daughter's first birthday party. The kids all loved watching their pictures develop, and kept asking to see them again. I handed them out with their favors at the end of the party, and while the kids definitely thought it was neat, the moms all really loved having pictures of their kids to take home, too.<br /><br />I like how the sensor determines which aperture setting to use, resulting in clear pictures that have a bit of that vintage Polaroid charm. The camera is easy to operate and Amazon had the best price I could find.<br /><br />The film is obviously pricey, so I will only use this camera for special/fun occasions. Overall, definitely glad I got it.","got here on time and it was just as expected.","i love the quality and its just what i expected","Great throwback item for Polaroid pictures!","Thank you for your quick processing and shipping. The product was arrived just as described and works like a dream!","Awesome!!!","love love love","It is a fun way to take pictures in an age where everything is digital. The prints are a bit smaller than I thought, but they come out really great! Only other issue is that the Instax cartridges are a bit more expensive than I'd like too. Still like it though and it great to hang these up on the fridge or other DIY frames for theses.","This is exactly the camera my daughter wanted & she loves it! Fast shipping & no hassles.","Great","Great fun little camera. Fun for all ages this camera instantly prints out Polaroid style photos.","Bought this as a gift for our niece and she loves it.  Great price and fast safe shipping","great item fast shipping","This camera is perfect for beginners. I was very pleased with how this product works and how fast it came to my house. I have so much fun with it, though I would recommend keeping multipule rolls of film on hand at a time because once you get inspired, it's hard to stop.","So darn cuttee!!! Love it!btw I got the strap in a bundle.","Didnt come with an actual instruction manual so half of my photos are messed up. Good luck.","In love!! I take it every where with me and it's so simple but adds the cutest touch to taking a picture","Love, love, love! I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter and the whole family has enjoyed using it. Pictures turn out much better than the old Polaroids. Great product!","Great camera! I had trouble adjusting it to take pictures outside. Indoors the pictures are great.","We love this little camera! We use it to take photos of all the important moments in our lives!","I LOOOOVEE THIS CAMERA. Everyone who has seen my camera is wondering where I bought it and how cute it is. It has a vintage style to it so they think it's expensive but it's cheaper here on amazon than at Walmart. At my Walmart they only have one color in this camera and it was white, I wanted more than just white so I purchased this camera for my birthday. I recommend this camera to anyone, the pictures come out a little small for my taste and the film for it is sorta expensive so be careful. You can buy the film on amazon or Walmart. For a 20 pack it cost about $20.00 :P","The throwback feel to this camera made it fun to use.","Came in excellent shape and in the box, brand new and works excellent!","I love the camara!!!!! It have a very good quality !!!!","I recommend this camera to anyone who simply adores the nostalgic feel of having a camera that doesn't have to be plugged into a computer to access photos, but to have a physical copy of the memory they had just made. I myself have always been fascinated by the idea of a Polaroid and simply love this cute camera that has been remodeled to a smaller and compact form to perfection. Just the one thing that I would like to warn anyone who gets this... FILM IS NOT CHEAP.","I bought this as my daughters 8th grade graduation gift and she Loves it<3","These are great cameras. This is the second one we have purchased.","Bought this camera for my son, and he loves to play with it. But on a trip to the beach found out the camera can't take a picture without looking exposed. Tried to adjust the lense setting but the camera just couldnt compensate for the light. It's fine for pictures inside but not outside.","This camera is so fun! We take it on our adventures and take fun photos. I love the Polaroid look and this camera definitely gives that. My only complaint is the photos are so small. I wish they'd make one with regular sized Polaroids.","Cute, easy to find film and accessories for. This bundle is a great deal, as well.","Expensive to use","My daughter loves this!  Just wish film came with it to start off with.","This camera is so fun. My daughter got it for her 8th birthday and is taking pictures left and right. It doesn't contain a lot of film within each packet so my suggestion would be to purchase a bundle of film and ensure the person using is taking purposeful pictures.","This is a great little camera","This camera is absolutely so cute and amazing and fun to use. It has great battery life and comes in a variety of different colors. Me and my friend both have one and neither of us has had a problem with them. But the film can get pricey so use it sparingly and only to capture memories!Best camera you can buy for only 54 dollars! Really great price for a really great product! Buy it and have fun!!","Brings back old memories and now I get to make some pretty cool ones with my 4 year old, he is obssesed with the pictures coming out right away, they look great, it does take some practice using the light settings but it's worth the money and haven't had any blank film so far","My daughter really wanted this for her 13th birthday after she did a bunch of research. She loves it!","My 3 year old loves her camera and knows how to work it!","Great product, great quality. Very happy I purchased!","Purchased for my grand daughter as an introduction to photography. I did try it out, though, and am very pleased with the ease of operation as well as the quality of photos produced. A very good purchase, especially for the price (under $60.)","Got it as a birthday gift and after 100's of photos I'm still loving it.","A well received high school graduation gift!!","It was a birthday present for my daughter and she love it and as a matter of fact am placing a another order cause one like her friends like it so much am getting it for her","LOVE IT! LOVE IT LOVE IT, only trick thing was the setting on the flash but the directions explain everything! Wasted all my film in one day i loved the way the pictures came out!","My family's over the moon when I purchase this camera ON MY OWN. They didn't know that I have enough gift card to buy it. My family love polaroid, but in Indonesia, this camera cost us arms and legs. We basically couldn't afford it. So yeah, I love it. The camera came out new, no problem at all, as I expected. Work perfectly well and trust me, I will not lie. So yeah, if you're planning to buy this camera, just buy it already. It's worth it.","I'M IN LOVE, THANK YOU SO MUCH ??","What an amazing little camera! I have been wanting to purchase this for a while and I'm so glad I finally did. It's small but not so tiny that it's easy to drop and it's so simple to use. I'm still getting used to the picture settings on it (cloudy/sunny/indoor/outside) but all in all I am so impressed!<br />Only flip side is that you have to buy the film separately but it's a small price to pay for such a great little camera :)","Bought for daughter'so birthday. She asked for one months ago. I hope she likes it ","The camera takes amazing pictures. The focus is well. The Polaroid even has settings for the type of area you are in. The settings are Home/Inside, Cloudy/Outside/Dark, Sunny/Outside/Light, Very Sunny/Outside/Bright, Hi-Key. Each setting really makes the pictures look better depending on the meeting you use and the climate of which you are in.","Super fast shipping to Turkey. Love it!","The most adorable little camera ever and it really does a great job of bringing the magic back of the traditional poloroid! Seriously for people that love taking photos this is it. It's a must have!","So Cute!!","Looking at the reviews this looked like a great, fun camera.  The pics are so grainey cant hardly tell what the picture is.","I definitely love using this camera! Easy to use! Not bulky! Adjustable flash settings are convenient!","Wife loves it","Yay!  Polaroids are back!  I got this for my nine-year-old who has gone crazy with it (don't' forget to buy extra film packs) and takes it everywhere.  Very easy to operate and has user friendly option to change the exposure which wasn't an option on the 70's cameras that i remember.  Rugged and durable with big buttons and controls.  Flash is nice and bright and takes lovely pictures inside as well as outside.  This will last a long long time.","I love it! Just as described, takes awesome pictures very self explanatory. :)","I bought this for my granddaughter.  The first one did not take very clear pictures. I reorder and this one works  very well.. We are very happy with it.","awesome camera great little pictures!!!!","I bought this for my niece and she loved it. The only problem I have with it is it that's not come with film. Now I have to order some.","Perfect for my 10 year old! Quick printing and easy to use!","It was a hit for our wedding guestbook idea!","My second time buying one of these as a gift. They are great! No issues","I love it ! It's great","For those of you who are looking to purchase a more affordable Polaroid camera; one that is easy to use and that quickly prints off credit card sized memories, look no further! This is a great way to strengthen bonds in the prevailing digital age. There's something very candid about a photo snapped that cannot be altered or shopped after being printed. Perhaps the only drawback (if any) is that the film itself is rather expensive. However, buying in bulk, using Amazon of course ;), makes for a reasonable price. I would highly recommend this camera! I would also recommend buying a case to avoid any unnecessary exposure to the film once stored inside, although I've personally had no issues with this so far. Enjoy!","Great Camera","My daughter loves it, not too bad, but don't expect good quality photos from it either... just a polaroid toy, if you will.","When I first saw this camera I thought it was good. I still think that it's good but I want the mini 90. Has more features for my taste. This camara really is for kids and with basic functions.","We love it and it arrived in PERFECT condition!  :)","Second camera I bought (this one was a gift). Light. Easy to use. Good side pictures. Obviously doesn't compare to a \"real\" camera (not phone although that sometimes comes very close) in terms of resolution but nice to be able to give out photos on the spot and it's something different.","Dictated by my 6 year old:. I wanted this camera  to print out pictures!  When I take a picture I can see it without getting it developed.  It is so cool and I got it for a present in Miami with my Grandma and GrandpaI. I like it!","I'm in love with this camera! It's compact and very easy to use. Doesn't come with the film but you can get a bundle (camera + twin pack film). My new favorite toy!","Gave it to my mom as a mothers day gift and she loved it!","Super fun camera for parties and get together's!  I wouldn't bother taking it on a trip or anything but it's a fun way to capture and share instantly.  The teens love pinning them to the roof of their cars or on their walls.  We used this at my sons graduation party and it was wonderfully successful!","makes me think of the older days of picture taking.. instant gratification!","I love this, it came fast in a good sized box, and it was cheaper than the one in store at best buy! It takes really cute pictures, and it's very easy to use.","bought this for something fun to do at my son's high school graduation party. It was such a huge hit that the next few parties we've hosted, this has been a request and now my 4 adult children are fighting over it! The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is the pictures sometimes come out over exposed and the film can is quite pricey.","This is a great camera and is so cute!! Yes this listing is 100% authentic. Love this so much it is such a great way to record memories, and even looks cute just sitting in a desk or shelf. Live it!","Daughter loves it, works good, easy to load and use<br /><br />Downside is no adjustable zoom, film goes quick, and you have to make sure of your flash setting for a clear picture","Great camera! The size is nice and the quality is better in person than it looked online. This one is for me but I would definitely order as a gift for someone as well.","SO SO SO CUTE, I LOVE IT. If you dont get this right now, you are missing out. It came right on time, fast shipping, no damage. Recommend it 100%","Exactly what I expected per photo and description.  Works great.  Super cute.","i love this camera soo much, if you buy this then watch youtube tutorials on this and you will be good to go!<br />the color is the same as in the picture.<br />comes with batteries and and string thing so u can put it on your hand with out having to hold the camera<br />really easy to use.<br />it tells you how many pictures (film) you have left.<br />hope this helped :)","Pictures come out good, no problems.","Takes great pictures...clear and sharp. My grand daughter was delighted when she opened this on her birthday!","My niece loves it!","The pictures from this camera are so cute and tumblr! Totally recommend it''","Everything about this order was perfect.","We live in an age where smartphone cameras and social media have made photography and digital content accessible to just about anyone, at anytime, and at any place. Scrolling through Instagram and Snapchat feeds is both entertaining and sometimes adventurous. I am constantly amazed at people’s creativity.","Very nice quality! Speedy delivery time","My 11-year-old daughter bought this herself with money she had saved... She absolutely loves it! Easy to use and the pictures come out great. All her friends want one now! Very happy with this camera!","An inexpensive camera that makes quick humble memories. The film ends up being more expensive that the camera itself over time.","This little camera is awesome!! I love the size of the pictures and its so easy to operate!<br />lets just say this...I bought this for my 7yr old daughter's birthday and she uses it like a pro!<br />I want one now!!","Everything came undamaged and new and my friend absolutely freaked and loved this camera. 10/10!!!","Very cute! Easy to work for someone with minimal camera experience, equally as workable for someone with lots of camera experience. Exact size I was expecting. Love the color! More of an off white than stark white which is great. Two charm holders on each side of the camera and wide blank space on the back to put lots of stickers!","Make sure you have the proper environment setting on because otherwise you waste a lot of film. We were outdoors and didn't change the setting so several pictures were over exposed. We used 2 of these cameras for my 8 year old's birthday scavenger hunt.","easy to use great","Feel like it's more like a reddish orange color not raspberry. Idk if that's the point but was expecting more like a dark pinkish color. Other than that great cam!!","Easy to use. Exactly as described.","nostalgic and works well","brings back memories of my polaroid days! my daughter received this at Christmas with two packs of film. Works well, just don't push the button until you're ready, I mistakenly took a few pictures of the ceiling and my face trying to figure it out... there goes that film! Film cartridges are not large, usually about 10 in each pack, and if you or your kids are having fun with a group you'll go through them fast probably. Still they are fun, pictures are much smaller than traditional polaroids, but just about as clear and focused as original.","it is so fun to use and it works perfectly.","I love it! It is amazing. Totally worth the money!  Easy to use. Works amazingly. The only slight downside is dirt sticks to it pretty easily. But if cleans off easily too. Totally recommend this!","my grandaughter loves it","Love this camera I have so much fun with it!","I bought this as a gift for my daughters graduation. She loves it, She took so many pictures with it of her friends before and after graduation.","I bought these for my daughter's (7) and (11).  They love them.  I recommend purchashing a case or the kit that includes a case.  It full of cute, helpful accessories.  My only complaint is using the camera on Sunny days makes the photo washed out looking. Indoor photos or if your in the shade look great.  I highly recommend the Mini 8 and the accessories!","My wife loves this!  I gave it to her as a birthday gift and she thought it was so fun and delightful.  Funny how having concrete polaroid shots are now unique again.  She loved the pink color.  It's easy to operate.  I thought it was terrific.  Well balanced in terms of being well-made, fun looking and a good price.","Lots of fun, I just ordered one for my mother in law","Another hit from Fujifilm. In this age of cell phone pictures and selfies, a camera product has to be compelling to compete with the cell phones we own already. Leave it to Fujifilm to update the camera to keep it in the arsenal as a useful, beautifully designed photographic resource.","My 4 year old loves her camera. Great for practice and teaching perspective and control. Easy to use and with good grasp for a child.","Great fun camera.","The camera works as expected. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I expected it to be smaller than the cameras that print standard sized Polaroids.  We, obviously, found that not to be the case. This camera is as equally bulky as the standard instant-print cameras.","Quick delivery and great value price point. The same camera at the store pricing i found was slightly higher and it's also so convenient to order it online","Yee","So much fun. This little camera takes nice instant photos.","The pictures turned out awesome !","Love this camera!  I've shot around 150 photos with it so far and only a couple times it was under or over exposed, but that was probably just because of the setting I had it on.  Sometimes I get someone to shoot my photo, then in turn I'll offer to shoot one for them and give them the photo.  Everyone pretty much loves it too!  No regrets!","lovely color, I love it.","So fun for DIY photo booth","Lots of fun","Great product, fast service!! Thank you!","Amazing and I love this camera!<br />Takes some practice to use but once you figure it out it's so worth it!","This Polaroid camera is awesome! It is easy to use and is pretty compact so it is not hard to carry around when you go out. They also have a strap that saved me from dropping it a couple times!","I am delighted with this camera. It's super cute and lovely","Really love this item!","my daughter loves this for insta print pics","All good","Great size and the photos are perfect for my wedding photo booth","So fun. the photos are not as big as the old time polaroid but still worth it.","The camera is awesome. I got this as a present for my girlfriend and she definitely \"showed\" her appreciation for it.","I love this camara I don't use it enogh!","A great camera!!! Takes good pictures, easy to read manual, and is just great over all. It's not too big and it's not small. Only bad thing is that it didn't come with film, and film (not bought on Amazon) is pretty expensive. And the color isn't as vibrant as they picture it. But color does want matter. This product works amazingly. Would recommend.","Worth every single penny who ever your buying this for, for you or a friend , you will fall in love with it !","Perfect! I bought this for my vacation and it was exactly what I wanted and more! I definitely recommend buying on here, it's way cheaper on Amazon rather than in stores like Walmart. I also recommend buying film on Amazon, there's some great deals!","It works, but the quality is very cheap looking it came with batteries the original camara doesn't come with batteries. Its a knock off","This camera is adorable and works great. I love it as a more affordable option to polaroid brand cameras. I've been using it for over six months with no problem! Highly recommend.","I got the yellow camera and it is sooo pretty! It's lightweight, adorable and has multiple setting to change the lighting!! This is awesome! Thanks Fujifilm!","Great price, amazing quality, Great buy I don't regret buying this camera in fact I wish I would have brough it sooner.","This camera is amazing, it came really fast…I dropped it the first day I got it and lens protector popped out I was scared because I broke it the first day but I just popped the lens protector back where it was and it is holding up","Wonderful","It worked perfectly","Im loving this polaroid, the pictures come out in hd and good focus, came earlier than expected. Its a great girft for someone who loves taking pictures","Awesome little camera! Color is beautiful.definitely recommend it!","I absolutely love this! It's such an easy way to share photos with friends. It also super cute decor in your room or car or something! I really think that y'all should buy this! My big fright when buying this online and not in a store was the actuality of it. I was afraid of it being a knock off but it works perfectly and came in perfect shape! I would recommend this to absolutely anyone.","Best purchase I have ever made!!!","Polaroid type film. What a super fun come-back!!! I’ve only taken a few pictures but I am very pleased with the outcome. Outside photos are better then inside (so far anyway). Haven’t experimented with all the settings yet.<br />Just remember they will not be what you may print from a Nikon, etc.,  or your iPhone,  but the whole idea is just great fun!<br />I ordered (and received) the raspberry color but it’s more of a coral. Still pretty though.<br />I would recommend purchasing.<br />Enjoy!!","My girlfriend loved it!! Great pictures with a hipseterish vibe","The color is exactly the same from the photo. I'm so exited to try it!. Its cute and comes with an adorable strap. Was debating on this and the 8+ but just seem like the selfie mirror attached wasn't worth the extra 50 so i got this instead.","I gave this to my mother in law for her Bday and she loved it!! She told me today that she brought it to work and all the ladies there are going to order one now. Lol. It's SO fun. I have one myself and that's why I purchased one for her. She seen mine and seemed to like it. So yeah, she cried when  she got it and it works just fine!!","I LOVE MY CAMERA ITS SO CUTE AND IT WAS SO CHEAP!!","I'm sure the camera will be ok, but am dinging the makers of it for not including at least one small package of film with it.  Now I've got to order that and wait a couple more days.","Arrived on time in perfect condition. Love love love this camera, doesn't work well outdoors but works perfect in doors. Would definitely recommend.","Love my instax mini. It is such a cute color and so light weight. It's a little hard to understand how to use it but if you follow the instructions you catch one. It even makes a great gift.","My nine-year-old daughter received this for her birthday and she absolutely loves it.","Love this little camera! It doesn't take the quality pictures I was hoping for, but it's still cute.","Step-daughter loves it! Directions are a tad confusing and I liked the previous generation better. This one has too many bells and whistles, and isn't your simple point and shoot instant camera.","I think the product is very cool. I bought it for my 3 year old's birthday party. We had a photo wall with dress up items. The kids' minds were collectively blown when the picture came out of the camera. They would fight over who got to take it out :)<br /><br />ANYWAY, the product itself feels kind of cheap and it's strange that the way to turn it off is to just push the lens in with your hand, but so far no problems so maybe it doesnt matter that it feels cheap.<br /><br />I've only taken about 20 pictures with it, but so far, so good.","My sister loves it.","I love my camera. It's very cute and takes nice photos. It definitely was a good purchase.","I always wanted a polaroid camera and was excited when I got this. However I did have some buyers remorse. First, when you take the picture it doesn't come out as it looks through the lens. The object will be either really far or close and fuzzy. Its hard to adjust the light setting because sometimes pictures in the shade come out really dark. Second. You can only take 10 pictures before you need a new roll. And the film is expensive. Its about a dollar per sheet and if you mess the picture up. You just wasted money. I really like it to take general pictures but no advanced photography. I ended up purchasing the Fujimax printer which I liked so much better because I could print out pictures from my phone that I really liked. You know what the picture looks like before you print it, and you could always edit the picture before printing it. I do like the camera but you are better off buying the printer than the camera.","THINK BEFORE YOU BUY!! The reason that I bought this camera is because my friend has one and as a college student I think it’s really cool and to have one by my own. LOL!!! However, the fact is that I only used it two times and NEVER use it again. I was really exciting when I just received the camera. Be honestly, FujiFilm Instax Mini 8 is a cute-costly-camera. It’s can give you the photo in 10 seconds and it has many different models, like indoor and outdoor. It is a great camera to help you keep the moment and share the photos with your friends. The camera seems cheap which only $78.87; however, for me, the films are SUPER expensive, like 20 sheets for $12.48.  The most important is that if you don’t keep the film in a safe place (it can’t be exposed under sun, you can’t put any pressure on the films, and it can’t be taken out once you put it into the camera.), it will waste the whole package of films. WARNNING!!! If you don’t use the camera, you better take the batteries out. Even though you don’t use the camera, the batteries will still die out really quick. If you really want to have one, you better ask yourself---DO I REALLY NEED IT? If you have many many great moments then you should. Nevertheless, if you like me, don’t have much parties then I suggest you do not waste your money and take photos by your phone.","Cute camera! Works well, the film process really dark.  Have plenty of light when using this camera.","ok","Soooo cute!","My grand daughter loves it :)","This camera is fantastic. Pictures are beautiful. Fun addition for our scrapbook.","I have not used it for the event that I bought the camera for.  But the 'test drive' was great!  Took great pictures.","I bought this for my stepdaughter's `14th birthday.  She loves it.  Obviously, if you are looking for a super high quality photo, this would not be the camera.  What it is perfect for is taking and printing shots instantly.  They are small little pictures that you can put anywhere.  They fit perfectly in planners, SMASH books, scrapbooks, or other little projects such as that.  The film isn't super cheap so you need to be willing to take a less than perfect, spontaneous shot as you won't want to take a dozen to get the \"perfect\" shot.  Overall, this camera is perfect for teens and adults to just take fun photos!","I love it!!!","so far its great!","My daughter loves it. Great pictures","Good","Basics: This camera arrived really quickly. The grape colour is exactly as it appears on the site. It came with batteries and an instruction manual with English on it.<br /><br />I wanted a  instant camera for a long while and so I took the plunge when I saw it was a good deal. I chose the grape because I loved the colour and it arrived shortly after. The first picture I took was clear but somewhat lower quality than the reviews led me to believe thus the removal of one star. Still, it was a great picture and the camera is adorable and sturdy. I will definitely love exploring this cute little tool.","Love it","Best purchase!! This camera is a hit at every party. We use it like a photo booth","Absolutely LOVE IT","Pictures are darker than the old school Polaroid.  It's ok Probably would not buy again.","This is a beautiful, probably not practical, Hello Kitty Instant Cam. So if you are the kind like me who is in love with Hello Kitty enough to completely disregard impracticability this is for you. I don't see myself carrying it around all the time since it is huge and only loads 10 mini pics at a time, but I will pull it out for instant gratification.","Cute lil camera, bought this for an 11 year old. She loves it, has little pictures of her and her friends and family all over her room. I just purchased  more film for this the other day.","Love this camera it's so cute and everyone loves it","I was so excited to get this. I was not dispointed. It's a cute size easy to use and just fun.","Great product.","Fun toy","Who doesn't love a Polaroid?","Purchased this for my mom... She Loves it!!!","Great little camera; daughter enjoys it.","Great gift for kids.","Great product, but good thing I purchased films.. didnt know there were no films","Absolutely wonderful buy!","In love with this product! My husband ordered it for a Christmas gift and I have had so much fun with it.","I love this so much! It takes amazing photos!","I bought this for a friend and he loves it. Probably will get myself one too!","Best camera ever","My daughter loved the camera!","Bought this for my 13 year old daughter.  She loves having a photo instantly and I appretiate the nostalgia.","great","my daughter loves this camera","Bought these for our daughters for Christmas and they love them.","LOVE this camera. It came packaged nicely and promptly. I definitely recommend getting this. Cheaper than a Polaroid, but does the same job.","Great quality camera and very user friendly! Love how the pictures have that nostalgic look to them. Would recommend.","I love this camera I take with me everywhere. Its great for little photos. The only thing I didn't realize is the size of the film is very small. I wish It was bigger but other than that, It's great!","The camera is amazing (I got the twin pack so it came with the film) but it came earlier than expected which was super thrilling. It came undamaged which was a big relief and the film wasn't damaged either. I followed the instructions word for word (it's not that hard to follow) and took my first picture. It developed just fine and came out great. I started taking more pictures and it was so much fun they all came out perfect. I highly recommend getting this product I can't wait to buy more film for the camera.","Great Christmas present","Bought this for a gift, my daughter loved it! Works good.","very nice, there was one little scratch but overall, I loved it!","My daughter loved it.  She always wanted this camera.","Excellent product!","I'm writing this as my 9yr daughter tells me what she does and doesn't like about. She loves this because it is purple, it is a good fit for hwr hands and isn't too big and being able to get immediate pictures when she meetsa new friend.  The only think she doesn't like or at least doesnt seem to matter is the focusing feature.  She says she can't tell any difference.<br />I actually used it at a family reunion and it was so great because you can immediately get pictures of folks you may not see again and share them.  Many older folks may not be inclined to know how to get online to download digital pictures that are emailed.  This is a great alternative.  I have tons of pics in my phone but I have 8 on of these Instax on my fridge that I see everyday.","I absolutely love my camera. It is so cute and small so you can bring it everywhere. It also takes adorable pictures.","Muy buen producto","GREAT. LOVE IT. I am thinking of buying another one but a different color. It has all the qualities that everyone said.","This was bought for a friend & she loved it!","I bought it for my daughter and she loves it!  We took it on our vacation and had a blast!  It's so much fun!","2nd time buying and still a great experience! This was a gift for my brother and he loved it","Great price and a very cool product!","OK - this thing is awesome!<br />It is a crowd pleaser, it is fun and easy. My 9 year old LOVES it. We got some props and did a photobooth with it, and she loves taking the pictures and watching them magically appear.  You can then use the results for photo magnets, and buttons and bookmarks and just anything fun!<br /><br />The only drawback - this is a mostly indoor camera - the outdoor shots we've taken are very very exposed.","love it","I have always wanted a polaroid and was ecstatic when I saw this one for a great deal. Easy to load film and love the wrist strap it comes with. Definitely need some practice with using it in proper lighting situations, but it is a fun little camera to have for quick little memories to make.","LOVE LOVE LOVE MY CAMERA!!!!!!!","I just wish it came with a nylon bag or anything you can put it with because I bought this as a gift for my wife and from day 2 in her purse it was all scratched , so I suggest if you can offered the cover they sell you should buy it","Luv it","Purchased a couple of these cuties for my wedding and honestly, best investment ever!!! Easy to  use and great quality photos.<br />Best part was that the both times i purchased items arrived sooner than expected! 100% recommended.","I gave this camera to my 6 year old daughter for her birthday and she absolutely loves it! She couldn't wait to start taking pics. The picture quality is great. There were a few times it might have been over exposed but we just need to figure out the lighting. I would recommend this item.","8th Bday gift for my daughter- was a total hit!  we bought a cool board to put up in her room to put the pics!","Good camera. Got a 20 dollars gift card from seller.","It works great","I ordered pink, the box was pink but when I opened it the camera was blue.","Love the color! It's easy to use, and it's super cute!","Love this camera and the cute colors! So fun to use!","I got the grape colored one. It just arrived this afternoon and I already took 3 pictures! The instructions are easy to read. 10/10 would buy again.","Love this camera! Our kids love it too. Brings me back to my dad's old Polaroid camera but with a much updated look.<br /><br />It's a snap and shoot kind of camera. I'm still getting used to how to set the flash to the correct setting since we've had a few pictures come out kind of dark but it's been so fun. The actual pictures are smaller than what we had back in the day and you have to purchase those separately. Quality of the picture actually surpassed my expectations. When I have the settings set correctly the picture comes out really nice.<br /><br />We wanted something that would produce pictures instantly, reasonably priced and something our kids could use. We found it with this fun camera.","daughter loves it","It wasn't very accurate with the amount of film left","These pictures are tiny!  I remember the old Polaroid camera and they were decent sized photos.  The camera is fun, you get photos right away, but they are probably only 2\" X 1\", something like that.  I didn't measure, but they are small compared to old size.","I love this camera! A few days after I purchased it, a few of my friends purchased one of their own. The only thing that is iffy is the somewhat-frequent underexposure/overexposure in photos taken with the correct adjustments per the actual setting (with sunlight, in the dark, etc.).","Excelente","Doesn't seem to change setting, but once you get used to it, it takes cool pictures!  Really digging it.","I LOVE LOVE LOVE my little camera! Of course the quality of the picture isn't as good as it would be on a more professional cam or even as good as off your phone, but to use to take little momentos to make a scrapbook or just to collect memories is great! It is battery operated, but I haven't had to replace them yet. It doesn't come with film.","This is a great little instant picture camera me and my friends love using this! My only complaint is that you can't control the flash but other then that it is very fun.","This camera is so easy to use and so much fun. The best part is getting the pictures right away! I'm so used to taking pictures on my iPhone and never getting them developed but now I can take a fun picture and have it that instant...so cool","She absolutely loves it","I love this camera!!","Love it","It's great - easy to work and vintage- love it","Awesome!","I bought this camera for my daughter for her 14th birthday. She loved the camera. This camera is easy to use and is great for a gift for a teenager. I order the black one because that is the color she chooses. This camera has given her tons of fun with her friends.<br /><br />This is a great camera a teenager can put in a bag and take with them when having sleepovers at friends houses. It is small and lightweight and takes great pictures for her to share.<br /><br />I paid full retail price for this camera and this is my honest and unbiased review. ?","My one complaint is that it can't take pictures outside. The lighting has to be 100% perfect to get a good shot. Great for portraits though!","Love it.","Good price. My nieice loves it!","Bought for my 12 year old niece and she loves it.  Only downfall is that the \"film\" is expensive.","Camera is perfect!! Lots of fun to take pictures with.  Everything arrived on time:)","I am an old woman and my hands occasionally tremble making clear pictures difficult. I bought this camera specifically to solve that problem which it does very well. I like to garden and take pictures of my flowers. They all turn out great! Love this camera.","so pretty! contains camera, strap, 2 batteries! easy to operate!","I love it! It's perfect for taking monthly pictures of my daughter. So cute!","I bought this for my wedding, since we were unable to accommodate a photobooth at our venue. Our guest were able to take selfies and glue the pictures to a scrapbook we provided to make an instant \"Photo Guest Book\".<br />The kids at our wedding had a BALL with this taking pictures of everyone.","Good!","12 year old daughter loves this camera!","It is a great camera and the color is very very nice. I loved it! It was love at first sight. Don't be fooled by the selfie mirror... it does not come with it , but to be honest I don't think it is needed. This camera is amazing just how it is and I will definitely recommend anyone to buy it. I'm so in love!!!","Love it, it's so cute.","Very very nice product","LOVE my instax!!","Love........","Came with everything listed and has perfect quality!","Takes wonderful pics. The clarity and color in the film can't be beat. The product is easy to use. It's sturdy and you can move the dial for more options (light exposure etc.). I put the film in backwards once, and worried I damaged something, but everything was fine (no problems at all!) The mini polaroids are fun, and make great party favors or keepsakes too. I love them, fuji is a great product. Highly recommend for the price 50-60$ I wouldn't pay more, but on amazon you  won't. If you're contemplating it, just buy it, you'll love it","I love my Fujifilm Instamax camera!!!!! I have been using this purchase with one that I got to review and it has been the most fun in the world. My son used it to go to DC and we made a little scrapbook for him to keep. My daughter is going to be going on a school trip also and some events in school and I she is going to use to preserve her memories as well. I loved the old Polaroid cameras that were instant, yes i'm that old, but this one is great and new technology. The pictures are pretty sharp and it is not hard to learn to use. The film is a bit pricey, but I love the results so much I just look to buy them in bulk on Amazon. I wish that I had gotten one of these when the kids were younger, it would have been so much fun. Oh, I can't forget to mention the color, I absolutely love this color it is true to the picture and is such a soft canary yellow. Great camera and have quite a few of them.","This Camera is so fun to use!","Such a fun little camera!","Its perfect for capturing the moment!","I am having so much fun with this. There is so much you can do with the photos. I have brought this everywhere with me even overseas. It works great!!!","Bought this for my daughter. She loves it!","Got to my house in time for the GF's birthday. Appeared just as described! Everything worked well and came with batteries.<br /><br />Good: Takes fun instant pictures, not too bulky.<br />Bad: Film is expensive, bad directions","I received this tire inflator and it was not what I expected but I still am happy with it.

So fun! I love taking pictures.","works great, used it a lot at parties.","The quality of the photos are just okay. Cute & fun product and great for parties.","I got the raspberry color for Christmas and all I can say is wow! What an amazing camera! I remember having the old fashioned Polaroid camera years ago and loved the fact that the picture develops instantly. I am so happy they remade a modern one like this. I use it all the time to capture memories whenever I can. It's so convenient. I honestly don't think I'd change anything about this camera, it's perfect!!!","Great product and quick shipping!","I love this camera! I received it earlier than expected which was a nice surprise. It came with everything shown in the information and it's so easy to set up and use. I would definitely recommend it this to anyone. It's so cute!","Hard to get a good picture outdoors in the sunlight , other than that it is a great camera .","Cute little camera.","My camera arrived super fast! It was so nice to see my camera in the mail way before estimated delivery day. It came perfectly wrapped and protected in the box. I absolutely love how cute the camera is. I ordered the yellow and it's more of a pastel yellow. It's very lightweight and super easy to use. The camera recommends which setting to use, like if you're outdoors it'll recommend the sunny or super sunny lense (the little sun icon with more rays drawn). The pictures take about 3 mins to develop, pretty fast. The quality is excellent! They are card sized and will fit perfectly in your wallet or whatever you choose. It's a great camera, I recommend it for anyone. I will be buying another one in the future as a gift :)","Glad I got white. It is different but not cheesy looking. Everyone enjoyed this camera at my party.","Best deal I could find and really great quality!","I ordered this for my daughter to give to my 12 year old Grand Daughter ! She absolutely loves it ! She used it within minutes of opening her gifts ! It's a very sturdy camera . Fun for the whole family !<br /><br />Click the button and in a minute you have your instant picture ! Great for Tweens and Teens !<br /><br />Great Gift !<br /><br />Easy to use and load up ! Comes with camera , camera strap , batteries<br /><br />New slim camera light weight .<br />Automatic picture exposure<br />New improved viewfinder great clear crisp picture !<br /><br />Choose your color !<br /><br />My Grand Daughter was very excited about this gift ! Her snapshots are picture perfect !","Best purchase ever! The color is exactly the same as in the photos. The camera is the perfect size, and has a few lighting settings to get your photos perfect! Produced some really great shots!","love it :)","Daughter LOVES the camera.  Have had for several months now...buy extra film!  It's a super cute camera - works well for what it is.  Don't expect any high quality pics...more a fun thing! but GREAT and works well.","Great compact, chunky camera for instant nostalgia!<br /><br />I found this camera very easy to use in spite of English-as-a-second-language instructions. I'm by no means an expert photographer (I took one class in high school 17 years ago and forgot everything but the words f-stop and aperature), but this was easy to use to remember \"the good ole days\". Even the sound of the flash firing and the film shooting out brings back memories. The flash is always on, which was fine for the indoor setting in which we have since primarily used it. Picture quality is about what you would expect from ye olde Polaroid, and that's just fine for me. I didn't buy this camera to just capture memories--I bought it to MAKE memories.<br /><br />The pictures themselves are small but charming, about the length of my middle finger and less than half as wide as the length. The film shoots out of the camera just like a classic Polaroid and takes about as long to develop as the classic brand did, so be patient if you don't seem your image come through for a couple of minutes. It develops with that wonderful, yellowy vintage sheen that's so appealing to my nostalgia, and because the picture sizes are so small, they make wonderful gifts and be tucked anywhere--wallets, bulletin boards, desk frames.<br /><br />For my part, I bought these for my son's third birthday carnival. You can see in the attached photo that they were part of the giveaways to my guests after they took pictures at our photo wall. My guests went gaga over them. Lots of happy friends that day!","Great","Such a fun camera! Buy extra film, you could just snap fun pictures all day! Love the color and is perfect for my 10 year old to capture all the beauty and fun she sees! I recommend this and actually would love to have one myself!","Amazing! Bought this for my daughter, takes amazing pictures and is easy to understand.","I received this for my birthday and I love it. Film runs out fast, but it's all worth it.","The product works great and is easy to use. I don't like reading directions and I figured it out. Haha. The strange thing about this little camera is where the button to take pictures is. The placement is a little odd and I actually have to think before taking a photo. The photos come out great. I love the size of them!","Shipped and received when supposed to. Wish the polaroids were larger, but apparently this is the new size. Camera is bit heavy, and polaroids are expensive. Read the directions, and then read again before using. We wasted a few polaroids due to careless reading of instructions. Product as described.","I love this new style of fujifilm camera it's perfect for traveling and just packing it on a carry on bag. It takes amazing pictures and its super affordable! Love this","i just wanted to say i received this in less than 24 hours! via PRIME<br />how cool is that!<br />great product, have yet to use it, i am bringing it on vacation with me this week","Love this product! Really great way to capture memories!","Fun little camera","I've wanted an instant film camera for as long as I can remember so getting this in the mail was super exciting! It did not disappoint! It feels sturdy and looks so cute and putting in the film is a breeze. It does not come with film so be sure to get that also!<br /><br />It works well and tells you where to adjust the lens according to the lighting. There's also a booklet inside that tells you how to adjust it to be brighter if that's the look you're going for.<br /><br />I had a slight problem with Amazon delivering it past the two day mark (originally 5 days and then down to 3) so just be aware of that if it's for an event like mine was.","Perfect gift for any child!! This is the new thing and I even thought it was super cool!","Works pretty well for a kid. I got this for my niece for her BDAY and she could use it right out of the box. She took a lot of pictures for her bday with it and had a lot of fun.<br /><br />Overall good product. Maybe slghtly more expensive than I wish it would be but it is good overall.","First off, I wouldn't recommend buying this camera for large scale family photos or pictures for gatherings. - Which I knew ahead of time by watching product overview videos. I spefically bought this product for cataloging my rock collection since I'm an amateur geologist. Since the photos are small and in HD, it makes it really easy and convenient to tape/catalog photos in a book.","Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful is what i have to say! So excited about it and am having too much fun also the film was at a great price for the twin pack! purchased another tiwn pack as well!","I love this camera, it takes great photos.","Love this camera!!!","love this camera. was a great purchase at great price.","As described, A +","Nice camera. Only wish it came with some sample film.","All products were as described and shown in the photos. None of the products were damaged during delivery. All parts worked as stated they would.","Everything","I've had this camera since January and I honestly love it. The only problem though is that my film gets stuck sometimes and I have to manually take it out. It can get annoying because I'm afraid I might break it but usually the pictures do come out great.","Good quality","Ok","Wonderful, but dont use in the day time. We tried all the settings the cameral has to offer, but really the photos in the day time came out super washed out. Great photos at night though","This looks more pink in the picture but it's more reddish color. Wasn't too happy about that. Wish I had ordered the light pink.","Good camera but when you use the camera outside you have to cover the flash","Great camera. Does what it is supposed to do. Very cute and small","I'm questioning the authenticity of the camera I received in the mail. Its labeling is different than the same caneras you can purchase from big stores like Target or Best Buy.","I love my instant pics and my kids love seeing the results.","Pretty good","I love this camera it's so cute ! I was worried after reading some negative reviews but it was worth it I would totally buy it again. The picture come out looking vintage which is an added plus for me!","My 13 yr old loved it!! It's a great camera and would recommend to anyone.","I don't regret getting this. It's very cute and takes nice little credit card sized photos. My issues with it are as follows: the viewing hole is really tiny. The photos come off out of center with the viewing hole. Sometimes the camera recommends settings that make the photos turn out too bright or too dark. & If you try to take closeup photos they will come out blurry.<br />All that aside I love my camera. Being able to take little instant photos wherever I am is just too fun not to enjoy. I love this camera, and if and when they improve it I will probably buy that too.","I love this camera, its small and cute. I bought it as a grad gift to my Baby sister. She uses it all the time, and when its not in use it looks like cute desk decor!","This camera is fun and takes great polaroids. Used at my daughter's graduation party to take pics of all the kids that came! It was the talk of the party!","Received package on time, love the red color and am Happy with the item","everything was as expected","I bought this because it was more affordable than Polaroids version. I love how easy it is to use this camera.","Thanks for good product","good  ok","This polaroid camera was awesome! I absolutely love it to the moon and back! It also ships really fast too! I ordered it on a Tuesday and got it on Friday. I really recommend this polaroid for everyone. It's so amazing that it'll feel like your new best friend! Are you ready to capture a new memory and get it instantly? Don't forget to order your very own Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 polaroid today!","Wife loves it!!! She likes having the picture instantly.","Love it","The first one that came to me had a defect, (the little arm that catches the film and pushes it up to the rollers wasn't working properly). Basically the film wouldn't eject at all. I decided to exchange it and the new one shipped fast and worked perfectly! The new one is so much fun and the return process was smooth. I definitely would recommend!!!","My wife loves this camera, not because it is perfect or because the image quality is tremendous, but because it is a fun experience. It is very easy to use and people are always excited to see the photo that prints out. It's fun, that's the chief benefit of this item.<br /><br />One word of caution, the photo paper is not cheap, so this isn't a carefree experience. We buy the film on Amazon, but even then it is roughly $0.75 per picture.","Just like the old Polaroid's, but with a vintage twist! Love love love! My kids get a kick out of it. They live in the digital age do this is un heard of! Great little shots with it too !","Works great It's so much fun having a instant camera again and these are so much cuter than the ones that were around when I was a kid.","FUN, nostalgia, we enjoy it","I gifted to my friend and she loves it! only down side that i will say about this is that it doesn't come with the films so i suggest buying the film separately","I took this Camera on a hiking trip today. Although it looks Bulkie it is very lite to carry. Not t going to get high tech photos on this but lots of fun. I can't wait to use it at a kid's party in the photo booth!","Very cute! A bit challenging to master getting ideal photo wuality","A lot of people that rate this product badly, didn't read the instructions well enough. It works great, photos are small, but still cute. Great that it has a exposure meter, helps when taking pics outside. Going to by a white one soon and probably incest in some accessories.","I love instant gratification. Who doesn't? My daddy gave me my first Polaroid eons ago. And while the pictures are nowhere near as good as my digital snaps, and while I have to wait to see if the picture I had hoped to capture is any good - I still love it.<br /><br />The last time I had an instant camera was when my oldest was born - almost 10 years ago. I don't remember if it broke or if procuring the film just got to be too expensive/difficult - but when we moved to Texas, the cameras didn't make it. But in the eerie way our techno age works (and really - it almost wants to make you go off the grid), Amazon started recommending instant cameras again. And when I saw this cute little thing AND in pink - I succumbed.<br /><br />But, as is often the case, I don't fully read all the information before purchasing, I was shocked at how large the camera was when it arrived (despite the fact the actual pictures are super tiny). But it is still cute. And it is still light years better than my old instant camera. It has lens controls that my Polaroids never had.<br /><br />And just as I was amused (awestruck) by the process of watching the pictures develop before my eyes and in my hot little hands - I LOVE that I am able to share that thrill with my babies now.","The color is really pretty, and it works very well!<br />Besides printing pictures, it is also good for decorations.","I overall loved this camera. Only thing is that you have to be careful taking pics in super bright tropical areas because the pics will turn out white if it's really sunny out. No problems with it beside that.","Fun to have 'polaroids\" back! This little camera is a lot of fun, but the flash is too bright for the film (using the mfg's film for this camera). It washes out anybody's face and throws off the color balance.","Love it soooo much super cheap and cute I love taking pictures with this!","Loooove this retro cameras such a hit! It's a bit clunky, but so we're the instant cameras back in the day!","So happy that I purchased this camera. So much cheaper than in stores. Highly recommend if you are looking for a polaroid camera. It is a little hard to know which lighting setting to put it on, but prascticemakes perfect. I LOVE the color of the camera as well. It is bright and I love it even more because it is matte (which is so in right now)!","I'm getting this for my daughter, she will love it!","Just what I wanted! Though the little part that says how much film I have left might be broken because it's stuck on 9 and I've taken more than 1 photo","Love it","I met my expectations and more","Our 4 yr old grandson is having a blast with his new camera!!!!","I loved the product. It came on time. The only thing I wasn't too happy with was that the strap was missing.","Receive it in mint condition. Works perfectly and durable!","Good item good price My GF likes it!","Loved it! Perfect for guest book pictures at the wedding!","Pictures have vintage feel, love how mini it is.","niece loved it.","ok","If you are a woman and wear makeup, white is not the best color to get. My foundation appears to always be on it... and it is not fun to wipe it down after each use. Try another color!","Talk about nostalgia! I had a camera like this when I was a kid and when I bought this for my wedding guest book, I was pleasantly surprised at the joy I had as a kid resurfacing! My little girl and I blew through 20 exposures just playing around and waiting for the picture to darken up. I love this camera and I am so excited to take photos at my wedding with it.","Perfect","I got this for my cousin for Christmas and she loves it!  The actual color of the camera matches the color in the picture, which I was really happy about.  I bought this product when they had the deal where you can get a free pack of 20 fujifilm instax, so that was a plus!  This product has multiple settings: sunny days, cloudy days, indoors, and nighttime.  This is a perfect gift for teenagers that loves to take pictures","My 11 year old daughter LOVES her camera. Pics are pretty good quality.","Does what it's supposed to do. Great gift. The film is a bit pricey so you really don't get all snap happy but it's a cool gadget","Its cute, Its simple, It should be cheaper. I say that because its a hit or miss with the pictures. Some would develop well some won't. Don't expect an outstanding picture. This camera is more like a toy for a mature kid. You also need to order extra film.","Our daughter purchased this in blue with her \"sweet 16\" birthday gift money. She loves it and has had great fun taking photos with it. The photo quality is nice, better than the old cameras from years ago. She also found and purchased on Amazon an extra two pack of film to go with this item and it was a great price! This camera was priced competively and we feel she got a fair price after much research. It arrived with the camera, in perfect condition. She carries that camera everywhere now!","Kids love the camera. The film produces great color and last long. Easy to use, fun for the kids and brings back memories of the good old days","it looks nice and have nice quality","My inner hipster couldn't resist. I used to love my polaroids. The film just became wayyyy to expensive. They still are. However the instant cameras have been making quite the comeback and with it fuji has made it a little more affordable to enjoy simplistic pictures again. I really love mine and I purchased the black one so that I could customized it to fit my personality. Overall I am super satisfied with this purchase. P.S. Amazon has the best price on these cameras... take my word for it, I have checked.","i lovvvvvvvve it","This product is amazing and is exactly what I expected","I loved it!","My gf loved it!","Smaller than I thought it would be.  But we love it.  Love the \"old school\" pictures it takes.","I am so happy i literally just got this in the mail and i already took 3 photos i'm very happy and this is true to colour.","I have had the instax wide film camera from Fujifilm for the past three years and this is an amazing improvement. The wide camera is just too large and I look retarded holding it. The instax mini fits very well in my backpack and I'm not scared to be a little rough with it. I like the larger pictures, but this film is a bit cheaper (buy the 60 pack on amazon) so it evens out.","My Mom loves it...I gave it to her for Mother's Day and she is 84 yrs. young !!","Happy","this is the best camera i have ever seen . its small size and easy to carry quality makes it the most cutest camera on earth.not only looks but the picture quality is more than amazing . every travel freak should carry such camera . this brand deals with worlds best camera company.","Big hit in our school raffle","I bought it for my daughter. She loves it!","like it really cool to have","The pictures are a little smaller than I thought but they turn out great, just like the old ones. Even my three year old took a perfect picture with it.","I purchased this camera as a gift and they loved it. The look and the feel of the camera is awesome. I love the way the pictures come out. It's great to make to print out and give to your friends as a gift.","Absolutely love my Instax. I take it on vacations with me and to outings with my friends and family. I have never been disappointed with a shot unless I put it on the wrong setting. Definitely would recommend this no matter what color you buy. I bought this one because it was the cheapest color at the time - but I fell in love with the color once I had it in my hand","I LOVE this camera! It's adorable, super portable, and makes it easy to keep memories in your pocket! Pictures come out great!","I love how raw the pictures look :) don't expect them to look HD with perfect lighting like your phone provides: but authentic and real. Bringing the old way of taking pictures back and I couldn't love it more!! So cute and compact and super easy to use! With different settings for when it's cloudy or sunny, or you are inside!! Also comes with a selfie lenses so you know you're in the right spot!! Added bonus so you don't accidentally cut half your face off since we are all spoiled and used to front facing cameras now!! Embrace the challenge of mastering a new form of selfie!!","Love this so much. great to take with me to events. the photos are always super flattering and artsy looking. the white gets dirty however, so i would suggest getting a carrier case of some sort","Great!","I love this camera!!","2 out of 10 are duds. When you think you're saving money, you're actually not. But there's no way for us to know until the Polaroid is out.","Awesome!","I notice even while using the proper settings of my camera sometimes the lighting in the photos are dark or too bright. It gives the view of an old photo, though. I enjoy this camera and can't wait to take it to DisneyWorld to take pictures of the kids. I think they will enjoy this photo fun as well!","Great Price. Works great. and received it fast.","So fun for my 12 year old daughter!","I love this little camera!! We bought it for a wedding photo guestbook and everyone had fun using it with the props we bought. I'll definitely keep using it. It's so fun to give people a tiny Polaroid. The picture quality isn't amazing or anything, and I had to take a few crappy pictures before figuring out what lighting works, but the cuteness and entertaining qualities of the camera make it totally worth it.","I love it!!","Love it! The polaroids come out great and I love the fact that it is so portable and easy to use. The camera allows you to take great photos in all kinds of light and automatically adjusts for lighting conditions. I have it in raspberry and it's a gorgeous colour. The camera feels light in hand and works well.","I have had this camera a few months now and it is awesome! I used it when I was on vacation in with family and many more times. worked perfect for my scrap booking!<br />I really like this camera, though you must be careful with the photos you take, for the film is somewhat expensive. I recommend that you watch some tutorial videos first, it makes operating the camera much easier.","Great production of photos.  Fun color. Great for teenagers.","this was a very interesting idea. we all have phones that take nice pictures but frankly, nothing can come close to a picture that you hold in your hand.<br />and it works so well for instant results.<br />very nice camera, not the best of the best pictures but it works.","This camera takes great mini photos, images are clear, it also comes in many colors.  My daughter loves it!","This camera is amazing . I love it so much ??","Came really fast! Really cute and works good. Difficult instructions.","This product is great so far! I've taken these two photos.","Fun!!!!","Love this camera. It's fun and perfect for guest book ideas. Been used for 2 different parties and maybe a wedding in July. It's awesome and my 6 year old loves it too. Easy to use and figure out.","Pros: You get your pictures instantly, you get to keep the memory it's cute  and it's very affordable too.<br />Cons: Since it's only $60, the quality that it produces is not so good. A lot of the times, the pictures are very dark so you have to play around and adjust the settings. If you room is really bright, the picture is going to come out super dark.(don't make that mistake like I did). I always follow the setting that it suggested but to be honest, it doesn't work most of the time.","I absolutely love it","love this camera took so many pics with it had it for about 2 months","Very cute but wished it took better pictures. But they will do what ai need to use them for","Top","Very neat little camera.  Just remember to get in close as the pictures are small.","Everything about it is great!","It was great","Awesomeness just like the old Polaroid camera I used to have.","Loved it so much!","Bought this about a month ago but just ended up using it before a concert I went to. It works great, the quality of the photos are great, can't believe this toy looking camera would have so much detail. We took photos in the hotel and the first you take is the plastic cover that comes out like a photo. The second picture is the first one from the film. The directions is in Chinese so was unsure of what setting to use. Picture from the bathroom came out very dark then switched setting to cloudy I believe and worked better. Wish it came in English of what settings to use for what. But nice camera. The flash on the photo is from my phone to show you what it looked like.","I am absolutely in love with this camera! Plan to take it everywhere I go. I mainly got this camera to capture college memories and to have them instantly. The film can get rather expensive, but I bought a boundle pack of film of 60 for $30 off Amazon. If you are interested in starting a Polaroid collection I would start with this camera. Although the film is expensive it's cheaper than the actual polariod brand film.","I bought this for my teenage niece. She absolutely loves it. Easy to use and the camera color turned out to be perfect. She takes it everywhere she goes.","Amazing this is my favorite thing ever! Great for scrap booking!","I absolutely love this camera! I got it to use at a bachelorette party so that the bride could have an instant album printed of the night! We then added scrapbook word stickers to each page as the night went on and put each photo into a little album. The bride absolutely loved it! I ended up using it a second time for another bachelorette with the same excitement. My kids love that the pictures come our right away and think its fun to have them to hold on to or give to someone. I wish the film was cheaper, but still think its totally worth it.","Gave this to my 10 year old for her bday.  She LOVES it!  It takes small pictures, about half the size of the classic polaroid I remember.  But it's a cool throwback for the next generation.  Film is a bit expensive, about $1 per picture, but I think I remember it always being that way.  Anyways its pretty cool and my daughter loves it.","everything was fine I didn't have any problems","Ive only had this for about a month and a half and I took it to Disneyland with me and I was ready to take a whole bunch of photos but when I took one, the film wouldnt come out but the number was going down. So I took one more and it still wouldnt come out. I turned it off and on again and took another one, and it finally came out but the picture was really messed up and it was kinda disappointing. Don't know why that happened.","Great birthday present for a love one!","picture quality","i love this thing. i just wish i didn't have to change the cartridge after every 10 shots.","good","I love this camera! I use it alot, and the pictures always come out very vintage looking. Sometimes blurry, but it adds polaroid character! It can be hard to hold on to, and I dropped it once. The side was damaged but luckily it still worked. I highly recommend a case for it!!","Sooooo cute!!! I love the pastel colors and feel of the hard plastic is so good. The size is kinda bulky, so be warned! For 70 dollars this is definitely worth for this product since it comes with some many extras, including  a extre lens.","I LOVE THIS","Worked great for my wedding photo booth. I got two for a back up but didnt need to use it. The colors do turn out dark but it worked out for what I was going for. For clearer photos I recommend getting additional lighting if using at night.","We bought this for our daughter's 10th birthday and she loves it!!!","one of my daughters favorite things!","Color is pretty much exactly as it looks on amazon.com.  The camera was bigger than I expected because I knew the photos were credit card size but that doesn't change my opinion of the actual camera.","somewhat heavy ;(","Awsome","Super cute!!!","This camera is absolutely amazing!! I bought the kit and I love it! It takes great pictures and it has different lenses for inside, outside, light, and bright.  I highly recommend this camera if you want something fun to do with friends and to take great pictures.","Fun to take pictures at parties.  Kinda have to get use to the viewfinder--- tricky to see through and turning it sideways makes for better landscape photos.","This camera is awesome. The exposures are always spot on when you use the recommended setting. I owned the Instax Wide 210, it was garbage the exposures were terribly inconsistent, plus it was a pain to always have to change the focusing distance. This is just a painless point and shoot camera. And I like the size of the exposures. They're smaller but more cost effective and just as fun. The camera itself is a plasticky toy but, the results are great for parties or family photos.","Obsessed!  Great product.  Very happy with my purchased","First Polaroid camera and have to say this is way cooler than I expected. So glad it was my first pick!","Very nice","So much fun!! My 13 year old loves it. Pretty good quality photos.","I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it so it really is her review.  I've seen the pictures that she has taken and they are wonderful.","This is so much fun to use! It was great idea for birthday party I threw. It wasn't very helpful the instructions, however, because I didn't have much time to read plus it was mainly in another language, I think Chinese. I just found video on youtube on how to use, however, and it's very simple to use.","Ordered for my daughter and she loves it!! You don't \"shake it like a Polaroid picture\" like the older versions of this camera. Just point and shoot and a few seconds later your picture develops.","Got this for my granddaughter.  She loves it.  Have already had to go for more film.","great quality cane fast happy:)","So cute!","as seen as picture shown, so cute!","Exactly what it is, a fun plastic camera.","I love it","My son loves it and he is 3! It's fantastic. He has no idea what pics are because everything is now stored on phones and computers so to see his face after he takes a pic and to be able to see the pic develope instantly is so fun to watch.","i bought this camera for my nieces 21st bday and she loves it.  it's a very cute color too","Adorable","excellent","Bought this for my 10 year old niece for her birthday. VERY EASY to set up and operate. Loved the optional packs that were offered to go with this as well. Camera arrived with batteries to my surprise, so we didn't have to make a trip out to get those.<br />Great purchase and will definitely remember for future gifts!","Bought it as a gift for my sister, and she really liked it!","Perfect camera","I'm in love with my polaroid camera. I'm so glad I purchased this.","Present for my niece. She loves it!","Very good it came without film so you need to buy some but I love this soooooo much highly recommend it.","Excelent !! I loved it","love it","i love my camera! no complaints! takes great pictures, it just took me a while to get used to the settings on the camera to take the perfect pictures.","Very pleased!","I've been wanting this camera for the longest time. I finally got it for my birthday and I love it! Best birthday gift ever, everyone should get it.","I bought the camera and all of the accessories as a gift.  Unfortunately it didn't work.  Now that they have replaced it, it works great and my daughter is always snapping pictures!","My daughters loves her camera.  Works great!","Best Polaroid camera out there love the many Polaroids very kid friendly my kids have a blast taking pictures of one another would recommend to anyone quality excellent","Received this as a gift and popped a pack of film in immediately. I had watched TONS of YouTube videos about this camera and wanted to practice with it because I had heard that sometimes the photo comes out off center. I did not have that problem. I took a few pictures both vertically and horizontally and the photo was perfectly centered for what I saw in the view finder. I absolutely loved the quality of the photos too. This camera is easy to load and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone who is in the market for an instant film camera. It will not be replacing my DSLR, but I am taking my family to Disney this year and it will be PERFECT for autograph book photos.<br /><br />I do recommend getting in close to the subject of the film. The far away pictures still come out well, but the up close ones are just stunning.","Perfect!!!!","Everyone should have one of these, just note it does not come with the film! It prints and develops fast and it's very cute and when youre not using it you can display it on a shelf since its so aesthetically pleasing :)","[[VIDEOID:36a07c9ccee4c1709f856144380e63ae]] My top 5 \"loves.\"<br />- Instant photo within 3 mins!<br />- Super easy to use.<br />- Durable, plastic body held up in traveling.<br />- Somewhat expensive film, but worth it having the instant photo.<br />- Light sensor is accurate and compensates accordingly.<br /><br />For reference, I also bought these and they worked wonderfully:<br />Fujifilm INSTAX Mini Instant Film Twin Pack (White)<br />Fujifilm Instax Mini Instant Film, 10 Sheets of 5 Pack × 2 (100 Sheets)<br /><br />5/5 stars.","I got this for fast, fun, and informal pics for parties and events and it's been perfect in that regard. Plus, it's damn good looking and works like a charm.","I got this camera as a gift for my daughter and it's already a favorite. Lots of precious memories. LOVE IT.","Love it.","A fun, easy to use camera with exciting results.","I purchased this camera for my daughter as a birthday gift, she is 13 now.<br /><br />She really likes this camera mind you it's not like my Cannon Rebel or even my iPhone 6splus camera but for a teenager it's perfect.<br /><br />The kids love watching the pictures fade in much like the old Polaroid camera I owned as a kid. It's like magic for my 5 year old granddaughter watching the picture appear.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can think of is the pictures are much better in brighter light. The flash is just not that bright.","the product arrived in perfect condition","I bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday present and she is in love with it! She likes how simple it is. Good buy!","Love ir !","This camera is awesome and easy to use however it often has small issues such as printing blanks and the pictures coming out very light, to the point where half the photo is just white. The photos taken in darker settings come out amazing though","Fun camera!  Works well.  Looks great!","Love the camera! Fun to use!","I have always wanted a polaroid camera and I absolutely love this newer version. It's light and compact enough that I can take it anywhere. It's perfect for capturing memories since I often forget to get my photos printed. This way I don't have to remember!","Awesome camera. Great for anyone who scrapbooks. Got as a part of a bday for my fiancé. She loved it.<br />Make sure you buy plenty of film! ","Gift item, really.  But fun.  Film cost a bit.","good","Great","I got this as a gift for a 6-year-old. She absolutely loved it!  I bought the instant film pack and the 7 in 1 instanx mini to complete the set.<br />It was easy for her to use after providing minimum instructions.","I love this, I always take pictures.","I love this product its amazing ","I love this camera - color is gorgeous (more of a coral than the raspberry pink shown in picture). It is super easy to use, but if you don't have your camera on the right setting, it will be either washed out or way too dark. I'm giving this 5 stars because I just got it a week ago so I'm figuring the minor problems I'm having are just because I'm a beginner :)","Have only used it inside so far and the automatic lighting setting has worked perfectly. Can't wait to see how it works outside, I have the instax wide and I have to say it doesn't always take the perfect photo.","I just received the camera and I am in love with it. It was really easy to figure out. I used it instantly and the picture came out great. I wish the picture would be a bit smaller but this way is also great since I do a photo book for my son. The pictures are small enough to fit many on one page. The best part is that I don't have to wait an hour at Walgreens to print a picture or several. I hope that it does last and it is not some cheap camera.","I love this camara. I use it for special moments with family and friends","Included in the package:<br />/Strap<br />/Instruction manuals<br />/a pair of batteries<br />/the camera<br />One review said it came with a close up lens, but it does not, sadly :( Also, the strap cannot adjust. As in, you cannot make it tighter or looser, which is a downside in case it slips.<br /><br />It's easy to insert film (which you have to buy separately) and came on time. I can't wait to use it! I saw one of my friends with it and it takes very cute, neat pictures so I thought I should get one too. Some of her pictures turn out really bright/white though, so settings will have to be played around with. The instruction manual kind of guides you on what settings to use depending on the lighting/background.<br />There was no damage to the box or the camera. The  camera is easy to use and is compact enough to fit in my small hand. It's light and lean, but since I got a powder blue camera I have to be careful not to get it dirty. True to picture and descriptions!<br />I used to have the Polaroid land instant camera and it was large and bulky plus the film was expensive. I was happy to get the Fujifilm instax 8 camera. The credit card sized pictures are cute and can be decorated around the edges. There are also many accessory kits available for this model camera.","Daughter loves!","The half pack of film do not work! I I don't know what's wrong?","Bought this for my daughter's 11th birthday. She loves it! Couldn't be happier! Good price compared to others we've seen.  I do want to mention that we had horrible delivery though. We used same day delivery and the driver was terrible. He actually throws the box at our door.","Thank you","Super cute and easy to use. Look up videos if you know nothing about how to work one of these or for some tips, there are incredibly helpful ones on youtube! I have been wanting one of these for so long, and this price is unbeatable. Highly recommended. Can't wait to use this for my trip to Mexico in June. Happy shopping xx (:","Good seller, excellent product","Loved this camera, I got one as a gift, and then I decided to purchase this one for a friend and she loves it! The color of the camera is gorgeous and it works great!","Arrived on time and undamaged. Took it to the beach with me and it was able to withstand heat and sand without any damage. Takes super cute pictures that come out around the size of a credit card. Perfect for scrapbooking.","Gift for the special teen in our lives.  She loves this thing to death.  I was surprised to see it took nice quality mini pix.  I stocked her up on lots of Fuji film, so she can snap away.  Kind of nice for the teens, then they have something in addition to the digital photo.  I also got the accessory kit, so she was in teen heaven.  Much more compact than the old fashioned polaroids and ten times more fun to use.","I love my camera, I've taken it to many different cities across the country and love being able to physically document my trips. You only get one chance at a photo and it's really nice to have that aspect back in my life compared to all the technology out there.","Is a funny camera not such a good quality but ir works very well","Great and fun camera but I thought the color was going to be closer to pink but it's like a matte red.","It's so cute! I've had mine for almost a year now and the only problem is it turns yellow when it's dirty.","Awesome little camera!!","Bought this as a gift for my teenage niece. She loved it! She takes it everywhere and snaps pics of everything.","Love it??","My sister really likes it.  It was a perfect gift","My daughter LOVES this camera. The pictures come out better than the old Polaroid, in a more-rectangular shape. Quicker, too. The film is a little pricey but still less expensive than other brands.","Came in great condition and was easy to use. It even had batteries already in it. Just make sure you read the instructions before loading pictures so that you dont ruin the pack. Thanks","works well","My son likes it.","Nice","this one is such a cutie. i am glad that i picked the perfect color.","Love my new camera can't wait too capture amazing photos","great H24 capabilities. Optical dynamic focus comes in handy for streamlined filtered light. Q3 shutter technology has improved since the last series. Instax mini8 far greater from the original. The processor, shutter-fly speeds, dynamic handling, macro-filter all much improved. Here are some photos that show capabilities.","The camera works great and i love the little photos!!","I am so obsessed! this little thing is my new best friend! If you are thinking about buying it, you should totally buy it!","I spotted this camera in my local craft store but wasn't willing to buy it for the outrageous price in the store.  I love this little camera! When I was a kid, Polaroid instant cameras were all the rage so this version from Fujifilm is just as great. The battery cover comes on and off easily, loading the film is easy to do as well.  This is a nice little camera to have fun with. You can change settings whether you are indoors or outdoors, the camera actually suggests the setting to use.  The own downfall for this camera is that you have to keep in mind that the view finder is off to the right.  So while you may have your subject in the center through the finder you do have to compensate a little bit so that your subject is in the center when the film pops out at the top. Otherwise this is a great little camera to have especially for the trip down memory lane and also for those moments where you want to capture something right away and let people walk away with an instant memento.","LOVE IT","It didn't come with the film that it said it would, but it did arrive on time. A little disappointed.","I bought this to send pictures to my fiancé in marine corps boot camp and I love it! I'm going to use it at his graduation and our wedding! Only downside the film is so expensive!","Its cute and it does what I want. Things to note however! The pictures takes a minute to develope, they pop out white and blank. Don't assume its broken! also don't take pictures in the mirror, silly me did and have some lovely ruined film for my trouble.","Great gift, my grandaughter loves it","Love Love Love! Been wanting to by one forever and now I found it at a perfect price and even bundled it to get some film. Cute and didn't break my wallet!","I love it. it is so cute and picture quality is great! I would buy this again!","LOVED IT WORTH THE MONEY","Works great..my 13 year old loves it","Comes exactly as shown, color is satisfying.","Arrived as described, on time and in complete working order (took 3 photos so far). Attached a Kata strap (good quality choice) and plan to take it on my many adventures in the future! Light weight and super easy to use. This model has shooting features that are great for an instant camera! Who knew we could do so much with an instant mini? Loving it so far and I even got a few other people to purchaee their own!","Settings aren't working and I've had the camera for a very short amount of time. Disappointed.","Camera came in a timely manner; rather quickly and it looks just as described. The camera came in its original package along with batteries and a manual. (I only ordered the camera itself.) It's exactly what I needed but it's not vintage.","Perfect","Good","My daughter loved this.  You actually have to teach them how to take a picture by lining up things in the view finder...but she loved having the pictures right away.  We bought it for her birthday and she was able to give her friends pictures at the end of the party.","LOVE! Took this to Miami with me and made a bulletin board with pins thought the trio! Only downfall is it only holds 8 photos & you HAVE to adjust the lighting on the lense or your photo will be solid white!","I am very satisfied with the product. My daughters love it and use it regularly. Only wish the film (cartridges) were less expensive.","I love this little blue camera! I always get fascinated looks when using it and people always smile when they see the film come out right after the picture is taken. I gave it 4 stars as it is great but the device could have so many more improvements and I hope Fuji uses it's success to work on designs and concepts for the next version. Often times the sensor will change like crazy and one moment you are on the right one then the next you take the picture and it is overexposed or too dark. Also it is hard sometime to center the picture as the viewfinder is off to the side and not closer to the center but I always go based off the lenses, but for people not used to the camera they tend to be off the first few tries if you are trying to get them to take a photo for you. Overall great product, warning though the film is pricey so use it wisely.","Takes great photos and selfies!!!","Loved it!","Great idea for scrapbooking and easy to use! My daughter loved it!","Supper fast shipping.!!! Loved my camera & it came with film so pleased.!","It's so easy to use and enjoyable!","Adorable","Don't have to wait for film to come back, Perfect.","Bundle price was a great deal. Arrive at the front end of delivery schedule and pictures came out great","I'm in love with the camera, I wish the pictures were larger but they are ok. Also the color of the raspberry one is not like the one on the product pictures, is more like a coral color, it's reddish! I liked it anyway :)","Great instant photo camera for my 9 year old!  She loves it.","Works well and was a hit as a gift. Pictures it takes are neat.","Sent as a gift to my sister and she loved it. Picture quality one of the finest out there.<br />Easy to use and other decent colors available.","Super fast shipment and great product.","I fell in love with this camera as soon as I received it. The color is gorgeous and it is relatively easy to use. It's pretty compact however it is kind of tiring to carry around without a case. The film is also kind of on the pricey side but other than that it is a great device to own. I definitely recommend it.","I was given this camera as a gift and I absolutely loved it!!!!! The pictures come out wonderful and so detailed. I also really love the vintage look to this camera. If you're looking to buy one, definitely get this!! You will adore it.","Very cute! Once you get used to how to position the subject in the frame and make sure nothing important gets cut off - it's easy to use! I have a Mudder case with this and I love it.","very small, perfect for a gift!","What's a party without memories. Tons of fun!","My daughter loves this camera!","As good as shown","My daughter loved it","LOVE IT!!!","I bought this for my 7 year old who loves to take pictures and thought he should have a hardcopy of his own. The camera came within 2 days of my order and it was perfect. The pictures are clear and look great. The size is definitely not that of the Polaroid pics of my childhood but it's still a good size. He loves the camera so much and I find myself using it as well. Great purchase and will definitely be buying it again as gifts.","I love my camera!","Very nice little camera and quite a surprise for those too young to remember polaroid cameras.","Great camera! Not the best for landscapes but awesome for close ups and party pics","This camera is my new baby,  it's  so simple to use and has great  quality.  There are a few different settings that you can use.  The only downside is that the flash goes off no matter what setting you set it at,  but that is an easy  fix: just cover the flash up ad you're all set! Just a heads up,  the film, is a little  pricey,  but you can get it for a little  cheaper online.","Awesome! Thanks!","Pictures turn out great and I love the color!","great","Awesome item!!!","This camera is great. So much fun. this is the second one that I have purchased. The first was for myself and the second was a gift to a 17 year old. Very reminiscent of the old polaroids.","Easy to use and adorable.","Exactly as described","I love it ! was everything I expected ! :)","This camera is all what I was hoping it would be.  Easy to use , clear pictures and perfect size for my 8 year old niece.  This was a birthday gift to her and she loved it!  The film is a bit pricey, but I bought a four pack on Amazon and saved quite a bit of money that way.  My niece goes through lots of film!  It's been dropped more than a few times and has held up quite well.  I'm happy with the purchase.  I ended up buying another one.","Really love it","LOVEEE IT!! the yellow is such a cool faded shade!! Shipped and arrived fast, easy to use and works greaaaatttt!!! It exceeded all expectations!! 100% worth the money!!","This camera is life. I'm sooo happy to have purchased it. It was a steal as I know that in other stores such as Urban Outfitters sell it for 100+ tax... 55 sure isn't a problem for me. Anyway, I am extremely excited for this particular purchase because I had always wanted a polaroid but just now had the opportunity to get one. The camera is very cute and easy to handle; in addition, it's also very convenient and surprisingly simple to use. The film for it is a bit on the pricey side but worth it. Your pictures come out so nice and pretty. I definitely recommend this product for anyone who loves to take pictures and want your camera to look fun and adorable at the same time! I adore it and I think you will too.<br /><br />+ the shipping for this product only took a day... knowing I am an impatient person, this is such a great add on.","I got this as a gift for my boyfriend whose a photographer, and he loves it! Sometimes the photos come out a little overexposed, but you have to toy with it a little to get the perfect lighting. Since I got this product used, it was a little dented up and the lens cover is a little uneven. It still works great and is a very awesome, fun gadget!","It's cute, not top quality.","Obviously I'm spoiled by point and shoot cameras but I find it hard to get the right amount of lighting for a good photo. Something is always too dark or too light. Very fun novelty though. Great for handing a photo to a friend or stranger since they are already printed unlike other photos.","Yes","Excelent!","I love it","Absolutely love we it, it came really fast and Im really really greatful for that since I was going so San Francisco and wanted pics, awesome product thanks","as expected granddaughter loves it<br /><br />Hate the pricey film","Rtyuikhvnz??:-( ;-)","I love this camera","Great price and fun for the kids","Great product","Love this camera super cute!","excellent","Everything met my approval.","My 11 year old daughter loves her new camera.  It takes pretty good photos compared to the old polaroid cameras we had in the 80's.  It definitely feels like it is cheaply made.  I feel like if it gets dropped, it wouldn't survive.  It will be going on a trip shortly, so we will see if it comes back in one piece.","Amazing and cute -- works very well. Can't wait to take it on a few vacations this year.","Shipped quick, just as described, very happy with this purchase.  Thanks.","Fun and inexpensive","Im so stoked to start using thanks","takes wonderfull pictures","This is so fun best camera for clubbing or birthday parties.","awesome","Arrived on time, product exactly as described.","I love this camera so much! It is very durable and the quality is wonderful. I absolutely recommend this item to anyone thinking about an instant camera.","GREAT","Amaazing","Fabulous","Favorite camera. Hard to figure out the exposure settings, but you'll get it!","The end product of this item is good! It is easy to use and so pretty. It is lovely. I always wanted to have this!","Had this at my wedding and it was a lot of fun and easy to use.  Great quality pictures, just make sure you have the right setting on.","This is so cute. I have absolutely no complaints about this product. I's a little bigger than the mini 8. comes in such a cute bundle.","My younger daughter loves hers. Getting the older daughter one for her birthday. Very fun to use and the color is great!","Came exactly as pictured! Love the vintage look of the photos. Super light and easy to use","Got the camera this afternoon and it works awesome! :D I'm super stoked to bring this on vacations and hang outs with me and take polaroid worthy pictures. (:","This camera is amazing, works like a charm. I love the pink design. I brought it to a wedding and it was a hit! It does take some trial and error getting the lighting just right. I wish the image size was a standard Polarioid size, this is slightly smaller.","Great camera!","cute and easy to use.","Works perfectly!!! It is so great for my 9 year old!","I love this camera.","She loved this. It was late.","I love this instant camera! I use it all of the time! It's great quality and gives me so much joy!","Bought it for my little sister and she loves it!!!","Fun camara! Worth the buy! A little bulky but still pretty awesome! Takes cute picture and the quality is good. Just don't take pictures in the direct sunlight because it won't turn out as well!","I love this instax mini, I love it so much I bought the pastel yellow. Great cam!","Great size and color for teens! Super picts too!","Great color and easy to use.","This camera is honestly so cute. I ordered it 4 days ago and got here faster than expected (I live in Puerto Rico). The color is NOT a bright yello, it's a lot more pastel which I love. The only thing that I was upset about was the strap because it's not the polka dot one but the other on with the little plastic ball but I don't mind. It's perfect and really easy to use.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA OMFG!! SO GREAT!","Its a good product","It's really nice. Bought this for my daughter for her 12th birthday.","Got this for my friends baby shower!!! Loooooove it! Works great. Big hit!","Love it","Very nice clear lens and comes with batteries so that was nice ! Only thing missing is the film ! Cute little camera I got it for my hubbys birthday","Awesome. My 9 year loves it for instant prints of pictures she takes.","it's cute and fun to use, but the film gets expensive if you get carried away - i think this is a great idea for scrapbooking, it gives a retro and fun look, but just for everyday use - then no, your phone is better!","Cute camera.. trendy.. my 8 year old loves it. I recommend getting a case for it. we did.","I LOVED IT!","Reminds me of the Polaroid cameras I grew up around, but the pictures are photo booth size. Makes for a great novelty item.","daughter loves it. She wanted this for her birthday and as soon as she got it she was snapping away. pictures everywhere!","What else can I add to all the good reviews....it is a great fun camera. It takes credit card size pictures. Gotta play with it for a bit, not every single picture turns out great, but overall I'm happy.","Amazing photo quality and really cute camera","Maddy loves her Polorid camera.","This little Mini * FugiFilm Instax Camera was a huge hit at my daughters birthday party. I actually bought this as a gift for her for her Birthday and everyone there went nuts over it along with her.<br /><br />This camera is small and uses the instax mini FujiFilm which is so cute, they are fun size photos that are perfect to carry in your purse or wallet. She actually sent a photo of herself with her daddy when he went on a fishing trip for good luck.<br /><br />This Camera is perfect for kids and adults as well. I actually bought some accessories to go with this and they make the whole photography experience so fun.<br /><br />It is really easy to use, your film comes out instantly and that is one of the other things that makes this camera so great. Once the picture comes out you will need to let it develop which takes no time at all.<br /><br />There is a dial on the front of the camera to get accurate settings for what your are taking pictures of. There is a flash on this cute little camera and it produces nice clear photos.<br /><br />At first i thought this was a little pricey but i am so happy i decided to go ahead and purchase this, it is one of her most prized pieces and i will add she has a cell phone and game systems but takes better care of this than any of those. Great buy!","We bought this for our 7 year old daughter on her birthday. She loves it. It's easy to use and she gets the benefit of seeing her photo right away. Nice color too.","so good","Kids love it, age 11.<br /><br />Complaints they had:<br />-no manual in the box.<br />-high cost instant film.<br />-just decent pictures.","Loved everything about this product so cool and cute","I love this camera. My niece has one that we bought locally. After playing with hers, I had to get one for myself! It's durable and stands up to my toddler carrying it around the house (I don't let her take pics), and has gone on several outings. I purchased on Amazon because the price couldn't be beat! Was able to buy the camera and film on Amazon for the same price as just the camera locally. The photo processing is similar to what it was back in the day, except no need to shake the pic:)","The end product of this item is good! It is easy to use and so pretty. I like the outside appearance even its usage and product. It is lovely. I always wanted to have this!","Really cool camera, but it's SO hard to take a quality photo. I have tried all of the different settings, and my pictures come out extremely overexposed or way too dark. It's almost impossible to take a good picture outdoors. Indoor pictures turn out better, but still not great. It's a shame because the camera itself is really cute and fun, but unfortunately it doesn't take good photos.","This camera is SO very retro fun.  My elementary-aged kids have never experienced a Polaroid, so this was incredibly unique to them!  Amazing that you get a picture right there!  The quality is that of an 80's Polaroid, so don't expect perfection, but for the novelty we love it.  The film can get expensive, but a three-pack outlasted the kid's attention span for several weeks.","Super cute! Whenever I use it around kids they all want one, lol. Heck, so do their parents! Easy to use, comes in different colors, and so much fun! :)","It's a different experience taking pictures that you instantly get to hold and share with physical friends. The camera is well made and designed. The quirky look and color encourage a playful mood for snapping shots. The lighting sensor is great, and having to manually switch the setting lends to the creative process of crafting that perfect print.","It's nice to have the pictures come out instantly, but the turning piece in the front that helps with the lighting doesn't really work. If I turn it, it doesn't change to the setting it is supposed to. Also better on not so sunny days, I tried to take a picture at the zoo, and all I got was a white picture because it was too bright and I couldn't change the settings or anything.","I've always wanted a poloriod camera, and this was the best gift to myself. I love the little pictures that comes out or it. It's also a comfortable hold in the hand. I would totally buy this for someone","Loved it!!!","Love it","Nice camera","I was VERY pleased with my camera. It takes wonderful pictures and is very easy to use.","You don't really realize how small the pictures really are.","My girlfriend loves this!","It's been great so far can't really take photos from a distant but it's still good. My daughter was very happy she got it for Easter.","just received this product using FREE ONE DAY SHIPPING!! As soon as i got my instax i FELL IN LOVE with it. Definitely a great buy. DO NOT buy the instax from urban outfitters or free people. Just know that the color is  LITTLE MORE GREEN THAN BLUE so i would recommend some stickers to put on your instax to personalize it. I used \"Kiss my patch\" stickers which are super cute patch stickers. Really would recommend this product.","Cute camera and a classic to have at parties. Everyone loves a polaroid","Love it","My daughter is having so much fun with this camera! And I love the blue color.","I love this product. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend but after receiving it in the mail and taking it out of its packaging I fell in love with it. For a relatively cheap product it is excellent quality that feels good in your hands and is very easy to operate. It came with two double AA batteries that are simple to put in and for an additional cheap price it came with two 10 picture cartridges that are easy to install. I would recommend buying the case for this product, not because its flimsy or not put together well but because it would be such a shame to see such a valuable product damaged. This is an all around great product that is great as a gift or for anyone interested in casual photography. I give this product five stars.","Definitely an amazing purchase. Love the color and it takes pictures very clearly. I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!","nice camera. no problems what so ever","Great Camera for kids or adults. The film can get expensive but my kids love taking pictures with friends They have so much fun with it. Good price for camera.","I have always wanted an Fuji instant camera. For the cost this little thing is amazing. In the right lighting it can take some very wonderful shots. I'm still playing around with it but I'm very pleased with it so far. It did not disappoint, so glad I decided to finally buy one!! :)","Beautiful !!!!","Glad I purchased it can't wit to actually use it!","My daughter loves it. Picture quality is as expected for something like this. It would be nice if the pictures were a little bigger. Don't expect the same size as old polaroids. These are about half the size and film is expensive at about $1/picture. Fun novelty item or gift for a teen.","My niece loves this camera! Good quality and so much fun to use!","great","Cute and quirky.  Requires some practice to get a good photo which is normal. The pics are smaller than I expected but adds to the charm and overall fun.","i love the color of this one. it looks nice and has nice quality. great find!","So much fun","it looks nice in actual and i really love the quality. great find indeed.","This is such a fun camera. My daughter loves it and it actually takes nice pictures.","xmas gift","We bought this camera for our daughter for her birthday.  She LOVED it!  The camera is so cute and fun to use.  All you have to do is put batteries in it and the film and you are ready to go!  It is so small it is easy for her to take to any event.  Her friends have fun using it too!<br /><br />This is a great present to buy for those \"hard to buy for\" girls.  I think any elementary and junior high age girl would love this!<br /><br />If you found my review helpful I would greatly appreciate it if you could mark this review as helpful! Thank you!! :)","So cute and just as I expected! Still working on lighting for the best picture quality but nonetheless I'm happy with my purchase. Look around for pricing. After purchasing I did see it cheaper elsewhere. Not on Amazon but a retail store. Regardless I love my new camera.","Birthday gift for granddaughter. She loves it.","Love","Purchased this for a photo booth and it was a HUGE hit!","I love the camera, but unfortunately the strap is missing.","Love This Camera , Takes Great pictures, AWESOME!!!","Love it.","Works great, my wife loves it!","Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend over Christmas, and it works amazing!","Very cute and good quality. My wife's friend love it.","My daughter absolutely loves this camera. Bought for her 13th birthday. Pairs really well with the camel colored carrying case!","I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she claims that she loves it. I have used it multiple times and have a couple of complaints. When taking photos inside, this camera works really well and takes good pictures. If your outside and it is sunny or at least a little sunny, the camera can not take good photos. They are always washed out no matter what setting you are on. You can barely get an image on the \"super sunny\" setting. I think polaroids are awesome, but I don't think this one is something I would buy again or even recommend.","works great","Camera did not work correctly and wasted two rolls of film. But, returned easily and quick to give credit.","Fun camera.  Some younger kids are amazed with the instant picture that pops out. Very fun","Amazing and loving it.....","Great camera my daughter loves it!!!","as described quick shipping","My daughter loves this camera. But it's over priced and the film is outrageously expensive. I just paid 65 for the camera and two days later it's 55.","Fantastic color & quick shipping! Takes really fun pictures to share with friends. Does not come with film, so make sure you order a package or two of that as well!","My son used this camera in Ecuador when he went on a mission trip. He stated that it was the right size, and the picture came out beautiful. When he returned home, he was absolutely correct. The pictures were amazing. I will recommend this product to anyone, especially when space is a concerned.","I've always had instant cameras, whether it's a Polaroid or an old land camera so I was really happy when Fuji came out with these! There's settings for different light settings, and it's easy to use","Fantastic camera!","Such a cute camera loveeeee the color it's light weight and sleek. Easy to operate and gives the vintage look of photos I've been looking for. Definitely a must have product!","Great camera for a great price. The quality is also really good.","Great product. Love my camera","I can't give much a review on how well it works yet as I just got it but I'm a little disappointed in the color. I ordered raspberry thinking it was a dark pink but it is not. It's red. Very red. Wish I had known that or I would have ordered the lighter pink one.","Fun little camera!","this one looks really cute in actual. i love the quality and the texture of it. awesome find indeed.","So much fun :) love it","Just got this today, so can't review on how good it holds up, but I really like it so far! Seems easy to operate and easy instructions with pictures on loading.  It came with batteries (which is cool, didn't notice it said that in the description) The color is deff more of a red than pinkish how it looks on the picture, unfortunately (well, unless you love red!).  I was thinking from the picture it was more of a deep rose pink, really it just seems nearly red, to me. Oh, well, still happy :) :)","Wonderful camera! Comes with easy instructions to get started and tons of fun to use!","It's a modern day Polaroid.....fills a niche","I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She has had no issues with it at all. We use rechargeable batteries in it because it will go through batteries with heavy use. On a side note, what I don't like is the cost of the film and would have liked this to have been a digital camera, so keep that in mind when deciding on this camera but it has nothing to do with how it works. It takes very good pictures from my perspective and that is this is a child's toy camera.","I have no idea why my wife wanted this, but she did and I got it for her as a gift. Pictures must be taken in near perfect lighting conditions to come out nicely. I'm sure the novelty will wear off of this soon and it'll find its way to the bottom of the junk drawer.","My daughter had to have this for her 11th birthday. An instant camera... really? Well she's had to have many things before but this is something she seems to love. After almost a year, It's been on two vacations with us and on many outings. Her bedroom walls are filled with Polaroids taken with her favorite camera. She says she rates this 5 stars.","I absolutely love my instax mini, it's very easy to use! I love the color I got mine in the raspberry color and it is beautiful. There is a small light that indicates what setting you should be on to take your photo so it makes the process that much easier. I bought a case to go along with my camera as well and it fits snugly. The case brand is also fujifilm. The film for this camera can get expensive but I think it is completely worth it.","Been eyeing these cameras for a while. I'm re-doing my room and I want to make a Polaroid photo board of all my favorite people, places, and things. Got this for about $60. Love the color and how simple it is to use.<br />I mean, the film is expensive as can be, but you should know and accept that before buying an instant camera anyway. :)","Very easy to use and takes high quality pictures.","As expected; wonderful and fun. Much better price than in stores. Love it!","???????¯???*?*Excellent product! 5?s! SUPER FAST s/h! Thank you*?*?*???????¯??","I love this camera!! In fact love isn't a strong enough word","Love the color!","My 12 year old daughter has wanted one for a very long time, and I purchased it for her for her last birthday. Very competitive pricing which is always a bonus. Seems durable and seems to be high quality.<br />I personally do not like how small the pictures are, they seem slightly pointless to me. But my daughter likes it, it's the 'cool' thing to the kids!","Purchased for my daughter. She loves the instant photos and quality is fairly good.","My friend loved it! it just sucks you have to buy the film separate which is pretty expensive.","cute and fun, but a little cheaper than I expected.  It was fun for the grandkids, but they need supervision so they won't break it.  The film is a bit pricey.","I love these little cameras! I have gifted two of them already to some friends, and they are equally as in love with them!<br /><br />The blue color displayed in the photos is identical to the actual color of the camera. So far, my friends have had no complaints regarding how well the cameras work. Mine is a different color, but since that's just a cosmetic difference, I'll give my personal opinion of my camera.<br /><br />Ease of Use: 4/5 This camera is SO easy to use. While the gist of it is \"point and shoot\", you may find that your photos are slightly un-centered and off to the left if you solely rely on viewing through the viewfinder. A helpful tip I've mentioned to my girlfriends is that when you think your photo is centered perfectly, adjust your camera ever so slightly to the right, and they will turn out beautifully! Also, make sure to adjust the lighting settings to whatever the camera prompts you to select. If you forget to do this, your photos will almost definitely turn out too dark, or overexposed - and film is NOT cheap!<br /><br />Set Up: 5/5 Super easy to set up. Literally all you do is insert the included batteries. Reading the instructions is very helpful when you're inserting your film for the first time, so make sure you don't throw them away!<br /><br />Price for Quality: 5/5 This camera is worth every penny. It's the cheapest by far on Amazon. While it's also sold at Michael's and Urban Outfitters, they'll charge you upwards of $100/$200, when you can easily buy it online for less. This camera is an investment. Buying film will be the most costly part of owning it, but if you hunt around and compare prices, you can easily find packs of film that save you a few bucks.<br /><br />I adore this camera. Since owning it, I've found that I'm much more selective when taking photos. I won't just take pictures of random things anymore since the film only comes in packs of 10 sheets. I love that the photos print right away, and they're so easy to display and give to people. My camera is always a hit at parties and when we're on vacations. It saves me from having to use up my phone battery while constantly taking pictures, which is definitely a plus! It's very small, and not at all a nuisance to carry around. I purchased a case for it, and have purchased the same cases as an included gift with their cameras. I definitely recommend buying yourself a case and an attachable selfie mirror to go along with this camera!","At first I was displeased because it was not working, but to my luck I got it working. Now I'm super excited and extremely happy with my Fujifilm camera.","This camera is the best! Got it just in time for Easter weekend. Definitely recommend this product!!!!!","I love it so much .","I got this as a present for my birthday and it is so much fun. My friends love me taking their pictures with it. The film can get a little pricey considering that it only comes with 10 but this isn't exactly a camera that you use on the daily, more for special or fun occasions.","Im feel so good with it I love it","I'm so glad to see that they brought back the instant camera.  This was a gift and the recipient was so pleased.  I checked out all the different brands and decided that fujifilm was my best choice. And it does take great pictures.  I chose white and the camera itself had a good \"feel\" to it.  Nice quality and takes really good pictures.  I wish the photos were just a bit larger though.  Of course, the camera would probably be larger too.  We like the compact size.","Too exspecive for something this small and crappy, it's very slippery when you try and hold it. Didn't have th color I wanted in stock....film is very exspecive...hard to find the film in the stores","It came a week early! and was in amazing condition. I absolutely love it and can't wait to take prom pictures with it!","I really like the camera per se, but the specific one that I received had signs of wear. The compartment where the film is placed does not lock completely, which does not affect the performance but it looks awful in a brand new camera. It also had little (but annoying) black stains that I couldn't take away. I am not taking away more stars, even though I should, because the camera is just awesome and I've taking photos like crazy. It reminded the materiality of traditional photography, which is something that we tend to ignore due to digital photography. Being able to look at the process of the chemical record of the light in these photographs is so interesting and fun. I am currently writing one chapter of my doctoral dissertation on analogue photography, so this camera has been the best idea for my procrastination time. Overall, I recommend the product but not the seller.","The best purchase that I've done so far!","I love it! The only downside was film isnt included but i bought it separately. Its so cute and love the color i recommend this too others who want one.","So I just got my camera yesterday and took it out to the park. I really love it. I have a Polaroid 600 camera that I was using before, but this compared to that is so much nicer. The camera itself has a fresh, clean and easy to use look to it. The instructions come in a ton of different languages, but English was easy to find and were simplified in easy how to instructions. Polaroid 600 was a thrifted camera and it was hard to get used to. The insta max camera includes a wrist strap which made the camera easy to carry around tha park. The Polaroid 600 is a neck strap which hurts after an hour. Once I took an insta max photo it came out quietly and quickly. Polaroids always came out loudly. Also with my Polaroid camera it was always a hit or miss with the quality of the photos, but my insta max mini has given me nothing but great ones. I'm very glad I made the swap from that camera to this one. It's will defiantly be on me at all times.","HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A YEAR NOW. LOVE IT SO MUCH! ALTHOUGH THE FILMS ARE EXPENSIVE, BUT STILL WORTH IT!","Love it! Even when my dog moved while I took the picture it wasn't blurry.","Got this for my mother for mothers day I know she is going to love it thank you :)","Great camera, but all the instructions come in Japanese,  my daughter had to watch a few youtube video to make sure she was installing the film right the first time.","Came way earlier than expected and was undamaged. Camera works great.","10 yr. old Daughter loved instant photos","Awesome and fun little camera- super fast shipping too!","love it","This little camera is so cute and perfect for tweens!","Absolutely cool camera, bought it for simple use. Surprised how much fun me and the gf have had with it. I havent purchases the special film with designs but the standard gives a classic look.<br /><br />Turns on kinda simple, one push button. Took a second for me to realize that the different lighting options are on the lens. The camera senses the lighting and lights up the most appropriate option.<br /><br />Side notes: Photos are ruined if the flash reflects of a window. Runs on Double AA, insert the film and leave it closed because the \"PHOTOS REMAINING\" counter resets when the flap opens. You cant upload photos online, weird right? But kinda awesome if you dont want people to see them.","I absolutely LOVE this camera. Super cute, easy to use. Does not come with film, you have to buy that desperately. Great buy, a little expensive but its overall a great camera & gift!!! Totally would recommend.","I absolutely love my Instax! The pictures are cute and vintage looking... Perfect for scrap booking! I take it with me on trips and special occasions and then post my pictures on a corkboard. One downside is the pictures are kind of small but that's not a problem unless you have more than three or four people in the photo. Found out a few days ago how durable this camera was. I forgot it was in my backseat and a bunch of muddy rowdy kids stepped all over it. I just wiped it off and it worked perfectly fine. I highly recommend it's worth the buy!","Brought this for a gift in the end wanted it for myself. Pictures are really great!!! Amazing camera!!!","So amazing and cute love love love it. It came super fast and was such a great price. I wanted one for the longest time and was going to buy one at urban outfitters for $100 so glad I looked around first. Definitely satisfied. Will definitely be buying more as gifts.","In love with my camera!!","I love this camera! For a reasonable price, I think that this camera works great and is very fun to use. I've traveled with it (so I do wish it was slightly smaller) but still fits fine in a large bag. I didn't purchase any case or protective gear for it, and it is still perfectly intact. The quality of the photos is great. I didn't read any of the instructions and figured out how to use it (but probably could learn more about some of the features), so overall pretty foolproof. I like that this particular model is popular enough that you can find a lot of other accessories out there (leather sleeves, photo albums, wood picture holders, etc.). It's really fun to use and I like the white color, which hasn't gotten dirty yet, despite all my travel and throwing it into the main compartment of large purses. Would recommend this.","This camera is absolutely AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! The picture quality is far better than I expected. The camera is a good size, fits in my hand perfectly. It is easy to use. It has different settings, for outside and inside,","good","I like it but only downfall is that if your outside and there's even the slightest of light, the pictures come out bright!!","So cuuute!","Works fine and I love how it looks!","This camera has been so much fun so far. I used it on Easter, I use it casually, I use it for anything and everything. It's great for the lazy scrapbooker like myself who does not have time for printing :)","My 13yo daughter got this and loves it. The pictures are smaller than the old polaroids, but cool. She did buy a case to go with it. It does seem durable. The film is pricey though. Overall, Amazon had the best price for a cool blast from the past.","Films expensive , quality of photos very questionable. Other than that, good.","Love","Picture quality is awesome! I LOVE this product","sensitive to light, so you have to be sure and not be in too bright of a room when taking pics.","Bought it for my grand daughter and we had so much fun using it. Pictures are really good.","great price fast delivery good quality  present for my 7 y/o granddaughter, nice starter camera, but film is expensive","Got this for my daughters 11th birthday. She loves it! Being able to have a print right away is amazing to her. It is a good quality camera and other than explaining to her what the settings should be in different types of lighting, there has be no difficulty. And that is only minor.","I've had these kind of cameras since I lived in Japan 13 years ago.  I love them, so much fun.  However, this one has options for exposure that don't seem to be accurate so kind of go with your instinct.","The product is great. Just what I expected.","My gf lovedd it!!","It's perfect!!","The Fuji film is awesome! Great quality!!","A little pricy for a piece of plastic. But she likes that the pics print out right away. Although the size of the pics is much to be desired.","For a Polaroid it is not bad.  Pictures are small,put the kids love it","Excelent","Absolutely love this camera! Very durable! I've dropped this camera once and still worked great!! A little tricky to get the hang of but over all the camera itself is wonderful! Definitely recommend for any photography lovers like me! Really captures the moment","awesome camera my kiddo loved it and used all the film the first day, easy to use easy to reload film.","Very fun camera for a teenager.","Fast delivery, I ordered this 2 nights ago and it already came in even with free ground shipping! The camera is so cute, can't wait to try it out!","Really awesome camera and much fun. Buying film isn't though. But that's how instant cameras are. Still awesome","My daughter is in love with this camera. We purchased it for her for her 8th birthday. While I wish there was more film in each pack to take pics. this camera is absolutely amazing and brings me back to my childhood with poloraid cameras.","WELL THANKS FOR YOUR HELP MY DAUGHTER IS HAPPY,","Works great and my daughter loves it","Gave as a gift, she LOVES it.","Awesome product","It's cute but turns yellow over time...","Not good for outdoor pictures in bright light or pictures from a distance. Works very well for indoors, up close pictures","Fun","Worked perfectly and has great pictures!!","This camera is adorable and it was a great price.","My 10 year-old daughter loved this whole combo - the camera, the case, the film.","Very satisfied with product.","Ordered for my daughter for Christmas. Came in plenty of time. Camera  was exactly how advertised! Very nice camera and worked very well.","I got this as a gift for my 9yr old daughter. She loves it. To me the pictures look great remember it's a polaroid.","Awesome","Great camera! My sister loved it.","DIG MY MINI 8","perfect size.","i got this one for my eldest who is 13 years old and she really love the color. got another in pink and gave it to my youngest who is 8.","Cute little camera for a great price. It's definitely such a great experience being able to capture once-in-a-lifetime moments and being able to keep a physical copy instantly. The only con is that the pictures are on the small side, though they are still cute. They are perfectly wallet sized! Easy to use camera & easily portable, I love it!","We were satisfied , it made my daughter happy... I thought I was getting the instax for 59$ no shopping and I paid $71.04... Not sure what I was charged for.??","Very great camera for kids. Produces high quality photos!","Bought this for my 15 yr old. She loves it. It's easy to use. Pictures have a cool, vintagy look to them.","Pictures look great when indoors, not so great when outdoors. Have attempted to search the Internet to see find a fix or to see what I might of done wrong, but have yet to find a solution.","My granddaughter loved it!","Came right on time. I love this thing. Just remember to order film when you buy it. The best prices are on Amazon for film. Easy to use and great for parties.","Seems like a bit of a novelty item but my wife and I love it. The settings are easy to use, especially if you havent used a film camera since you were a preteen like me.","Good camera my wife really wanted one. She likes it. Just wished it came with a packed of film.","This is so fun to use","I bought this for my best friend and she absolutely loved this!! It came in perfect condition and brought 2 double a batteries thanks!","Amazing ","Muy buena","It's a fun and cute little gadget! It's easy to learn but the pictures are a bit small. They are not as big as old Polaroid pictures; they're about half the size but they still have the same look. Haven't had a single problem with mine and it was here 2 days early!","Loved it!!","Bought for my 10 year old. She loves it and it does the job well.<br />For my part, I thought it was expensive for a camera that only takes instant photos. It would have been better value if it also had the capability to take digital photos as well.  And we there is the expense of buying film as well.... which also is not cheap.  But apart from that, its lots of fun, looks great and seems well made.","Little small photos , could be a little bigger","Cute and amazing","My daughter loves it!","I  bought this camera for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it !!!  Its fun and compact.  Great for fun pics and instant pics  Easy to use, you can produce high-quality, credit-card sized photos in an instant. The camera features a brightness adjustment dial that allows you to take pictures anytime, anywhere—indoors, Pictures come out great and in seconds. I'd recommend it for anyone trying to get a gift for any occasion.","I purchased this camera for my daughter's 5th birthday. She loves this camera.  Yes, the film is a little pricey but if used in moderation, it's worth the money.","fun camera","This is a great little camera. Both of my children have one and enjoy taking pictures","I love love love this camera!! I wish the films were a little cheaper but these are rare items and it is so much fun with it. When asking people to help you take a photo, everyone gathers around for the final product, it is a great fun product for those that love photography.","I'm in love with mine!!","Love this camera.","I love it! The color the quality everything just perfect ","My 15 year old daughter has so much fun with this ! She loves it. Film is a bit pricey, but worth it.","Fun and cute! Easy to use and exactly what I expected!! You'll get great fun snapshots with this camera!","This product is amazing. It does what its suppose to do. Easy to us. I would recommend this for people who are looking for polaroid cameras. The beauty of this product is that it has \"hi-key\" which is one of their product updates.<br /><br />I love this product. But u have to make sure u use every shot wisely. Coz ones u press on it, its done. And remember that the \"see through\" hole is highwr than where the lens of the camera is. So i would adjust it a little bit higher. Adjust the setting, adjust the view, focus and ur good to go ","I got mines yesterday! It is so much prettier in person. Everything looks good I'm just waiting for my film to come. I highly recommend it especially since I got it for $50.","My kids think this is the most amazing thing ever! They love seeing the photos come right out. Easy to use, even for kids.","LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera.  Bought it to be used as a way to have a party favor for a kids birthday.  They loved the pictures and a fun way to have a momento.","Love it! Got it for a party in May, been using it since I received it a week ago. Can't put it down.<br />tip.... the picture turns out down and to the left of what you are aiming at.  So don't line up perfectly in the sight or you may miss the top part of the picture you're trying to take","Bought this for my girlfriend as a surprise. She has not stopped using it and I might consider buying one for myself","So cute, I really love it. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because I haven't gotten to play around with it too much but I've taken pictures and I love them. Definitely worth the money, great quality snapshots as well","Happy Happy","Just received this camera today. I purchased it for my daughter's birthday gift, and live it do far. We have taken 6 pictures so far and they came out great! They are very similar in quality to the pnes I remember as a kid with my mom's Polaroid. S uper easy to use even with rudimentary instruction manual.  so far no problems as some reviews state, we will see as time goes on. But for now, for a $50  instant camera , I would definitely recommend this!","I just got my camera yesterday and it is awesome! It's so little. The camera itself is smaller than a pencil! It takes pretty good pictures (you just have to remember to turn the wheel above the lens to set the lighting). Here are some pictures I took with it!","Very fun little camera.  Just be careful not to toss it around too much as the plastic scratches easily and I can see how pieces may become loose if not taken care of properly.","Camera met all my expectations and then some.  Having lots of fun with camera.  Also purchased the bundle which included a carrying case and other items.","I love this camera so much!!! It's hard to take pictures on extreme sunny days but I'm getting better at it... It's super fun to have it on parties to take pictures with friends","Got this for my daughter. Boy does she love it!

The color is so pretty.  I get a lot of compliments on this camera. Takes good pictures.","I love my new camera, it's so small and easy to use:) recommend it to any one that likes the outdoors and photography","Love this camera!!  Camera is easy to operate.  Picture quality is great for an instant camera.  The raspberry color looks pink in these images but is actually more of a red color.  Great gift for our daughter!","I adore my camara! Love it , it arrived on time and the pictures come out great worth every dollar","My daughter love it!! This was her birthday present. For the price we paid, the quality of the product is really good.","Its nice it was a child dream come true. But in the cold like really cold doesn't work like the photos is just white. What else some photo I have to take twice cause is to dark. Other too white.","Wife and I love this little camera. Nostalgia in the old school instant photo. Clear pics. Fast. Small and compact. Love this camera.","This couldn't work better! I absolutely love the simplicity of this product, and the price. I work in an Assisted Living community, and bought this for an event. Resident's loved getting their pictures taken, and I had a blast doing it.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is that it can only take 10 pictures before changing film.","Amazing quality. I would definitely recommend you and your friends to buy this camera. It's exactly worth the price and it's exactly what you see on YouTube and in pictures. It's super cute and really easy to use if your looking for a gift to give to someone this would also be great for that too. I love photography and I really wanted to get a camera that was cute and affordable.... So I found Fujiflim and I was hooked my mom and dad bought me one not to long ago (February 25, 2016) and I honestly don't regret buying it. The only thing was that I didn't order film when I got mine and there wasn't any film in the stores so I had to order my on Amazon. Amazon is literally your Bestfriend when buying film and other cute accessories I hoped I helped and I really hope you enjoy your camera! ??","I love it!! I was so happy when I recieved it!!","Perfct idea for a gift.","I wish it came with a free package of film instead of just purchasing it","So fun! My daughter loves it. Film is pricey but worth the fun.","This is absolutely perfect for snapping pictures on the go to keep. The auto setting definitely needs to be fine tuned but you can just change your settings yourself to fix that problem. I've gone through 2 film packs so far and I've only had it a week.","This has got to be the best poloroid I have had since I was a little girl. Sometime the light does not swith but the setting changes even if the light doesnt move.","Beautiful!","I love this camera! It's hard to take a good photo at first because of the light, but with practice I got some very nice photos.","The camera worked good. The only thing we saw different was the box was marked raspberry but the color was a little \"orangier\" color than the case color. Both were marked raspberry. But our granddaughter said it was ok. She liked it.","Great product, great timing!","Love it!","Best investment I have ever made. No problems what so ever","I love it! I ordered same day shipping and it got here five hours later! It works so well and it's super fun to use!","The camera is very good, the pictures turn out very clear and beautiful. However, it's a shame that the film costs so much and is a very small amount, but otherwise it's a fun investment and is much more affordable than a professional camera.","This is a magical product!  I work at a school, so imagine when<br />I tell kids I'm going to take their picture and it magically appears!<br />Crazy!  Fun!  Love the color! My boss just bought one after she<br />saw the beautiful pictures!","I absolutely love it! It came in the mail today and the packaging couldn't been better it was very well protected with bubble wrap it came with batteries and a handstrap. The handstrap is a little tricky to tie but a little YouTube could help :) it ended up being very easy to put on. By the way there's some people asking if it came with film no it does not come with film even though the picture has film in it so you'll have to buy the film. Its the perfect size as well. The instructions that it came with were in what I think is Japanese but it also comes with picture instructions. Overall great product!","this is very good","I love it","5stars","Purchased this camera for our young granddaughter's birthday and she is absolutely thrilled with it! ... and so are we.  The camera is easy for her to use.  The quality of the photos is surprisingly crisp and clear.  It's a great way to introduce children to the creative side of photography.","I love this! It's so cute and it was easy to assemble and the pictures are really small and adorable! Sorry for the random flying photo in the picture i posted haha.","Absolutely love this product! It's light and easy to carry in a purse, even if you don't have the special case for it. It also has multiple settings, from indoor to cloudy to very sunny, and the flash works great. It's fairly easy to use and you can take 10 photos before having to switch to the next cartilage. Fun way to save those special moments!","Fast shipping everything is ok so i am happy","Perfect for my romantic vacation","I love it","Bought this as a fun little gift for my fiancé. She absolutely loves it.","GREAT GIFT FOR MY TEENAGER ALONG WITH FUJI FILM!","The 6 yr. old loves her camera and used up all of the film immediately. The photos are a little small and the quality isn't the best, but it works for a child","don't hesitate to buy this camera, it's nostalgic! sure film is a bit pricey...but who said to take photos of every damn thing you see? be conservative and take photos that are actually significant. in other words don't waste your film on bullspit you can photograph with your phone.","Got this for my girlfriend (now fiancé) as one of her Christmas gifts. Easy to use and simple to replace film. The photos are rather small if you're comparing to the vintage \"Polaroid\" but fun and good quality  nonetheless. Camera also has different settings for different lighting environments which is a plus. Downside would be that replacement film is expensive.","Love the camera can't beat the price . Received camera in 2 days free shipping with Amazon prime I am a very satisfied with Amazon","super awesome! the camera itself is cute and the pictures are awesome quality for a polaroid!~","Came with a few scatches on some places of the camera.....still cute but would've better if it was in a good condition","Actually purchased this for my five year old daughter (moms a photographer) so she loves having a camera of her own, and it's easy enough for her to use, I just have to change the film out for her.","Love my new camera.","The photo setting is a little strange. If you're indoors, most likely your photos will be washed out because the flash is too bright. We read that you can counteract this by adding a little bit of scotch tape in front of the flash. That seems to have done the trick!","it was a raspberry color look more like red.","Super cool and fun. Expensive film is about the only downside.","Love it! Nephew loves to play with it. Great nostalgia product. It's nice to have an actual photo on hand. The film is a little expensive but worth it. Very easy to use even for a child.","Our dughter needed an instant camera for a school project and we found this one to be a great buy. Highly recommended...","I love it so much. I dont regret buying it at all. Its fun and easy to use and way cheaper here than at the stores.","Cutest thing ever! We love it! Great quality!","This product came on time and as shown. Works great and easy to use. Love it!","Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for. I purchased this with the Mudder Retro Leather Case, and it worked out really well. Shipping was fast, too!","Great camera! Hard to figure out settings at first.","Girlfriend here.<br />Absolutely love this camera. It's really fun to take pictures with friends. I have the selfie attachment and love showing up next to someone, pose and take a quick pic. It's nice to have an physical copy and be spontaneous with pictures.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Have physical copies of pictures<br />Old school \"Polaroid\" feel<br /><br />Cons:<br />Film starts to add up<br /><br />The film can start to get expensive so I don't go too crazy with taking pictures but I bring it along when I go to events and people have a lot of fun with it.","It surprisingly takes good pictures.  I bought the extra attachment for taking selfy which makes the camera looks even cuter. So far so good.. Very easy to use. The only downside is the bulkiness","Awesome and fun. Good for a little board and some old school photographing.","I love it!","OMG I LOVE THIISSSS. No issues, great quality, came in perfect condition. <3 I love this.","Everything came perfectly, thank you.","I love it. Still getting used to it and in order to get used to it you need to take many pictures which can be costly. If you dont mind spending money on the film than this is perfect.","My daughter loves this camera! Good quality!","I love this camera. The Polaroids are obviously smaller than the classic old school Polaroids, but I still love them !!","Bought it for my grand daughter. She loves it. It takes great pics","I must say that this camera is everything I expected. I'm happy with my purchase! The color is not as fuchsia as it looks in the picture, it is more a coral-colored but equally'm delighted. Is easy to use and super cute. Do not be hesitant to buy it!","I just got my camera yesterday. It's absolutely amazing. If you're thinking about buying this, you should.The camera is pretty light and comes with a strap, but it doesn't come with flim inside of the camera. If you buy flim from the same seller at the same time you buy your camera, it will come in the same package. Warning: when you open the flim out of it's package don't open it. The flim will become useless and the photos will come out white. Also, the camera has 5 settings. Indoors, cloudy, sunny, really sunny, and high-key.You should also know the photos won't come out looking professional. The camera can only do so much. If you want to take better close up pictures you should buy a accessory that lets you do close up pictures. I have seen them on Amazon too along with other cool things like colored filters. I hope this review helped you.","Excellent!!","Great Camera","great camera","Purchased this for my gf and she loves it! Pictures come out looking great","Absolutely love it. I've been taking many pictures with it in all kinds of different lighting and they come out great. Shipping was fast.","Arrived faster than I expected ! So in love","Love this camera. I was looking for a Polaroid camera a while ago thinking I was being originally in this day and age. Of course the second I get mine in the mail I start noticing everyone with the same camera. Either way it's cute, light, and takes good pictures.","good","Daughter loves this","Great camera","Very good ,it even came before the dates assigned for it.","Great camera, daughter loves it!","Bought as a gift for my cousin, and she loved it. Was exactly what she was looking for and i knew by the description that she was going to love it. Shipped very fast and didn't have any problems with it upon opening. Everything worked right out of the box.","great camera","I've wanted this camera for years and always told myself I didn't need it, well I decided I needed it, and I love it. The pictures come out great, it's so fun to take cute little photos of my friends and write the date on them so I can keep these memories close to my heart! And the pink color of the camera is just a bonus.","My granddaughter was very pleased with her present.","Absolutely love","I love the quality of the photos.","Love it!","Happy happy happy!!!","I'm very happy, it's exactly what I expected.","Great camera for keeping memories. Tested the camera with 2 film and one was used with a selfie lens. So far so good","I love it","In love!! This camara is awesome!! Takes<br />great pictures is light in weight!! It's just perfect!!","Birthday gift for my niece, and she LOVES the camera. Fast shipping, and it arrived a few days before her birthday!","LOVE IT!!!! My only complaint is mine did not come with batteries so I had to buy my own. Besides that everything was perfect.","The product was in excellent condition.","Great for exactly what I wanted, the old feel of a Polaroid for todays age.  It does look a little strange and feels a little strange in your hand, like a hamburger you're trying to grasp with mittens.  Great for parties though, the instant feel is great and is a wonderful momento.  In most dark places the flash gets the subject lit up quite well.","This product is an amazing deal including the fact that you get millions of accessories.","This camera is soooo amazing, I love it! The Polaroids are kinda small, but I dont mind. Well worth the price. The photos are of GREAT quality!","So much fun!  Vintage quality, instant Polaroid photos.  My creative 7 year old easily operates it, and her big sister, and mom, and dad, all want their own!  Highly recommend.","I got this camera for my daughter for her 14th birthday. She wanted this for Christmas but I was unable to get for her at the time. She is a picture kinda girl. She loves taking pictures of her self and her friends.<br /><br />This camera takes nice clear pictures. I am surprised at the quality of the pictures you get from this little camera. This is great for them that like to scrap book because there pictures are instance and you get great pictures. My daughter wanted the black one but you have other colors to choose from so you can pick the perfect color for you. This camera is small so it is easy to have on you for them camera moments. If you choose you can also get the case with the camera. This camera cost me $69.00 dollars which is worth every penny but now I see it for $49.00 so you should grab yours now. I think this is a perfect gift for teenagers.<br /><br />This product was purchase for normal pricing and this is my honest and unbiased review.","Love this camera! It is great for parties! Everyone always asks me where I got it at and wants a pic. The film is kinda expensive but worth it!","The ítem arrived just on time and it was perfect! I recomend the seller. On the other hand, I traveled to Europe a few days ago and the camera isn’t  too resistant to the cold weather. Photos took a long time to appear and the quality wasn’t the best. Even so, I love it!","My bestfriend loved this gift. I would recommend to buy film because it doesn't come with film. But the good thing is it comes with batteries.","got exactly what I ordered! personally wish that I had gotten a different colour as the colour in person looks slightly childish to me but I still like it! the pictures develop in about 5 minutes, and the instructions on how to take a picture or set up the camera weren't very clear but thanks to YouTube videos I figured it out. overall it is exactly what I bought and expected so very good!","Cute camera! Takes a few pics to get the hang of what settings to use but we have fun using it to snap pics!","This makez picture taking extra fun. Cool retro effect. The only negative I found is that you need plenty of light, or the photo is a little distorted.","This camera is so fun!!!  I bought it as a gift and plan on buying on for myself soon. I have used the one my sister has and think it is great for small parties and group events to be able to take pictures and have instant gratification. It is very easy to operate and film is pretty cheap and also easy to get. Its a novel fun toy and makes for a great gift too","The camera is amazing!!!! Very clear! The only thing I will say about this SELLER is that the attach a photo as if film is included. Besides that item came quickly and was exactly what I anticipated.","Love it- fast shipping, everything as posted :)","Love it!!!! Easy to use! So much fun!","Exactly as pictured , I was so scared of getting scammed and now I'm so happy I didn't !!! Yay can't wait for the film to come in the mail to use it !!","This Fuji camera is Amazing and worth every penny!!! Easy to use & Pictures come out phenomenal! Everyone in my family loves it!!","Great pictures, absolutely love it,","Love it!","I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it! She has so much fun taking pictures with it and watching them develop right before her eyes! I will say that it can be fragile. She accidentally dropped it in a carpeted area and the front part of the lens popped off.  Luckily, we were able to get it back on.  Even without it, it didn't really effect the function of the camera.","This camera is super simple to use. I love the retro look of it. It is perfect for a teenage girl that is all about selfies with her friends, but it could be perfect for many other people. I, personally, got it for work reasons to help thank people for referrals. I had previously been taking pictures with a  phone, emailing them to myself, downloading them to the computer, then to finally print them out, and cut them to size. This was a truly daunting task. Now, I can simply have the picture in a matter of minutes. The pictures are not great quality. Honestly, they have a vintage look to them. I do feel in this day and age that Fujifilm could have improved the clarity of the photos, which is the reason for the 4 stars. Otherwise this is great camera. I do think it has a slippery texture that could make it prone to dropping and the wrist strap is a must have. It doesn't come with film, unless stated, which is also kind of frustrating. I felt like they should at least add in a few for practice. Also, there is no way to store the pictures digitally. Maybe that will be a feature in future models.","Fun little camera.  Bought as gift.","Perfect camera nothing more to say","Love this Camera, the pictures are a little low quality, but that's kind of the point isn't it?","Ordered 3/11 and was delivered 3/12!!! Assembling was easy, clear instructions. Great picture quality and easy to handle. Cant wait to go on a trip!","Used this camera for a selfie station at our Halloween wedding. Absolutely so much fun. Loved the high quality pics our friends and family left for us!","Film is expensive.  Have to carry extra.  I think this will lose its newness fast. I bought for my daughter Jan.  I've yet to see her use it.","I thought this camera was very cute so I picked this up for my girlfriend. I have the old model as well, but this new model is much better cause it comes with limited edition accessories. It comes with special Hello Kitty film that is only available with this camera, stickers, and a shoulder strap. It is still the same point and shoot camera that prints out the film instantaneously. On the lower back of the camera, a small circle displays the number of film you still have left to shoot. This new model comes with an extra mode thats perfect for selfies. My girlfriend loves the new one I got her and gave me her old one to use.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Limited edition accessories<br />- Extremely cute and fashionable<br />- New high-key mode (takes brighter pictures with a soft look)<br />- Prints photos out instantaneously<br /><br />CONS:<br />- NONE<br /><br />If you get this 40th anniversary Hello Kitty model, I advise getting a case for further protection first and a film book. If you want your girlfriend to love you more, I definitely recommend you to get this for her. It's a very inexpensive present that brings joy to most girls.","Ordered for my 8yr old daughter and she loves it! Very neat, works great.","Super fun!","love it. the color is nice and easy to use","Awesome camera, purchased for my daughter's 5th birthday. Film is a little pricey.","Love and works perfectly.","I bought this for my teenage daughter for Christmas as a fun thing to have! It takes great little pictures that the kids love to trade right away! It really has been a fun thing to own!","Enjoy it very much","Loved it!! Oh my gosh it is so cute, works awesome, shipping was fast, and even though it was refurbished it worked good as new","I LOVE THIS!! It is adorable, my favorite color, and it works perfectly! It's easy to use and just fun. The only complaint I have is that it scuffed very quickly when I put it in my bag, but I should've bought a case for it. But it's very minor and tiny, and that shouldn't stop you from buying this camera!","This is the cutest camera...I bought for my 10 yr old granddaughter's birthday...after a little help from mom to get the settings just right..they had a ton of fun taking photos all throughout the sleeper over. ..much giggling did the photos generate.. fun fun fun","I love this camera ! i bought this for my daughter and she loves taking pictures with it , plus it is so vintage. The only drawback is that you have to constantly buy film and they cost about $20-$36 . We are going to South Padre Island for spring great and this is the perfect thing to take with you , its not as heavy as a professional camera but it has the same quality as a professional camera !","I was a little bit confused about the brightness dial setting but after reading the manual, figured out that the setting is adjusted automatically. You can choose to put the dial at the darker setting to get a softer picture. Easy to use! Can't wait to use it during my travels.","Took this to Cuba to hand out picture's, a huge success!","This was a birthday gift for my Granddaughter . She was excited to get it and said all the kids are using them. I haven't seen a picture taken yet , but it sure made her happy getting this camera .","I got this for a gift, she loves it!","I love it","My daughter is pregnant and loves this camera. She likes taking photos of her growing belly and likes to send these to her extended family.","Came in great condition I recommend to everyone","love it","Awesome and fun camera to use! Love the instant pictures. I love this color as well,  it's a pastel yellow. I just use the different instructions and tricks on youtube from diff vloggers. Great buy! Best price I've seen so far, glad I made this purchase.","No problems went well","Just as pictured and fast shipping.","This camera is so cool and cute! its little and the picture quality of the Polaroids are surprisingly really clear. Defiantly a good buy","I didn't think much of it at the$$ but daughter loved it","I love it so much. The only thing is that when you center it it goes to the right a bit","Love love love! Still trying to get used to the flash settings, but other than that it an amazing little camera!","Good","Purchased for my 10 year old for Christmas. She loves it. Having instant pictures is great! They are small so they don't take up a lot of space.","OMG THIS CAMERA IS THE BEST THING GOING FOR FUN INSTANT PRINT AT YOUR FINGER TIPS AM OLDER THEN THE NORMAL TEEN AM AN ADULT AN WE HAVE SO MUCH FUN I KNOW THAT THE SD CARDS FOR CAMERAS HAVE TAKING OVER OF COURSE CAUSE TIME MOVES ON BUT IT GREAT TO SEE A COMPANY BRING BACK SOMETHING OLD BUT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE NEWER TO KEEP YOU IN THE LOOP, HONESTLY I USE THIS MORE THAN MY SD CARD CAMERA FOR I GET MY PICTURE INSTANT JUST LIKE THE OLD POLIROID CAMERA BACK IN THE DAY BUT WITH A MORE SWIFTIER LOOK AN STYLE PLUS IT COMES IN MANY COLORS I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE BE AN OWNER OF ONE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS BUT YOU LIKE KEEPING UP TO DATE WITH THE SD CAMERAS THEN AT LEAST GET IT FOR YOUR KIDS OR GRANDKIDS FOR THERE FIRST CAMERA I BOUGHT THE GROOVY CASE AN XTRA FILM FOR IT AN ILOVE IT","It was great","Worth the price!","Camera arrived very fast and in perfect condition. I love it already I can't wait to use it. Perfect size for traveling","This camera is fantastic!<br /><br />Originally, I got this camera because my friend bought one in Korea, in a pastel yellow. It's light weight, and completely easy to use. All you do is put in the AA batteries, a film pack, and voila! You're ready to use the camera. It has settings, \"in doors,\" \"cloudy,\" \"sunny,\" \"very sunny,\" and \"hi-key.\" The wrist strap is also a nice addition, because I drop things very easily.","I recently took a trip to the Grand Canyon and Red Rock, I brought this camera along to capture the beauty of both places on film. All of my pictures turned out spectacular aside from a select few, (however, that is my fault - the place I was taking a picture was a bit too dark, so make sure there is enough brightness available for the picture). This was definitely a rewarding buy.","Awesome! Exactly what I expected:)","Very fun camera to have ! Friends got a big kick out of it when they could see the pics right away. Just like the 70's camera but the pictures come out a bit smaller but very clear.","Daughter loves it!","Camera is so cute! Easy to use and produces fantastic pictures. SO excited to take it everywhere.","Love this camera and the color! I got it because it was slightly cheaper and fell in love with the color!! Definitely recommend","Great camera for kids.","This was a gift. I was hoping they had put a sample film with it.","I love this little camera but I wouldn't suggest for people 18+. It's really fun at first but then it's just another thing lying around. I got one for my 8 year old sister though. She definitely took more interest in it longer than I did.","Fun stuff, my 11 year old loved it, it was a gift.  Her dad and I took turns using it as well, it was great! Thanks for the fun!","It is great it came quickly, brand new, just like what you would buy in a store except cheaper it is such a beautiful color. I am so happy! Thank you guys so much for it :)!!1","love it","Easy to use instant camera, although the resolution of the picture is not as I was hoping I'd still buy it again, maybe as a gift","This little camera is great! It takes great pictures and develops them very quickly.  We had a lot of fun with this at our wedding.  This is great for parties, or anything with lots of people! FUN TIMES","love it","awesome camera my daughter loves it","I bought this camera for my niece for christmas she LOVED it! the quality of the pictures is amazing its was a great choice","My daughter Loves This!!","Its adorable, the color is more red than raspberry. Other than that it amazing and my daughter loves it.","I love it.","perfect, just as described","I purchased one of these for my grandson's Christmas present and had to purchase another for my granddaughters 6th birthday.  As you would guess, the film doesn't last too long, but the children love it!","I got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loved it! We couldn't stop taking pictures of each other! The quality of the photos is awesome considering its a mini Polaroid. Definitely satisfied and I recommend to any and everyone!","Great Buy! So much fun!","I love the color to this Instax Mini 8!! It's very vibrant and beautiful. I would recommend :)","No idea why yellow was the cheapest but okay.<br /><br />Works great, very simple and easy to use for casual point and shoot. Not trying to earn millions of instagram virtual dollars with this.","To date, I've purchased five of these cameras as gifts, for work, and for personal use, and they never fail to bring a smile to anyone's face. It's small enough to stuff into a mid-sized purse, and the variety of settings are handy, too. I bring my Instax camera everywhere, and have posted the photos on our wall and also strung them together on twine with glittery clothespins. I've had my Instax for two years now and haven't ever encountered any trouble with it, and it's had its fair share of falls and drops! Highly recommended.","I don't understand why these are so popular in the age of super sharp cell phone photos.  However,  my daughter loves it and is having fun with it.","I've owned one of these for a couple of years now and love it! It's so much fun to have instant pictures.","I really missed my old instant camera ,so I got this one and some film delivered  and wow , this is so much fun . the camera is light and smaller than I thought but the color was definitely more coral not raspberry . its easy to use and came with wrist strap and batteries instructions in all languages . it was so fun to show my Grand kids what this thing did , they just looked as that picture develop and were so amazed .Best thing to see","Very cool camera. Easy to operate, we really enjoy it. And the price was very reasonable. Keep up the good work Fuji!","It took a little bit to get used to it, in order for the pictures to come out great, but after that it's great!","It takes great pictures just small but plain","I LOVE my fujifilm instax mini, so much fun to use and the quality of pictures are great.","Great camera to get someone as a gift!","Great camera very nice picture quality and price is great. Kids love it","Love it!","Pleasant surprise-serves the purpose.","She loves this so much!  Fun to see kids love something they actually have to wait for!  Reminds me of the old Polariods of my childhood!","Such a fun and cute camera but buyer beware...If you are a person who is use to digital, its nothing like it. It seems like common sense but its a bit of a shock to realize they're not coming out like your cell phone images. I grew up with 35mm and polaroids and I have to readjust my way of taking pix but if you have never been raised that way, my guess is... it will irritate you. The viewfinder isn't directly through the lens, so your pix will be off set a little then what you aimed for and the pix are darker and nothing like the brightness of what your use to, so you have to practice with distance and the flash. I practically wasted a whole package of film to get reacquainted with the way old school photo taking was. I think its a great road trip, being goofy in the car and with friends kinda camera and also great for a little kid that doesn't really care how their images turn out, just excited that it's instant.  Im glad I purchased it and would buy it again. Its a simple camera that takes me back to simple times and just having fun.","nice!","My daughter loves this ! Very happy with her gift.","I ordered this camera on a sunday and arrived at my house on a monday in which i am very pleased with the shipping (I have Amazon Prime). The camera came in the original real packaging. The product comes with batteries for camera, a strap, and of course the camera its self. Im very happy with product everything has worked just fine and I've had no problems at all! I do recommend this product to anyone with no doubt!","Granddaughter loves it","Awesome!!","This is awesome totally love it #socute need film tho ;( that's ok I'll just get it from Amazon #bestplacetoshop love my new instax mini ahhhh","Love it!!","I bought 2 of these for my twin 11 year old daughters.  They took pictures all over the place!  The photos are small, but the girls expected that.  No disappointment with this version of an old Polaroid.","love","Such an awesome little camera! Great for scrapbooks and tiny memories!","love it <3 <3","liked it","Love the camera - especially the cute light yellow color. The Pictures are a little small but turn out nicely. I brought this to a party and it was a hit! The size is perfect - fits well in a medium size handbag so very portable. Ended up buying a different color as a gift and they loved it. Would recommend if interested in buying a Polaroid camera ","Absolutely love it ! Came in perfect condition and was worth every penny.","Such a good camera! I love how you can change the lighting and the prints are just the right size. I love my camera soooo much!!!!","was a gift but person was really happy with this present, she love it!","Ok, it's a total splurge buy, but totally worth it!  We love it. The teens love it. Everyone at the restaurants we go to and take family pics love it!  Super cute camera. It takes several practice shots to figure out the exposure/flash options. But overall, you get the same 'easily out of focus', 'over exposed' Polaroid pictures we all grew up with!! LOVE!! It was really fun watching my 13 yo take a picture, see it \"pop out\" and then develop infrintbif her. Worth every penny!!","I love it it's so cute!","Picture in seconds and it gives it that retro old look. Love it and def worth the price. Its much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else. Great buy!","My daughter loves this camera. She takes a picture of everyone that comes over. Easy to operate and takes nice little pictures.","My order came in before the expected date:D I'm obsessed with my camera will buy again I highly recommend it! The color is a bit darker but still cute!","I love taking this traveling. When I come across children in small villages or remote areas, they love to get their photos taken and it is a great alternative to giving them candy. It has been with me to the Mongolian Steppe, Romanian Orphanages, Peruvian mountains...","Love this camera!!  The pictures turn out nicely and the camera is easy to use.  I gave this to my daughter for her 6th birthday and she loved it.  She used it at her party and all her friends now want one too.  It takes nice pictures and the film with the decorated borders on it is really fun.","I adore this camera, the picture style reminds of me of the old school polaroids and they're so much more meaningful since they are an actual physical photo instead of a digital one. The one tip is to try to shoot pictures in decent lighting and not too far away from your subject, because the picture can come out too dark even if you have the camera on the right setting.","This camera broke a few months into using it. Sometimes it was hard to not overexpose when in sunlight, even with the correct light settings.<br /><br />I really loved the camera and it said it had a warranty but when I called Amazon, they didn't know who to transfer me to for the warranty and the best they could do was refund me most of the my purchase cost and take back the camera. Not sure if I just had a fluke or if they're just not durable, but I've been tempted to get another one.","It's amazing and just how it should be. I love it!!","LOVEEEEEEE this product. I bought it for a Christmas present for my niece who is 8 years old. She loves it, its easy to use, and easy to setup. Now that she has one I'm thinking of buying one myself. The pictures are very clear and they're so cute in size (about the size of credit card/wallet size). I love it!","Great camera! Takes good pictures and if super fun and easy to use!","Love this!! The pictures obviously are regular sized Polaroids but for $60 bucks the mini is so worth it!!","This camera is the cutest and most fun in photography I've ever had.","It was purchased as a gift and was exactly want was wanted. Great surprise.","She loves it","happy with the camera","Bought in 2015, worked great for my wedding guest book, would buy again.","Oh my God! I am in love with this camera. I got a clear cover for it just to be super careful with my little love. But honestly, if you're looking for a professionally photographed picture then it's definitely a no-no. But for all those vintage things obsessed people you have come to the right place, don't think twice before ordering it. Just need to be careful while taking pictures, as I have previously mentioned don't expect super perfect and clear pictures, but it's best while creating those special memories in picture instantly. You have a memory of your best time, without fearing to have lost it due to accidentally deleting your pictures on your phone, or in worst case scenarios if your phone gets lost. Sometimes, few memories are a lot worth then few dollars and for such time your Fujifilm Instax mini 8 is perfect.<br /><br />It's Fujifilm, it's a reputed and well-known brand so definitely there's no chance anything going wrong with the camera. Just keep the obvious things in your mind don't drop it in the water, don't drop it, and don't cover the flash while taking pictures.<br /><br />PS. Your friends are gonna be so jelly ;)","Love love love!","My gran daughter is so excited with the camera now my other gran daughter want one","Nice color, and great camera.  Bought the twin pack film to accompany a terrific gift!","just GREAT!!!<br />Camera works perfectly and simply love it.","Looks good, and works great!","My kids loved it!

Made very well great gift.","Easy to use","Wonderful and receive in a timely manner.","<3 thank you","Just perfect","Love this camera. The photos are so fun, and it's great to have at parties. I only rated it 4 stars and not 5 because I wish the film was more affordable.","Good one, if it had gift wrap option it would be perfect","Great for fun. Really easy use and super cute!","I bought this for my five year old as a birthday gift. Of course she loves it, and all of her friends loved it at her birthday party. It is very easy to use. The pictures are very clear, though much smaller than \"old-school\" Polaroids. It also comes with a wrist strap, which I do not believe is pictured.","Got it for my daughter.  She loves it and it works great.","Love it!","Niece loved it!","Easy to use and takes good pictures for a polarized camera and gives a nice retro feel","Great gift for tween","I am not a professional photographer, just an ordinary person that loves playing with the camera. You need to learn to use the different options like outside, inside, etc and then the pics look great.","We bought this camera for our daughter's birthday and she loves it! Also, it has proven to be a very durable camera!","This camera has a nice color. I like it.","Good","Boyfriend loved it!!!!","It's awesome","Light, compact instant photos that are good quality.","This is hands down the most awesome vintage way of taking pictures!

There is nothing better then a Polaroid!","I got the grape color and love it! It's a dark purple and looks great with pretty much anything. Love the vintage look of the prints! Before I left a 1 star review for the raspberry color because it was tremendously ugly, instead of red it was a faded, old looking orange. This one that I have now works and looks amazing!<br /><br />The good: The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is a cute, easy to use compact device. It can easily fit into a handbag and isn’t cumbersome to hold but I got one of the cute and convenient cases (that did not come with the device) that has a strap for around the body to protect my baby girl. The camera didn't come with a selfie mirror so I highly recommend getting one, if you're thinking of taking selfies with it (they're fairly inexpensive) just so you know where to position yourself. The operations are minimal, since the device is almost fully automatic, if and when you rotate the dial the light doesn't move that is why, it determines the best setting for the amount of light that surrounds the subject. It uses double A batteries (which came with the device) that are easy to find! Instant gratification!<br /><br />The bad: It holds only 10 film sheets at a time. The film it's expensive. Have to get batteries for the device when they run out. Sometimes the pictures aren't as clear as you want them to be. Didn't come with clear instructions, had to look for them on the Internet. The box it comes in seemed old and faded.<br /><br />Overall I love my little camera so I say get it! You won't regret it!","Not sure why these are so popular with the 11-14 yo gang.... Especially the girls, but when did adults ever understand kids.","Have a blast every time I use this camera. Who doesnt love polaroids","The color is more like a red orange...something like that, but came in soon, very well packaged it just wasn't the color that i wanted.","Small pictures but it's super cute and fun happy I bought this","Bought this for my 14 year old as a Christmas gift. She LOVES it!!","Great, fun gift for tween or teen.","I really like this camera everyone should have one to make great memories :)","I take this pretty little thing everywhere!","Absolutely love my new Instax mini8! Taking night time photos can be a challenge but overall it's awesome!","Perfect size! I bring this with me everywhere I go. Super cute and just perfect!","This camera was a gift for my wife.  She had a friend who payed a lot more for this item on another site and didn't have a selection on color.  The camera takes good pictures and with the 7 in 1 kit available, you can take great instant selfies as wel as other neat filters and a fitted case to protect the camera.  This is good for scrapbooking as you might imagine.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for fun instant camera.","my 8 year old absolutely loves this camera. she started her album and enjoys sharing it with her friends. i love the color, it really stands out. pictures are clear and glossy. perfect size for little hands and lightweight also.","I got this for my daughter for Christmas. Bought it as a package or so I thought no film came with it very disappointed she couldn't use it for weeks until I got the phone in the mail. Film extremely expensive","Loveee","Great quality (vintage looking) photos & easy to set up and use. The film makes it quite expensive, but I don't plan to use it too often! Only problem I encountered was that all of the directions were not provided I n English. Luckily it was easy to figure out using the diagrams & common sense!","I purchased this as a gift for my niece and she loved  it.I have not seen the camera so going by what she told me. She said it was exactly what she wanted and was easy to operate.","Great ! I love it","Great camera","My daughter loves it.","Great product but all instructions were in Chinese.","daughter loves it","I love it! It works good and mine did have the selfie mirror on it. My friends and I all enjoy it, I'm very glad I bought this.","Great fun and it brings back good memories from back in the day.  Beware that the photos are slimmer than the old school polaroid.  Not a problem for me, but I could see some people thinking differently.","We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 10 year old. She LOVE it and was happy with the color.","Works wonderful!","I had purchased this camera for my daughter whom is currently a junior in college.  She LOVES the color, and the pictures that it takes.  Brings it with her to parties, friend events, etc..  Don't get plain black if getting for your kid.  They have quite a few vibrant colors.","I love the way the camera looks especially since it looks like a toy but i dont like the way the pictures come out especially since they're so small.","Works perfect, was nicely shipped, takes great pictures. I am really please and going really enjoy this for my kids birthday partys.","This thing is great. GF loves it and won't stop using it. No issues at all.<br />If your into taking photos, traveler, blogger, parents, crafter whatever you NEED to have one of these around. Well worth it.<br />I would like to see them make one that prints larger photos (these are about the size of a credit card) but still 5 stars period. Thank you'","my 11 yr old daughter loves her camera","My daughter asked for this for Christmas but we waited and got a much better price.  She loves it.  The color is perfect.  Just as pictured.  One word of caution - it doesn't come with film :-(.","Shipped quickly and in perfect condition. Just got it today and still trying it out but very pretty and cute camera. Took a few pictures and they look good. Definitely recommend!","Tips for Taking Photos with Instax Mini!<br /><br />1. take good care of the camera i.e it shouldn’t be jostled or dropped because THE LENS circle thing WILL FALL OFF. You can stick it back on but there’s always a little risk involved, the first time the lens fell off I nearly got a heart attack.<br />2. never, ever take a photo in sucky lighting (ex. Our house which is lighted purely by incandescent lamps) In fact limit indoor photos unless it’s an extremely special/candid moment that can’t be replaced. Don’t lie to yourself and think “it’ll turn out good anyway” Nuh uh<br />3. Always pay attention to the dial and turn it. I’ve had photos come out as yellowish blanks because someone forgot to turn the dial<br />4. do not play around with the dial and think you can judge what setting is best for the weather…the camera really is most accurate.<br />5. Try to wear light colored clothing. Not white because the flash will react badly. Not dark/black clothing because the background of the picture (ESPECIALLY if indoors) darkens naturally and you can “Fade” into the background.<br />6. Selfies are always best with natural light. If not, and you’re taking a selfie with a friend, remember that the person holding the camera (and therefore closest to it) is more likely to get a little bit whited out (not a lot, but a little) than the other person.<br />7. The lens can hold a surprising amount of space/number of people in one photo. This means that if for example, you’re taking a photo of a big group of people, you don’t have to back up as much as you think. If you do their faces will have less focus. Don’t be afraid to close up a little bit. (referring here to horizontal photos of course)<br />8. The camera can take very nice photos both vertically and horizontally. Vertically is better for portraits and closeups and is very flexible. Horizontal, however, can get you a beautiful “slice of life” feel, when you want to focus not only on the people but the background and scenery.<br />9. The paper/material the photo is printed on is thick, white, and has a little space under the photo itself for you to write something. ALWAYS write with a thin pen Sharpie. Normal pens, ballpens, ink pens whatever bleed and smudge and look plain nasty.<br /><br />So maybe now you’re wondering….wow, this camera has a lot of limitations. Should I seriously get it?? And my answer….YES! Yes you should. The photos just feel so incredibly real. It’s like holding that moment in your hand. It’s so different from digital photos or even printing at Walgreens. You can look at a photo over and over again, and every time notice something good and different. It’s hard to explain, but these photos are so old timey and vivid, every one of these is like a breath of fresh air. And another thing…EVERYONE loves instant cameras….I met my cousins for the first time this winter, and I honestly feel like we really bonded over this. Every time you take a new photo, everybody hovering around like “how’d it turn out??” and you get to watch it develop (extremely interesting.) It only takes a minute for the photo to develop, but a few more for the colors to really pop.<br />So yes….Get it. Make sure to watch a couple YouTube tips/reviews/demo vids and be sparing with the pictures, they ARE pricey!!","Awesome","i love it but i wish i bought it around this time because i got mine for 80 bucks. to be exact 82.95","I got the camera the next day and I absolutely love it!","I love the camera and I use it quite often, yet mine was off-centered. Im not sure if this is common with all of these but my friend and I both bought one from the same person and they both seemed to be off centered when the photo was taken.","I love the camera. The film is definitely affordable and the quality is great.","This camera is $110 at the store I got the same camera and the case for less than that! I love it the color is perfect. The case is really good quality.","Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! It was the perfect gift. Great picture quality also!","No selfie timer. High exposure every time. Gifted to a friend and purchased the next model up which cured these issues.","my wife like it","Works and my niece loves it!","Arrived on time and was packaged nicely. My sister LOVED this gift. It's what she's been wanting for a year now so she really enjoyed it. She was a little confused with the instructions but once she got it, she was able to make it work.","On time, and is so cute!","I love this camera so much! I've read it's kinda marketed for tweens and as a twenty something  heading to thirty, I have to say that adults can have just as much fun with it. I took pictures of all the kids at Christmas and gave them to the parents and they loved it. The camera works great and is easy to use. Yeah, your tween will love it, but so will you.","My daughter gives this five stars!  She's had it for months and gets a lot of use out of it. Unfortunately the film is not cheaper.  From a parent's perspective, the quality of the photos are not good but kids love it anyway.  Worth the purchase if the kids love it.","Very light in weight and adorable to the touch, love it very much, easy to take anywhere :)","My daughter loves her camera and uses it every time she's at her friends. If you want to make your kid happy then get it!!!","I bought this for my Fiancé and he loved it. He has a love for photography and with the little pictures that he's taken are his most important ones that he'll keep forever. We've taken pictures at night and in the day, they aren't HD pictures but they are Polaroids so they are clear enough to be scrapbooked or put in the refrigerator. I love this Polaroid, and want to get one for myself(one day)!","Excellent","Excellent","Works great and super fast shipping!","Love it","LOVE this camera. It's so easy to use, and so adorable!","Perfect for tweens.  My 11 year old daughter loves it - she got it for Christmas.  Fun for her to take picture with her friends.","Very Happy!","This camera is so adorable! The shipping was faster than anticipated, and I am so excited to use this on my upcoming trip. Perfect size camera to fit into a small bag","I LIKE TI SO MUCH","My 10 year old loves it. Takes photos and gives them away to friends. Happy girl.","I received the camera this past Saturday and it came in perfect condition. The film is good and the camera works great, I love it.","My granddaughter asked for this for her 13th birthday. I was not aware that instant cameras were making a come-back. I remember the Swinger from Polaroid and was a little hesitant but the picture quality did not disappoint. He daddy is a professional photographer and he okayed the purchase and was pleased. Great for a 13 year old.","Love this instax mini 8....","My Girlfriend loves it.","My 9 year old daughter absolutely loves this camera.  I got it for her birthday and let her open it before her party because I knew she would want to use it.  Her friends were crazy about it too, and all wanted to know where they could get one.  They adored the small instant \"Polaroid\" type photographs, and were all sent home with a couple.  I had to police the situation because they were nearly fighting over them....I took that as a sure sign they liked them.  The camera is extremely easy to operate, and fun to use.  The pastel colors are great for young ladies.<br /><br />My only caution with this camera is that the film is rather expensive, and it's quite easy to just keep \"clicking\" with it.<br /><br />Remember, just like the original instant cameras,you must take one \"photograph\" before the film is ready to use. I made this mistake twice with a new film cartridge in....try getting a dozen 9 year olds to hold their pose again!<br /><br />Overall, this camera is so fun and functional, I had to give it five stars.  Although we have e not owned it for a long time yet, it seems sturdy and very well built. Even though it's plastic, it dies have some \"heft\" to it.<br /><br />Just so you are prior to purchase, this camera does not print regular \"polaroid\" size pictures. They are \"mini\" versions, but they are still very cool and the kids live them.<br /><br />Also be aware this does not take, or keep a digital version of you photograph.  It works just like and older instant camera; Once it prints the picture, it is gone from the camera forever.<br /><br />As long as you are aware of the price of film ahead of time, and do not have a problem with that; then I recommend this camera without reservation.","Have been wanting this item for a while now and decided to go ahead and purchase it. it was the best investment i could have made i love this camera and the pictures are actually very clear for such a small instant camera.","Amazing!!! Take it everywhere! Perfect modern Polaroid ??","Love this camera!","Dope ??????????","Love it","I ordered this in red for my 12 year old daughter as a gift. She loves it and uses it all the time. Easy to use! I also purchased the selfie lens.","So happy to have an instant camera in my life again. pretty inexpensive and so easy to use. i would definitely suggest buying a wholesale pack of film with it so you don't have to worry too much about wasting film as you try it out. the camera itself does not take photos well up close which can be slightly frustrating if you wanted to capture details as things tend to get washed out but thats not too much of a big deal for me as i knew what to expect.","I love this camera, but the colors are different than on the picture on the pink, the image need some improvement.","Love it !!!","So far, so good!","Great item decided to order another one but different color. :)","Picture size is rather small but the camera feels like a quality item and it is attractive.","works great!!! my daughter loves it...","Purchased this for my 11 yr old daughter for Christmas and she thinks its pretty neat. As adult remembering the old Polaroids, I just love it and will be getting one for myself soon.","Awesome","Excelente","My daughter loves her camera. As a Dad though I don't think the picture quality is that great. She is 14 and takes lots of pictures. Film is quite pricey too...","gives nice picture ,sturdy","I had a Polaroid camera when I was little so naturally I wanted another instant camera! This one is so great & not to large! I love it & it makes events so fun!","Best product I ever purchased","My daughter loves this","this was a gift for our granddaughter  - and she LOVES LOVES LOVES it!  Huge hit with her and her friends at her sleep over.","This is a perfect little instant camera.  I will be creating my own photo booth at my wedding reception next month and these are perfect for my little wedding party to have fun with.","The film is expensive!!<br /><br />But if you're looking to take Polaroid photos this is a great tool to satisfy your craving.","Arrived on time and on good conditions, very good quality..Thanks","This was a gift for my grand daughter and she loved it.  Worked perfectly for her birthday sleep over party.","LOVED IT","I love my camera!  The pictures show in great quality and it's super cute and fun to use!","Love this camera simple and easy to use brings back nostalgia of when I was young and my parents had a camera like this","Bought this for a friend of mine. She hasn't said anything bad about it, so the instant camera most be great. Well packaged!","Love this camera!!","Absolutely love these products! Took them on a trip to Portland and had so much fun with the filters. The camera is super easy to use and all the fun attachments are great.","Great bargain at almost 1/2 the price of the cost in a retail store. My daughter loves this camera i gave her as a 17 b'day gift.","Great camera!!","For my 14 year old. It's awesome. It's a freaking Polaroid but pics are smaller and film is .50/sheet. she LOVES it btw so who cares about moms opinion. It's on trend, fun, instant gratification, simple.","what a great way for instant pictures","Gave this camera to my grand daughter for her 13th Birthday. She loves it!","Awesome","I ordered this on Saturday night I believe, it arrived yesterday on Wednesday, on time. It arrived without the batteries, which is why I haven't four stars instead of five. It wasn't super inconvenient, I mean it's not hard to get batteries. The picture quality is good, and as expected. Usually if you take a picture in your house, the background of the picture isn't pretty dark. The flash can be a bit much. Sometimes so I usually put the setting on sunny if I'm already happy withheld gusting for the most part. I bought a 50 pack of film, if you do it that way it's a lot cheaper. I also bought a (fake) leather case and a selfie lens to go with it. The view finder for the camera is a little off so leave room for there to be a slight mistake in positioning. I am pretty happy with this purchase, it would be a cute gift for a young adult in high school who is making a lot of memories or if you are going on a trip somewhere. It's just nice to have. I recommend it.","Love it!","I like this camera for my stepdaughter, however I bought it because the picture looked more pink than red. I got it yesterday and it's definitely a very deep coral and not as light pink as the picture... Should have gotten the purple. But I already wrapped it for her birthday.","Amazing!love this camera! Only thing I don't like is that you have to keep buying film,but film is cheap! Love it! Totally recommend this","Best christmas gift ever!","Came in time and no complaints!","Great camera for the price. Easy to use and produces quality pictures.","I receive the camera in prefect conditions. I was looking for a Polaroid camera with a great prices. This was the cheapest one I found and I am super happy with it. I absolutely love it!!","Best camera ever! Prints the cutest little pictures and fun to play with! Love poloroids","This is our 2nd camera. We used it at my daughter's photo booth so we didn't have to pay $300+ on one! Worked great. First pic is always a test pic. Very happy with product. Only drawback is film is pricey, unless you buy multipacks. We bought 2 multi 6packs for $75 total! 120 pics worked great for our photo booth. Also wish it took larger size film, like original Poloroid cameras, but it does a good job. Great for on the go and fun for a teenager/young adult for a night out. Better shots are taken when taken up close, otherwise quality is compromised.<br /> It's definitely a gadget for fun, If you are more seasoned photographer/hobbyist, like myself, you may be disappointed.","Great item!!","It's literally the cutest thing, very aesthetically pleasing haha. As others mentioned it doesn't come with film which is a bummer since the film is a bit expensive. It came with batteries as described and is easy to use once you read the instructions. I can't wait to take it along with me on road trips!","This camera is so awesome!! I love it!  It seemed cheap because its made out of plastic which I was worried about at first but after carrying it around with me for 5 days in a row it is still in perfect condition.  The pictures are so cool and vintage.  Its like a little present every time you take a photo.","The quality of the photos when taken outside is crappy, but it's great for indoor pictures","Works great and is SUPER FUN!","love it","I love it!","Love this vintage camera","Super-fun camera.  Very easy to use.  Good quality.","Great camera","LOVE!","Love it","It is awesome!!!<br />Totally met my expectations!","Love it","Was delivered fast and is a really cool product . My fiancé was in love with it","Love it! Super cute and easy to use.","My daughter loved it a lot. She takes it to her school and takes picture with her friends. The pictures come out so cute. The camera is so pretty.","What a fun, nostalgic camera.  I guess these are very popular with the kids right now because my daughter's friends all love these too.  The Amazon price was much better than other places I've seen.","Really great and fun camera to use","I love this camera so much, I have taken nearly 20 photos since new years. Can be taken in any setting, since it has a quality flash. Just be careful before you snap a photo that it's on the correct setting, it will automatically be on house setting, but there are many options for the setting of the picture being taken. When you go to buy film buy it in bulk, much cheaper that way.","It should come with film. Major bummer.","This was just what our 16 yr. old grand daughter wanted, & she loves it.  Who knew today's kids would want a camera with film?","Description stated that batteries are included but they were not included when received.","Doesn't come with film.... just FYI! Don't make the same mistake we did! We took it to our friend's 30th birthday party and when she opened it and we went to put it together, no film :( Should come with at least a 10 pack in my opinion or clearer writing that it doesn't come with the film.","Ordered this for my granddaughter she loved it! Easy to work! And too cute!!!","happy birthday daughter","Cutest thing ever!","The girls really enjoyed this camera and we found it to be easy to use.  Thanks!","Love the Yellow color and the idea of capturing and print! It's way way easier and economical compared to the other competitor","It's came so quickly with Amazon Prime. Brand New so cute!!! And works! First camera I've ever had","The camera is great. Note, this specific one DOES NOT come with a pack of film, which I did not notice when ordering it.","Girlfriend loves it. It's cute and dainty and it still has the novelty.","As I expected. Was a gift to my fiance. She loved it.","Bought it for my 12 yr old daughter .. And i WANT ONE NOW!!!!!","It's awesome :)","this came in excellent condition and my daughter is having a lot of fun using it.","Bought this as a Christmas gift for our daughter. It seems to take nice quality photos, but nothing that will blow your socks off. She loves it though, so it was worth the price.","Its so cute I love it <3","Over all works good!! I love it, and really enjoy taking polaroids!!! The only prpblem, is the settings DO NOT change. So i cannot take cute photos at the beach in the sun:(  they just come out white. i heard people return theirs but i didnt wanna go through all that. It sucks. But over all i like this camera .","my niece was happy","My wife loves the camera. So far she is having a lot of fun with it. The seller shipped it right away and it arrived in a few days unscathed and in brand new condition.<br />The only bad thing is that this camera is definitely NOT PINK. It is a weird shade of orange. We were going to send it back but my wife was too excited to play with it and decided to just settle and live with the off color. Hopefully there is a case or something I can buy for her.","This was a gift and she loved it!","best!!!!","Love this! the first picture I took was beautiful and I couldn't believe how every picture turns out really well. I usually don't get excited enough about something to write a good review but this is definitely worth it. I love it I love it I love it.","Excellent","Cool little gift, lots of fun for the money.","Looks awesome! Can't wait to try!","Grand daughter loved the camera, uses it all the time.","Super cute! Perfect for taking pictures of special memories","It was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! It arrived quickly and was everything we hoped it would be.","I cannot wait to take this everywhere with me. I got a carrying case separately. My camera, sadly, did not come with the wrist strap! I took a picture of my plant... enjoy.","The camera came exactly as I expected, no surprises. It even came a day early! Great quality product, with the only downside that I can't take more than 10 photos per film cartridge. But there are so many bulk offers of film available online, even that isn't too disappointing. I highly recommend this product. Get snap-happy, my friends!","Love it!! It's nice and light. I did the faster shipping took two days. Ordered on Febuary 11,2016 and it got her Febuary 13, 2016 ans a little before 11:00 Am. So I really love it. It came with everything cause u ordered the camera accessories too so it was faboulus. I feel very kawaii!","Love it","I  gave this to my 8-year-old granddaughter for Christmas, and she loved it! She was visiting from out of town, recorded all her activities while she was with us, then went home with visual memories of her visit.","I just got my camera today! I LOVE IT!! It's soo cute!!","Great camera, awesome idea for a gift.","My teenager love  this camera and the instant pictures","No idea why the kids have drifted back to this style, but the film is insanely high priced, no use without the film, IMO if this had digital option, I would say sure, but this was a gift for a niece who really wanted it, so can't complain, just scratching my head as to why they would want them","This is a perfect gift, my daughter love it...","My daughter loves this camera and it takes great pictures.  So easy and fun to use.  A must for every girl to have!","I purchased 15 of these in assorted colors for a theme party.  Everyone also received a small photo album and two packs of film with instructions to use it tonight!  So much fun with a group of 30-40 yo women who had Polaroid cameras growing up.  Everyone enjoyed the photo keep sakes and then they took them home where their children had fun playing with the camera.<br /><br />Only downside is the coast of film at almost $1 per picture.  In the digital age you have to remind the kids every shot counts!","Bought this for my daughter for her birthday--she's used it nonstop since.  One caveat--the photos are about half as wide as typical Poloraids were when I was growing up--only about 2 inches wide.","I love it!!","my daughter loves this camera she is always taking pictures with it","Love!","My Grand daughter is just having TOO much fun with this. It was a Christmas gift. Now all she wants for gifts is more film. Pictures are clear and \"fun\" size.","Made a great gift for my best friend, she loves it and was so happy to receive it. It's adorable, lightweight, and intuitive to use, even for people who are used to digital photography.","I love this camera! It is easy to use, and is also really fun.","My daughter loves it. Brings back some old memories","I am absolutely in love with this polaroid camera!! It works wonderfully and produces quick and well-processed pictures easily. The film can be expensive so buying in bulk is usually the best option. Although the camera is difficult to fit in small-medium sized purses for day trips, it's a vacation must and an adorable accessory!!","A good buy for my daughter for Christmas she loves the camera and she gets a lot of use out of it only problem is is it's disposable film so expect to pay a lot and keep on paying for film","Got it opened it and loved it takes awesome pictures that look real retro","It captures great pictures. It's actually my new favorite toy. I love it so much. Good for travels, I would<br />Highly recommend.","I love love love this camera!","I'm over joyed with this! No complaints!!","I absolutely love it, simply and easy to use! It came earlier than expected, which is a plus. I would totally recommend this product, takes great & clear photos.","Very cute'' nice for unedited, candid pictures. Let be real, I hadn't developed the pictures on my phone for over 3 years! And now I have a ton of pictures :) yay love it! I would never have tangible pictures for scrapbooking ''''''","My daughter loves it. Works great.","So much fun!","Amazing product!! It’s so much easier to use than a Polaroid and the pictures turn out amazing!! Learning the different setting was pretty fun and the pictures turned out great. I love having physical pictures of my dog that I can keep for a long time. I do suggest using the strap though just in case, it does fall out of my hands pretty easily.","BEST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE!!! I'm so in love with this camera and the price was great and shipping was so fast! Thank you ","Retro!  My daughter has a chance to see how my parents did it back in the day.  She has pictures on the wall already.","Loved it, super cute, awesome pictures, but after a few days, the pictures in the sunlight come out with \"ghost-like\" marks, like white shadows. Pretty upset about it","Love it !","Awesome Product!!","Ok","GAVE IT AS A GIFT TO OUR GRAD DAUGHTER","very nice for 1st camera for my grandaughter,she loved it!","Great camera, does exactly what it says on the box, four stars because the film is pricey, understandable in this day and age but still a little more than I'd like to pay. The camera is a great price though. Build quality is stellar, the lens mechanism feels well made and the camera feels like it will stand up to a lot. We're using it at our wedding, great for a wedding scrapbook.","Absolutely cute!  I didn't even realize there were different editions when I ordered this. It's the newer model and my daughter was very happy. Grabbed the accessory variety pack to go along w it. Very pleased with the products and services.","We live in an age where smartphone cameras and social media have made photography and digital content accessible to just about anyone, at anytime, and at any place. Scrolling through Instagram and Snapchat feeds is both entertaining and sometimes adventurous. I am constantly amazed at people’s creativity.<br /><br />But sometimes our propensity to binge on media can dull our senses and cheapen our experiences. The intangible but infinite nature of digital content can leave us wanting. I mean, who hasn’t stayed up until the wee hours of the night browsing through their phone, wondering why life feels so empty in that moment? Existential crises have a tendency to arise when we sit unchecked in front of glowing blue screens.<br /><br />This is why I really appreciate instant film cameras. They are self-limiting. Taking a photo requires us to slow down and really think a shot through. And only one person can take a photo home. Pictures and memories become what they once were: rare, precious gifts.<br /><br />For these reasons I purchased the Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera for my wife. We instantly fell in love with it. For someone who wants their gear to be as artsy as the pictures they take, the Instax Mini 8 is the best instant film camera you can buy. The name of the product is a mouthful but it’s form and function are simple.<br /><br />Form<br /><br />The Instax Mini 8 has a solid build quality and doesn’t feel cheap. My wife usually carries it in her purse and we’ve yet to find any discernible scratches on the body. However, if you are concerned about scratching the lens you can find cases online.<br /><br />The camera just looks good. The angles and curves are elegant, giving off less of the “box-look” found in other instant cameras. These curves make the camera comfortable to hold, whether you’re taking normal pictures of selfies. There is also a vast selection of colors to choose from to fit personality type or outfit.<br /><br />Function<br /><br />The camera has two buttons. The button adjacent to the lens turns the camera on and the other functions as the shutter. They’re simple to use and unobtrusive to the design.<br /><br />The Instax Mini 8 also has different aperture settings depending on the lighting and environment. It will automatically recommend the best setting for you with a flashing LED.<br /><br />The viewfinder accurately frames shots. Pictures will come out looking like what you see in the viewfinder. The film chamber is also in the back. Inserting and ejecting film cartridges is quick and easy. There is also a film counter on the bottom right that displays the remaining amount of film in the camera.<br /><br />Image quality is what you’d expect from instant film. It is crucial to use the correct aperture settings on your shots. I accidentally used the indoor lighting setting at times so the pictures came out brighter than we expected.<br /><br />I can’t recommend the Instax Mini 8 Instant Camera enough. It makes a perfect gift for your wife, friend, girlfriend, or yourself. The pictures it takes will have a personal touch to them that will mean more to you and whoever you share your pictures with.<br /><br />This review was originally published by Geekskills at WordPress.","I love it! If buying a Polaroid, buy a lot of film and have fun with it. I've received a lot of compliments, it's easy to use, make sure to check the lighting settings before taking a picture!","Buy this camera. Just do it.","I got this for my 10 year old niece but I ended up using it all night long. I loved it. The pictures look great, the caMera is nice and solid and it looks cute. My niece loves it as well and has done lots of diy photo projects with it.","you cant take pics without flash:(","I got myself the yellow one and I bought my sister the pink one and they are so amazing. We received the package early and it was so neatly wrapped. If you are thinking about buying one then you should most definitely get one. They are so cute and take adorable little pictures.","Works great!!! So cute and such a great idea. My friends have even bought their own after using mine. Highly recommend.","We bought this for our 12 year old daughter who loves snapping photos of everyone and was wanting to start scrap booking (but I was rarely wanting to stop everything to print for her).<br /><br />The camera is simple enough she's been able to figure out how to use it with minimal help, she's thrilled with it and loves being able to instantly have her pictures.<br /><br />It's definitely just the old polaroid idea - just with smaller pictures (in a bit cuter format). Definitely stock up on the extra film though, we've noticed she does go through it ;-) And it does have to be bought separately.","It's nice..","Love it! The film is a little smaller than I expected but it had great quality, easy to use, relatively compact. The film packs are 10shot ea. so be sparing! The different light sensing modes work pretty well. All of my films have been clear and look awesome. Great deal here on amazon also.","Fast delivery & good product","My daughter thought this was the greatest thing ever made, she did not know the joys of an instant camera and had fun using this with her friends","Love the product! The manual is came with was easy to read and understand. A must-have for anyone who loves taking pictures!","New, unopened and in good condition.<br />No fails yet.<br />4 stars as the delivery was a bit later than the est. delivery.<br />Overall happy with the product.","As expected.","LOVE THIS CAMERA! So glad I bought it, its so much fun to use and it takes really good pictures if you make sure to change the light settings. I've dropped it probably 15 times too and sometimes from pretty high up and its still working. So its durable but obviously I don't recommend dropping it. I should probably buy a case for it at some point.","Everything great as expected","No problems with the film, easy to use.","Well my product never arrived but I am very grateful to Amazon for fixing my problem fast! I went out and purchased one of these at target (it wasn't this pretty color of course) and I am very happy with my purchase. Will definitely be buying another as a gift.","my granddaughter loves it!","Bought camera for wedding","I think the pictures should be a little better quality than what it produces.  When I was young, the pictures weren't so off in a distance.  You literally have to get on top of your subject in an effort to get a half-way decent picture of them.","Thank you.","Great mini camera.  Picture quality was ok for selfies.. My niece enjoyed it","Great!","Great present for my teenage daughter.","My daughter loves this camera! Easy to use & picture quality is good, film is expensive though.","Girlfriend loves it","Love it! So cute and light. Everything I expected it to be and more!","great camera, my daughter loves it","I love my mini camara, it takes beautiful pictures. definately will take it with me my next vacations. wish did't have to order the case and other things separate.","I like the camera","Great gift for a tween!","My daughter loves this camera, particularly the selfie feature.  These are small photos, but perfect for what she wants them for.","Everything I expected! :)","I am in love with this camera!!! It takes clear pictures and you can choose the setting you are in. Indoors, outdoors, in the shade, or night.","best Polaroid ever. 100% recommend!","This camera is the cutest thing and works so well! I love it!!","Love","Very well received and thoroughly enjoyed.  Great photos too!","My daughter uses it when her friends come over, but is a little to large for a teenager to travel with.","I love love loveee it. I was a bit hesitant to buy it because of the price. Great quality for the the price. And it literally shipped in one day. So satisfied ","Its cool. Love the color, shape and size.  The only drawback is its a bit hard to figure out the light setting to use in different situations.  It takes a couple pics to get it right.","Amazon prime","My daughter loves this camera","Wonderful product","Amazing i live it","Had no problems with it! (: MUST GET!","Once you passed the initial emotion, you realize this is not practical nor economic to use.  So If you have the extra bucks and don't care small unique pictures (no copies possible), then it's a nice TOY.  I bought this for my doughter, she's happy with it... so far.  Let's wait until picture cartridge is finished... :(","This is such a hit with friends. I have used this at a friend's baby shower for guests to pin photos with a wish for the baby written on them and also took it to a nearby orphanage. The photos are a great party favor.","I bought this for my daughter's 11th birthday. She absolutely loves it. It's easy to use and the cartridges are simple to put in. The film is a little expensive but she loves this camera. She's putting together a scrapbook with her pictures. I wish I would've bought one for myself.","this camera honestly is the best thing ever.. i was kinda iffy to buy at first because of all the things people were saying about it being defective but so far it's turned out great. this one thing i really love about it is that the cameras flash will literally make your face look flawless af.","Awesome small camera to carry around anywhere and takes very cute unique photos! Love love love mine","My fifteen year old loved it.  She and her friends were bewildered by the development of the pictures.","This camera is fun to use! Only downside is that mine will not take pictures in the sunlight, or low light they get washed out completly. I reccomend indoor lighting or overcast for a usable poloroid. Mine may be faulty because I have seen other people take good pictures outside. Just something to think about! Otherwise I love using it.","The rasberry color is NOT PINK! It is RED! My daughter was disappointed so I just wanted to let you know. Also does not come with any film so be sure to order some.","The picture pops out the top like a toaster! Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehe","great pictures","A fun camera. Having a tangible image in-hand seems to be bring excitement back to photography, especially, to the \"miliennials.\" I hope Fuji can increase the format size, in the future.","I love this camera.!","Awesome","It was really nice and pictures came out great awesome gift for my girlfriend and it was a quick delivery very nice!!!","SERIOUSLY SO MUCH FUN!!! buy this camera! i love love love it. nothing like the instant gratification an instant film camera gives you. :)","Fast shipping! Very satisfied with this item.","Super cute color. Pics are very good quality!","so fun a bit bulgy, but i love it!","Absolutely great. This tiny camera takes some of the best pics ever. I very highly suggest this product","My daughter loves this camera!  Pictures come out clear & camera quality is great!  Def brings it back to when I use to use a polaroid 30 years ago.  ;)","It was everything I expected. I was worried about buying it but its simple, affordable, and just everything I expected.","Works good. But is weak with poor ligth","This takes the cutest little pictures! Obviously it's not a high end \"super camera\", but it's fun and the pictures turn out pretty well. My husband got me the pink one for Christmas, along with the matching album and carrying case. The pictures are about the size of a credit card, and there's a space below the picture for a notation. Please understand, you're not buying the equivalent of a Nikon or Canon or Sony, but just a fun camera that will produce small photos instantly. I was somewhat surprised at the size of the actual camera. For some reason I thought it would be smaller. It's not something you could fit in a pocket or comfortably carry in a purse. I'm having a lot of fun with it, and people are amazed when they see the camera in action!","got this for my 9 year old and he loves it takes great vivid photos","Nice","This was my 7 year old niece's favorite birthday gift, she flipped out.  She wouldn't stop playing with it all day, carried it everywhere with her.  The only bummer is the cost of the film, it's a little high.","Bought this for our girls for Christmas - they have had so much fun with it. Easy to use. Easy to load the film into.. of course they are going through a lot of film but thier smiles and laughter even it out!","I ordered this for my daughter & she loves it.","INSTANT PCITURES! My wife absolutely love this camera. It brings a totally different feel to taking pictures knowing that it is limited, unlike the unlimited photos on a phone. There's always the mind set that it costs over $1 per picture though we always have to make sure our smiles are right. Every picture so far has been great. The retro look is cool.","Works as expected.","LOVE IT! It's so fun to capture memories with this Instax camera! I got mine for $65 when my friend got hers in stores for $100!","My daughter loves her new camera.  Color is nice and bright.  Easy to use.","Great camera! Bought this for my 10 year old daughter, she loves it. Takes nice pictures.","I love this camera!!","I absolutely love this!!! It met my expectations greatly!","Grand daughter loves this camera. Now older daughter wants one!","Love it! Film is too expensive though!","Bought for my daughter for Christmas and so far it has been good. Takes good instant photos. Not professional or digital quality. Great for my kids to make scrap book or photo albums.","I just received my fujifilm instax mini 8!!! So far, so good! It is everything I expected it to be. I hope it continues to be a well worth buy. <3","This camera is cute! I ended up returning it because I just didn't see myself using it, but it's an awesome gift for kiddos !! Brings back memories","Very cute, soft yellow color. Takes great insta photos. We took this with us to NYC and my daughter used it to take photos of the sights in NYC. It takes great photos and it's a blast from the past with the insta photos.","love it","Extremely cute I love it","Arrived exactly as picture.  Easy to use.  Takes good pictures for a polaroid.  THe kids have been having a blast with this.","A pretty cool device but their are some flaws on it. The switch botton is kinda near the view finder. It would cause ur finger to block it. Sensor can be improve making it faster to.switch mode. Great buy for a price but the film is kinda pricy. So make sure make a great pose and smile before you shoot.","Awesome little camera with a vintage look!","I received the camera and the seal was broken on the bottom of the box and there was no inside. The box looks very Worn.  stinks because I'm giving as a gift. I'm asking for replacement.","Best Instax for the price. Best gift under $100 for your girlfriend, fiancee, mums, or your wife. Although this is my first Instax(not my Instax as this is a gift to my wife). But anyway, this is my observation.<br /><br />Pro :<br /><br />1) The pink color is very light and subdue, which for me is very beautiful. It does not strike out like crazy pink<br />2) The picture quality is superb. I do own several Fujifilm cameras, ranging from $1000 upwards and I know Fujifilm camera produces superb quality image<br />3) It is very easy to use. Almost foolproof I would say. Human with the slightest intelligence can use it.<br />4) It do have 5 modes : indoor, cloudy, sunny, extra sunny, high<br />5)The strong point of Fujifilm vs other Instax (Polaroid,Kodak,etc) is for me, Fujifilm produce the most beautiful and accurate skin tone. The flash is intelligent enough to sense the environment I am currently in and adjust accordingly, resulting for a perfect image.<br /><br />Cons :<br />1)Plastic<br />2)Expensive film<br />3)Kinda weird shape<br />4)Does not look as stylish as the other Instax<br /><br />Final say :<br /><br />If image quality is your priority and kinda hard on the cash, get this one. You will not regret it. If you have extra money to burn, go for Fujifilm Wide Instax. If you don't really care about money and just want to buy some fancy looking Instax, get a Polaroid.","My 24 year old daughter has LOVED this since the day we got it! Film is a little pricey, but you know that before you buy it, so worth it in our book!","loveee!","I bought this for my SO and she loves it!","I'm in love with this camera the moment I opened it in the box!!! This is so fun and so cute!!!","I really like my camera. I got the raspberry color and its almost a rust color so its not too girly for my husband to snap a picture here or there.<br /><br />The only con is that the pictures I took inside were a little darker than Id like.","I'm in love with it! great product!","Great camera, daughter loves the pink &<br />Great price !!","Very happy with my purchase!!! I love my fujifilm camera and the color is such a beautiful shade of pink.","My 11 year old loves this!! It is reminiscent of the pics you seen as a kid but better and a little smaller so cool!!","Absolutely love this camera!!","Cool camera and even cooler pictures.  Perfect for our 8 year old.","Brand new, item came as described and love the instant pictures! Very happy and glad I decided to buy this.","My four year old had so much fun with it! Easy to aim and shoot! And he did all 20 pix well!","Nice camera","Love it!!!","perfect","Pictures are not that great but my daughter llikes it.","Works great! Cute design","Its great","great camera for my teenage daughter.  The film is rather costly","daughter loves it","Great camera and perfect gift. Only downside is that it does not come with film so be sure to purchase film with the camera!","Great camera came in 6 days new awesome quality it was exactly how I expected","I bought this camera for my girlfriend on our anniversary and she loved it so much!","Came a day later than 2-day priority.","This camera is amazing. The photos look great, the camera is easy to use. 10/10.","Easy to work with. Lots of fun.","Best substitute since the polaroid 600 :)","Perfect!","I love the camera but the pics are very small. When the pics come out, the actual size of the pic is Smaller than the size of a credit card.","So amazing!! Pictures even better than I thought they would be!","I brought it for my daughter for Christmas and she love it as well as others. I tell them that I bought it off of Amazon.  I like the little photos it reminds me when I was a little girl we had cameras that printed out poloriod it comes to show you how things have a way of coming back around","She is off at college and just loves it!","Excellent","I love this little camera. Shipping took a little longer than I hoped for but product is great. Fun, portable and cute. Went through so much film already. Only thing about it, is you have to make sure you put the light setting on the one it tells you to or your pictures may turn out over lighted or dark.","Great buy ","I absolutely love this camera! it is a great way to scrapbook and actually have tangible pictures. with so much technology we hardly go and print out our pictures. this camera instantly captures priceless moments and leaves you with a copy of the picture. it is cute and vintage color makes it a lot better.","small pictures but good for what it does.","So cool and nostalgic with great picture quality.  Was a gift for my 8 year old and she had no problem taking great pics and was very easy to use and very fun!","Love this item!! Great buy! Great quality !","Granddaughter loved her birthday gift. Film is a little pricey but she is using the camera wisely.<br />Well packaged.","Good deal.","Bought as a gift for my daughter. She loved it!!","Bought this for daughters 18th birthday! She loves it! Little bit of a learning curve with framing the shot. Takes me right back to the 70's!","This camera has made my life a whole new world XD I love it I have taken so many pics with me and my friends and family they love it too I bought this thinking this camera is my first make the best of it and from the first day It arrived  (on my birth day) I was so happy Amazon said that it would be here on Feb first I was so sad then it said it was coming right at 8 o-clock on my birth day I was so happy and I could take some pics while some people where leaving it came just in time and my birth day was the best the Amazon","I rarely leave reviews but this time I feel this camera is worth the trouble. I bough two of these one for me and one for my daughter as a gift. We both love it and recommended it for my brothers. I took it to the family gathering and gave it to the children to take a few shots. We laughed a lot at photos taken by them and one of my brothers said he'd bring one for his daughter. It is sold in a bookstore here in Riyadh but it is cheaper at Amazon. I like the accessories especially the frames and the album. In fact, this is the main reason we bought it.<br /> I am giving it 4 stars because the picture is too small. It is not good to capture events or scenes. It is good for selfies with friends and family.","So much fun! Love this playful camera. It's kinda big but I don't mind.","Bought for my daughter....LOVE LOVE LOVE...it's an instant camera so the pics look a bit vintage.  If you want digital quality, buy a digital camera.  If you want a super cute vintage print to hang in the shappy chic room...this is for you.  Pics are approx credit card size.","This was for my ex girlfriend u.u never got to enjoy it.","Cool!","Finally a gift for my teenage granddaughter she really likes and uses!","Arrived as expected","Got one for my sister and she loves it","It is a really good camera","Poor quality photos but retro, I suppose.","Nice and easy to use!","So easy to use. Expensive but worth it as I had wanted one for a long time. My friend bought a different brand that allows you to choose which pictures to print out, which you don't get with this one. However the quality is impeccable, it really makes life & parties look so much cooler.","Huge hit and Amazon had the best price!","Loved it! Just what i expected!","Happy with my product!","Our granddaughter is having fun with the camera","Excellent, easy to use, love the size of the photos! They are so fun to watch develop.","Bought for my 6 year old and she absolutely loves it. Pictures are clear and the camera is very sturdy. Has been dropped several times and still works with no issues.","My daughter loves her new camera, came fast too","Love it","Fun little camera.  My 12 year old daughter LOVES hers!!","I returned the item only because the color is more of a dull red than a rasberry color. Otherwise, I'm sure the camera would have been fine.","Thank you for the camera.  It arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and it was my granddaughters favorite gift.","I bought this for my daughter. Film is pricey but it is what she wanted.","Bought this for my little sister. She loves it! I wish film was cheaper but it's great anyways.","Love this. I've wanted one for so long. I wish the pictures were a little bigger. But I knew what I was getting, so no effect on the rating.","Came just as expected ! Came in perfect condition! Also came with batteries and a string for the camera. Absolutely love it !","Just as advertised.","Works PERFECTLY! Such a worth it buy. (:","Great product","5 star","The Polaroid camera is back! We have had a lot of fun using this camera in a variety of ways. You go through the film very quickly and it isn't cheap. I wouldn't use this on a regular basis, but for special parties and events it is a lot of fun.","My daughter who is in college has loved the camera! Works great, easy to use.","love it!","My daughter loves this instant film camera. Fuji should have 2 types of film, the current size and the original polaroid size.

Came complete. No complains","This is so much fun and good pictures","Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Perfect gift for s teen. My teenager loves it!","Very simple to use, just point and shoot. Great for all ages to use. I love the spontaneity and novelty of the pictures (which most people may not). The softness of colors, slight viginettes, and other effects due to the nature of the camera make every photo look vintage. I will attach some photos when I have time. For first time instant camera owners, I'd recommend buying a bulk pack of film (even if you don't get a lot of user-errors with photos, you'll just want to keep taking and taking them) as well as an accessories set if you like to play around with photography. I purchased the NODARTISAN package, which brings lots of cute filters, a case, and other items.","bought this for my son and hes had fun with it.","good","I was about to give five stars for this review when I found out that the strap of the camera was missing. Ouch","Excelent purchases","Love this product! The film is expensive but definitely worth it.

I use it plentiful and no problems so far. It is well designed and better than the previous model. I recommend getting this and a designed film to make the photo look even better! It is easy to use and lightweight! I would've liked there to be a little more to the camera but for the price it is fair.","Love this camera! Everyone had so much fun taking pics with this at the birthday party! & Everyone wanted one after they played with it! =] It was a really cute and clever party favor for the parents and kids to take home with them! I think the picture turns out really nice as long as your up close and personal with good lighting! =]","They love it, works really well!","100% PERFECT!","Love it. Takes cute pictures","The camera it's self is amazing only thing is if you get it there is no film with the camera. You would have to go but it separately. When I got mine the battery wasn't working,<br />So if you get it make sure you have film and extra batteries .","great","My granddaughter is having so much fun with this camera.","Easy to use, super cute and portable. This does not come with written English instructions, but picture instructions, which at first were slightly confusing, but ultimately understandable. It is a hit at all parties I take it to!","This camera is incredibly cute, and as an owner of the rose one, I must say that I love the color. It also has a nice weight to it without being heavy, and pretty easy to use.","Bought as a gift and liked it so much I had to buy myself one as well","This camera is super cute and instant.

Easy to use.  We purchased for our 14 year old as a birthday gift.","This camera and case arrived on time and brought a huge smile to my granddaughter. She loves it.","Great","I bought this as a birthday gift for my 9 year old niece. She loved it and thought that it was really cute. The adults loved it too because it reminded us of the old Polaroid cameras from our childhoods!  The only negative is having to buy film.","Okay, but a bit of a teen toy.  Does not take quality photos at all, but it was fun for a party.","So much fun and easy to use!","Super fun. Wish the film wasn't so pricey.

I tried researching how to fix it online & it said the best solution was to replace the bulb for the flash. :( Sounds like too much of a hassle for me. So I wanted a thing of film & am getting ready to return it. I bought another one because I still REAALLY want one. hopefully this one works! fingers crossed","Came right on time.

Makes great pictures!","Thank you; what I wanted.","Great birthday present for my daughter.","Nice camera. Although it's easy to waste a shot because the settings aren't highly customizable. Also, once you're out of film, there's no point in using this camera! I wish I bought the Snap Polaroid because it's SD card supported. But hey I don't care because this was a gift to my GF and she liked it. So.... Whatever!","My Granddaughter was happy to get the extra film. She us having lots if fun with her friends.","This is a great and easy camera to use. It is a great quality camera that you can carry around with you at all times.","Just what she wanted. Thanx.","Not for everyday.  Film is $$. But fun to mess around with.","This camera is fantastic!  These marketing folks really need to pat themselves on the back for bringing Polaroid-style cameras back.  The color is so beautiful and I just know my daughter will love it!  (P.S.  I want one for myself O_O)","Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She loves it.  Takes great little pics.  The blue is very pretty.

Work great.","Bring the good old days back with this one. You wont get HD prints out of this but you will get a quality photo right then and there. The camera itself seems built to last.

Absolute love","It's a neat little camera, but we seem to get a lot of pictures that won't develop.","Bought it for my daughter for x-mas.  She loves it - and has been snapping pics ever since.","my daughter wanted one for her birthday and she got it.  So easy to use and like the old instant cameras, easy to use.  The pictures are small, however that is what the kids want now a days.","Favorite gift of Christmas!  Love the retro design and color.","LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera. Easy to use, I haven't dropped it so I wouldn't know how durable, but it's plastic so I guess it'd be ok if your clumsy. Takes swell pictures. Sometimes the pics come out too dark, but it's not the cameras fault. Bad lighting is all. I recommend this. And the price is fair.","Very fun to use but the camera hole is kinda small hard for people with glasses to get a good picture","funky","This was a big hit at our Christmas Party!  Everyone kept asking where I had purchased it.  Amazon has everything!","A+++++","Awesome!!!","This camera is so cute and came in very good packaging also. I recommend to buy it here since its much cheeper for the same product you buy at any other store for $120. I got the Blue one amd its the same exact color as shown!","Fun item to have","Bought for my 11 year old for Christmas and has lived it. Film is a little pricey, but she's learned to be more selective with pictures she takes with it.","Device as expected! Good stuff and very fast arriving to my place","i love it! the quality of the photo is nice and i did not even expected it to be this nice. what an awesome find indeed.and plus, the color is a total eye candy. love it!","Bought it for vacation","I purchased this product for my teenage daughter for Christmas. She absolutely LOVED it!!! She has used it constantly. The color was perfect and the price was great. She was very pleased!","The camera was a favorite Christmas gift and the yellow was the perfect color choice for my granddaughter.  (Made me a really popular grannie)","Love this camera. Was a perfect gift for my daughter. She loves the fact it prints the picture after you take it. Only downfall is it can only do ten pictures on one thing of film and that gets a little pricey. But all in all great camera and great gift.","I got this for my 8 year old. She loves it.","My 19 year old daughters favorite gift!","I bought it for my sister, and she absolutely loves the camera, the pictures always turn out really pretty, everyone looks good on the pictures, alwaays haha.","My daughter was very happy with her camera, delivery time was awsome thank you.","It is the best!!! It is so easy to use and so much fun.","My 13 year old daughter was very excited","My daughter was happy!","Granddaughter loves this camera.","Great throwback to the original Polaroid cameras! The pictures are small, but right up the alley to my daughter who received it as a gift.","The picture came out dark but I my daughter loves it so I guess it works out","this product is not limited edition no matter what anyone says. its a new colour including the grape colour. it also does not come with a selfie mirror, because thats the fujifilm instax mini 8+, which does not come in raspberry or grape yet. overall this is an amazing camera and i cannot wait to get one, its totally worth the price considering its almost $100 at Michael's or BJs.","Loved IT","Love it","Obsessed!!! This is such a fun and great quality camera! I can't believe I didn't purchase sooner!","All good.","Love it! Picture quality came out wonderful","Arrived very fast. Great quality.","This is one of my favorite products that I have bought recently.  It is very user-friendly and easy to use. My 9-year old niece can operate it easily.<br /><br />You would not believe how excited people get when this comes out at a party or event!  The older crowd gets that \"Polaroid nostalgia\" and those that are too young to remember instant cameras are completely fascinated by it!","Love it!","My daughter really enjoys her camera.  She needs more film.","I bought this for my little sister (age 14). She didn't ask for this gift or expect it. The look on her face was priceless when the picture came out of the camera.<br /><br />You have to get up really close to people when you take the picture. Keep this in mind since the film is very expensive.","Loved it! Used it at a Hannukah community event to take pics of kids and the kids put them in the holiday frames they decorated. Obviously the pics don't come out like regular photos with normal camera, but I didn't expect it to. Kids really enjoyed it. Only problem is that as all the reviews stated, the film is very expensive. I wish it were cheaper. Otherwise, GREAT camera, GREAT price, GREAT buy!","Muy buena","I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for a Christmas gift. It was the only thing she asked for. It was exactly as described and is so easy to use. We've both had fun with it!! The only problem I have is the film is pretty pricey for only 10 pictures per package of film.<br />All in all I'm super happy with the purchase and so is my daughter!","Bought this for my 12 year old. It was exactly what she wanted. Easy enough for her to set up and put film in even without reading directions.","I love this thing so much, I'm buying both my nieces one for Christmas.","My graanddaughter requested this camera for Christmas and seems pleased with it. I bought the warranty for loss or breakage because she has lost a camera in the past.","Súper dooper!! WHAT a blast!!!","It's a little Polaroid. It's fun to play with.","Granddaughter loved it.","My daughter got this for Christmas & just loves it!  She is having so much fun with her friends & family and is loving the pictures on her wall!","first of all, this camera is amazing. it is super adorable and i love it! the first picture i took came out perfect. after that they were all blank! i checked amazon reviews and i saw that if you take out the package after it is started, the pictures have been exposed to light and they will come out blank. luckily, i had bought a few more packs so i made sure not to mess around with those. just make sure not to open the back after the pack is started, or the pack will be ruined. i gave it four stars because it is perfect but the company didnt write about that and i lost so much money.i just wanted to give you that tip before you start taking pictures.","Exactly what we wanted","exelent","I've been wanting an Instax Mini for years and I finally treated myself! I couldn't be happier. I was able to try out one in person before. I fell in love instantly with a memory developed right in front of your eyes. It's cool to have. I know it's going to be sort of an investment with the film, but I think it makes everything more worth while and buying the twin pack from Amazon is the best deal for that. I've always been a huge fan of photo booth pictures so this camera is right up my alley. I like to really think about the photo before taking it to insure I get what I want. It's nice to think of the perspective and lighting and background of each photo. I just love being able to have a physical copy right away, it's romantic. I also love the pink color of the camera, it's so cute and my friends love it too. The camera shape itself is sort of large in my hands, but it's really easy to use. I'd recommend it if you're interested!","Super cute! I love the pictures. I ordered the camera with the twin pack of film and I'm not sure if you'd get any film if you do not purchase the camera on its own (mentioning this because I almost skipped out on buying the extra film since I assumed it came with some). But all in all I love it!","I was really excited to receive this camera but pretty disappointed that it didn't work on the trip I wanted to use it on. Not really sure what I did wrong because it worked fine inside but when I tried to take pictures outside it wouldn't develop properly. Guess I have to stick to taking pictures inside.","great for a gift or something fun for yourself. i bought an extra pack of film separately but it does come with a pack of 10 prints!!","my 14 year old daughter loves it! Great keepsakes of memories instantly! Christmas was extra special this year!","I love my camera, just wish it picked up more light. The pictures come out fairly dark, but it's an instant camera so it's understandable. Very fun to have and use though.","great","Daughter laugs and cute","Fun camera, takes great photos in any lighting situation. Great choice for an instant camera and the film is much cheaper than polaroid exposures.","bought this for my gf she loved it exactly what i expected and what she wanted worth the money and there pretty durable drop it about twice already still works perfect lol","Camera works as expected taking excellent photos!","This is a super fun camera. Enjoyed it at Christmas went the family. The teenagers actually enjoyed it!  Perfect credit card size pics. I've given twice as a gift I since my  original purchase!","Bought this for a Christmas gift. They seem to be happy with it.","This camera would have been worth 5 stars had the camera not came in with technical malfunctions. It was stuck on one setting the entire time, the houses symbol setting. Taking any picture outside and the photos always came out either all black or white. Even pictures inside weren't guaranteed as they came out completely dark most of the time. I just requested to return it to buy another one but upset I've gone through 30 film sets with the majority printing out ruined.","My daughter absolutely loves this camera! We got it for her for Christmas, the color is so pretty! It actually takes good quality pictures as well, the only downside is the film can be a bit pricey but besides that we love it!","LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS POLAROID! It takes wonderful pictures, and I personally just love that I can take pictures and have a printed copy seconds later vs. digital copies of pictures. There are 5 settings and it will tell you which one to set it to before you take the picture, perfect for beginners. I took it on my road trip and had a blast with it. One of the best things I've purchased off amazon! Definitely worth the money in my opinion!","Great gift for my Mom and sister. They love it. Thanks!","Can not say enough about this camera.  It brings back memories of the true polaroid camera.  The pictures come out so well.  Small enough to take anywhere, and the pictures develop instantly.","Santa sent this camera to my 5 yr old daughter. She figured out how to use it in minutes but I have to load the film. She's obsessed and uses it constantly for her artistic expression. Silly girl even took it to Walmart to capture her day.","I love this camera.  The film is sorta expensive but it's totally worth it.","As a guy, I fond white colored objects just like this one.","I LOVE this polaroid camera. I have had this camera for almost a year and the memories captured are amazing. You always need to remember to have extra film when you are out and about to restock. It takes a few test shots to work the camera and know what setting to put it in. It recommends what setting to take a picture with so that suggestion is very helpful.","my little sister loves getting this camera for Christmas! it works well and the pictures look great!","small pictures, but accurate","These are awesome! Reminds of when I was a kid.  Anyway easy to use and my 10 year old loves it.","Granddaughter loves it.","I got this camera for my birthday. I've operated Polaroid cameras, SLR film cameras, and DSLRs, so I was excited to get a new type of camera to play around with.  It took me a while to get used to it because it is a low tech camera (sort of like a Polaroid camera which I haven't operated in years) but after I got used to it I got some really beautiful images. There is a ring that lets you adjust the exposure from an inside setting to a bright and sunny setting. There is also a Hi Key setting that amps up the brightness in your photos.  There is a little light indicator that suggests what setting to set the dial to. In my experimentation I have found that the suggestion is usually accurate.  However, I've found that these photos tend to be more on the overexposed side so adjusting the ring to a different setting may be necessary (if you are unfamiliar with f stops, the sunny setting is the highest stop which means it lets in the least amount of light. The house icon would let in the most light).  Anyway, I would suggest sticking with what setting the camera suggests.  Also, it's worth noting that the flash always fires.  Some people have put electrical tape over the flash to soften their images but I haven't experimented with it yet.  I suggest reading up on this camera before taking photos. There are all sorts of tutorials and tips on the internet that you might find helpful. This is really important because you will run through your film quickly and it's not cheap stuff.  Overall it's a really fun camera to own and it gives you instant gratification. There's nothing quite like having a photo that you can hold in your hand and this camera will provide you with that joy.","My daughter wanted this so bad for Christmas, so I got it for her. She loves it, but she's also a teenager. This is definitely not caught up to 2016 speed for electronics, but if you don't care about that, it's fun to play with.","I am in love with my Polaroid camera! It was really easy to use and the color looks amazing.","Love this camera! The pictures are small, but they always look great, and it's very easy to use. It's just a standard point-and-shoot camera that anyone can use, and there's a little ring around the lens that you can turn to put it at different lighting settings. The nice thing is that the camera recognizes your surroundings and has a light that tells you which setting is recommended. The pictures print out and develop within a minute, and I know you can buy different types of film with cute borders although I've only used the standard white so far.<br /><br />I have the camera sitting on my shelf when I'm not using it and it looks really cute, and I taped up some hemp cord and got little clothespins to display my pictures on the wall. Like I said, the pictures always turn out looking great simply because they're that \"polaroid\" style.","Flash works unclear. Many photos are spoiled.","The receiver of this gift has been using it daily since they got it!","Love it. Easy to use.","This is the CUTEST camera for a teenager. There's the instant gratification part because the pictures come out immediately. Mini pics that they can share with friends. The camera is cute and comes in different colors like this sweet pink. Price was right and film is not terribly expensive. Definitely nice when you don't want to go digital.","I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It's so easy to use and I love how the pictures come out very vintage. The only downside is that the film is expensive.","awesome camera... great gift for a preteen, or anyone who loves instant cameras!","Love this. It's super fun. I wish I'd had it for my best friend's bachelorette party. I had this great idea to make a little scrap book and have everyone write advice/jokes in it and put a picture of each person on the pages they wrote on. It was a GREAT idea. Six years later I STILL haven't printed the pictures I took. I SO wish I could have had this back then. It would have been PERFECTION!","I liked these fun funky colours!","My mother loves this Christmas gift!!!  Quality is that of polaroid pictures of our youth and that is totally fine!  Easy to operate and load with film.  Great gift idea!!","I am in love with this camera! It is so cute and super easy to use. I can't wait to take more pictures :).","LOOOOVVEEE","cute!","My daughter loved it for christmas","Shoot great photos. In love with it!","I love it takes great pictures","great job","Granddaughter loves it","great","Great looking camera. The color is awesome. For the most part, the pictures develop as expected. I have had some issues with lighting affecting the quality of the picture. All in all, a fun camera.","Bought as a gift and it was exactly what my daughter wanted.  Make sure to buy a case, lots of film, and a coordinating photo album for the mini8 photos.","Works great and love it, lots of fun. Was a christmas present. The settings are a bit confusing but just playing around with it is all that's necessary. Awesome!","Very cute.  Easy to use.  Pictures are not great though.  Obviously, I didn't expect digital quality, but they are all really dark.  Fun for 9 year old daughter, but learned to take pics outside for better quality.  Note that these are not the same size pics as the old polaroid square ones.  These are much smaller.","I've had my camera for a good 5 months now and it works great. The battery life is great the photos are great everything works fine. Picture quality is cool and vintage but you have to remember if the lighting is too bright or too dark the picture won't come out too great. But you'll figure out what works best through trial and error. I took my camera on a trip to New York with me and it took wonderful pictures of the 911 memorial and new World Trade Center building but didn't take good pictures in the dimly lit museum of natural history. I would buy one again I this one ever broke","Such a fantastic product. Easy set up and instructions are simple to set up. Film must be purchased separately. The mini picture quality is excellent! I cannot wait to use my little memory photos for scrapbooking:)","Huge hit at the birthday party.  My daughter and her friends had a blast taking photos that \"you can like have\".  They shot up 2 packs of film the first day.  And now its sat on her shelf for three months.  It takes pretty poor, tiny, photos.","My daughter loves this camera. She takes it everywhere and snaps away! Very good quality and the color is so pretty!","FujiFilm Instax Mini 8 with Strap and Batteries (Blue) Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Thanks!","Does it come with a charger","great!!","I love my new camera","We love this thing and it was a Christmas hit!<br />CON: Didn't realize it didn't come with \"film\". Had to buy separate after Christmas but that my problem for not reading fine print.","Beautiful","I bought this as a christmas gift for my 14 year old sister and she absolutely loved it and said it was the best gift she's gotten (I won't lie, I loved it too). The shipping took longer than expected and arrived after christmas, but it was worth the wait. The picture quality is wonderful and perfect for capturing memories. I would definitely recommend to anyone.","love it","It's was great .","Great product. I am very happy with it. I would highly reccomend.","Great","I love this camera! I ordered at the end of the week and I had it by Sunday evening, which was 4 days earlier than anticipated. The pictures taken are so clear, and the its easy to use with very few buttons to worry about. This camera is MUCH better than the ones I grew up using years ago, and the price difference on the film for them isn't all that different.","This has quickly become my 14 year old's favorite play thing!  She carries it everywhere and is always taking pictures.  I still cannot believe that we are back to polaroid picture taking, but what a cute way to do it!  I do wish the film wasn't so expensive, but my daughter isn't complaining.","My niece uses it all the time! Her favorite Christmas gift.","I got it as a present for christmas from my parents. I picked the pink one put myself and they ordered it for me! It came on time and is amazing with pictures!! I love the Polaroid quality in all my pictures!!","My daughter loves this camera. It's super cute and easy to use.","Bought this as a present for my wife. she loves this camera. She has already used it on many parties including bachelorette party and for granmother's 80th birthday. She used the pictures for a scrapbook and it is a hit at every event.","Such an awesome camera! Was on the fence about buying it, so glad I did! It's prefect for vacations! Easy to use and film isn't too terribly expensive.","beautiful ..","It is a toy, but a lot of fun!","My 11 year old daughter got this for Christmas and LOVES it.  Her and her friends think it is simply amazing!","No the best camera ever. It is very light weight and feels fake. It is chunky and the button to take the pictures is in a weird location. The instructions that came with it are not clear on how to adjust for lighting differences. My daughter dropped it one time and the battery casing lid broke off. I wouldn't buy this again for 80.00. Maybe its worth $30 or $40 but $80 is a joke.","def sturdy, cute color, but it did not come with the film that it said it does!","Fast shipping, great product!","Love it just didn't come with a strap so that sucks","Fellas, get this for your girl. Be ready to smile. She will love it.","My daughter has had so much fun with this!  Seems to work well.","Purchased this camera for my wife who is a professional dslr photographer. She was super excited about it and still is. It is obviously very different from a dslr and has a learning curve with it, but overall she has enjoyed using it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a little fun with a Polaroid camera.","Bought as a gift for my niece, needless to say I am the best aunt in the world this year!","I love it !","I bought this in 2013 as a gift to myself and I couldn't be happier with this purchase! The camera is super cute, especially in powder pink. The photos are a bit hit or miss with quality if you don't learn how to use the settings properly. I recommend doing some research on how to take the best photos with this camera so that you don't waste any of the film, which can be pretty pricey. The biggest problem I have with this camera is that whenever I use it, everyone wants their photo taken too (and film isn't cheap!!). Instax cameras are especially fun and useful now, in a time when our lives are saturated with digital images—having a physical photo you can look at in the past to bring back old memories is precious. I keep a few Instax pictures of my boyfriend and me on my bedside table and hang up ones with friends and family on my bedroom wall.","exactly what my daughter wanted. Perfect gift for a teen","Love it so much","My boyfriend and I take pictures with this constantly!  Since I bought it he's decided to order one of his own.  The pictures are adorable and so personal.  I think we often forget how sentimental we are; it's nice to be reminded of that.","Love this camera","SUCH a fun camera! The price is pretty comparable to Walmart at times, but still a great buy!","Just received it, tried it and it is working great!","Came packaged very well! Comes with batteries so that's a plus(:","The camera was ok... my daughter liked it, I realize that I should have bought a case because a strap does not come with it and it can fall easily. Also I was a little disappointed that the box and all instructions were not in English.","Works awesome daughter loves it. Fast delivery and packaging was good","My nieces LOVE THIS!  They have been having all sorts of fun taking pictures!  A winner!","Loved it","14 year old loves it, film is pricy but expected","I love this camera. Great for parties or family functions. Everybody loves this little thing and it's a nice and fun ice breaker.","My daughter loves it! A fun way to take old school pictures.","Great product!","Love this! I purchased this for my 7 year old and she is very stoked. The film is incredibly easy to load. Just open the back, line up the yellow marks on the camera and film, and lay it in. One button to turn on the camera, one to take the picture. Simple. The picture comes out fantastic. It does not work miracles, a dark room is not lit up by flash alone. There is a countdown window on the back of the camera that shows how many pics are left. Very helpful. The instant gratification of having a picture in hand is a happy kid maker. On a side note, I ordered the raspberry color, which is slightly more orangey than it is pink. It is not exactly the same as pictured. Very very happy with the camera!","I love using this camera for my art journals. It adds some \"old school\" feel but saves me tons of time because the pictures are instant. I don't have to remember to go print out the pictures I took. My nieces love my magic camera.","Great picture quality!","This was a Christmas gift that my daughter requested. She loves it.","Best Birthday gift for a 14 year old girl.  A lot of fun.  Pictures are small but the quality is fairly good.  A lot of fun for an instant photo to give to a friend.","Its a great camera. i love it.","I love it! The pictures are so tiny and cute. Perfect for making memories!","Beautiful camera, easy to use. Great gift for people of all ages!","It just came in and my girlfriend loves it already. Great to capture those perfect memories.","This is as fun a gift for my 13 year old niece, as it was when i got one at that age ftom my Auntie. The camera is sleek and i got it in white with a key lime case. It is more compact and the film is easier to load than the old Polaroid I had growing up. One notice, the photos are actually about 1/3 the size of the 80s version, but don't let that dissuade you, it's still a wonderful gadget. At about a buck a shot, it also teaches a teen about having budget, since they are so used to clicking 100s of pics with their digital.  Their piggy bank will be empty if they aren't thoughtful about what they shoot!! Best film price by far here on Amazon.","I bought this camera for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. It came in great condition and is stylish and cute. Takes beautiful pictures and its just great overall.  So far this camera is trouble-free. I guess our old time stuff are coming back in style lol","Nice camera.  Takes OK pics, but the film is ridiculous expensive.  $1 per pic taken.","I LOVE IT!!!!!","all perfect, delivery on time!","Purchased this for my daughter for her birthday to take pics of her one year old.  She loves it.  The flash can get annoying indoors, but outdoors it takes great photos.  Please remember these take very small pictures, but it is a fun thing to have, and you can purchase cute little photo albums to place the pictures in, or attach them to the inside of birthday cards and projects.  The film is not cheap, but it's a great little novelty.  The camera is adorable!","I just got this in the mail today and I'm so excited about it! It works so well and it's such a good investment, I highly recommend this camera if you like vintage pictures :)","It was a birthday gift","My daughter absolutely loves this camera and was super excited about being able to snap a picture and it immediately printing. Ha! What a concept. :)","Love it","Nice camera. Daughter loves it","Great gift","So fun and cute!","Great","I ordered this for my daughter's 13th birthday.  She loves it!","Perfect for \"that Polaroid\" feel to the pictures. The eye hole is a little small to see out of & I don't like you can't turn off the flash.","Love this product. It came in the mail shortly after purchase. I was slightly disappointed because the batteries I received did not work, but once I used my own everything worked perfectly. It was easy to put together and figure out the buttons. Amazing product overall! Cost was very reasonable. Once I figured out how to use it in all the right ways it was always with me.","All I have to say is buy a case, use it with caution or get the warranty. I've watched two polaroids lenses shatter in the same week.","I LOVE IT! Very compact and adorable and the film is the perfect size !! The color is beautiful and it feels lovely and not awkward. I take it everywhere with me and I love the entire aesthetic of it all. Very good price and aaaaAaaaA I just love it so much !! ","Love it! And so does everyone else!!","My eight year old love this!","Loved it!!","I love love loooove this camera! It's the perfect size and takes great Polaroid photos. Definitely buy this if you haven't already!","I recommend this to any one!!! I love this camera it's super easy to use!","My favorite Camera! I love how cute the polaroids are and how everyone falls in love with it. Packaged well and shipped on time.","the instructions are not complete so ill have to find more info online. The first pic came out black so i have no idea why it didn’t work and i am afraid to waste film.","I  ought this gift for my gf at the time. She loved it. The film is easy to refill. The functions are straight forward. Not Co fusing at all. One con I could think of is the space between the flash and the button.  I catch my finger to be blocking the flash. Overall it is a great camera.","Love it works great! Recommend for the people that enjoy taking photos  !","Works great with my Instax Mini 8, will probably purchase in bulk again","Love this camera so much. Takes great pictures with great quality. Way better than expected. Easy to use and takes batteries that are also provided in the purchase!","Very happy with the fast shipment and great product! Highly recommend!","absolutely love this camera. the look of it is fun and the pictures that come out, are really pretty good quality. film isnt to expensive and my daughter loves this thing, she takes it everywhere she goes.","I can't say enough good stuff about my new Instax mini 8. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT so much! It is so easy to set up, use,and photo quality is excellent. This is the perfect camera for easy, playful shots and instant FUN!<br />Did I mention that I LOVE IT?","It is a great camera, mostly suited for parties since they are so much fun to use, I've used them for a friend's 21st birthday and it was quite a blast. The only drawback is that you cannot \"delete\" hahaha. It is a film camera, so you are mostly stuck with what you get unless you have TONS of film to waste. However it was really fun to use! So when you use this camera, just make sure you look your best before snapping xD","Thank you!","I think this canera is easy to use and very cute.","I just got my camera maybe 20 minutes go. Shipping was great. The camera is perfect and it is so much fun! The photos develope nicely!","I give this item 4 stars because it delivers as advertised.  However, for the cost and for what it does, I was not overly impressed.  This is basically a re-do of the old classic polaroid instant camera.  I would not call it an upgrade  - it is a new style - and it has a built in flash with some picture-taking options depending on your environment, but overall it's the same thing as the classic.  Pay attention to the size of the pictures this thing produces as I recommend you only attempt to take close-ups with no more than 3 people or objects in the frame.  it is not a good option for groups or distance at all.  It is pretty much the equivalent of a hand-held photo-booth like the ones in your typical mall.  My 9-year old loves it but you have to be sure you keep track of the film because it is a bit costly.  This probably would be a great thing to pass around at a party but I would not make this your primary source of pictures.  It is closer to a toy than a legitimate camera.","This camara is absolutely adorable! I love the color and how small it is. The pictures come out nicely too. The only thing I don't like it's that it doesn't focus very well when an object is close to the camara, also I don't use the settings provided bc they tend to make the photos come out too bright. I use one setting for all my differently lighting and it seems to work just fine! It is definely worth it.","I absolutely love my camera! It came in perfect condition and on time. I have honestly nothing bad to say about it. :)","My daughter wanted this camera for Christmas, and she loves it.  It is like the vintage Polaroid instants.  The pictures are smaller than the vintage Polaroids.  It is a fun party size camera.  I would recommend a close up lens that you can buy separately for selfies, etc as the lens on this camera isn't designed for close up shots.","This camera is so much fun! I just discovered this not to long ago and man I have been missing out! I no longer have to wait for my memories to be printed! I'm having a blast! Also would make a perfect gift.","Pictures look just like old Polaroids. Easy to turn on and comes with batteries. The controls are very easy to understand.","Bought this for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas. She LOVES it and so does everyone else. She was defiantly the most popular at the Christmas party lol! Pictures come out very good and sharp, I love the color tones too.","This was a present for my sister and she loved it , it works great and I will start using it too :)","Having this camera around has caught many wonderful pictures. I really like it","OMG, THIS IS AMAZING! I was seriously debating, on whether or not if I should purchase this camera. But I can honestly say, I do NOT regret buying this! It's perfect! And I got the blue! Looks like a pastal color blue, which is pretty! But I do recommend you guys buying this camera, if you're thinking about it ;) it'll be worth it!","Just got camera and very impressed. Easy to use and love the pictures.","Daughter loved it, would order again.  Arrived just in time for Christmas.","Takes good pictures. Settings don't change like it supposed to. Stays on one setting is the only downfall","My Grandaughter loves this camera!  Just wish the film was cheaper as she goes through it quickly","This thing is awesome! I purchased this for my gf and she loves it. Nothing like having some good ole fashion polaroid pics","Wonderful product. My sister is definitely excited to have it! Thank you so much for the speedy delivery! I will definitely be buying from you again.","amazing","Didn't realize it didn't come with film. My fault though.","I love my camera except for that it doesn't take very good inside pictures and you can't turn off the flash but other than that it's amazing","Cute camera very compact","I wish it came with a few test pictures. I had to wait and order some rolls.<br /><br />Overall, the prints are super nice with the Fuji film instant.","Perfect!! Just what I wanted! I love this camera it's so cute and the the only reason I don't give it five stars is because the pictures aren't completely clear but they are pretty dang good!!","Amazing and beautiful","excellent camera - fun stuff!  fun for all ages","I love this glad they came back in style.","I bought this camera for personal use and it is a lot of fun to use. It is definitely not going to give you National Geographic style photographs, but if you are looking for a fun camera to give you instant memories, then this camera is for you. It is easy to load with new photo sheets and it only takes a few minutes for the photo to turn out. You can turn the lighting option for the camera to your desired setting depending on your location and the camera is ready to use is a few seconds. Overall, the camera is a lot of fun to use and extremely easy to use.","not bad","My daughter LOVES this camera!","Works good but film is so expensive I have to almost force my daughter to use it because she doesn't want to 'waste' film.","I've only had for a few weeks but I love this camera! I wish you could take more than 10 pics with one roll of film but i love this!!!","Love this! It works perfectly. I would totally recommend buying this camera.","Expensive film...","It's a good camera but it's really not worth the price Amazon sells it for but I love the camera","Love this camera. My son loves to get the picture right then and there.","ADORABLE  CAMERA!!!! RECOMEND.... i had no issues with the camera.... best price I could find. It will be something i will use along my day to day... film is small and a little pricey... credit card size, camera picture is true to color.","I was a little surprised that it did not come with film.","I love this little camera. Its small and you can carry it everywhere.","What a fun camera for 10 year old boy! He has been taking his pictures and loving the instant gratification!","This is a neat idea.  The pictures are adorable.  However, the camera feels like it's made really cheap.  Also, the film is ridiculously expensive.","Great product!","Great product! Shipping was quick too!","Arrived on Tim for Christmas and my daughter loves it!","My 8 year old received this as a Christmas gift and loves going around taking pics of everything with her camera. Beautiful quality, seems user friendly, and who doesn't love a good old instant picture. Great gift for those preteen/tweens as well.","Excellent pictures!! Great quality. Fun for any age. Just snap and go!","Like the çamera, was for my 8 yr old daughter. II was in a rush when I ordered and assumed it had a memory slot - it doesn't- which is why I'm rating a 4. The film is expensive so the çamera should come with memory slot for the price.","I was disappointed that this did not come with film.  They could have included a small amount.","Thank you","My wife loves it","I had high hopes that instant camera technology had come further along. Photos resemble that of the instant camera I had 30 years ago, but Santa brought this to my teenager, and she loves it! She's has a retro spirit, and this fits her perfectly.","Not sure if it's the film or camera but some pictures come out completely blank, the ones that do process are ok, some having a \"flash burst\" in a corner of picture . 15 year old daughter loves it! Age appropriate","This a great camera! Got it for my lady as a gift for the holidays and she loves it. Just be sure to buy film with it because it does not come with any (and it's not cheap)","Perfect","My 9 year old loves this. .just wish the film was a little cheaper","Makes a great gift! My daughter loves it.","the best thing I have ever bought","bought this for Christmas for 11 year old granddaughter and she loved it.","Got this for my daughters 11 bday.  She absolutely loves this.  Works great and is easy to use for an 11 yr old.","Takin it way back!! This camera is amazing! The quality of pics that come out of this are awesome!! Way better than expected! They are very small but so fun for the kids to be able to see there picture physically as soon as they snap it! Love it!!","Very satisfied and it is super cute! I have owned DSLRs and all kinds of camera but this is a great addition to my collection.","A gift for My Granddaughter who's 15 and been wanting one.This was the best deal I could find for it after searching for a time.Easy to use and a hit with Her.Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Yellow)","Takes beautiful pictures","love it!","13 year old loves it!","Great birthday present for my daughter!  Wish Polaroids were a little larger like the old Polaroids I remember, but she has fun with it for the price!","The camera was a gift for one of our kids. Our son really enjoys taking shots and having them print right away. The quality of the prints is only slightly better than the old Polaroid cameras in the 1970s. Still, the camera is both fun and practical. It also has a modern look that draws attention from people who see him use it.","It takes a bit of getting used to in the digital era, you can't edit or delete the pics kids!! It's so great for her to be able to have pictures of friends, pets, whatever... and hang them in her room. (Super cute accessory is chicken wire in a large frame with tiny clothes pins to hang the pics).","the films were small I had no idea but I'm still inlove! fujifilm came with the string to hold it and 2 batteries!","Bought 3 for 3 girls age 11-14 for Xmas, and they love it.  The 11 year old is especially fond of it, but all are using.  I am sure it will not supplant the iPhone cameras, but this is a different, and fun, option.","Takes good pictures and my granddaughter loves it. Only problem is the availability of the paper.  So far we have found it only online.","Love this camera, it takes great photos.","Great Christmas gift my daughter loves it","This camera is fun but hard to set up and take a great photo. The box you see through is very off so it does NOT help. The lighting always is on flash and most off the time ruins the photo. It also does not take pictures of something(other picture,sign) indoors well. only recommend buying if you are great at taking photos.","Arrived on time and as advertised.","My fourteen year old daughter received the camera as a gift. She loves it, and she uses it often.  The cost of the film is the only thing that prevents her from using it all the time.  Otherwise, it is durable and works well.","Product as advertised, great shipping time and great price","I LOVE MY INSTAX MINI 8 CAMERA SO MUCH I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT!!!","What a great product for a gift! My daughter absolutely loved it! Really came in handy during our New Years Eve celebration.","Brings back the old polaroid memories..Very easy to use for the kids. Looks attractive and makes a great gift.  The viewfinder is too small and the picture quality can use an improvement though(kinda washed out in many photos).","I love this camera! We bought it to use for the Photo Booth at our wedding and it was such a hit. The only drawback is the film is a little expensive, but it's worth it and so much fun. Since the wedding I use it in my 4th grade classroom to take pictures of my students doing projects; and I hang the Polaroids around our classroom to make it more personal and show people visiting what we've been up to.","It is marketed for Tweens and kids. However, this thing was a hit at a New Years Eve party we attended a few days ago. Everyone loved it and it added a \"throw back\" feel. Very cool.  We just ordered one of our own.","Love this! We've had so much fun playing with it and it's super sturdy for even the kiddos. Brings back memories!","NICE CAMERA FOR OUR GRAND DAUGHTER!","A fun camera that also takes sharp mini-pics! I purchased this camera for my 20 year old daughter as a Christmas gift. She loved it and we were both shocked at how clear the pictures were!","Bought as a gift. Teenage recipient liked it very much.","great product, easy to use, my 9 year old loves it","Oh my! This is a GREAT gift. I love this camera. Its super easy to use. And pretty self explanatory. If you cant figure it out, or if you want some tips, I watched some YouTube videos and it helped alot! I recommend this camera to everyone who wants a polaroid.","I am addicted, was crushed when they stopped making Polaroids and now I am sooo happy. Film is pricey but totally worth it!","Exactly what I expected and was delivered very quickly in time for Christmas.","I love this ! It's so fun to have the picture in you hands!!","Awesome buy. Very chic camera. No complaints. Pictures are small but to me they're just right. You can stick it in your wallet,on the fridge,wherever. And the outcome of the pictures is superb. Lovely colors make it a plus.","I love this thing!  It as been so much fun at parties and it's a huge hit!  It takes great pictures.  The images are smaller than the older polaroids, about 2x3\", so keep that in mind.  I love pulling it out and taking the first picture with it.  As soon as the film comes out everyone is so excited!","I've had two Instax Mini 8 cameras, both pink, I lost the first one on a trip so I got me the same one again. Simply love it. The pics come out with this great vintage-looking-filter so you always look good on selfies.","perfect","Daughter loves this...Fantastic!!","Like a lot of users, I was looking to recreate the Polaroid experience with this camera. What I got was even better than my vintage Polaroids! I love the shape of the film, the look of the camera, and the resolution of the photos.","Great! Works just as it should! Image true to actual color!","Good fun gift for 8 year-old. Photos are fairly good quality. Fun activity, easy to operate. Film could get expensive, but there are sales sometime. Not much more than an activity; not sure it is for serious photojournalism, but may be good for school reports or fun projects. Photos are slightly smaller than trading card size. Seems to work quite well.","I love this camera! It came in very quickly, and is so fun to use. Thank you, Amazon!","I love this camera it is easy to use, the only problem I have with it is lighting or more accurately what setting to use because some of my pictures come out too dark, other than that it is a good camera and I made a memory wall with all my pictures...I have no regrets","My daughter loves this camera. It is similar to the old Polaroids but the photos come out smaller and clearer. This camera is easy to use and comes in several fun colors. Be sure to buy the film with it. It is not digital.","Gave it as a gift.<br /><br />The coloring is pretty spot on as the picture.<br /><br />Only downside is that it didn't come with film (which I should have checked into), but other than that the product itself is pretty good :)","The item was delivered way before the estimated delivery date. It works and it's cute! I totally recommend it!!","Gift for Grandaughter, she loved it.","My granddaughter LOVED it! Although she asked for a 'Polaroid' after opening this gift she said that this was the one she had been looking at. I hit it all right! Color and brand. The reviews really helped me decide on this one instead of the Polaroid","pics are sometimes too dark, wish it had zoom!","I didn't receive the photo sheets with my camera.  Please send","It's so easy to use and so adorable!!! I love this camera so much. My only worry is how expensive the film is but it's cheaper than Polaroid film.","So cute and adorable!! Love the color and pictures turn out great!!","Easy to learn and simple! Came with batteries, and instructions. Film was not included, but it was easy to purchase film.","Love love love it !! Gave it to my 13 year old sister for Christmas and she's in love. Super cute, perfectly taken care of, and i dont know who's happier, me or her!!","Gave this as a Christmas gift to at 16 year old girl. She loves taking pictures and really liked that she could have hard copy photos in the digital age.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Overall, cool modern camera for taking Polaroids.<br />Good variety of colors<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wish there was more focusing ability<br />Maybe a little smaller and less clunky<br />Bigger viewing window","It's so cute! Plus it came in only 3 days! It's in great condition, and I just love it! Definitely recommend buying it! ","My daughter loves this camera. Great fun gift for a teenager!","Love it. My daughter was so excited and spent the day being creative!! Thank you.","My daughter loves this little thing and the quality of the instant picture has come along way from when I had mine in the 80s. Great transaction.","This my very first Polaroid camera, I absolutely love it! it's soooo perfect, it's just everything I expected it to be! Also it arrived super fast and right before New Year's Eve, which is exactly what I wanted! I highly recommend this product it's freakin awesome!!","Came in on time from the expected arrival date :3 It's so cute and I would recommend anyone to buy this. Take note, //definitely// get a case for this to prevent it from getting scratched and/or destroyed :o","Daughter loved it","So fun to use.","It works really well but your supposed to be able to push the flash thing but it does not work or but budge. Also your supposed switch lighting settings but does not work yes I know it turns automatically on but your also able to switch it by yourself but just stays the same","Got it Today but all of the instructions are in Chinese! No idea what to do or how to use it but I'm sure I'll find something online","Love!!!","Great product, i expect a bit more quality on the pictures but beside that its a very cool camera.","We bought this for our 15yr old daughter as a Christmas gift and she loves it.  She loves taking pictures with her digital camera, but the Instax Mini gives her something tangible instantly that she can share with her friends and team mates.","I've only had it for like 5 minutes but so far it's so rad. Definitely is mini.","Bought this as a gift and my friend loved it!","Great camera very impressed with service","Great little camera! Purchased for my 11 year old but everyone wants one now! Takes pretty nice pictures!","I've never written a review before until now because that's how satisfied and happy Iam with my new camera!!! I was super excited when my package came which didn't take long at all to arrive (2 days). Packaging of the camera was perfect, there were no damages. When I opened the box it came with a pair of batteries, strap (hand strap, not long), 1 year warranty, instructions and a beautiful camera of course. Everything about this camera is truly amazing, I took a photo of my Christmas tree to test it out. The image didn't come out bad, you just can't see the tree lights. You just have to choose which settings fit your surroundings. I want to keep testing out the settings but as many know the film is somewhat pricey. But overall, the camera is great and would definitely recommend it!!!","Love this camera!","Love it! Cute, adorable and easy to store","This camera and film was  gift for my niece who loved it's ease of use and the fact that the photos develop before \"her very eyes\".  We received superfast shipping on this item.","Came just as promised and my daughter loves it!","Easy to use . Lightweight. Fun and cute pucs","works perfectly.","everything ok!","Very nostalgic","Purchased as a Christmas gift for my teen, and earned the \"favorite present\" rating this year!","excellent","SS loves it.","Cutest investment ever!","I got incredibly in the style check when I saw this camera while looking for an appropriate birthday present for my 14 year old daughter. Because of smartphones and their capabilities for taking pictures, I wasn't sure how she would react to such a throwback gift. I had nothing to fear she absolutely adored it her friends loved it. There's still something to be said about taking a photo and waiting to see how it develops. That's all part of the fun of photographs. The imperfect moments, the funny faces, the almost I wasn't ready. Plus it's nice to be able to give my daughter a toll that's not going to give her instant gratification. I kind of felt like sneaking vegetables in her food when she was a baby. I know she'll like it but she doesn't know that it's also good for her, lol","Great!","Fun camera!","to this amazing Polaroid.  Simple to set up and use.","Purchased for Christmas gift.  I am impressed with the quality of this camera and the photos are quite good.","So cute and perfect, the pictures  turn out really well and mini!","Santa brought this for my 8 year old daughter and she just loved it.  The pictures pop right out and it is reminiscent of the old polaroids we all played with in the past.  Not great picture quality but that is not what this is about.  I bought some accessories and scrapbooking materials that go with this model and my daughter loved using these materials as well.  She filled her scrapbook, made some picture ornaments, etc.  I was so surprised and pleased to see her entertain herself with something other than tv or video games!","Color is beautiful, 13-year old daughter is ecstatic! Highly recommend for the tween set!","I got this for my daughter for Christmas! She love it. My daughter is 10 and she was able to figure it out without my help. Film is expensive but the camera quality and pictures are great for an instant camera.","love it. easy to use and easy instructions","The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera was a gift for my 18 year old daughter for Christmas this year and she LOVES it! I don't quite get the attraction because we have pictures at our finger tips these days and all the apps to edit photos right on our phones - but for her, it's a novelty taking actual photographs - and they're instant just like her phone. She started using it right out of the box when she opened it and has taken it with her when going out with her friends. For me, it's nostalgic remembering instant photos from the 70's.<br /><br />Be forewarned, the camera does not come with film - you need to buy that separately. It's cute, but a bit bulky to carry around - it did not fit in her purse, but you can throw it in a tote or backpack.","big hit this christmas","It's so adorable. I got it the day before Christmas just like it said & it's perfect! Thank you so much.","Amazing I ordered it on Saterday night and I got it on Monday.Very good and fast to get it.I would get a case tho","Very nice camera!  :o)","I absolutely love my fujifilm instax mini 8! It is great to take a picture and have a hard copy. It is small, so it is very portable. Also keep in mind that the pictures are credit card sized, and not big like the older Polaroid photos. I recommend getting the base with twin pack. It includes the camera and 20 pack of film for a better price.","I'm in love with this camera it's the perfect size to throw in a backpack or throw in a purse I really think it's so convient and easy to use the film is sold Separate its a little pricey in stores so buying it here on Amazon is your best best","This was the PERFECT holiday gift! The white is so nice -- I was nervous that it would get dirty quickly, but not at all!","It is super cool when the picture comes out, because you cant see the picture till a few minutes.","My 11 yr old daughter loves this camera and it is a cute idea. I do think it is overpriced considering you can't save the pictures digitally or anything.<br />Easy to use. After the first couple uses though we are no longer able to select the setting (inside, sun, cloudy, etc). It's like it automatically picks no matter what we change it to.","Very cute. My daughter loves it","this camera is AMAZING!  I got it as a gift for my daughter and almost kept it myself!  This camera is so much fun.  all the cool accessories you can get with it, change the colors of the lens.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this for any girl that loves to take pictures.  It's even awesome outside taking scenery pictures.","Bought as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter.  She loves it.  Shipping was fast and product was/is as expected.","Hands down love it thank you","Super cute! Takes great pictures. Fun little camera!!","Great product, and shipped quickly! Highly recommend buying.","EVERYONE loves these...  BUY IT!  and buy film and picture frames... can' say enough!  Keeps wife, guests, and teens, SUPER happy...","i bought this for my best friend and she loved it and she loved how the pictures develope quickly i give this 5 stars","So far no problems! Just wish the film was cheaper!! Great product though and takes much better pictures than I thought it would. Thanks!! (:","Very satisfied with product and shipping! Thank you","This camera is amazing! brings back old memories and love that not all my pictures are on my phone","I love my mini Polaroid!","My 12 year old daughter's favorite Christmas present this year. Be aware: these photos are MUCH smaller than old instant photos. It is kind of cool, though, and the kids love it.","This is a cute, fun little instant camera. Good if you're a journaler or scrapbooker.","Amazing .","Bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas.  She screamed with excitement when she opened it.  Exactly as shown online.","I bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter, and she absolutely loves it. It is so easy to load, the pictures are clear and are a great size to make a collage out of.","This was a Christmas gift for my 11yo sister.  All of us older sisters played with it a lot more than her.  Definitely a favorite.","Absolutely flawless items and service! Easy to use. Wish the photos were a bit bigger but the quality was good.","Bought this for a 17 year old girl who had no clue how awesome Polaroids are. No filter needed and so much fun. Giant hit! Purchased an extra case of film and photo album to go along with it. Perfect gift for anyone over 10","Omg it was amazing great delivery came in,in two days I'm EXTREMLY satisfied","My daughter loves this camera!","Love the color and the size of the photos.","It was a prefect Christmas gift. Especially for a 15 year she just loved it.","Such a cute camera to carry around !!<br /><br />It takes out great business card size pictures that takes about 10 minutes to fully appear - but slowly starts appearing after 2. The Fugifilm Instax mini is a fun camera to have, especially now when everyone is so used to taking pictures on their phones. Having the picture to print out instantly makes it exciting to get creative with it.","Amazing :)","LOVE IT!  Works great!","Awesome little camera!","Excellent Product, Excellent Price, Shipped very quickly! WDBA! A+++","Bought this for my 12 and 7 year old nieces.  The girls were very happy!","I bought this for me, and I love it.  Very small picture but for me it's ok","Gift for my niece, she loved it!","It looks very cute! I so love the color and the design of this one. So grateful to have it in addition to my collection.","Wonderful product.  My daughter loves it .","Awesome","My teen loves this!","My 11 year old loves this.  Works well right out of the box - easy to use.","Exactly How I Wanted It","What a fun camera! Bought for my 13 year old daughter and she has had tons of fun with it. Great gift for a teen!","This camera is pretty straightforward to operate and the photos develop like the ol' Kodak used to in the past. It's pretty fun and looks good too even indoors with less light. The viewfinder wasn't very accurate with showing what was actually in frame so you may need to play with framing at first to get the hang of it but overall it's a fun camera!","our picture are coming out white.","Perfect for parties. Love this camera!<br />Be sure to choose the proper setting when taking pics so your photos don't get over exposed like ours did- see photo.<br /><br />I've used this for two parties for a make shift \"photo booth\" and now on vacation. Everyone loves it, it's super easy to use. The only downfall is how expensive film is :( either way, I'll pay it.<br /><br />Another idea we did- wrote Merry Christmas cards from Hawaii, snapped a photo, put it in the envelope and sent it to family. A cheap way of doing personalized family holiday pictures!","This camera is fun to use!","My grandchildren bought this for me for Christmas, it is a good on the go camera with good results.Takes a bit if getting used to & you don't get crystal clear pictures,what you do get are great Polaroids & lots of fun.","I love the Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Camera! I just got mine today. Make sure you buy film with the camera because it does not come with it. I couldn't be happier with this product!","I absolutely love this! I received the pink camera for Christmas and could not be more excited for anything! All of the colors are wonderful, however the pink happened to be my favorite. If you do not know how to use if but do not want to read the manual, I suggest watching a YouTube video on how to use it, a review of it, or an unboxing although It truly is t that difficult. The pictures are so unique and cute, however when taking a picture make sure your camera is a little to the left of what you want to capture because the lens is to the left of the viewfinder so what you see in it will be a little off of what you really took a picture of.<br />Moreover, the camera is simply amazing. It's so unique and creative and anyone to recover this, will 100% love it!","This camera is Honestly Great! The ONLY down side is at night when its pitch black and Bright in the day it's a 50/50 chance it'll turn out at All:/ as long as you're Not facing the sun when you take the pic you're okk! Which I didn't know when I attempted to retake a pic like 3 times and they Didn't turn out at All. Besides that the pics are Very rustic and Great:)","This is by far my favorite camera in my collection. I also own the instax wide 800 and while I like the size and quality of the pictures over the mini, this is easier to carry, lighter and I enjoy the different colored films and accessories that are offered for the mini. I've taken this to parties and it's always fun to give out the pictures to people who have never played with instant film. Highly recommend this camera.","Great camera! Very nice quality pics! My daughter loves it!","On time, the camera is perfect !","Happy with camera.","I love mine but I'm going to donate it because I got a new version. The Hello Kitty shaped one.","Came in good time and great shape. Looks exactly like the picture. I will tell you it is very cheap looking, most people think I have a child's play camera but what do you expect when you're buying a yellow polaroid? Great product, I love it!","I absolutely love this camera. I'm going to Orlando Florida, Guatemala, and Canada this year and really want to capture those moments and I've recently used it for Thanksgiving and Christmas so it is a really nice small gift to my family!","Cute mondern redition on the old instant camera. Pricey, and figure about a $1 per picture, but something different.","This camera is very very cute! I love the colors and the style. But the only thing I do not understand is why they brought back this type of camera. I find it quite frustrating that you can't pick if you would like to print your picture. If you take a bad picture you have to waste your film and the film is not very cheap. Other than that I love this camera but I don't plan on buying it again.","my daughters favorite Christmas present! The picture is very good quality for instant film... she loves it and used up all her film first day.","Christmas gift for 10 year old daughter, who wanted a camera. I thought she and her friends would enjoy seeing their photos come right out. Even the grown ups were intrigued. It's been a hit. Hopefully she won't go overboard on taking photos since the film runs around 75 cents to $1 per photo.","Awesome!","This is an adorable, affordable buy. I would pay extra, if you could choose which pictures I could print.","My granddaughter loves this camera! It brought back memories of the old polaroid instant camera which we still have. The film is somewhat expensive and the finished photos are very small.","Bought this for my 13 yr old,  she absolutely loves it! Was a great gift.","Little larger then we expect other wise great.<br />Haven't use yet will post another review later","My 13 year old daughter loves this","My granddaughter loved this camera.  Best gift.  Love it","My 12 year old daughter loves this.  She got it for Christmas and absolutely had a blast taking pictures of the day.  I wish there was a SD card option, so you could save the pics and download them to the computer as well as have them print out immediately.","This doesn't allow you as much freedom as the printer does, but I love it all the same. The quality of the pictures seem to come out better on the camera than they do on the printer, but maybe that's because these can't be filtered. The film is expensive, and the flash is SUPER bright, but I think I can manage. I love it!","Very compact and works great so far!!  The film is a little pricey, though.  Less room for mistakes...","Cute little camera but wish the films were bigger.","Daughter absolutely loves it.  Shipping time was awesome.","My first Polaroid camera ever so I didn't know what to expect. It was super easy to use and super cute. The picture quality is not the best but I'm assuming is typical for a Polaroid. I do love having them instantly though. Absolutely love it.","Love it !","grand daughter loves it","Bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift.  She absolutely loves it.  Takes great pictures and a fun way to create memories for a scrapbook.  Only downside is the film is a little pricey.","Nice looking camera, Bit heavy but nothing too bad. Does not come with film so if you are going to buy it, Buy film with it. Also the instructions do not come in English, Which is very annoying. Aside from that, It was worth buying.","Love this camera! ?????? very cute and the extra excessories are perfect!","It's more of a reddish colour but it's still very cute!!","very good camera . It works well and looks great .","Bought this as a birthday present for my mother. She hasn't used it yet but she's excited to use it. Too bad the film is the size of a credit card, and not like the size of the vintage Polaroids.","Such a fun camera.  My daughter loves it.","Love the photos that I get to take with this! Great item, arrived in perfect condition.","Works great! Bought it for my kid to take pictures with friends. She loves it and it's great for making little memories!","Got my camera--along with some film I bought with it--last Friday, and ever since Sunday, the little light indicating the mode you're on, is stuck on the first/home mode. Even when I clearly set the camera to a different lighting/mode, the light stays on home. So whenever I take a picture, it doesn't come out in the brightness I want. I changed the batteries, thinking it was just a problem with the batteries. Nope. I can still use the camera, I guess, if I want pictures that don't come out how I want. I'm not sure if I can get a refund or not, so I'm screwed. It was nice while it lasted, 2 days.","Best camera ever! If you want a camera it for amazing quality this wouldn't be the best. It has good quality but not the best.","This camera is so fun. My 11 year old loves it and takes it everywhere. It actually takes nice pics and so fun to get them instantly. Everybody is always asking about it when they see her using it!","Very nice and cute. Good for the price. This was my daughter's birthday gift and she loved it. It takes good clear pictures.","perfect for christmas","Everything looks like it is in fine shape.  My granddaughter's Christmas present - will let you know how she likes it.","Purchased for a gift and it was a wonderful price. Item arrived just as described","Good to see a form of Polaroid come back. At least for me. Got for my daughter in law. She'll love it as it's instant. I also purchased tripod to go w it. Got christmas","I love my camera so much it's so nice ! Great quality ! I was skeptical at first but honestly it was worth the money.","I always get so many questions about my cute little camera.  And the pictures are so much fun for the kids-teenagers to enjoy.","no problems","Great Camera. Good quality of pictures even with flash. Kids are very happy to see the picture develop.","Great value","awesome , very simple and easy to use , pictures come out nice and vintage. perfect for scrapbooking meories with an old fashioned look , love it!","i love this product. my only complaint that i wish the photos were bigger. just my preference. it is ok.","Yes received my order and was happy with it. My granddaughter is going to love it.","came in excellent condition these cameras a lot of fun for any of us who remember being burdened by film : )","It's really cool but it didn't come with film.","Very cute, and fun too have.  Pictures come out a bit duller than expected, and for the price of the film you should get more and better quality.","recieved as shown with batteries and when expected.","great","It's fun.. Takes really cute small clear instant photos which is great in a digital would for my daughter to have a memory to hold...film is hard to find.. I started ordering on line.  Same price 2 dollars a photo worth it to me I love photographs that much.","Perfect, thanks!","so good","Good camera with photos printed so quick!","Lots of fun, my daughter loves it, pretty color blue! works just like they used too.","It came a little late but otherwise I love it!","AWSOME","everything that was described","Received and wrapped for Christmas.","I FINALLY GOT THE CAMERA THANK YOU","So far this camera does exactly as I had hoped! It brings back warm and fuzzy memories of my childhood! I gave 3 stars due to the packaging. It came extremely roughed up. I was disappointed!","I wanted to try this out.  I have two awesome cameras, both digital that take great pics.  I chose this camera just for fun family events, throw back type photos that you can take and have instant gratification, pass out as keepsakes, etc.  Let me start by saying, like other reviewers comments on other sellers sites here selling this camera, they advertise a selfie mirror, NO, there is NOT a selfie mirror.  Slight disappointment but no biggie I guess.  Let me finish by saying, its a great camera for a 7 year old.  Its basic, doesnt do anything except snap & print a tee-tiny little picture that I must say, you can barely even see some things you are photographing.  Overall, I feel silly using this camera.  I guess its fun at first, but the lack of its ability to really do anything makes it a big disappointment.  For the steep price and the overexaggerated marketing, this product is a fail.  I expected old time polaroid type photos, it does NOT deliver.  Positive: As always Amazon delivered within 1 business day.","Great Product my daughter loved it! Fast shipping it was the perfect birthday present and she has turned into quite the photographer !","this is so adorable and i love the pics. if your into the whole vintage thing you will love this!","Nice camera.","I cant verify this purchase because I got it as a present for my birthday. But, the camera works really well. It comes with an instruction manual in case you dont know how to use it.<br />Its light but kinda bulky in size. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it since polaroid cameras/photos have been trending lately.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- light weight<br />- light pastel blue color<br />- reasonable price<br />- easy to learn how to use<br />- comes with a hand strap<br /><br />Cons:<br />- kind of bulky<br />- have to mind the fact that its one shot per pic because of film","it was great product but ordered erroneously","christmas present","AWESOMMEEEEEEE","Brought it for my daughter's birthday, it's a cute starter camera, she loves it!","My daughter love it, Great product","Exactly as it was shown. Prompt service. Could have used a little more padding but it was good.","Glot this and all the accessories for my granddaughter for Christmas. She does not have it yet but I am sure she will like it....it was on her list to me submitted before Thanksgiving...LOL","Color is pretty much red doesn't even have a hint of pink in it","gi o d","This camera is awesome. Classic looking photos and easy to use.","Purchased this for my 15 year old daughter and she loves it.  Apparently instant cameras are a fad right now and this seems to work well. It's simple to use and is a fun novelty item.<br /><br />And it IS a novelty item.  Please don't buy this thinking you're getting something that's going to take amazing photos. They quality is just lovely for a Polaroid-style camera, but you won't get the results that you get from your phone or digital camera.  This is designed for kids to take cute pictures of their friends, not something you're going to take vacation photos with. My daughter decorates them with stickers, writes on them with her friends and hangs them in her study and bedroom on ribbons with tiny clothespins.<br /><br />The photos are about the size of a credit card or wallet-sized photo, including the white frame around the picture. Big difference between this and the old square Polaroids from our childhood is that you *don't* flap these in the air to develop them.. That will actually hurt the development process. You lay the film on a flat surface and it takes about 10 minutes to finish processing.<br /><br />It's an instant camera, so it's bulky compared to a regular one, but again, you're not going to want to take this to document a family trip.<br /><br />The bulk and the price of the film (roughly $1 per picture) would keep me from giving this to a child younger than 10-12.  I would definitely not purchase this for a little one, because they'd go through $20 in film in eleven seconds and you'd have a lot of blurry photos of their feet and the walls!<br /><br />Now for a bunch of 15 year old girls, it's a lot of fun and my daughter and her friends have really enjoyed it.","Cute Polaroid camera. The pictures are exactly as expected. I looked up directions on youtube and its been working perfectly.","Love this! I bought the Fujifilm Insta Mini to use in home-made photo booth at my mom's bday celebration. People loved the idea and were able to leave a short message for my mom at the bottom of the photo.  Then I collected all the pics and created a mini photo album with the pics. Overall I got my money worth. See the pics below.","Very fun little product, great holiday gift.  Pics are what you'd expect. Fun to have as a retro response to digital phone pics. Don't forget the two AA batteries if you're giving it as a gift.","I always love these cameras! I bought the older model for myself and fell in love with it so I got this one for my sisters birthday. It's so perfect for when she wants to take pictures to put up in her college dorm! Don't forget the film","My daughter loved this gift for her birthday.","I'm happy with this purchase, product was well packaged and it arrived in a timely manner. I love the camera, we had fun taking pictures during Thanksgiving, great conversation piece.  The camera takes great pictures as well.","Love this little camera. It's very fun to play with and get instant prints. The film is a bit pricey, so be warned if you plan on being really crazy with the photos. It ends up being approx. 1$ per photo. Also, the picture makes the camera seem more pink, but it is a little more orange. It doesn't look bad, but it is not quite as pink as you would expect and I was a little surprised. I will say I was disappointed in that it didn't come with even one thing of film, which is troublesome when your film is in a different order, so I had to wait to use it.","So much fun!! Ordered this for my husbands youth group and the teens love it. Takes really cool vintage photos. This is the mini version so photos aren't the big typical ones but that works for us. I have noticed you need to get fairly close to your subject and have somewhat decent lighting for pictures to show up well. It's best for up close face pictures. Really happy with this purchase and love the blue color!","I love my camera it's the best thing ever !!","Nice","WOW! Extremely fast shipping with over the top care. I LOVE THIS CAMERA","good","Excelente","Nice product, great for tween's, teens and parties.","Better than expected! I was worry that doesn't work as supposed to... But works perfectly!","i think it's a cute idea to bring back the polaroid camera in a new fun design.  I like it but I wouldn't say I love it.  The picture quality isn't there which is what i expected but the camera sometimes pauses for too long before it takes the picture which usually results in a bit of a blurry picture.  And with the film being as expensive as it is, it is a bit frustrating to have blurry pictures.  Overall, though, I like the camera.  I'm happy that I made the purchase.","Great price!! Delivered fast. Product as described!!","I love my mini camera! My only complaint was that this product advertised the front mirror, but mine never came with it..","Cuuuuuute! Good thing I chose the pink one!","its so cute, im so glad i got my wife this color she loves it","If you are thinking of buying this product, do it because this camera is the perfect size to fit in any bag and you can't beat the price.  However film may be expensive but you are paying for cool looking vintage photos. Definitely recommend! ??","Lots of fun. the light settings are odd though. They kinda all feel the same.<br /><br />Forget about outdoor photos at night.","I love love love this camera.  It is fun for snapshots. I love the pale pink color. People of all ages will enjoy this camera, but maybe youngsters especially.  I am 43 and I am having a blast with this camera.  I have taken photos of my whole family and decorated them with stickers.  A great hobby.","In love with this camera. It' has some tricks you should have on mine like to be sure to set the light exposition, cause otherwise it could turn too bright or too dark. Also, it leaves a big spaces between the top of what you see through the lense and the photo print. I mean, when you're shooting to someone's head. if you put the top of the view on their head, the printed photo will come out with lot of space above the head. If you just want a portrait from neck to head (for example), then you would set the view to just see from the forehead and down. This way, then the photo would just cover from the top hair down without leaving a big black space...","CUTEST CAMERA EVER. used it for our photo guest book at our wedding and received tons of compliments.","LOVE THIS SO MUCH. GREAT PRODUCT.","Awesome camera!!it takeS great pictures very fun and easy to use . the raspberry color is more of a red then pink  but still very cute:) my husband got it for me and I can't stop snapping pics: )looove it!","Not sure if it works yet, because it's a Christmas gift, but looks intact.  There are a few more scratches on the back that I wasn't expecting.  The gift is for my daughter and she knows I shop Amazon.  If it was for anyone else, I would be concerned that it looked too used to give as a gift.","My 13 yo got this for her bday. She loves it. It took her a little while but once she (finally) read the instructions she was happily snapping away","Perfect","Super in love with this camera! Not one single complaint yet!","the pictures are pretty blurry.","I'm so, so in love with my Mini 8. It was probably one of the best buys I've had on Amazon. It came in good, protective packaging on time. This is such a cute camera, and I'd recommend it to anyone!","Came on time and works well! Exactly as pictured.","I absolutely love this camera. It is perfect for any occasion. Worth the money!","This was the rave of our party! Everyone just wanted to take pictures with it.","I have yet to use the camera as it's for my daughter's birthday but it looks perfect! Not to mention the price was unbeatable! This same<br />Camera at Michaels is more than double the price!","This camera is great! I don't know why I thought it would be bigger, but I love how small it is! The camera it self is beautiful and simple to use. The photos come out nice as well.","Absolutely love this camera!!  This camera is very stylish and cute all in a very great way. This lovely camera came with two batteries a strap.Just a reminderthis camera does not come with film. It weighs more than I expected but it doesn't weigh enough to hurt your arm. You should defanantley but this camera it is suck good quality for that price hope you guys enjoy your cameras and they would make very great christmas presents","I bought this as a gift, but the tags expired on my car in july and i barely got them updated","Absolutely love this camera! An updated version of what most of us grew up with. Shipping was even quicker than the seller had promised!","Love this camera!","Inexpensive and fun way to capture memories. Bought 2, one for each daughter after used at son's wedding.","This was a gift for my great grandaughter, she is pretty young but mom supervises her. They love the camera!","Makes mediocre-at-best photos but it's fairly compact (at least compared to the old Poloroids my generation is familiar with) and my daughter had to have one.  Guess they're cool again. Who knew!","came in great condition & packaged well. I bought this as a gift for a friend, I think she'll really enjoy it.","Terrific product at a great price.","I always get so many compliments on this camera! I have been offered to take pictures and have them purchased by strangers. These pictures come out GREAT! The best part is you instantly have your picture physically in your hands once it is taken. Now a days hardly anyone prints pictures anymore, yet these memories are so priceless! I love my camera so much I bought one for my niece too. It is a great camera with good quality pictures and memories for keepsake!","Love this cutey. Cute color and perfect for a quick album :). Image size is credit card size though.","My daughter loves it","Love the color ~ it's so fun to use! My daughter and her friends are having a great time with it!","We have had so much fun with these cameras. And the pictures, surprisingly because they are so small,are sensational.","Got this camera for my granddaughter and she loves it!","This camera is so affordable and it's so cute! The photos are teeny tiny - wish they were bigger we always take this on trips in addition to our dslr - it's fun and retro.",":)",":)","Small and takes cute pictures","Exactly what I was looking for.","If it weren't so expensive, it would get 5 stars.  Love this camera for a fun twist at parties and school events. Used it at an end of the year Kindergarten celebration and the kids couldn't get enough. Too bad film is so expensive! The kids had fun taking pictures of each other and trading them with one another.  Got the idea of buying this camera at a wedding where they used this for their guest book with props, etc. Definitely a hit for all ages!","Best purchase I believe I have ever made.","I love this camera! Not just for kids! Im a 25 year old wife and mother of two (ages 2 & 1) and i used this camera on our first cross country roadtrip and every holiday since purchasing it! It is a geeat way to keep those memories in a physical form!","This thing is super cool! I love taking it around and taking pictures with it, but I think mine came with a malfunction. Since I received it in the mail and started using it I realized that the lighting wheel didn't work.. It stayed on the same lighting. Other than that this is a super cute and fun way to take pictures!","Nice","item came exactly as described, the color is a little more pastel than in photo, but the tone is the same. definitely a good deal and does exactly what it says it does.","I love this! It's so much fun!","This was a gift. I hit the mark with this one.  Takes great pix and you have them in a couple of minutes.","So far so good...this item is a Christmas gift. I did open to look at it and it seems pretty neat, looks easy to use as well!","just what I wanted. Described perfectly.","so cute.","This is such a fun camera! I'm able to take a picture and get it instantly. I love having this to document pictures of events and be able to give them to the person right there. It's also been fun having it to take pictures of my baby and I can write the date on the front. You do, however, need to put the picture in a dark spot (in a book or something) until it's developed. It makes the pictures turn out better.","So happy I got the camera here. Great quality for a great price!","got this for my 11yo as a gift.  Really cool color and fun.  Easy to use, love it!!","Described perfectly. Everything I expected:)","It shipped quickly and I love the camera itself. It's adorable and takes cute pictures.","I got this as a gift and I absolutely love it! This isn't the sort of camera I would take high quality, artsy pictures with but if you're looking for something a bit vintage and a bit nostalgic this is perfect! It reminds me of my very first camera. The simple controls, the little number that counts down how many pictures are left in the roll, the viewfinder (and lack of screen on the back). It has a flash that you can't turn off (which will likely be a problem on sunny days), there is a button to turn it on and a button to take a picture. To close it you push the lens back in until the shutter closes. Truly a simply camera but so much fun! If you want something to take fun picture (probably of pets or family) or you need to get someone who's either into retro stuff or a bit of a camera/photo geek then this is perfect for them.<br /><br />I downgraded it one star not because of any flaw with the camera but because of the outrageous cost for film. It makes the camera slightly less enjoyable because you have to parse out how many pictures you take as a 20 pack can cost $15 or more depending on where you buy it. That is terrible in my opinion and it was lessened a star simply for that.","I really enjoyed this camera. But I really hated not seeing what I was getting before it was printed out. I went on vacation and it was quite sunny and half the pictures didn't show up because of that, no matter what setting I used. All the indoor pictures and afternoon pictures were okay! There is an adapter that allows you to take selfies. It's a cute idea!","boyfriend loves it!!","I like it","So I have been wanting this camera for years!!! And I finally had enough money to get this plus the accessories! And I'm so in love!!","This thing is awesome","My item came in good shape and it worked perfectly","loved it","Easy & Smart","Great product and line by FujiFilm. Small and compact, easy to carry as well as very light!","Absolutely adore my new camera. Impressed with how carefully packaged it was. Great gift for others or yourself, the instructions don't come in English though but you can just watch a tutorial on youtube! totally worth it!!","My daughter is going to have a great Christmas!!!!!","This is such a fun cute camera! Each picture has a vintage feel to it, which I love. It's so easy too, just press the button near the lens,and it starts right up! The only bad part is having to buy more film, but it isn't very expensive. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who likes vintage things.","Was very pleased with it although when I try to take pictures at night it does not show up at all. Idk if I used the wrong setting but yea.","Fall in love with random life photos again!! My Border Collie is terrified of it! lol lol!","Excellent transaction, highly recommended","It's perfect I love it.","It's a great purchase, it comes complete and nothing is missing. Excellent conditions, I love it!","I love it works just fine great quilts picture","I Love is onlyone and adorable!","I bought this instax mini 8 from Amazon directly (not another dealer through Amazon). It works wonderfully and came in its complete package. I absolutely love it!","It is exactly what my daughter was looking for. A smaller version of the actual polaroid camera's in my day.  Plus pink is her favorite color.","gave it to a friend and he loved it","I love it,beautiful picture but it does get expensive with all the picture but overall I think its a great product","This is so cute I love this camera it came so quickly but it runs out of film quickly other than that it is a good camera","It's really good. It worked for me for almost 6 months. it would work longer, however I took it to the beach and I guess sand got stuck in it and they don't offer a warranty.","lower the price","I love this thing, it shipped really fast and it was an amazing birthday gift to myself.","This is my favorite little toy. It is so much fun to bring to the beach, on a hike, or on a trip to the city. It is durable, but not heavy or too clunky. The style is unique and minimal. Set up is quick, operation is entirely simple.This would make such a wonderful holiday or birthday present.","Daughter wanted this and loves it.  the photo's are about wallet style - she loves that!","Amazing!","I originally brought to start on my baby book for my son, and this camera is perfect! Everything prints out clear, and it's always at my side.","B'day gift for 11/30.  Looked good to me.","This is a great camera (for the people who love cameras)<br />It a cute, stylish camera that is adorable and fun to use-<br />most people would prefer a camera that had internal memory but its fun to actually have the physical photo in your hand, although internal memory would be great though... But anyway this is what the box comes with:<br />A great and cute little camera<br />BATTERIES! YAY because most cameras dont come with batteries<br />A cute little strap to match the color of your camera<br />Easy and cute instructions<br />BUBBLE WRAP! Who doesn' t love that?<br /><br />Ok so the actual camera.. Its so cute (i got the blue one) and it takes really high quality adorable cute photos that are great for anything.. You get a tone of accessories for this camera.It is also better then those little portable cameras because they don' t really function that well, so I would recommend this camera because there are:<br />Different styles and colors<br />Different colored and styled film<br />AMAZING kinds of cases for travel and non-travel<br /><br />SO I would definitely recommend this camera for all types of people :)","In lovvveee with this camera! worth the money for sure. They best part is having a cute keep sake to put up in your room.","I love it. I took it to Miami and got some great pictures. It's not too big or small and the pictures are about the size of a credit card. I got one camera and it was defective but contacted the seller within the following week I had it replaced I was so pleased. They even paid for me to send them back the broken one. The replacement I got was perfect worked well!","This is a really great and easy to use camera. I love the color and the design. I wanted to get a camera that would be easy enough for my grandmother to use, and it is! Shipping was fast and looks exactly like the picture shown.","my 10 yr old daughter loves it!!!!!!!","so fun and easy! nice to have ease of use and instant gratification in lieu of a digitally complex world","I love it!!! It's smaller than I expected but it's still a good size.But my complaints are that I put film in the camera but didn't change the number of how much I got also it feels cheap.","Great little camera, however the film is just as expensive!","I bought this to use at a photo booth at my daughter's Sweet 16 party. It was the hit of the party. The pictures were great. I dont think the kids put it down all night.  Highly recommend this camera. The pictures are small but it was worth every dime for the fun it brought the party.","GREAT PICTURES AND MY GIRLFRIEND LOVES THE QUALITY, BETTER THAN THE POLAROID I BOUGHT HER EARLIER THIS YEAR.","I bought this camera for our wedding to be used in the guestbook. It was such a hit!  And so fun for us the morning after!  The cameras work as well as you would expect, they are certainly not perfect but they are small and instant and adorable.  We continue to use them at home for events.  These cameras a touch bigger and heavier than I expected.  They feel toyish and fragile, but they have been dropped a few times with no issues.  You should just get one to have around... the only caveat is that the film is really expensive.  Not so expensive that it's not worth buying, but expensive enough to be thoughtful about waste.","Absolutely love my Instax.  I take it on vacations with me and to outings with my friends and family.  I have never been disappointed with a shot unless I put it on the wrong setting.  Definitely would recommend this no matter what color you buy.  I bought this one because it was the cheapest color at the time - but I fell in love with the color once I had it in my hand.","I bought this for my daughters for Christmas last year and they absolutely love it! The pictures come out clear, it is very simple to use, and it's fun for kids!","This is listed as the fujifilm camera with a selfie mirror (notice the tiny mirror next to the lense) and so you would assume any third party sellers listing their items as this would be identical. However, it's just the normal fujifilm camera. Not bad, but I wish it came as described.","Quick shipping. LOVE THIS CAMERA I AM OBSSESED!!! Made my aunt cry for<br />Her birthday when she received photos that were printed right then and there. And it actually has a very wide range! Fits a lot of people! Love love love!","This was a big hit at my wedding. I love it! The color is so cute!","This is the first polaroid camera I have ever bought and it was so worth it. It's so cute and portable, not only do I get vintage inspired films from this I get to have the pictures almost instantly. So much worth the buy, now I can account on all my events to be captured into pictures.","I bought it as a birthday gift for my 15 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.  My only concern might be that the price of the film is a little on the high priced end.  But all in all - it was a huge hit with her.","perfect! exactly what i wanted! just wish film wasn't so expensive!","I recently signed up for Amazon Prime Now, which had become available in my locale. This morning I was just playing with the iPhone app and by chance saw this for sale, so I just ordered it. After all, I have been missing the good ol' days of Polaroid instants.<br /><br />It was delivered within the promised delivery window, along with some extra film packs. I popped in the included 2 AA batteries and a film pack. (Film pack is not included in the standard package.) The power button is actually a len extension lever button in the front, located next to the lens. Pushing the button extends out the lens and powers on at the same time. There's a very small optical viewfinder. Focus appears to be the .6m to infinity focus-free type. Exposure is a bit weird and annoying: there're five indicators on the lens itself - indoor, cloudy, partly cloudy, sunny, and \"hi-key.\" The instruction sheet gives you the corresponding F stops. Obviously indoor uses a slow F stop, with Hi-Key using a even slower stop to let in extra light which results in a highly exposed picture.<br /><br />What's annoying is to get the correct exposure, you must point the lens at your subject, then observe which indicator light is lid, then turn the lens to that light. Two problems: 1. when you look at the indicator lights, you're going to hold the camera different than when you frame your shot, so the indicator may have changed - this is a really dumb design. 2. you may simply forget to turn the lens to the right exposure. Why Fujifilm implemented such a dumb system, is beyond me.<br /><br />Luckily, the exposure doesn't appear to do much to the end product, which is your instant photo. The flash is on for every picture - so be sure you don't use this in an environment where flash is prohibited. You must use the Instax mini film packs; they also make other packs such as the wide type which cannot fit inside this model.<br /><br />After pressing the shutter which is located on the front of the camera \"beneath\" the viewfinder (if you hold the camera vertically), out pops the Polaroid-style photo from the top of the camera (if you hold it vertically). Development seems to take much longer than I remember with Polaroids. I have timed the process: 30 seconds to any hint of image appearing, and a full 2 minutes to a decently developed photo, and 5 minutes for the development to settle. I remember (of course I could be wrong about this) I was able to get a Polaroid photo within 1 minute of taking the picture.<br /><br />Speaking of Polaroid, your photos will look just like the old Polaroids, but perhaps with slightly better contrast. The film itself is rated ISO 800 so there is not much in way of resolution. The camera does tend to over-expose. Coupled with the always-firing flash, pictures tend to come out with lots of highlights, which does make most of us look more attractive than with a real camera.<br /><br />In the end, this is a \"novelty\" item that uses a technology that went back to the 60s and matured in the 70s. I have to say while I'm having a lot of fun with it (here's someone who takes close to 30,000 digital photos every year), I'm disappointed the technology has not improved, and may have come out worse in terms of film-processing speed.  I just hope the photos don't fade as fast as the old Polaroids.<br /><br />I'm going to order an accessory kit to add to the functionality. Going to Disney World next week with a bunch of old friends. Hopefully this will add some interesting fun to the trip. Since each film pack comes with only 10 films, I will have to load up on the film. BTW the film packaging warns you not to run these through X-ray machines.","I love this camera! It's pretty lightweight and easy to use. The only thing that made me slightly disappointed is that the color shown in the image is more pink than what the actual product looks like. It's a more of a washed out reddish pink.","cant wait to take pics","Love this little toy. Bought this for my gf as a gift and she loved it. The picture quality is good as a polarized camera. No other complains. Satisfied!","Love it ! Great Conditions!","I bought this for a photo booth at a small carnival. It was a HUGE hit. Easy to use and load film. I'm very happy with my purchase.","Love it! Takes amazing pictures","So I purchased this camera since it looked cool. But when I received it the camera would not turn on even with the compatible film. Then I bought a second one in pink, the film exploded with ink. What a horrible product. Rip off, don't buy.","Easy to use. Automatic lighting sensor tells you which of the 4 settings to use. Love it!","Adorable fun camera! Works great and speedy shipping!","Fast shipping, got here a day before than expected. Really amazing price too, will definitely come back here if I ever buy another.","Cute camera at such an affordable price . Can't wait for my daughter to see her Christmas Present.","Its great","I bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter - she hasn't used it yet.  She is very excited about this!","BEST camera ever! It's a cool new instant camera, and it works like a charm!  There isn't anything that I would say bad about it!","I thought I would use this camera all the time.  I was afraid of the cost of the film because of how much I was going to use it... nope.  It's a great idea for young children or for a party.  Not so much if you're a grown adult that has a job and can afford a real camera or if you own a smartphone.<br /><br />The picture quality is ok.  It's reminiscent of the old style poloroids from the 80s.  The thing is that like movies and tv, cameras have gotten better.  Much much better.  So don't be shocked if you can't really make out the details of a picture you took of your kids 20 feet away.<br /><br />Also take a look at the size of the pictures.  It's a lot smaller than the old style poloroids about half the size.<br /><br />This being said.  My children really like this camera.  I think because they were born to a time where we have automatic sensor lights in our house and Amazon's Echo tells us answers to whatever we ask it.  They have no idea what a land line phone is and TV has always been high def.  So a poloroid camera is a novelty and the manual process of producing a picture is like magic to them.  They can have a picture on paper (and not on the camera where they live).  I can see kids up to 12 really getting a kick out of this.  So the kid in me is giving this 4 stars.  If you have money to burn then buy this product.","Good one","100 %Satisfied","Great camera for my 5 yr old girl, who had wanted instant camera for a while now. She loved taking pictures AND getting the prints right away, as opposed to all the digital stuff we have. Word of a caution: be sure to let your kid know NOT to open the back of the camera where the film goes. My kid opened and wasted the full film pack (she actually took out the whole pack, and removed each film, one by one). And those things are not cheap :).<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with the purchase. It's much better present (I wouldnt call that a toy, as it has an actual use) than all other disney crap she wants. While camera is relatively not expensive, the films are, so keep this in mind. (Gillette using guys will know what I'm talking about ;))","Love this camera! It's not only super cute, but it's so much fun to use. I loved my Polaroid camera when I was a kid so I'm glad Fuji made this. It's a fun camera to use.","Love love it!! Wish I would have bought this a long time ago it's so much fun!","Exactly what I ordered:-) comes with batteries too, but film is separate I just bought it at bestbuy. Love it!","I got this camera as a gift and I absolutely love it! It’s portable and light and you can take it practically anywhere! It has four settings that you can set it to: outdoors, indoors, cloudy, and sunny. It also has a flash that the camera uses for every picture that you take. It does need batteries, but mine came with some so I didn’t have to worry about buying any. You do need to buy the camera film in order to take pictures. You can purchase the film at target, Walmart, best buy, etc. The film comes with ten but sometimes you can buy two for the price of twenty.<br /> The quality of the camera is great! The pictures come out looking soft and it gives you a sense that it’s old but in a good way. I highly recommend this camera to anyone it’s good for any occasion and you don’t have to worry about printing out the pictures later since the camera is an instant film!<br />P.S. sorry to whoever read this and thought it was dumb, I had to do this for a class assignment","Exactly what I was looking for!","Works great! My girlfriend loves it and the pictures turn out really good. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the price of the film. Other than that is a fun little camera.","This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter which I know she will love.  Her favorite color is pink!!!","Great","It is adorable first of all. It also brings a bit of nostalgia to me from growing up in the 90's. This camera is a hit where ever I go, people always ask me where I bought it. I have since moved on to the instax 300 wide camera but this camera will always have a special place in my heart.","Great Gift for my Daughter","I am IN LOVE with this camera!  It's really cool, feels good in the hands, and takes pretty good pictures. The only downside is the cost of film, and how long it takes to ship. Overall I would really recomend getting this Fujifilm instax mini 8.  '''","No problems at all! Loved the color! The package arrived safely and on time.","Nice little quirky thing to own. It worked as expected producing the pictures as expected","Looks wonderful! Arrived here faster than states. Couldn't ship film so I will need to hunt some down.","LOVE","Got this for my daughter and she loves it!!  She also got the film.  The pictures are smaller than the Polaroid pictures.  The camera is very easy to use.  Great item that teen girls love!!","lots of fun","I absolutely  love this camera that only downside is the price of film. I can't  wait to use it for holiday parties along with same photo booth props.","My daughter really enjoys it. I think it's a huge waste of money.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA!  It is so cute!  The picture quality is great!  I'm using this for my wedding guestbook, but I bought it early to play with it.  I'm so glad I did as I cannot stop using it!  I'm glad Amazon has affordable film!  Also, the pink is adorable.","Love the colors of the photos coming out of it. manages to get everyone excited to see how the photo came out. The eye lens shows a smaller farm then the photos when they come out, a bit annoying in group pics.","Excellent camera. The kids had a great time with this. Photos are small, but capture everything perfectly.","This was a gift for Granddaughter.  She loved it.","I'm only giving this three stars, because it was broken when I received it. It did not take pictures and would keep flashing. I've taken out the batteries and put in new ones, still nothing. I went and got one from Target instead and it works fine, so I will be returning the one I got from Amazon. Probably just had bad luck, but I do like the camera overall (I would have given it 5/5 if the one I received actually worked)","Oh my gosh! I love this camera, I'm taking it with me everywhere!!! I bought 50 sheets of film but I honestly don't think it's enough haha! Probably going to buy a lot more next paycheck! Love this camera, the pictures are small but they are really cute, the pictures take about less than 3 minutes to fully process, this camera is adorable and so worth it! Considering they sell these for way more! My package came perfectly, nothing wrong with it, came with batteries, it did take a while for it to come though but it was worth the wait!","Great gift","Great item","Thanks its very good and the delivery fast","Great","Love it","Excelent product","My daughter purchase this for her birthday and i believe its a perfect little gift for a 12 year old, its super fun to take when she is hanging out with her friend. Perfect memories. She put them on the back of her case or on her walls.","Love it! Everything works and looks perfect! Ordered more for my family. friends love it too!","Thanks to this, my daughter love this so much. She said that its super cute.","I love this camera!!! I traveled all over Europe and took tons of photos.","More red, then magenta but that was what I was wanting so its perfect!","Had this on my wishlist forever and finally got it as an anniversary gift! I was super excited for this one. It's one of those nostalgic items, for the retro kid in me - snapping pictures of anything and everything, everywhere I go. The camera itself does kind of feel like a cheap plastic toy, but the quality is good and it's so fun to use.","In a word? Obsessed.<br /><br />Ever since I got this camera in late September, I have brought it to several parties, as well as cons. Whenever I bring it, everyone always wants to take home the images. So I have to be judicious with who gets to take  a picture, otherwise I'm spending money on film I never see. I read other reviews about how popular the camera was with friends and family, and I can contest that it really is. People are surprised when they see it, and then curious about the lineage of how instant cameras have progressed to this point of small and compact size. I can't even tell you how many people have asked me where I've gotten it at this point.<br /><br />My entire reason for getting it was to take it to AWA to snap pictures of people in costumes, and have a physical representation of the convention experience. And because I have somewhat of a type-A personality, I did extensive research on multiple models over the course of several days. This is something I learned early on: every single person will call it a Polaroid. Not a single one knows to call it an Instax, even after finding out that’s what it is. Kind of interesting how much the Polaroid brand has withstood the test of time, like how people say Kleenex instead of tissue. Anyways... These Pros/Cons were taken before the purchase of the camera, and were generally what other people said over several platforms (Amazon, FujiFilm website, other blog posts). At the time of purchase, I got this model for 67.98, which was in line with all the other colors. Because it’s a popular color, it looks like they’ve upped the price.<br /><br />In case you aren’t looking to comparisons and you just want to know why I chose this model, I ended up deciding on the 8 for several reasons. While the cameras from 25 and beyond have a button feature for horizontal and vertical, the 8 doesn’t. I am completely fine with tilting the camera either way, and I have never had an issue taking vertical shots. The 8 also has a price point and purpose I think agree with each other. For less than $70, I could get an instant camera to take to parties and conventions, a camera I could also use for when I have a Photobooth set up at my parties (something I do a lot). And the final deciding factor was the color and design. The 8 comes in a variety of colors, including the beautiful pastel blueishgreen I decided on. While some people thought the design looked cheesy and cheap, I really loved it! I liked the lightweight feel and compact size and the cute sort of toy look of it appealed to my nostalgic side.<br /><br />By far, the best camera is the 90. It offers an option to turn the flash on/off, which I could say is the biggest caveat of all of the other cameras in this series. Because the flash is always on the 8, it washes out pictures taken in bright light. I’ve mostly used the 8 inside and at parties, ant it performs very well in that environment.<br /><br />At any rate, here are my findings:<br /><br />FujiFilm Instax 210 Instant Wide (camera priced at $72.89 as of 11/11, $15.99 for 20 exposures)<br />Note: Takes 4 AA batteries.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Better at outdoor images than smaller Instax cameras, because they show more detail.<br />-Larger photo size, about 2x bigger than the mini.<br />-More like a classic Polaroid from the ‘90s, so it has a really nice nostalgia factor.<br />-Has 3 different camera modes: lighten, darken, and normal.<br />-Tends to look best with a horizontal shot, but you can turn the camera for a vertical shot.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Bulky, not easy to carry in a pocket or small purse.<br />-Auto flash.<br />-Not conducive to traveling, due to its large size.<br />-Fragile construction.<br /><br />Recommended for: Anyone who wants more of a classic Polaroid feel, with larger images.<br /><br />____<br /><br />FujiFilm Instax Mini 8 (camera priced at $67.49 – 72.00 as of 11/11, $15 for 20 exposures)<br />Note: Takes 2 4AA batteries.<br />Note: Just because this camera doesn’t offer an option for horizontal and vertical images does not mean you can’t simply tilt the camera, because you definitely can!<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Small photo size, about the size of a business card.<br />-Portable and easy to travel with.<br />-Takes good indoor/outdoor photos.<br />-Camera itself is available in many colors.<br />-Cute design.<br />-Sturdy construction.<br />- Has 4 settings: indoor, cloudy, little sun, sunny.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Small photo size (both a pro and con).<br />-Easy to over and underexpose film.<br />-Jamming film problem with some people.

I've taken it with me to NYC, to countless parties, to conventions, and just regular ole days out on the town. Here are a few observations over the year:<br />-It sucks in light. Like really really sucks. It always washes images out, and sometimes that creates a cool effect, but for the most part it just looks bad. I really wish there was a way to turn off the flash, but since there isn't this camera is best inside.<br />-It only sort of eats up batteries. It will start flashing when it's low, but I've been able to take somewhere between 20-30 additional photos after it has started flashing. Just make sure that you only turn it on when you're ready to take a shot, and not spending forever waiting for your friends to get into a decent formation.<br />-It is pretty bulky (but not heavy) for travel purposes. It takes up a lot of precious space in suitcases or backpacks, so be prepared to sacrifice the loss of a few items of clothing for it.<br />-It can take a little bit of a beating. In my suitcase, jostled with shoes, clothes, and books, it has done fine. It's also done well when I put it in a little bag I have with extra batteries that are loose and jiggling around and knocking into it.<br />-It still works swimmingly for me. I've never experienced any issues with jamming or any other issues, really.<br />-And one final tip. It's probably best to buy an extra 10-20 rolls for parties, because people will REALLY REALLY want to take the pictures home.","I love this camera.  I bought it on a whim and it has been so fun to bring to parties and dinners.  My only negative is that the instructions are nearly impossible to read and the film is a little expensive.  But I still love it.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA....need I say more?","Great for parties. Everyone loves it.","MY GRAND-DAUGHTER WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT HER GIFT!!!","Really very fun camera!! very good quality of the photos!!!","got mine in today & I am so excited to use it! I won't give it 5 stars because it should at least come with 10 photo films to get started.","My sister loves this! Definitely brings you back to the golden days and we love that you get the picture instantly! The pictures are clear and everything is extremely easy to use.","Bought this for a Bridal Shower so the Bride could get a cute book with all her photos in them. Everyone at the party loved it. Huge hit. I will definitely be using it more.","The camera works great.","Gr daughter loved the blue camera. The blue mudder camera case fit the camera perfectly. She couldn't have been happier.","No selfie mirror as clearly stated - angered.","It is one of the things that I want to buy.","really beautiful","Lovely color,just I like.","So beautiful camera. I love it. I want to give it a try.","My daughter loves it. She's very happy with the camera.","It's such a great camera, definitely recommend it . The pictures come out so clear and nice .  It would be an awesome gift for anyone","I love this camera. I'd never been into photography (and still aren't that interested in it, to be honest!) but this camera makes me enjoy taking pictures very much. I carry it everywhere I go so thank goodness it's light weight. The only downside is that the film is quite expensive for how little you get in each box ($10-$12 for 10 sheets). Some of the reviews of this camera say that the pictures don't come out well, but I haven't had any problems with mine; the colours come in crisp (keep in mind that these pictures are supposed to look \"vintage\") and develop very quickly. I also saw some reviews saying how paper jamming is frequent, but I've had my camera for over a month and I've used it at least once almost every day since purchase, and mine hasn't jammed at all. I get so many compliments on how cute this camera is, so I definitely recommend it!","Perfect","My favorite camera ever! i ordered it in the color Raspberry and it's super cute (°?°?)","It's a great lil camera","Great to use for children's parties!  Instant photos for the kids - and you don't have to worry about getting any approval from parents as the kids take home their pics.  Love the \"pink\" color!  Easy to use...","my granddaughter loves it-big hit with her friends","I bought this camera for my daughter and she loves it! No issues to report yet. Although, I do think the product does seem a little fragile. Handle with care..","xmas gift","Great camera","My sister loved it ^_^ I bought it for her birthday.","I consider myself an intermediate photographer, and I found it so unfortunate that once I got into photography, Polaroids were a thing of the past. I was so stoked to learn that a new generation of instant camera is so present on the market now!<br />I got my camera a few days ago and I've already gone through two packs of film. This is my new favorite thing!<br />The controls are easy to understand, there's a little bit of a learning curve, but that's very small. Four shots, and this camera is now easy-peasy.<br />I highly recommend this to novice and professional photographers a like. It's a fun little toy to have, and is well worth the price of the films.","Bought this as a gift for my friend and she loved it","I have ALWAYS wanted a camera like this & I love anything that comes in pink. This soft, light pink is so gorgeous & very close to the color of my bedroom. I'm so happy that this came with a wrist strap too. I almost ordered one separately, but glad I didn't. This camera is so easy to use & absolutely adorable. I'm getting tired of all my special moments being electronic, so I want moments I can keep forever. The strap can be put on either side, which is handy. It also has adjustments for each type of lighting. The photo shown was on a super dark, rainy day, so I was happy that our cat actually showed up & was of good quality. Overall, this is an amazing purchase & I couldn't be happier :)","This little camera is so much fun!! I had purchased it for photos while we travel. And ended up using it for our wedding. They aren't the higest quality but I think that's a bit of the charm!! Film is expensive but worth it if you can afford t for special trips and memories!","Very nice camera! I absolutely love it and I'm so glad i got it; I already took ten pictures with it!","This was my plan B for my wedding reception photo booth. Great product. Easy to use. The kids enjoyed hearing how this was a way we took photos in the old days. I am so glad I bought this and the extra film.","I bought it for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it!!!!! Nice pictures and very fun!!!!!","super cute and easy to use camera","Exactly what I was looking for.  I'd absolutely order again.  It was easy to use and easy to refill.","I bought this for my daughter's birthday.  It was a hit at the party.  It was something she really wanted and it works great.","Works great but the function in the lense to change the lighting is broken. Can't always trust the picture will turn out great because of this.","works greaaaaaat","love this camera!!","This was such a hit at my sister's wedding! The camera is great. Photo quality is great and the size is perfect for me. However, the photo paper is expensive if u use it a lot.","It was a gift for my granddaughter  She loves it!","Got this as a present for my sister. She LOVES it. The pictures are super cute, it's very lightweight and portable, and the instructions are pretty clear.","As described","Great product. I use it all the time.","Granddaughters 11th birthday gift. Said it was her best birthday gift ever!","So much fun!! Bought this for a party and now my nephew thinks I'm magic because I have a camera that prints pictures automatically! And to think, this was just the norm a while back!","So far great camera","perfect for my scrapbooking.  bought this one for my boyfriend's mother, who's also a scrapbooker","Bought this camera for my wife. She really loves it. She especially likes to use it for taking passport like photos for the girl scouts.","It doesn't really focus for up-close pictures, so I bought detachable selfie lens that supposedly fixes that. I haven't quite figured out how to use it yet because all the instructions are in Chinese. It comes with two AA batteries (appreciated) and a countdown to let you know how many shots are left. Wish it held more than 10 photos at a time! It supposedly has different settings for indoor versus outdoor photos, but for the life of me I cannot figure out if this can take photos without flash yet. The flash always seems to go off, which makes it hard to get photos if you're near any reflective surfaces. That said, it is really satisfying to hold an actual photo in your hands right after taking it. The color is cute too. It feels a little on the cheap side but I got it for $50 so can't complain! The exposure button is a little close to the aperture to be careful or your fingertip will appear in the corner of every photo.","Enjoyable for that teen!","Awesome and fun!","my little sister loved it and ran around taking pictures all night","Our granddaughter is enjoying her new camera.","I love my camera great for capturing moments recommend you buy","my daughter has really loved this little camera its perfect for her. but the film seems kinda high.","Great product, good picture quality","Everthing was ok with the order. Thank you.","Works great, definetly worth the money.","I bought this to do our own version of a photo booth at my daughter's 13 birthday party - it took awhile for the younger kids who are used to digital cameras to figure out they had to look through the hole to take a picture - but that gave the rest of us a good laugh! The pictures were fun for people to take home as souvenirs and there was a little bit of space to write the date/event info on.","instant film camera was a good deal for the money.  also like the color.  kind of difficult to find the film in stores but that's not really an issue.","so far so good bought about a month or two ago and its been great so happy i made the purchase , still getting the settings figured out for when your outside, I've found if i put the picture setting on the one it tells me , it hasn't come out right,  so be careful with that maybe its just me lol !","My daughter loves the camera and loves the memories. She loves to make scrap books.","Cute. Have zoom in function","My 14 year old Grand Daughter LOVES this!!! She couldn't stop saying Thank you!!!","Nice artifact.","Worth the price, instant pictures at your finger tips! Con: A little pricey for the film.","Great, no problems","my daughter got this for her birthday and has not stopped taking pictures.  i bought the film too.","Amazing product! thank you!","Nice camera ..I loved the color.","Great camera! Very easy to use! Bought for my daughters 9 th birthday, she loves it!<br /><br />The pictures are credit card shaped and look vintage, very cool!","Got this pink Instax Mini 8 for a good deal and was everything that my girlfriend wanted! Takes great stills, but you have to practice focusing it and setting it on the right setting for light and such. Looked new in box, but tape sealing it was broken.","quality of pictures is not as good as expected, but besides that easy to handle","This is the mini instant film camera. It comes in black. Blue. Pink. White. Yellow. Grape. Raspberry.  Indigo. It is lightweight and very portable. So easy to use. Easy to refill. So fun to use.  So handy to have on hand for those photo moments when you want to take a picture. And you get to have the picture printed there and then. Perfect.  This would really made a nice gift. Very fast shipping","EXCELLENT","The camera color is awesome. This was a birthday gift & our daughter loves it!","Perfect for elementary school kids.","Love my camera! So cute and easy to use.

The photo paper is pretty pricey but it is definitely worth it!","Great camera! Takes great pictures and is really fun!  Would highly recommend!","Great for instant photos at our wedding! Love the small size. Photo quality not the same as film camera, but love the retro look!","Cool","Gave this camera as a gift for my best friend's birthday and she absolutely loved it! It is well built and easy to use. I like the matte black, it looks very sleek.","takes great pix, n my daughter has so much fun with it!","We bought this for my daughter's birthday and she loves it!","My daughter love it..","Bought this for my daughters 14th B-day and she absolutely went crazy with taking pictures all night long. They enjoyed it so much, only thing was they went through 4 rolls of film in just a few hours time.","my daughter loves it perfect for her and her friends","I love it! Works great, just as decribed. Sugh a quick, fun way to capture moments.","Omg, this is literally the cutest thing ever. Can't wait to get mines. Their so freaking adorable!

Her birthday is next month.<br />Gram","I love it","its nice to have a hard copy.","Awesome! Got this for my daughter for her birthday.  She loves it. It is super easy to use and the camera has settings that help it take the best pictures depending on the light.  Thank you!","Very easy to use camera but I wish they had made this with zoom possibilities. When I take pictures it is definitely like old school where you cannot focus and you are literally just looking through the viewfinder to take your picture.","This is the perfect camera! I absolutely adore it!! If you are iffy about buying, don't! It's completely worth it!!","Super fun for special events. The photos come out great.","Give me lots of fun . Very good~","I absolutely love this camera!!!!! My pictures come out great and it's easy to use. I highly recommend this camera :)","Such a fun camera!  Pictures come out very vintage feeling.  So much fun to have little shots of your kids, family and friends.  My little one really loves watching the pictures come and waiting for them to expose.  Blast from the past fun!","Vintage and nice. Good for party to give the photos to the people right away. Photo size is a little small but good enough.","I bought this for a gift so we will see how it works when I give it to my granddaughter.","Was everything i wanted.  My girlfriend doesn't stop using it.  These pictures are alot of fun.","Bought one of these for my friends birthday and she loves it. I also got one for my birthday in baby blue and the pictures come out great.","I was so excited to order this after My cousin told me that she recieved one for her birthday .. It was delivered fast and came with the film I ordered, great camera easy to use not too big no complaints besides the film and the size of the photos were too small for me , so I returned and ordered the wide camera will write a review there once i recieve it in the mail","I didn't realize how many Polaroids it eats up and I'm very unsure despise very vague directions on how to use the settings. I bought the little rabbit lens I have no idea What the thing does","The camera is cute but I feel like it gets dirty easily.","I bought these for an adult \"halloween\" party, people ranged from 21-65+.. we had a blast, great photos, a bit small, so if you're looking for that \"old polaroid\" kinda 4x6 this is not the camera for you.. the photos are like 2x3 and the border takes up a bit of the frame. the good news is that the film is relatively inexpensive, compared to the \"real\" polaroid film that is still available..nostalgic, hip and quit surprisingly, even NEW to some people!!<br />How quick we are to forget...the film takes a few minutes to actually \"expose\", people of the iPhone age can't relate.. they had a blank stare and many asked what they did wrong..or they'd stare in amazement from the film rising from the camera..hilarious!! ANYHOW<br />I'm passing off to my children for a bit, but I'm definitely borrowing them for the next party!","I purchased this gift for  my daughter's 15th birthday and she absolutely loved it...it had different pic modes and one of them makes the pic look like the old school Polaroid cameras. ..it was worth every penny","Love it","I really liked this product. When you pop out the lens, it has 5 different settings. It also takes pictures pretty good for a polariod. I am going to use it for a sign in table at my wedding. I will update to see how it held up to that.","I love it. I don't regret getting it, because when o go to the stores its way too expensive and here I was able to get it.","ok","Came in when promised. Works perfectly.","This camera was purchased as a gift and the recipient loved it! Works well and the pictures turn out perfectly. Very happy with this purchase.","This is the perfect gift for a teenager or college student.  My college student was thrilled to receive this, and she's filled her room with garlands of the wee photos.  Yes the film is expensive, but buying in bulk saves money.  There's a learning curve to how to take successful photos which wastes a fair amount of film, but once you figure out lighting, the pics are lovely in an instamatic-y way.  I can't think of a gift my daughter has enjoyed or used more.","Love this camera. Price is great and shipping was fast. Comes with batteries. I remember my parents  having an instant camera when I was young. My son loves that the photo comes out when he takes the picture. In the age of cell phone photos and not getting film developed, this is so fun for him and me. Looking firward to taking Halloween photos. The pictures are good quality. Now my daughter wants one of her own because she is away at college. I plan to buy her one for Christmas. Great product","amazing product!","Love it!!!","My daughter keep taking pictures..","It takes amazing pictures with that vintage feel to it. Super adorable, easy to use. Arrived on time. If your looking for a way to keep those moments that you treasure then this is the camera for you!!","It just came in today. It is perfect ","Very good buy !!!!","I love this camera so much","I like it","Worked perfectly ","Purchased as gift for my sister. She loves it! It works well.","love the camera but the film can get a little pricy, I recommend getting a 50 pack because its so easy to run out of film with this fun little camera!","DON'T EVEN THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT IT. GET IT!!! all the colors are darling and they work amazing it's hard to stop taking pictures.<br />The size is perfect, the color is too.<br />Remember first put the batteries in AND THEN (don't turn it on) put the film in, line the yellow stripes. Close it turn it on. The first picture won't be a picture but the cover of the film, it'll be black . Don't panic! The next pic should be the actual Polaroid.<br />The hi-key settings is for pictures that you want to turn out washed out, like white so don't use this outside in a sunny day! Use it in a dark environment.<br />For cheapness, buy film in large quantities! Not a single 10 film packet <br /> Also you should buy sticker frames instead of cute films! Its way way cheaper but that's up to you!<br /><br />Enjoy it and have fun!","This is even prettier in person. It is a great gift and way better price than in stores.","What is this yellow spot on my pictures ? It went from having a yellow discolouration to now just coming out plain white","thx","My favorite purchase on Amazon so far! It takes a little bit of playing with the settings and how far away you can be to get a good shot, but once you know what lighting works, you're good to go. The different colored frames on other film packs are super adorable too.","Love this, I take pictures of mostly my boyfriend and I. I really like have instant photos instead of phone pics, besides the waiting is fun","I love it!! I just wish film was cheaper and came with more","Thanks it is fantastic","IN LOVE WITH IT","I love my Polaroid camera takes super cute fotos but u have to make sure when u taking the pictures you move it a little to the right after you center your shot.","So glad I bought this camera. I take it with me everywhere and always get compliments on it.","Love love love!!!","I gave this as a gift to my younger sister and she absolutely loves this camera. She takes it every where! It is totally worth the money, and the pictures come out amazing!","Fun!","Had to return it cause I wanted the white one instead but the camera is so much fun! Loved the way the photos turn out once they print out!","Amazing Camera and so fun to use!  However the first time it was dropped it broke.  I did buy the warranty plan, so just waiting now to see how that plays out...","Super easy to use, cool looking photos and the purple is nice and vibrant. Great product for teens and adults alike. Took it out of the box and was snapping photos in the matter of minutes. I was deciding between this and the more expensive version, so happy with my choice!","My daughter is very pleased with this camera.  Just wish that the picture films were less expensive!!!","Perfect Thank you","great pics love it fast easy to take and fun","I love my camera! Learn how to use the settings though, otherwise your photos could be completely blown out or way too dark.","Bought this for my girlfriend before we went on a road trip. She absolutely loved it and her folks did too. They were surprised to see a film camera, let alone something like this. Takes amazing photos that you can keep just about anywhere.","Love my New camera and it takes wonder pictures","Love it","camera came in and we are enjoy that also","I LOVE THIS SO MUCH! My boyfriend got this as an early birthday present for me and I luuuurrrrve it so much. I haven't had any problems with film or anything. I've only taken three pictures because the film is pricey but otherwise it's great!","My favorite purchase this year... Great for scrapbooking","Easy to use and take clear photos","Amazing deal. Amazing product. I have two","Fun camera and love having instant pictures when I want them","Delivery was on time (which is always a plus), and the product was in perfect condition! I love love love this camera, especially since I have a LO, this captures such awesome moments with her :)","An amazing device! Super cute, got as gift for my sister and she loves it! Easy to use and makes beautiful photos!","We bought this for our daughter for her birthday!  She absolutely loves it!","Overall a cute little camera, great for using to take candid photos for collages or scrapbooking.","This is a fun throwback to bring to parties and take drunk pics and put them on the persons refrigerator then take pictures of the pictures the next morning so they can be properly uploaded to Facebook.","Great gifts at affordable prices.","Good","Was disappointed to find that the entire packaging, instructions, etc were in Chinese/Japanese. This product was intended for purchase in Asia, not the US. The product works great but the batteries did not. They didn't work at all.","A++++++++","Came in great condition! Thnak you so much! i love it!","Hands down, the best gift for teen you know, be it a niece, cousin, friend, babysitter, neighbor, scrapbooker, etc. For me, kids between the ages of 10 and 20 can be so difficult to shop for. But even with Facebook and Instagram, kids love actual photographs of themselves and friends. Without fail, a Fujifilm Instax Mini Instant Film Camera in their favorite color is always an instant hit.","my new favorite thing! I feel I will be so creative with this camera!","Perfect everything!!","Love the camera and use it all the time.","I LOVE THIS!!!","SO. MUCH. 80's FUN!!! This is a blast, and the pictures are really unique & remind me of when I was a kid! My girls love taking pictures, and, while the pictures themselves are a little spendy, I think it is totally worth it, and have framed quite a few....it makes me smile every time I walk by the tiny pics hung up in the hallway!","Great stuff!","Love this!!! Super easy and fun for INSTANT gratification. Plus so cute to decorate your room or car with the pictures.","very good product from Fuji as always","Works perfectly it's amazing.","works well.  film can be kind of expensive but fun product nonetheless.  my girlfriend loves it","Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.","My granddaughter loved her little camera, though I was disappointed that it did not come with one packet of film, just the camera itself.  Fortunately, I had also purchased extra film, so she was not disappointed with her gift.<br /><br />I'd think a product obviously aimed at children would include at least a little film so they could use the camera immediately.","Attended expectations Good price.","My boyfriend bought me this camera and I think it is adorable. It's really lightweight and i thought it was pretty simple to get started. All you have to do it put the batteries in and load the pack of film and you're ready to go. The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is because the photos are really small, maybe about the size of a credit card or so. Still, the quality is beautiful and operating the camera is simple. It even detects the appropriate lighting setting for you.","Great camera and I love the color. It's cute and compact and such a portable size. Great for bringing around and taking pictures that are wallet sized and compact.","LOVE THIS CAMERA!","Awesome! It is seriously the best thing ever and we'll worth the cost. It comes with batteries and it works good. I would suggest getting accessories it just makes it more cool also buy lots of extra film :)","Very nice and cute :) I would recommend","I love this camera! It takes cute little instant pictures, and I'm glad that I can get film for it right at Walmart. This is inexpensive and awesome.","Love it!","We've got this for our 13 yrs old daughter- because she begged for it :) She is happy with it. The photo quality is not perfect but she likes hanging them around. I'd expect a little larger photos, they're very tiny. Arrived on time, no damage or broken pieces.","excellent","I purchased the yellow Instax Mini 8, along with a accessorie package. The camera itself is absolutely WONDERFUL. I've taken several photos, and all of them have came out amazing. For a older style camera, the quality of the photos are excellent. After reading many, many reviews on this product I decided to buy it, and this is probably one of my greatest buys! I definitely recommend it. Soon I'll be purchasing this camera in different colors. 10/10","fun to use","I love this camera, it works well inside the house. I've tried many times to take pictures outside and if it is a cloudy day the pictures look washed out. I couldn't fully see myself it was almost blurry. I'm still testing it out, but inside the house works best.","Cool!!","It was blood gold! Takes damn good photos.","it was for my daughter ...its ok for a while ..she got bored","It was amazing. Came right on time for my birthday.","My daughter just loves it!!!!","Perfect","My 10year old daughter loved this birthday gift.  We first saw it at a wedding set up for a photo booth.  It looks elegant, is incredible easy to use and is super cute. Instant gratification and the photos are pretty good quality...","A+","Awesome little camera with super cute instant photos. Amazon's delivery with this item was flawless and I could not be more happy to have been able to take pictures at my cousin's wedding since the camera came right on time!","Got it in the grape colour, which is exactly the colour you would expect. Takes great photos, really clear and the colours are quite vibrant also.<br /><br />It didn't come with even one film, which would be bad if you bought somebody this without any spares. And the films are a little bit expensive too, but not nearly as expensive as the polaroid Sheets!","Absolutely love this camera, takes great pictures. Didn't realize how much I missed point, shoot, and print cameras! So far this product is exactly what we are looking for! Going to use it for our wedding instead of hiring someone to do a photo booth for a ton of $$$","This is a really cool camera, the photos taken print out right away and look like old school photos so they are not clear like any other picture. The size is nice for this kind of camera, the pictures are kind of small but as advertised. Lighting is a bit of an issue, it does not perform well in dark places and the instructions leave much o be desired.","Very nice camera. Great quality!!!","This little camra is so fun and amazing!  We bought it for our 14 year old daughter so she could capture some memories at Disneyland. She had so much fun with it. Took really great pictures and just fun to have!","Love how I can take a picture and print it instantly","I had wanted a Polaroid since I was 6 yrs old and I'm SO happy to finally have one. I love the picture quality, you don't even need instructions it's so simple to you. I'm absolutely obsessed with it. Couldn't possibly be happier","They are soooo cute!","This was a hit. My daughter had a blast playing with this camera. Some of the pictures came out blurry but once we had the settings right they came out very clear. Really happy i chose this over the polariod, its a great camera and she loves it!","bought this for my 11 year old granddaughter for her birthday and she loved it.","It's a gift for my niece! She loves it!","Birthday gift for my daughter...she LOVES this camera!!","great!","I love this camera! It's so cute and perfect. I bring it around whenever I go on adventures and every picture makes me so happy!","EKKKKS!! It's so cute and I waited really long and thought hard about buying one of these. I went on a \"hipster\" vacation with a friend and this was the perfect addition to our trip. The white gets dirty really easily dirty, but it's nothing that a baby wipe can't clean up. This one has the pop out lens to turn on, and the flash. It tells you the \"ideal\" setting since there's a light sensor next to the flash where it detects the lighting in the area. Some pictures come washed out depending on the lighting and the flash together, but it gives it this great vibe!<br /><br />No complaints about the camera and I think it's a better investment from Amazon than Best Buy or another stores. Make sure you use the fujifilm instax COLOR film or else your camera won't work. The polaroid like picture comes out instantly (make sure not to shake it) and instant picture in your hand. It's pretty sturdy, comes with a strap for your wrist. I don't trust myself to just hold it by the straps, but it does look cute in your hand. Super reliable and captures the moment perfectly. Also, on the back of the camera, it tells you how many photos you have left. Once you pop in a new film set, it'll be at S (which is the plastic film). Once that first one is taken out, then it'll start the countdown which is really helpful. 10 seems really little, but it sometimes feels like a lot. The lens is wide enough to get two people for a selfie, but it naturally points lower, so hold your camera up a little higher!","The flash is not so good, but everything else is pretty good.","So awesome. Taking me back to the 90s when I always had my polaroid on me.","Bought for a party and it was a blast! I posted the photos on my fridge with small magnets and they still make me laugh every time I pass. Made me feel nostalgic for the 80s/90s.","It's a nice camera for getting instant photos. I am not so thrilled about the quality of the prints, but that could be contributed to getting familiar with using the right settings under different conditions.","Got in on time, love it!!","Came fast also easy directions and the pictures always come out great.","I love it.","Such a fun camera to use! It is simple and easy to use, too! The film is reasonable. It serves it's purpose well. If you want an inexpensive, instant camera . . . this is the one to buy!! I used it for a wedding reception for guests to leave a photo and message for the bride & groom.","Great camera.  works great and takes fun pictures","Awesome camera GF loved it!","Awesome","Fun!","Like a lot","so cute! for those perfect memories.","really good! Fun to use. I would suggest buying some white electrical tape and placing it over the flash, this will prevent your pictures from being flushed out, because the flash is really strong on this camera.","Takes good pics, but sometimes depending on the lighting, even when you specifically set it automatically goes back to what it senses??? Wouldn't be a big deal except the film gets expensive and since there's only 10pics per roll, it's a bummer when you specifically set it and it switches to auto mode and faces turn out way \"whiter\"...","My granddaughter loved it.","I love the Fujifilm Instax Mini so far. Really easy to use and awesome picture quality.","It's just the right size, cute, color as shown in the picture and my friend absolutely loved it! It's adorable and a great gift for anyone who wanted a Polaroid. The delivery also came on time and in perfect condition.","Super fun to have.  Cheaper online than michaels.","I love my fujifilm instax excellent camera for quick and cute pictures!","I love it!","A favorite gift of my granddaughter on Her eighth Bday.","Works very well. Makes a great gift!","Bought this to use as a \"guestbook\" at our wedding. Our guests took photos of each other and all the photos are a great memento from our day! Our guests did have some issues with exposure (overexposed) but I think that was because some guests didn't know to change the settings. Most photos turned out great though!","Pictures are to small and its not a great picture either.","My only concern is that it takes dark pictures sometimes but my 17 year old daughter thinks it's perfect.","Got this for my 14 year for her birthday and she loves it.","Works perfectly. Only used a couple times so far, but my girlfriend loves it. Good picture quality compared to what I was expecting. Picture turned out darker but you can adjust it.","These products were great and so much fun. Pictures turned out clear. and great.  Would buy them again","Was quick ..I am a happy costumer. .","Took it on vacation to OBX and everyone enjoyed it. It was a little blast from the past. It was left outside over night and a thunderstorm rolled through. I took the film and batteries out and let it dry for ~24 hours and it worked like a charm afterwards. Anyone looking to have fun and not worried about the candid photos they will get will enjoy this camera a lot. I see this being a big hit at get togethers and the once in awhile moments that you want to keep close to you.","Super fun camera!  Really love it!  Have taken loads of great photos with a \"vintage feel\" indoors, but still haven't figured out the settings for outdoors.  Adjusted the exposure several times, but so far photos have come out overexposed.  Will keep trying!","Takes great photos vintage style","I puchased it for a nine-year old girl and she loved it!  It is easy to use and the raspberry color made a big hit, too!","My daughter loves it","Amazing","Bought this for my husband's niece as a high school graduation gift, along with a few packs of film. She was thrilled to get it.","Bought this for a roadtrip.  Easy to use.  Really enjoyed having instant photos to put into my travel journal each day.  We were traveling in the desert so some photos were a bit over-exposed even when the light meter was set on the highest level, but I kinda like the blown out look.  I did forget to check the meter on several occasions and totally ruined those pictures.  You definitely have to train yourself to adjust the settings first!","This camera is amazing! pictures look very neat and vintage! I'm using it to make a photo album for my baby, but I think it can be use for anything. I highly recommend it. I got the cherry color and it's nice, I which it was more reddish but is still nice.","The directions are absolutely inscrutable.","Great instax camera. Great when you need a picture now!","I love this camera. It's quick and easy to use. The only down side is if you take pictures outside and it is already dark, you have to be pretty close to the camera for the flash to work-- otherwise you're left out of the picture. I got this camera for an anniversary present from my fiancé. He did all of the research and picked it out. I can honestly say that if I would've had to choose my own camera (instead of receiving this as a surprise), I would've picked this same one. The pictures are great quality and the camera is sturdy. I couldn't be more excited and happy with this.","I purchased this camera as a gift for my niece. I was really impressed to see how great this camera works, even though it looks kind of cheap manufacturing. Dont get me wrong, the design is really nice and iteorks excellent. I am happy to see this type of picture taking back. I think that you can aleays appreciate a picture tgat yiu can actually feel and touch more than digital. The quality of the pictures that come from this camera are very nice.","Great quality","I love this camera. I saw this on my favorite Korean tv show and was hoping they sold this here in the USA. I am so glad it is available on Amazon. It takes great pictures and the pictures and the picture comes out instantly and only takes seconds to develop.<br /><br />Edit*** It has now been a year since I first got this camera.<br /><br />The camera is still in great condition and I have only had to change the batteries once. The pictures come out clear each time and the camera fully functions. I did drop this camera a few weeks ago and the top part of the lid came off but the rest of the camera was safe. I was able to snap back in the front cover of the camera.","Well-built. Lovely color. I've tested it and it works... Except for the lights on the high-key dial: I would change the setting, but the option I select would not light up.","my favorite color and favorite instant camera!","Love this camera I can't wait to buy more.","best camera ever!","Love this camera. SO CUTE!","Purchased this for my child as a birthday present. She loves this camera. The pictures are the size of a credit card and has pretty good quality. We love the instant gratification you get.  I would recommend this product for adults and children, very easy to use.","My daughter loves it.","It's perfect for my wedding!","A fun version of the classic polaroid, great colors. Easy to use.No zoom, very simple","I love it ","I love my camera, it came on time and nothing was broken or damaged. the box didn't have any dents when I got it. It shipped on time and I'm really happy with the product.","Great price! My teens love this camera","its soooooooooo cute and soo cool :D","Bought this so I could take pictures during family reunions and have an actual physical copy of them instead of just looking through facebook. The pictures I took were great! This camera is definitely worth buying","It's aiight. Fun, but don't expect a digital shot, ya'll.","Perfect","It work great, excellent quality and arrived super fast! Super happy with it","I am so glad I purchased this camera. I debated it for months and finally gave in. It was worth the cost in my opinion. I wish the film was cheaper. It is a little bulkier than I had expected. I enjoy it.","Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Pink)<br /><br />I'm not into stuff like this. But my girlfriend is super trendy and hipster and she loves it!","She loves it.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA! IT'S VERY CUTE AND STYLISH AND DOES THE JOB.","It's okay","cool stuff","Nice  product and  the  quality is  excellent , recommended","I am a little upset and wanted to share with all of you why real quick. I was so excited to get this awesome camera and start taking some cool polaroid pics to hang on my wall!  Unfortunately, all of the pictures I have taken have come out blurry.  I am not sure if I just received a slightly defective one or if this is a common problem so don't completely write it off.  I have tried it on all the settings with multiple sets of film over a few weeks but there has been no improvement.  It's just a little disappointing because I was so close ya know?  like the composure is great and the settings all work great but everything is just too blurry to be able to look at every picture and be happy with it.  Anyways, hopefully no one else runs into this problem and make sure to take good care of it! ( really wish I could buy another one...maybe in a couple months.) Hope this helps...","Awesome camera. Came in two days in really good conditions. Camera was a little darker than the picture that was fine. This camera is small and cute. Love it!","I adore this camera, the only mild drawback is that the film can get pretty expensive but that is alright because it is an awesome way to take pictures. No editing, just pure picture taking. I adore the color as well.","fast shipping, great price","At time! Good!","Bought it for sister in-law as a graduation gift. She loved it!","love it","love it awesome","The film isn't cheap, but the novelty is worth it. A lot of fun for any age. I wish it used Instax Wide film instead of Mini for bigger prints.<br /><br />This camera has zero low-light functionality unless your subject is less than a few meters away. Tried to capture a picture at twilight, but it came out completely black lol.","I purchased this one because it came with a pack of film. The photos so far have come out really washed out. I hope it's an issue with the film and not the camera. The camera has fun accessories (purchased seperate) and is really easy to use.","Ordered this for my daughters 13th birthday. She loves the camera and has found it very easy to use. The film is fairly affordable, but not so much when a 13 year old girl takes pics of everything in sight the first couple days. I would highly recommend this product.","LOVEEEEEEE IT! IT'S AMAZING IN EVERY WAY!  BUY IT! !! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!","Great camera that takes great instant photos!","great","Fun and works great","I use this camera as a fun party tool and all around good time product. The photos come out clear and people love to see themselves. Last time I took it to work on New Year's Eve and took photos of my office mates to show what they looked like at the last day of 2014. It was a hit. I have no problems with this little babe.","This is such a GREAT camera!!! A great camera for a great price. I've only taken one picture, and I am SO IMPRESSED! Before buying this camera however, consider the cost of film. Film is expensive! For 50 pictures it cost about $47 dollars. >_<","Amazing!!","I absolutely loved it! I wasn't able to be at my place when it got delivered and they came the next day which I think is the best! Oh and camera is very cute(:","Lovely little camera. Just like the classic Polaroids of the 90s. Highly recommend.","Bought this as a gift for my step-daughter.  She was very happy about it.  She doesn't use it as much as anticipated though because of having to purchase film.  From what I saw, the quality of the pictures was really good.","haven't used this yet. It will be a Christmas gift for my daughter.  It's very pretty, so I hope it works well.","Fabulous camera for making personalized cards.","Perfect","film is expensive to buy","Excelent Product","Works great, just like description! Fun and easy to use! Love my new pictures!","Now I can make memories in an instant!","I got this new but when I tried to change the light exposure setting, it didn't work. It was kind of lame","Wonderful!!!! I LOVE THIS CAMERA AND THE QUALITY IS PERFECT","Takes excellent pictures!!!  love it!!!","This was a fun item at a big party.  I used this along with some photo booth props also purchase on Amazon.  Fun, memorable photos created at an instant at the party. You can take 2 shots:  keep one and the other give to your friends.","I really love it!! It works great, came fast, and takes great pictures :) BTW just in case some are wondering if it comes with the film included IT DOESN'T, but you can always order some! :)","I bought this camera for my little sister to give to her on her 13th birthday. She is just starting to get into photography and this is a nice and fun compliment to the rest of her photography arsenal. Not having to wait to upload the pictures onto a computer or have the film developed at the store results in some instant gratification and reminds me of the good ole days when I was younger than she is now. It is a bummer that you have to routinely spend more money in order to buy more film but my little sister loves it and that is good enough for me! Her bulletin board is full of pictures she has taken in the few weeks of owning it.","My 9 year old loves her new camera...she takes it everywhere she thinks she'll have some good photo ops!  Photos are cute size...small..but perfect for her at this age! Surprisingly good quality photos too if you make sure to change the lighting indicator as instructed.  Love it!","OBSESSION!!! I brought this all over Italy and it took the cutest pictures ever. My friends are all jealous!!! People at the Colosseum wanted if they could have a picture! The film is cheap, it's easy to use. It's lightweight. I absolutely adore this camera. YES YES YES!","We loved this camera, it was the hit of the party! Ordered another for a Christmas present for someone on my list!","CuteCamera great for making memories and displaying it In my room!","It's cute, we get compliments on it all the time. Most people don't know something like this still exists and most call it a Polaroid.<br /><br />The pics are smaller than old Polaroid but the camera is also smaller and easier to take around with you. It's fun to give friends a souvenir to take home.<br /><br />Only complaint is its hard to get the exposure right. It gives you suggested exposure but getting things wrong at $0.80 a pop kind of sucks. Oh wells, it's part of the process I suppose.","Cute, light weight, has 3 different shooting options. Comes with a cute yellow polka dot strap. Takes good pictures, doesn't have a zoom so if your far away you'll be smaller... But I bought for close up pictures, the subject is in focus and very easy to see. A fun little camera","This product is good but I have couple concerns about this camera (I don't know if it is due to my poor photographing skills or the product itself.)<br />1) the film always come out empty, or white?<br />2)it's somehow out of focus, even when I'm aiming right in the circle and it's super blurry when the film comes out even when I adjusted to the right mode<br />3) I have to press the button really hard to get a film ( don't know why)<br />I have attached some pictures as a proof.<br />Don't know if  I should return this product and purchase a new one? This is a great product, I love it but I'd also like to get it fixed before it gets worse.","purchase it for my 15 year old and it takes good pictures she loves it","It works just as expected. It's so cute and it's a great size for carrying around with me throughout the day.","super fun to use.  pictures are great compared with other instant cameras!","In love with my camara","I love it! it's so cute and I love the color.","LOVE this camera. It takes great clear quality pictures. Will be taking it on my Christmas vacation.","I love it","My daughter was super happy to receive this for her birthday.  It works very well.","Great Product!","Daughter loves it.","great for a gift! and inexpensive for what it can do!!

It's so much fun. Thank you for fast shipping and a great product","Love it","I couldn't be more happy with the Instax camera, it's my new, favorite obsession. It's extremely easy and fun to use. It's well worth the money!","thank you, good packaging and no problems with the camera","It was a gift and she loves it","I am so happy I purchased this camera, the item arrived quickly & promptly. It is definitely worth it! I am so happy to capture memories in this form. I plan to make a scrap book soon! The camera is light weight and certainly met up to my expectations.","Bought for my teenager. She's very happy with it.","I've wanted this camera for so long until I finally just ordered it on a wimb and I can't be happier! Film for it can get pretty expensive but it's totally worth it and I love how the pictures turn out.","Cute as can be to be the first camera for my 9 year old granddaughter.<br />Easy to use and can see the picture right away.","Just how I wanted it! Thanks so much!","I love it!!!!!! It's very cute and the pictures are very very very clear!!!!","my daughter is addicted.thanks!","I love this camera. It's really fun and exactly what I expected. I gave it 4 stars because I realized I will not be able to use this camera as much as I would probably like to because the film (to me) is a little on the pricey side. When I do buy it I will definitely buy from Amazon though because you get a better deal over anywhere else I've seen; however, figure about a dollar a picture. It's still definitely worth to buy.","I absolutely love this piece of amazingness. I was planning to buy it for years and now that I've finally got it I couldn't be more  satisfied.","I got this Instax Camera as a gift!  I had been looking at it for a long time, and I really love everything about it.  It is compact and adorable.  Its a great way to share memories with your friends and family, along with displaying your photography!","I just got this Instax and it's wonderful. I love the vibrant color. The pictures it takes are quite clear so I have zero complaints.","i thought the camera itself would be heavy! its really lightweight and the wrist strap holds really well. im super happy with it! i think its worth the price! photo quality is great too!","My daughter loves the camera.  The initial camera we purchased stopped working without cause.  We were sent a new one expediently.  I highly recommend the square trade warranty.  They were easy to work with and there was no hassle.","Awesome camera! Great quality!","smaller in your hand than i thought, which is great! can't wait to really use it. its adorable!","Delighted with camera, birthday present for my Grandaughter.","Perfection","My daughter LOVES this camera but is unhappy with the color choice she selected (white).  She would recommend a darker color that would hide scuffs and dirt better!!","Amazing camera, would recommend","I received mine today, and it's so cute! it comes with the little strap and batteries as well, it works perfect fine, I'm in love!!!","I love my instax mini!! this type of film is the best!!! the color is more pink than vintage pink but i still love it!! great product just wish the film wasn't so expensive but would definitely buy this again.","I'm so happy with my purchase! The camera came in perfect condition and the box didn't look old or opened like some other people had said on their reviews. It also came arrived a lot quicker than what the estimated delivery date suggested. If you're thinking about getting an instant camera I would definitely recommend the instax mini 8.","Haven't tried it out as of yet but it sure is cute ! Can't wait ! Comes with batteries as well","produces surprisingly good quality photos. pics are small...very small.","Received it sooner than expected! Super excited to start using it. I'm satisfied with my transaction. Thank you so much! :)","I totally love my fujifilm camera <3","film runs quick and is pricey.. love the camera but film runs too quickly..","Purchased for my daughter (11yr old). She and her friends love it. Easy to use. The additional types of specialty film and stickers make tons of fun for the girls taking pictures of themselves.","loved it!","So cool! Very easy to use. I can't wait to use this for guests at my sisters birthday.","great camera, works perfectly. going to use for my wedding guest book! easy to use.","Love it!","No issues  works as expected","Great products","We purchased this camera for our baby shower to have guests take pictures, paste them into a memory book, and write a message.  For our wedding, we used an instant printer and the quality was just not great so we were diappointed.  With the Instax camera, the quality is excellent and the film is reasonable if purchased in 50 packs.  The time between shots is less than 15 seconds, so our event planners were able to go around and take pictures of all our guests at the party.<br />The only downside was that when pictures were taken in extreme sunlight, the quality looked somewhat washed out.  The built-in flash did better than expected and indoor photos looked perfect.","The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant camera is an awesome way to have some vintage photography fun in a world that seems to have gone completely digital! This camera instantly prints out pictures (about the size of a credit card) using film and runs on two AA batteries as its power source. There is also a built in flash and multiple settings to ensure you get the perfect shot each time. You will not find a more reasonably priced \"polaroid\"camera today!<br /><br />The Good: Excellent price, Easy setup, LOTS of vintage fun!<br /><br />The Bad: The suggested light setting indicator can sometimes be inaccurate, leading to washed out pictures (you'll figure out which setting works best with practice, so don't rely too much on the suggestions). Also, although the film is relatively cheap, it is still expensive at almost 50 cents a picture.","Just received this for my 8 year old and she loves it! Although, the front plastic lense cover fell off. Now pics have a purple spot on them d/t flash. I'm wondering if I can order this pieces or if I need to return it?","fun polaroid camera. outdoor pictures not as colorful and cute as indoor, but perfect for taking indoor pictures of people!","Love this camera. The downside about this camera is that you can't take it in very bright light. For example, at the beach with the sun shining on top of you. You will get a white image cause its so bright outside. Overall, its a must camera.","My granddaughter's Christmas gift, so can't tell how it works, if it works, etc.  It is just what she asked for and I am hoping she will love it.","A good, fast camera.  Wish that the pictures were a little larger like the old Poleroids but can put them through a machine probably and enlarge them.  Good when you  need an instant moment in time.","the camera was perfect and the delivery was right on time. AMAZING!","I got this camera for my daughter a few weeks ago. It works perfectly, except for the fact that when we take a photo inside, it turns out all black except for a few faint visible spots. Either it's a manufacturer defect, or our house is a terrible place to take pictures. It's still works great outside, and very portable and perfect to take on trips. We got the colored film and lenses with it, and they fit perfectly.","LOVE! Easy to work, easy to figure out. Prints the cutest pictures. Bought it for my 9 year old and she is a pro already.","Awesome Gift for my fiance pictures come out amazing, great buy.","I got the yellow one, and i love it. Use it a lot!","It was purchased for a 12 year old granddaughter. She loves it. Finds it easy to use. Loves the color. Really nice photos too.","The camera is easy to use with different themes to pick from.","I bought this as a gift for my husband's teenage cousin. She's in love with it.","it was for my Granddaughter. She loved her camera and it arrived  within a day. It was great as she needed it for an event and it came in time.","I love this camera! it takes great pictures and comes in the original box with instructions and everything! I got expedited shipping, and it came amazingly fast! I assure you, getting better shipping is worth it all! completely recomend to anyone looking for a great product!","A+","Great little camera!","I LOVE this camera. It's cute and I love the instant pictures! Works and looks great.","excellent camera. Takes great photos. My daughter loves it. The pictures are a great size for collages or just carrying in your wallet","love love love love!!!! so cute and great, thanks!","I like it, it's fun!","LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! Its more red when it comes tho","Exactly what was promised. Couldn't be happier with the product. Made the perfect present and me and my partner love taking pictures","Camera was exactly as described.  Purchased as a gift for my granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.","Super excited, it is exactly what I want.","This little camera is so much fun. I used it to take pictures of my grandkids when I went on vacation to see them and then created memory books for all five of them that they could keep after we left. They love their memory books so much and look at them every day. The only problem I had was the pictures taken outside and bright light didn't turn out but the pictures taken inside were fabulous. It's a little pricey picture cost about a buck apiece but it was worth it in the end and I'm glad I bought it.","Birthday gift for a 12 year old girl and she was so happy. Suggest buying more than a 5 pack of instant film....you will need it if you're 12.","I love!!","Prints high-quality, vintage-style pictures in a flash! Way better than the original. I could not be more pleased? with my Instax Mini 8!","Amazing little camare i love it for the first  time :)","Bought this for my son's 3rd birthday party, as part of a photo booth - the kids and adults loved it! Took a bit to get used to how it worked but was fairly easy to figure out. Kids were even using it, and loved that the pictures came out \"right away\".<br /><br />The white is very modern looking, and the film was easy to figure out and load - overall this was a good purchase, and a fun one too!","FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS ONE BOMB FREAKIN CAMERA. SO IT ARRIVES IN THE MAIL, MINE CAME A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE IT SHOULDVE IGHT ? I WAS LIKE 'DANG THIS IS SOME FREAKY FAST DELVERY, JIMMY JOHNS SHOULD BE JEALOUS'<br />SO I OPENED THE BOX OK AND IT COMES IN THIS CUTE LIL BOX AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE IN JAPANESE, FRENCH, AND SPANISH MAYBE I THINK SO UNLESS YOU BILINGUAL OR SOME S**T I RECOMMEND YOU LOOK UP ONE OF THEM NICE YOUTUBE TUTORIALS OKAY. ITS NOT AN ENGLISH COMPANY SO FREAKIN DEAL WITH IT AND MOVE THE HECK ON<br />HOWEVER MY MAN IT COMES WITH BATTERIES SO U ALL GOOD BUT I DONT KNOW HOW LONG THEY LAST SO GOOD LUCK BRO<br />AND BTW, THEY ARE NOT FRICKIN CHICKEN LYING WHEN THEY SAY MINI IGHT SO THE PICTURES (films not included dawg) IS LIKE CREDIT CARD SIZE SO DONT WRITE ONE OF THEM ANGRY REVIEWS LIKE 'WELL THEY ARENT ADEQUATE TO MY NEEDS WHY ARE THEY SO SMALL' WELL HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU DAWG BUT MAYBE THE WORD MINI ACTUALLY MEANS MINI OK SO STOP YOUR WHINING AND SUCK IT UP<br />THIS CAMERA IS GOOD. BUY IT.","This is a very cool color. I love it and it is compact and takes great pictures.","We love this camara. We use it for parties to give photos to friends as they leave. The film is expensive and or hard to find if you forgot to order online. Only one little specialty shop carries the film. So we just stock up.... ;)","The product is so cute and everything is perfect as it described. Thank you so much","Purchased for our wedding and it was great.","Happy with the camera. Takes great little pocket sized Polaroids. Was fun to pass around at a party","I love this camera quite low price. Tip. I need to put the setting for the light one setting higher than the real light other wise my pics are over exposed. (example I put on full sun when have slightly overcast)","I love it??","so fun!","Worked great for a wedding. When signed the guest book we took a picture to go with it.","As soon as I received the camera I opened it right away and noticed a scratch on the inside of the lens. The pictures still come out good but it bugs me knowing it's there.","Good","Everything was perfect!","Super neat!","Very good","My new husband was very impressed with this camera. We purchased it for out guest to take pictures. It was a big success.","It looks great! Brand new, photos look amazing, they develop within seconds of taking the picture! I can't wait to use it more :)","It's so cute, and I love that it doesn't have to be charged or anything like that... all it needs is film. I got this adorable camera and decorative camera sticker to go on it, and I'm always taking pictures with it. I'm super happy with this purchase.","Awesome little camera! Love it.","It takes very nice and good quality pictures, but it sometimes breaks down on me and I end up wasting about 4 films.","No it does not come with a selfie mirror but its still a really cute unique color!! I haven't seen anyone with the same color and i love it!","I am very happy with this camera! The product arrived quickly, in complete packaging including directions in many languages. The included strap is woven yellow fabric. The camera works perfectly, taking small photos with a limited range flash. It is ideal for candid shots of friends at a party, or still life photos. It takes practice to use the flash well, but every photo has charm.","i like it!","Cute but disappointing.  The size of the pictures in half what the old Polaroid cameras used to produce.  Very small.  Reasonable quality pictures and good light sensor to make setting up for pictures fast and easy.  Just really disappointed in the size.  Expensive film.  More then 50¢ a picture.","AWESOME","I looove it ","My family's over the moon when I purchase this camera ON MY OWN. They didn't know that I have enough gift card to buy it. My family love polaroid, but in Indonesia, this camera cost us arms and legs. We basically couldn't afford it. So yeah, I love it. The camera came out new, no problem at all, as I expected. Work perfectly well and trust me, I will not lie. So yeah, if you're planning to buy this camera, just buy it already. It's worth it.","good item","Good!","Love it. I bought this to document the planning of my vintage wedding. I can't wait to use with my bridesmaids. Works great so far!","Great!  A fun camera with quirky retro pictures.  :-)","Thank you","This camera was everything my daughter wanted","It's great!!","DA best","I really do love this camera. We used it for our wedding as our guestbook. Worked perfectly! The downside is that if you try to use it in the sun (or on a super sunny day) the pics come out totally white. At least for me they did, even when you cover the flash or adjust the lighting setting. Still a great camera and love using it even now!","I can not say enough how much I love this camera! Obviously be careful with it and it will last. Takes wonderful photos, great for every occasion. My younger sister was so fascinated by the concept she now wants her own.","Absolutely perfect!","Just received this product today and I have to say I am so satisfied with this product. It is so simple to use, just pop in the film (film is not included but batteries are) turn it on, set dial to the lighted setting and snap a photo (flash is always on).  The pictures come out very nice and take about 10 minutes to fully develop. The camera came with a strap (polka dot one which I am not fond of) and directions with pictures only which was a little confusing. Overall it's great and so fun.","THANK YOU","Really like the camera and how easy it is to use","Nice mini pictures.","Worked perfectly for our wedding guest book!","This is the single best investment I've ever made in my life. The camera and film are well worth the money!! I have a cousin who is a professional AP photographer, and he's obsessed with his Fujifilm Instax too.<br /><br />I never leave home without it. I take it to bars, baseball games, vacation. Everyone laughs when they first see it, and then will not stop using it; I have to pry it away from people. It's a great conversation piece, and a great way to make friends and meet people, especially if you're an introvert like me. Heads up: Polaroids are also a great way to get free drinks from bartenders!<br /><br />Amazon is the cheapest place I've found for anything from Fujifilm. I know this is a bad comparison, but Urban Outfitters is selling this same camera for $100 minus tax and shipping. I didn't even check to see how much they're charging for film.","There's a bit of cognitive adjustment for someone used to using a digital camera, but once you get over that, this camera is very easy to use and very fun. Be sure to pay attention to the light dial suggesting which exposure to use-- with the ten sheets film pack, a few mistakes will burn through your whole roll pretty quick, so it's important to use the right exposure.","color is adorbs! works well even after dropping in a low surf at beach!","Love! Film is expensive though.","My kids absolutely adore these cameras!! The are so easy to use and they take super cute photos. This yellow one has amazing color that does not fade. Love this!","My daughter loved it!","My bestfriend got one and I wanted one so bad I love it thanks!!!","White gets a little grimy at time but I've had it for about 10 months and it works wonderfully. Easy to use and carry around!","Bought this for my daughter. Awesome, fun camera.. is a total hit at get-togethers. She's excited to shoot photos and then give them to her friends right on the spot. Most kids (9-12 year olds) have never even seen a Polaroid-style instant camera before. It's like magic!<br /><br />Drawback - Film packs (10 shots) are like $10 a pack... which is around a dollar a shot.<br /><br />Benefit from the drawback - If you're an artist like me, and understand how important it is to frame a shot right, and have your camera settings squared away, this is an incredible tool for budding photographers like my daughter. It forces her to not have the \"shoot 100 shots until you get it right\" mindset, and helps her develop a style, and proper framing. A great educational tool. At $1 a shot (she pays for film) she works hard to get it just right.","Absolutely love mine. The pictures are so fun. My kids have so much fun snaking fun photos with this camera. Really easy to use. Very user friendly","This little camera is so much fun and my daughter has absolutely loved using it. It takes decent pictures, is quick, and easy to operate. Lots of fun to have with this!","My mom bought this for me for my birthday and I love it! It takes great pictures and it is basically the talk of a party. Film is kind of expensive but it is reasonable. Love it!","I love this camera! For the price, its great! However, if you are looking for a camera with more features, you should probably research the more expensive ones. I like the size and weight of this camera, its substantial while still easy to carry around in your bag without being too heavy or take up too much space. So far Ive only taken two photos with it, and I am still playing around with the different light settings, but I already know i'll be taking this everywhere with me!","The lighting might be tough to dial in. I've had a few that were too dark and one that was too light, but it's a super fun little camera.","Super fun! Take it every where!","Cute....no selfie mirror though","Excelente!","such a great, fun camera.  I love the the pics it produces.  Such a great camera to bring to a party and hand out the pics","The color of the camera was a bit darker then the picture but I love it! Still trying to figure out which settings work best in the lighting. Love having pictures instantly!","i loved the camera, its great thank you","As advertised.  Great camera, arrived on time.","It's awesome","Really cute camera.","I gave this polaroid camera to my girlfriend for our anniversary. Pink's her favorite color so I figured she'll love it. And she did! Now e have tons of photos posted on our bedroom wall.","This is the best camera I have ever had. So easy to use, I love the instant pictures. Fun to share with friends. Love it.","Nice!!!","Love the little pics my daughter takes with this camera.  Great buy!","Novelty camera, photos are small and washed out. Don,t waste your money","Love the camera! Looks and works great!","I'll start off by saying I have a big selection of \"good\" cameras (ranging from mirrorless to DSLRs) but there's something neat about an instant film camera. Being able to take pictures and have no clue if they'll turn out (and each one costing you money) is a bit scary to jump into, and there will definitely be shots you don't like.. but that randomness is one of the more enjoyable parts to it.<br /><br />I originally purchased the Mini 8 camera and the 210 \"Wide\" camera. I immediately loved the Mini8, but the 210 Wide seemed much less user friendly (huge, lots of settings that aren't very clear, different focus distances to set), but I bought it for the \"wide\" prints (as big as 2 Mini prints).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the 210 Wide camera just gave terrible results. Some parts overexposed, some underexposed, while the same shots with the Mini8 were beautiful. The 210 also required a bit more (twice the batteries, larger film, a \"closeup\" adapter (that arrived broken). In the end, I sent the 210 back and kept the Mini 8.<br /><br />The Mini 8 is actually a nice size. It's a bit bulky, but nothing too bad at all. It's very easy to use (open the lens, it will tell you which setting to pick (a LED will light up), select it and press the shutter button. There are \"settings\" for indoors, outdoors, High-Key, etc..  and with the light up LED it's very easy to tell which you need to use.<br /><br />The viewfinder is relatively close to the lens, giving a \"pretty accurate\" representation of what the shot will look like. The viewfinder on the 210 was a bit too far from the lens and always gave me odd framing.<br /><br />The Mini8 uses the Instax Mini prints -- they come in packs of 10 (usually in 2-packs -- 20 shots). The camera will hold 10 at a time, so one thing to keep in mind with the size is that unless you want only 10 shots per outing, you'll need to bring extra packs and that's where the cost (and extra bulk) come from.<br /><br />I like the way the prints look. They're definitely a vintage/washed out/overexposed look most of the time, but it's neat to have! I would say it would be fine for kids to use, except they may be a little trigger-happy with the shutter button (and 10 shots = about 10 bucks).<br /><br />Overall, I really like it. I wasn't expecting to (I was expecting more from the 210 wide instax to be honest) but it impressed me so much, I ordered 8 extra boxed of film for it.","I bought mine from BestBuy when they were on sale. I have always wanted one and finally!<br />It was for my wedding welcome table. I love it and I bring it with me everywhere:) It is really easy to use and the film is easy to install too. You can get different cute design for your film on amazon too.<br />I really don't have anything negative to say about this camera, only couple things to keep in mind,<br />1. The film is expensive;) I went through 2 pack during a 2 days trip.<br />2. I saw a lot of people complain about the quality of their pics.....this is a instant camera, just saying.....Read the user's manual first, there are some good tips there.<br />3. Oh and be care not putting your finger in front of the lens, you won't see it through that little whole....but it will be in your pics. (make sense? I am really bad at explaining things...)<br /><br />Other than that, Enjoy it:)","This camera right out of the box was amazing! Ease of use gets an A++ and quality as well. The photos come out looking great.<br /><br />As for light control, there's a dial on the lens that allows you to adjust the shutter speed to current light, \"Indoors, Cloudy, Partly Cloudy, Sunny, Hi Key\".<br /><br />Although not your larger, \"classic\", size photo,  this is quite the camera for capturing memories in a way that doesn't just pass you by like our thousands of photos on our phones.. I highly recommend this product to people looking to capture special events. Used it for our first child's Baby Shower and everyone was able to take a photo home for the memory. Very nice experience for all!","Love my camera  just what I expected","My daughter loved it!! So happy with it","I bought this camera as a birthday gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it! In the digital age where everything is online she was so excited to have instant \"old school\" pictures.","Absolutely LOVE this thing. It's so cute and compact and easy to use. I've already gone through most of the film I've bought. I'm going to use this for a guest book at my wedding, so people can include a picture in there \"words of advice\".","loevende loeven this camera. I love being able to have instant photos just to capture moments in my everyday life. This camera is awesome but the only downside is it does not come with the film and the film can get very expensive. Also be sure to purchase a case for this product it can get scuffed easily.","Takes a bit of trial and error adjusting the setting, and maybe a few film sacrifices. Other than that great camera.","Gave this camera to my 12 year old granddaughter and she has loved it! Is putting together picture albums and going thru film like crazy. This is what she picked out for her birthday and she has enjoyed it ever since.<br />Great little product here.","Wow! I bought this camera for my daughter's 11th birthday.  She already has a digital camera, and a phone.  But this \"new\" technology of instant camera prints blew her mind.  She declared it the most awesome gift she's ever received.  I never had a polaroid growing up, and I was thrilled with how easy it is to use, how lightweight and intuitive the camera is, and how cool the photos turn out.  My daughter likes the \"retro\" look of the prints.  I am very happy with this purchase.","Gave 4 stars because I think the camera is awesome, but the color is not Raspberry it's more like a dull coral.  My daughter wanted a bright pink color and saw this and was like no I don't want that color.  So just know that the color is not a bright pink before you buy it, the color on the box is Raspberry but the camera is not.  I returned and am going with a different color","Bought for 17 year old daughter birthday. She loves it. Picture quality is great.","I absolutely love this camera! The reason why I gave it four stars is because it broke a month after I purchased it. I would have to take a picture several times for the camera to actually push the film out. Amazon sent me a new camera, but I wasted so much film due to this.","great camera, makes a great gift.","My daughter loves it!!!","Great camera!","Fun, small camera and takes good pictures.","Amazing camera! Super easy to use love it:) came in great condition","Super cute and fits in regular sized bags which is convienet. Buy extra film cause you're going to want to use this everywhere.","Love this lightweight instant camera. The photos of the camera make the prints seem a little small but they are really the perfect size and the camera is incredibly easy to use. It is turned on by pressing a button near the lens and turned off by pushing the lens itself inward. I will admit that this made me a little wary at first because it makes it seem cheap but I have had no problems with it and have gotten great photos with each shot!","tHE CAMERA LOOKS GREAT BUT MY GRANDAUGHTER HAS NOT USED IT YET.  I THOUGHT FILM FOR THE CAMERA WAS IN THE \"BUNDLE\" & SHE NEVER SAW IT.  AM I MISTAKEN/?<br /><br />BARBARA K MC CORMICK","Took a minute to get used to......love the old school!","AWESOME CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!! GLAD I PURCHASED IT.  PICTURES ARE GREAT.","I just got this in the mail. The camera looks nice, and is surprising very light. The set up was very easy and came with picture instructions. It also came with the polka dot wrist strap. I took a few pictures with it and they came out very clear. I will have so much fun with this camera. I'm planning on using it at my wedding instead of renting a photo booth. My only negative with this camera is that the capture button is in an awkward spot on the front of the camera, so I can see how it would be easy to accidentally take pictures. This did not come with film, so I purchased separately. You can buy it in packs of 50 photos for about $37. I still think the film is kind of pricy, but it will be a really cool keepsake for my wedding. The black camera looks very sleek.","I was interested in purchasing an instant camera for fun and test my hand with new photography methods. I had planned on purchasing and old Polaroid, but the film for the cameras is around 3$. This Instax film camera came in at a much lower price point than any other camera on the market.<br /><br />Shape:<br />The camera is very oddly shaped. It looks like molten plastic was mashed together, but it handles very well. The grip is easily positioned with a shutter button right where your finger sets. Manipulating the camera the first time is a little awkward and it must be explained to anyone that has not taken a photo with a Mini before. The camera turn on with a push button right next to the lens and also included a wrist strap out of rough lanyard string. Although it looks plastic-y the camera holds up very well in a backpack and can handle its share of bumps. the white does pick up marks.<br /><br />Quality:<br />When a photo comes out well, it looks great. Well, its not a perfect \"digital\" photo, but has the exact aesthetic that you would expect from this camera. A couple of my photos do come out over exposed and never develop a photo due to letting in too much light. There is a flash for taking photos indoors and this works nicely giving every indoor picture a \"fun\" look. Tip: the lens spins offering various degrees of exposure. Be sure to set this to where the orange indicator light shows or photos will not be visible.<br /><br />Film:<br />The film for this camera is much cheaper than any Polaroid film, and it comes in around 80 cents per photo Fujifilm Instax Mini Twin Pack Instant Film This price point doesn't make it practical for everyday use, but it is low enough that most people can use it for special occasions (parties, vacations) and not worry about breaking the bank.<br /><br />Other:<br />The photos from this camera are about the size of a credit card and fit great in my wallet. They are however noticeably smaller than those from a Polaroid. Fujifilm makes another camera, the Instax 300 Fujifilm Instax Wide 300 Instant Film Camera (Black), that uses wide film about double the size of the \"mini\" prints.<br />There are also a variety of film options that have colored or patterned borders. These are usually priced a little higher.<br />Fujifilm makes branded accessories for the camera such as lens filters that change the image's hue.","so i have this camera and i am totally OBSESSED with it!!<br />there are a few problems that i have encountered but they are mostly my fault so Im just gonna say them to help others out with these problems!<br />1. MY POLAROIDS ARE COMING OUT WHITE!! - this is because you took a picture in the sun without changing the setting. unfortunately for me, i didn't realize that the light by the setting DOES NOT mean you're on the setting! it just is a recommended setting. when i was inside, i was fine. but as soon as i went outside, all my pictures were white! it took a few wasted polaroids to figure that one out...<br />2. FILM IS SO S O EXPENSIVE!! - this is a incurable dilemma. the film is like $20-30 for a pack of 20 films. my only recommendation is to look on amazon and  buy the film in bulk (60 films for $40) or something along those lines. if you do the math, the price will come out to be cheaper in the long run.<br />3. MY INK FROM MY FILM IS LEAKING! - this has never happened to me, but a bunch of people and told me to watch out for this. if you press on the back of the film, in the little ink pocket - the ink will leak!! whether its out of the film entirely, or onto the picture, it can leak!  so beware of that!<br /><br />i forgot my other concerns and questions, so if you have any, feel free to ask!!!","Awesome camera! Very fun and easy to use. Film is expensive, but what isn't these days?","My 15 year old loves this camera. The film is very expensive, but it is a very fun camera she uses with her friends.","I am very happy with the product. It serve its purpose quite well: I use it at home for guests, since it is not something very handy to carry around in trips. :-)","This is so simple and easy to use","Just got this for my birthday and I love it. The instructions are very easy to follow and the pictures come out great. My only advice is to make sure that you take pictures closer than you normally would because the pictures are small. I would recommend buying.","I'm in love I just got my Insta mini8 in today early then said to be . good thing just in time for camping I tested it out I have to say looks great  I'm amazed reading some reviews had me skeptic but I'm happy with my choice although the film a little pricey it's worth it !","Very good","My sister and I used to love having photo shoots as kids with a Polaroid camera. I bought this on a whim after feeling a bit nostalgic for my younger days. I'm very pleased with the camera. It takes really cool photos. I've been having fun snapping pictures of my new baby boy.<br /><br /> I highly recommend it.","i dont yet have one of these but i am asking for one for my birthday... three of my close friends have them and i love the pictures! They turn out really clear and vintage-like, they are so cool! It is aso really nice to have the pictures print out right away, it usually takes a few minutes to totally show up.  The frames even come in cute colors and patterns, but i prefer white because it gives it a more sophisticated look.  Unless you are a big fan of pink, I wouldnt recommend buying this camera in that color... it looks different than it does online and gets dirty fast.  also be careful not to expose new, unused film to light, because it will ruin the film and when you try to take pictures with it it wont show up.  Overall this product is durable, inexpensive, fun, and definitely worth it!","Love this camera. The price is really good compared to the same exact model at Best Buy.","Works great. Have gone through 4 packs of film and it takes great pictures for the camera.  It's not an expensive high tech piece, so I wasn't expected masterful pics.  The prints come out looking a little \"antiqued\", but I like that for this type of film. The camera is plastic and feels fake, but again, it's not an expensive high tech piece.  My two year old even took a picture with it \"accidentally\" and no issues.","Great camera. My daughter loves it!","I really like this. It's very cute and super portable. The camera comes equipped with different shooting modes depending on what the lighting is, and the indicator light will tell you which mode it believes you should be in. This is just a plain point and shoot. There are no fancy settings to let you zoom or anything, you pretty much get what you get with this. It comes with an arm strap which is actually very handy and convenient. However, the film is super pricey. Additionally, I wouldn't change out of the original setting when shooting because everytime I put it on the setting it suggests the picture comes out awful. It's very tricky to figure out how to take a picture only because the circle of focus, isn't what the camera focuses on once you take the picture, so honestly it's a guessing game when taking a picture up close. Pictures taking at a distance are a lot easier to take. Also, if you get too close to a subject, and I mean within like 1.5 feet, the whole picture basically comes out white because the flash is so intense. Also, if you are outside and it is super sunny and you put the mode on the sun, the picture just comes out with a white glow on it, if it is cloudy and the camera suggests you use the cloudy setting, the picture comes out a black hazy blob.<br /><br />However, once you work out the kinks and get to know the camera I think it's very neat and I prefer to use it over my 6plus","Awesome!!!","My grandaughter absolutely loved this camera.  It was a hit with her friends, as well.  The parents & kids at her party asked me where I purchased it. It is so EASY TO USE. Getting instant pictures, is so exciting as it pops out & watch as it develops before your eyes!","I just love the camera the pictures that come are excellent","works great","Great camera just that occasionally my pictures do not fully or don't develop","its an awesome camera","Picture quality is not great but it keeps my daughter happy.","Product arrived a day earlier than expected, which was a nice surprise. It was poorly packaged, and I honestly would have expected there would be damage, but luckily there wasn't... The actual camera is pretty awesome and I started using it immediately to check how well it worked. Don't know why people were complaining about the quality of the photos it produces, because mine works great. Obviously it won't be super hi-def quality, but it gives you Polaroid quality that gives it that cool vintage look/feel. I love it! Will be buying lot of film in the near future. :)","the package was good it was all amazing","Love love love this!!! Nice price, great product, easy to use.","Excelent","Really easy to use, light weight, and it helps you adjust the exposure which is great. Only downside is you use film up quickly so it's a good idea to stock up good thing the film is relatively cheap. Overall happy with my purchase","I absolutely LOVE this camera and the company shipped extremely fast.","It works so well, I love this.","Love it so much!","Love the color, and this camera is a lot of fun for my friends and me.","This was given to my daughter as a Christmas gift and she likes it very much.","camera is beautiful BUT one setting (the house one) only draws out plain white pictures so just put it on another setting.","Gift, child is happy.","My granddaughter loves it.","Best thing I've bought in a while! I love thus camera!","Prints pictures very well, but can be hard to manage. Otherwise a very lovely, easy-to-manage camera! Gives off good vintage vibes and instantly gives you a nice bit of pretensious hipster flare.","going to use this for a guest book for my grandmothers 90th birthday. got it today and tried it out... took everything for me to not use all the film :)","Such an awesome camera love it","i love it! perfect size and everything! and the film doesnt cost too much either. i chose the free standard shipping and it took like a week and a few days to come but other than that it is great!","Great camera works well","So cute & fun! We're having a blast capturing memories with this awesome camera!","Camera came in excellent condition. I got a film bundle with the camera, and shot pictures fine. Great camera all around for any occasion. The one thing I wish though is there to have a flash button to turn the flash off, but other then that it is awesome!","Super cute and easy to carry around everywhere with me!","This was one of my best decisions i have ever made. its so cute and the cheepest price on the market. works great and super duper cute! i think everyone should get one. quality is great and a nice fit in the hand. High remarks about this.","Quite easy to use and was a present....","It was fun to be able to actually see the photos and pass them around for a laugh or too.  to compare the dress up of the kids immediately was loads of fun.","My daughter loves the product. Customer Service and product expectations where met. Love it.","Had some glitches with the ejector for the film but it is overall a really good camera for the price.","Thanks","So great, purchased this for a 10th birthday. It was a huge hit !","great product","I really liked the camara","So happy with it. It's perfect","It works for what I ordered it for perfectly. I am a real estate investor and I need pictures that I can put on paper with tape and then fax and they are just the right material, not too thick for a fax machine. Not so big they take up too much room. Besides all that it is fun to take pictures and see them instantly. perfect for what I needed.","Picture shows includes film yet received product and no film. Please advise!","Awesome!","Great camera in good lighting, not so good at night. Over all not bad for the price.","Great","4 stars only because i purchased mine through warehouse deals and did not come with batteries and the string was missing that's suppose to attach to cam. i guess thats expected when getting it cheaper. but other than that it works great and pictures come out vintage and credit card size which makes them adorable:) buy it you wont be dissapointed;)","Got this as a present for a friend! She said the pictures may come out dark in too much sunlight","I purchased this item for my 13 year old granddaughter.  She likes it, but has not used it enough to offer meaningful feedback.<br />Delivery was prompt.  I was surprised it was delivered on Sunday.","When u take picture with this camera make sure u have the right setting because if u don't ur photo doesn't develop as good. This camera is a perfect size to bring in trips or when u r hanging out with ur friends! If u purchase this camera u r sooo lucky and the camera is super fun to use!","Great fun for my wife","Love this camera, makes cute business card size pictures.","good","Perfect","BESTTTTTT Love it!!!","My daughter was happy.","Adorable camera!  came with a cute yellow and white polka dot strap.","It came on time & my daughter loves it :)","dank","price is very competitive","Really like this camera. I'm not big into taking pictures (with a real camera or with a phone) but I like the novelty of the tiny pictures this prints out. I took it on a recent trip and loved the moments I was able to capture.  I'm giving it 4 stars because the film cartridges are pricey!","We setup a photo \"booth\" at the company picnic and took instant photos to give the guests. It was a huge success!  The light meter helped determine the best setting for a well-lit outdoor photo. Guests enjoyed watching their photo develop too!  We took over 60 photos in a matter of hours and everyone was delighted with the results. Using the Instax Mini 8 camera instead of a digital camera ended up being a fantastic idea.<br /><br />The flash is bright. Really bright!  To help diffuse the flash I covered it with a piece of clear contact paper.  It helps when taking close-up portraits. I also dialed down the aperture setting when the subjects wore white and light colors to keep them from being overexposed.  The photo booth portraits came out great!<br /><br />The camera works great.  Film packs are easy to load and the picture counter is large and easy to read.  The lens takes a wider angle picture than you see through the view finder, so take that into consideration when you're framing your subjects.  I wear eyeglasses and found the viewfinder to be a bit small.  A larger viewfinder would improve the photographer's experience.","my granddaughter (13) loves it","My daughter loves it. She can share her pictures instantly with her friends.","I was nervous to buy this for my friend for her birthday... but I made the right decision. She loves it. There is just something so rewarding about getting a picture instantly! It's easy to use, detects which setting you should be on automatically, is super light weight, and prints out the cutest business size pictures with great quality. Love it.","ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I'VE MADE YET","I love it!! thank you so so much! it works just perfectly","i love it","This camera is an absolute necessity for everyone. This is the third one I've bought! I gift them to people because they are simply a fun and easy way to make and share memories. Pro tip: buy the 6 pack of film because it ends up being the cheapest per box.","Wonderful camera!  Got it for my 10-year-old daughter for her birthday and it's her favorite gift!  Love it!","Awesome","Used this for a wedding guest book alternative and the guests loved it!","Loved it!","The camera works wonderful and it was the best deal I found!","Love this camera. The instant gratification of your pictures being printed instantly is fantastic","Doesn't take good pictures when it's sunny outside, kinda a waste of a money in my opinion","Camera came/delivered two days after I ordered it (the day between ordering and delivery was a Sunday too!) in great condition. Instructions came in English and several other languages, along with helpful pictures to show how to operate the camera without much reading required.","I bought this for my 17 year old for her birthday. She loves it! It's retro, but easy to use. The Fugifilm Instax Accessory Bundle Set is a 'Must Have'! It's also easy to get film for.","Takes great pics","Easy to use, instant gratification and lots of fun for teens who want more than posting pics.","absolutely love my Polaroid! easy to use and small enough to carry around! although the Polaroid can easily get scuff marks on. the best way to use the Polaroid is by watching a video on how to use so every picture will come out great!","great camera","Love love love! Can't stop taking pictures!!","SOOOOO CUTE and so much fun.","This camera is so fun, cute and reliable. My daughter has made a scrapbook of all her moments in time since she got this camera. She is 13 and loves it.","Daughter loves it.","Gave this a bday gift and daughter loves it. A bit pricey having to constantly purchase film but it's to be expected. Nice shade of blue and works exactly as it should.","My daughter love it,and I do also we took it to a trip and it's so cool to experience instant pic without been able to edit or repeat it 100 times.LOL","This camera is so cute and so good!","Granddaughter is thrilled, camera works great!","I have not had the time to try all of the capabilities of the Nikon D3200 digital camera, but so far have found it easy to use and adaptable, resulting in excellent pictures.","Really Good Camera, Takes a few minutes to understand how to operate it (i didn't look in the manual) but overall its pretty easy and very light.<br />Takes about 5-10 seconds to the image to Appear on film.","This was a gift, but my friend seems pretty happy with it.","cute!","I love it","LOVE LOVE LOVE IT... CAME SUPER QUICK.....GREAT QUALITY BEST PRICE","Perfect gift, daughter loved it","cool camera. only thing is doesn't come with film. you have to buy it separately","I love bringing this camera when I go to Disney! The pictures come out so good! I recommend taking outdoor shots when the sky is clear for a more \"enhanced\" shot.","No complaints with the product. FYI - it does not come with a memory card, you have to purchase one separately. I wish I had know ahead of time since this was a gift, and I could have purchased one at the same time of my original order.","FUJIFILM's best instant camera as of this date.","This is absolutely the cutest little camera! It was exactly what I wanted: old school pictures in a modern little package! I absolutely love it! Everyone that has seen me with it wants one too!","Its been a week and i feel the camera is Awesome. We used it as novelty item for our party and all our guests loved it..<br />Buy one for urself and I'm sure your guests will be impressed..","Cute and quaint. A role of film is about 20$.","I purchased this fujifilm camera for my wedding. I had a seating chart in which you wuold take your name and replace it with a picture of yourself. It was a huge success and a hit! I'm so happy to have the printed pictures of my guests and the memories we made taking them. It worked well:)","need to get more. lovely gift.","thenproduct came in early which was exciting. It's made very well seems durable. But as far as figuring out how it worked I had to look up a video. Mabey I'm not that bright but the dig ram they send. With isn't the easiest to follow but I love the camera the pictures are so cute","Oh how it makes me feel young again. The Polaroid, which instantly develops and prints out your photo within 15 minutes. I love using it but why it gotta be so expensive to get the film :(<br /><br />Can't mess up with this camera! :)<br /><br />Great quality, LOVE IT!","I love this, I basically wanna take it everywhere. READ HOW TO ADJUST YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING BEFORE TAKING YOUR PICTURES. If they come out horrible, it's cause you did it wrong.","My daughter enjoys taking pictures.","Came in two days, very great packaging, nice and works well","I normally don't write reviews but I have to say that this camera is awesome!  I took it with me while taking my daughter to practice so I can test it. I had so many  complements about this camera and the image came out clean. One of the Best purchase I've made.","My daughter love her camera excellent product very nice pictures","Nice instax mini 8 instant film camera! It takes nice pictures instantly!","love the camera! comes with batteries!","I love this camera. It was exactly what I expected it to be but I gave it a 4 because while it was in my bag it must've gotten jostled around enough to mess with the way the lights work. The exposure is fine but the lights indicating what setting is being used doesn't always work. It not like I was being rough with it while it was in my bag either. I would like it to be more durable but I sill love it.","Have had for almost a year and still works like a charm, love it!","I love the camera, just like how imagine it would be and it came wayyyyyyy fast. Arrived at the same time my case arrived.","Omg thank you it works perfectly it bigger than I thought it would be I love it ","It's great ! I love it .

Great pictures, easy to use, and amazing price.","I just absolutely love it omwh","I love my camera. Nothing beats the fun of instant pictures.","Takes cute little pictures! I am using it for our guestbook at our wedding. Make sure you know that it only prints CREDIT CARD sized photos.","Cute, classy, fairly compact. Love it! Just be careful inserting film","So fun","I love it!","Love it","Great Product!","easy to use and takes real good pics. fits nicely in pocket or pouch","i love it :3","his camera takes great pictures and is easy to operate. So glad that I purchased it before my granddaughter was born.","I am in love with this camera, I've taken only 4 Polaroids and I gotta say I'm happy. It's completely worth every penny ?? I recommend to all those photography lovers!","love it so much!","great product","In love with this camera! So glad that I bought it. If you are debating on if you should buy it or not, I'd say to go ahead and do it! I couldn't be any happier with this purchase. It's cute, takes great pictures, and is the perfect size for on the go. Also, it conveniently comes with the batteries it needs so you don't need to worry about buying some before it arrives. I would recommend this product to anyone!!","Nice camera! Bough it for my daugther she loves it!","My daughter loves this camera and it takes the cutest pictures. Cute, fun, and at a good price on Amazon!","Such a cute little camera! Easy to use and great quality pictures!

She always wanted one as a child so I made her dream come true. It's a really neat.","Love it!","Definitely the best thing I've bought in awhile. This camera is not only super easy to use, but the greatest thing to take along when you go on vacations or are just hanging out with friends! Everyone is always so fascinated by it and its great to capture fun memories with. It came just as pictured, and with all the instructions you need. I'd recommend checking out some Youtube tutorials on how to use the camera just in case! But it's super simple to use and to put film in.<br /><br />The camera even turns off if you aren't using it after 5 min. It does come with batteries, which is nice, and they last awhile! <3 It shipped very quickly and arrived in great condition. I'd recommend this product to anyone!","Works great, awesome condition.<br />Take it anywhere you would like.<br /><br />Sucks to always need to buy films, but that's cool.<br />It's still awesome!","One of the best cameras I have. Takes great photos and brings the 70s back!","This little camera was a gift for my birthday. Once you get the hang of it, it's such a fun party cam! I only use it on special occasions: weddings, parties, travel, things like that. My friends love the pictures - I wish it would print two at a time, since I'm always giving them away :)","Came quickly, works great as promised.","I love mine, thank you","will be fun to use it...","This camera is perfect for my needs. I tend to do alot of research before I purchase anything and have owned this before","It is an amazing camera the color is actually what it is in the picture. I should also say that if you like taking pictures then this is the camera for you!","Love this camera!","OMG this camera is awesome. Totally recommend it for any one who loves photography. It's easy to use and its setup instructions are also simple.","Completely in love with it. Can't  stop using it.","I was really excited about this camera.  The camera is so cute and I thought it would be fun to take snap shots of my 2 year old son for him to cherish later on. It's small enough goes in your purse perfectly, which was another plus for me.<br /><br />Today is the second day I used this camera. It takes good pictures inside.  The photos do have a vintage look to them which I really like. I went to the beach today.  I was so excited to take snap shots of my son on the beach and was so dissapointed when my photos turned out white.  You can see my son but it seems like the photo has been exposed to light and did not come out properly. I will post a picture. I am hoping I can figure out how to take better pictures outdoors. If anyone has any suggestions - please write about it!<br /><br />All in all,  great point and shoot camera.  Not too sure about taking outdoor pictures yet but it's a fun little camera to have around.","fun and great memories","Neat, compact remake of the original Polaroid camera.","I love this camera it takes great pictures. To first start off this review I would like to say that this camera is great its so sleek and pretty skinny and light. The camera looks exactly like the picture. I have dropped this camera before but it was perfectly fine and did`nt get any scratches or anything. From experience always remember to adjust the setting to the one that it suggests (it suggests a setting by lighting up by the setting). Try not to get to close to the camera because i dont if this is just me but when i was too close to the camera i came out very very white. I loved that this came with a cute strap too that matches the camera. I recommend buying a big package of the film because it is very expensive and the more you buy the more money you save. Im not sure but for all of the pictures I have taken so far the flash has been on. Just for when you put in the film box be sure to read the instructions carefully or you will do it wrong and it could mess up the camera. I also recommend getting the color lens. With the color lens on the camera , i think that the picture comes out more cool looking and it looks very tumblry. A great feature on this camera that i love is that it shows you a number which mean how many films you have left. The camera holds ten films at a time. This camera is perfect for creating cute memorys with your friends! The only thing that i would complain about this camera is that the fact that the film for it is so expensive. But i do get why because they are so cute and it prints out write there when you take it. Another thing just make sure you are ready for the picture to be taken because i wouldnt want to waste any of the film. I would totally recommend this as a gift for anyone i love mine! If this review helped you in any way please vote helpful! If you have any questions feel free to ask.","exactly as described and so much fun!","Arrived on time, as described, perfect condition, new with original packaging","I like it alot","Grandaughter loves this.","Cute camera & perfect gift","Even with digital cameras its great to see your picture printed instantly.  Great fun, gave the  camera to my granddaughter for her birthday, she loves it !","i got one for my birthday and they are so cute and very easy to use. The only thing is before you take a picture make sure the setting is on correctly or the picture will be to dark or bright. I love this instant film camera!!","The camera is bulky, but great for kids! I bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she absolutely LOVES it! The picture quality if surprisingly clear and very easy to use. Highly recommended for any age!","It was in great shape and my girlfriend loved it when she unwrapped it on her bday! Thank you!","Cute camera, brings back the memories of my old Polaroid camera. Pictures are quite small but great for decoration.","awesome","I purchased this for my wedding shower. HUGE hit! Great price and I LOVE it! :)","Great camera! I know this is just a fad, but it has been fun taking polaroid type pictures again and this camera does a good job at it. Definitely recommend it.","This is so neat right out of the box me and my daughter started snapping photos! We got a 3 pack of 10 sheets of film in various designs to go with it as well.<br />It's easy to use, fun and a great little party favor to pass out to friends. Love this pink soft shell also.","Great Camera. Lovely pictures!","Good and cute'i love it ''","Super cute & easy to understand! I would definitely recommend purchasing a case for it! :)","Perfect for summer","Came quickly, perfect quality. Love it","Arrived on time and as purchased, daughter loves it!","ok","Bought this for my daughter for Christmas!!! Shipped fast and she loved it!!","Used it for a kids birthday party to provide cute pictures as little take home gifts.  All the kids and parents loved tge pictures.  In this day of digital cameras, people are very pleased to actually be able to hold a printed picture bc so few of us make the effort to print our pictures. I loved the quality and the nostalgia. Really pleased with it.","I have a DSLR, but I wanted to try the Instax cameras out for when I go on vacation to certain locations. I already have the Instax Wide which I adore, but I wanted something smaller that was easier to carry around. While I love how lightweight and small this Instax Mini 8 is, I wish it worked better in direct sunlight. I recently went down the shore and when I tried to use the camera (on the brightest sun setting) to take pictures of the sand dunes, the pictures came out WAY overexposed. It made me waste about 4 films out of 10. The only time it worked was if I was taking a photo of someone DIRECTLY in front of me. I'm hoping it doesn't crap out on me while in Disney next month, or I'll probably have to return it. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes just taking photos for fun! :)","This camera is easy to use, adorable, and everyone at my wedding reception had a BLAST with it! You have to purchase film separately, which runs about $1/photo. It worked as expected and the buttery yellow is so cheerful! I am beyond pleased with this little camera!","I love it!!","Good investment for our DIY photo booth at an outdoor wedding.","Exactly what I was looking for, and this is MUCH cheaper than I would have paid at Urban Outfitters or any other store!! The pictures come out great (once you learn how to use the flash, that is) and I love the pale yellow shade. Love it!","I love it!","Bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it!","awesome camera really really really reccomend it if your into instant photos! shipped in 2 days came really fast & packaged nicely i love this product . 5 stars!!","Got this for my daughter on her birthday and was able to use it with her friends and they all enjoyed it as part of their party favors...","THIS CAMERA IS TONS OF FUN!!!! we just recently moved and my daughter has definitely gotten a lot of use out of this camera in our new home and also has been a great talking point for making new friends!! Would definitely reccommend","I got the blue one. Very beautiful!","Great, fun camera.  Was a gift for my 11 year old and it has gotten tremendous use and rave reviews.  It is fun for adults to fondly recall our own instant film days.  These pictures are pretty small, about 2x3 inches in size.  Somehow, this does not detract from the shot.  The kids really enjoy the instant gratification.  Parents appreciate the vintage look.  Highly recommend.","Perfect color & easy to use. Takes great pics!","Love this camera!! Just hate how expensive the film is.. Yellow makes me happy :)","I've been wanting one of these cameras for a long, long time. I've been researching and looking at online videos to find out if it is worth it, and it totally is! I know you may look at the 1 star comments and decide otherwise, but don't do that! It is really fun to use and it is pretty easy to use, I looked up a video on YouTube and learned how to use it and now my pictures come out great! It works perfectly and u should really buy it!","the kid love it . originaly packed","my daughter loves this camera","I love my Instax Fuijifilm camera! I recently went on a trip to Europe and my poloroid pics make for great memories and was so fun and easy to use. Great for all ages and the picture quality is actually pretty decent if set on the correct settings.","Great camera","A cute camera, perfect size and a nice shape for the hand. Sometimes hard to tell how far away you should be, because the viewfinder is more zoomed in than the actual lens. But just a wonderful camera ? The wrist strap, however, looks matching in the picture but is actually a darker yellow","It works very well but I put my first pack of film in it and I got 3 pictures out of it and then the rest wouldn't come out so I had to waste almost a completely full pack of film.","I got this for my mother's birthday and she adores it and never misses an opportunity to take a couple of pictures!","Works as described, easy to use but was expecting more. Pictures are ok but there are basically no settings to the camera. There's less tech in this than old polaroid cameras from the 80's. Look through the viewfinder and hope for the best! Too bulky to carry around and not that enough film per cartridge means it has a very limited range of use.","This camera took me back to my childhood.  I love taking poloroid shots, although shortly after buying this, I saw they released a new version that allows for double exposures. This camera is also a hit with the younger generation that didn't grow up with poloroid cameras. My younger cousins love taking pictures with this.  The film is kind of pricey, but affordable on Amazon.","I bought this camera for my daughter and she's in the Navy now and she loves it tells me Dad its an (Old School camera)","So fun!!! Love this adorable camera","If you going to buy a mini  8 instant film buy it here !! worth the price and its a really cool camera I take it to most place and every one always wants a mini picture of them self. I hang up all my mini pictures in a wall in my room it looks cute :)","good! l like ","Love this camera! Has a very retro feel to it. I wish the pictures printed larger but they are great to put in wallets.","Very cool","I love it... Great price too","It was fast and quick delivery. My daughter loves the camera","I love it","It's exactly what I expected. It was in perfect condition and contained a wrist strap, which was an unexpected surprise.","I received the product in a satisfactory manner and before the scheduled time","amazing have used it soon much OBSESSED. so glad I bought it here instead of other places that sell it for $100.","Very good camera. Does everything the advertising says. My daughter loves!","A present for my daughters 11th Bday.  She LOVES it!!!","Love love ??","It came two days earlier but... I opened the box and found a black camera. When I ordered a white camera. It worked fine but seriously? I'm fine with black but it could've been a color I hate like yellow or something","This camera is fantastic. Great picture quality, cute color, good texture, comfortable to hold, and it has different settings for different lighting (of which it suggests automatically). It's easy to operate, fun to mess around with, and the pictures make a great addition to the scrapbook I'm working on.","Grandaughter loves this camera","Great gift","I'm<br />I love with my fujifilm instax","my daughter got this for christmas and its a big hit at my house ...everyone loves it ... totally worth the money ... the film is crazy expensive for it but just buy the bundle packs and they make up for it ... great gift idea","Broght this for my daugther. She love it","Great little camera. Functions exactly as advertised. It has an automatic focus. You can change it, but picture does not turn out as well if you don't. (Indoor, outdoor, the lighting, etc). My daughter and her friends love using their polarid.","Good product","love it","This camera is compact and sturdy. It is really easy to use and I absolutely love it.","Cute camera and very fun!","This camera is a lot of fun. I'm not good about getting pictures printed so this is an easy convenient way to do it. Loading film is easy. The camera is easy to use for even the most gadget-friendly person.<br />Also, the camera itself has gotten me a lot of compliments. People ask me, \"Is that really a Polaroid?\"<br /><br />Warning: the pictures are small and the pictures don't come out in bright sunlight.","Amazing!! so fast and its beautiful!! thank you so much!","Purchased this for my daughter, and she loves it! Just be aware of the setting of the camera before you snap the picture.","My gf loves it. Brings back memories of the old Polaroid cameras.","It's a little hard to get the hang of as other reviewers have said you can easily waste a lot of film with the light meter not always being so accurate. Also even if the film roll seems empty try again to make sure you used it all up, lost 2 photos when I prematurely opened it up. pros: cute design, and love having tactile photo result. cons: learning curve is costly","I like it but i wish there was film included... it was misleading.","This works well for my daughter, I'm not highly impressed with the functionality or quality compared to the old Polaroid cameras, but for the money my kid loves it.","Came in perfectly, looks amazing and take fantastic pictures. Thanks!","my 10 year old loves this gift.  be warned though, the film is expensive","I love it but I wish I had ordered a camera case at the same time because the white scratches very easily.","I love it but I'm confused mine didn't come with a strap","I bought this as a graduation gift and my friend loves it. It works absolutely perfectly and arrived on time. We have little credit card sized pictures everywhere now!","Thank you so much im extremely satisfied .","This thing is like a merical worker.","Gotta love this camera, it came all in one piece and I'm happy with it ","Great camera works perfect","Picture quality is not what I expected.","It's fun to have a Polaroid type of camera, however, I found the room needs to be quite well-lit. The pictures print out the size of a credit card which is cute but at the same time is kind of too small. Perhaps I'm just used to the camera size my dad had when I was a kid.","My girlfriend loves it. Perfect gift for your lady.","This camera is a whole lot of fun! I bought this because I wanted to have some actual, physical pictures since lately almost everything is digital.  I also liked the old, Polaroid-like quality that this camera produces, and it really does not disappoint! There are many different settings on the camera so that you can get the perfect picture regardless of the setting.  There really is something fun about getting an instant picture in your hand a few minutes after taking it.<br /><br />I am certainly not a professional photographer, but this camera proved to be a great purchase and I have had a lot of fun with it!","This is really cute and fun to just play with.  I haven't used it all day or at a party yet so I have no idea on the battery life.  They refills of film are kind of pricey but this would make a cute gift for a graduate or newly married couple and if your okay with spending 100 bucks on film, fun for a party. The pictures come out just like polaroid's do, so I'm not sure they've improved on color quality.  Picture quality as far as sharpness does look better than some polaroid's I've seen. I'm going to say I like it with four stars instead of loving it just because of the price point on film and the lack of improvement on color.  My first time using it was a little clunky, but I'm someone who like to dive in and see if I can figure out a product before I read the directions. Loading the film was a no brainer but if you aren't tech or camera savvy, take a moment to read the directions before using.","Really really ausem","Absolutely love this camera! Pictures aren't great quality, but are so fun to have!","Bought this for my girlfriend everything is great! Only thing please be aware the films are expensive!","Awesome camera. Easy to use -- especially after reading the manual (or at least the part about the lighting). Pictures are about credit-card size.","I like it  takes awesome pictures","its ok if you are not into quality","Excellent! It arrived earlier then expected and everyone loves my new camera.  Very pretty color and don't expect the selfie mirror, if you read the description it doesn't state selfie mirror so I knew what I will except when arrived.  The picture isn't the same camera I received but read description before purchase. You won't be disappointed, I love it!","I love this camera so much! Such a great purchase!","I LOVE this camera its sooo gorgeous and fun watching the photos develope. The film will be alittle expensive 2 keep up with but its completely worthhhh it if your lookn to have something to capture memories u can hold ! .","Love my camera! The pictures are great and it's a great value. If you want pictures larger than these--buy the bigger, uglier Fujifilm instant camera. I really prefer this smaller, cuter version though!!","The camera doesn't come with film, but it works wonderfully and the film is pretty cheap!","Love my polotid however it arrived after the GUARANTEED  delivery date overall I like the product","Nice camera great pics..light weight.<br />I ordered it for my daughter for her birthday, I asked for it to be gift wrapped and wrote a note to be posted on the gift. It was not gift-wrapped.  Did not like that!","I got this Fuji mini 8 camera as a gift but the problem is that i did not get any accessories for it,so i went on Amazon to search for essential accessories i needed.

Would purchase again.","gave this camera to my sister as a gift, we used it right away and she was very happy with it. It's a bright yellow and worked perfectly.","As a photography fanatic, I'm always looking for new cameras to mess with and have fun with. Lately I've been very obsessed with film cameras and thought I would try this camera. The vintage feel it gives plus the gratification of immediately having the photo is great appeal. I absolutely love this camera! So smooth and has such a nice feel. Can't get enough of it!","Love it! I love the matte black color and the curves kind of remind me of Toothless from how to train your dragon lol Camera came on time, no scratch no imperfections and good packaging! I got my films at Michaels for $15 per 20 films with 40% coupons.","Just like the old Polaroid just better","bought this for my sister and she loves it. just the film is expensive","Great product!","Didn't come with batteries, so we couldn't use it at the party I bought it for.  I should have checked earlier, but batteries would be a good thing to ship with it.","Fun camera for my 13 year old daughter. She loves being able to take pics with friends and pin them onto her corkboard frames in her room.","Cant stop taking pictures!!","Best thing I've bought on here. I'm very happy with this camera, it is definitely worth it ?","Very good works perfect my girlfriend loved it. You kinda have to  make sure you aim precisely and a good distance because the viewing glass isn't so accurate other then that this camera takes good pictures. Very fun so we can keep good memories. :)!","I  just received my camera about a day ago and i'm already obsessed with it. I have taken two pictures so far and they both turned out perfect. The camera came very fast and in perfect condition. I am very happy with this purchase, this camera is easy to use and looks very cute. The only complain that I have is that the film is a bit pricey but, it is so worth it.","love this camera. It does exactly what I needed.","Granddaughter (13) LUVS this camera, along with her Go-Pro camera!!!!<br />Shipped Fast; Exactly as Described; Great Value!","everybody loves it!","I absolutely love it!!!!!!!! It's so cute!","I love it. It's so compact and easy to carry. I bring it with me everywhere. It takes good photos!","I've been wanting a Polaroid camera for quite some time now and I recently received the Instax Mini for my birthday. It's user friendly and required little set-up. I'm not a serious photographer, I mostly just take pictures for fun with my friends or family so the camera works perfectly for my needs.  It also came with clear, understandable instructions on how and when to use the different light settings so I got the hang of it in no time. I love it!","Great, fun, and easy to use camera! I love it.","lo ame!","Favorite thing in the world ","Love this camera this was for my granddaughter she asked for it specifically She loved it I made her take the first pic of me and her little sister so she will always remember who she received it from grandma It worked great","I love my camrea so much!!  Very nice","Works very well!! I love it and use it when I go on trips or hang out with friends","Very satisfactory","I love this little camera! It shipped on time and was packaged very carefully.<br /><br />First impression: very classy and cute. Almost looks like a toy.<br />Granted the instructions were in Japanese or Chinese (not sure which one), the pictures really helped me figure out what to do. It's all very easy to set up and works flawlessly. However I should warn you that the pics are smaller than expected and in bright daylight the picture doesn't develop as well but other than that, it's pretty neat. I would recommend buying this if you're like going travelling and wanna take some pocket-sized photos.<br /><br />NB: It's continued to work after 3 pictures (I mention this because some reviews mention how after 3 pics the camera just stops)","Great!!!","Great little camera, easy for kids to use, and fun","Great!","My daughter loves her new camera and she has PLENTY of film (I bought her 160 pictures for her 16th birthday). She loves to have that instant picture as opposed to the pictures on her phone.","Enjoying this camera.... Super cute small, tiny pics!!","that's sooooo good!","I'm upset because it dident come with film, so ended up spending another 15$, which I could have just bought a Polaroid on here for $80 with the film and Polaroid that way I wouldn't have to wait another week for my film to come. But other then that, it works great and fast shipping! Came in 3 days!","Great stuff","Good","Great camera except film's expensive","Câmera is awesome.<br />Haters gonna hate!","Love it! I'm so excited to use this for my DIY photo-booth for my wedding in September 2015! Great price! looks just like th picture. Love the sassy raspberry color!","Works GREAT! Pictures are surprisingly clear and a perfect size for selfies! The film is expensive (about $1.07) per picture, but the camera is excellent for kids because it is fairly durable (so far) and very easy to use.","Super cute and I always get question on what kind of camera it is","Great!","LOVE","I really like the camara but I think it should come with film.","Love it!","My daugthers love her new camera. No issues and quick delivery.","I love the camera it's everything I wanted & it came at a reasonable time!","Fastest shipping ever! So Happy with this camera..the color is the prettiest light pink..perfect for my daughter!","I love this fun little camera!!","Great product. Simple and easy to use","The coolest camera ever! My favorite amazon purchase. Takes the cutest photos with a vintage feel. I love using it when I go out with friends. It does seem to have some difficulty with reflections on glass and the film is kindof expensive. But the pros definitely outweigh the cons! 100% recommend.","A little big, be sure to buy Pink for a Girl! But very much loved by my Grand-daughter.","I love love love it!!","My sister loves it just wish that it could hold more shots, but other than that it's great and super sturdy for her accidental drops and bumps.","Ordered the film and camera for my wedding, product arrived on time and was exactly what I wanted.","great product..daughter loves it","I was sent the order twice and the selfie mirror was not included both times. Slightly disappointing but wonderful working camera.","I LOVE this camera!  So much fun!","Great camera, i bought it for my sister and she loved it","loved it :)! the pictures are way cool","Just like I imagined it. Love it!","Cute cool fun camera","I loved it !","I got the package early in the morning 2 days after ordering and everything works great. I was a bit hesitant to try it out because of some of the review about it not working right or the flash not working but there was no problems for me. I've taken almost 10 pictures already and the photos are processing fast and good, sure the picture isn't High Def. but it's an instant camera and the price is quite low for this type of pictures. I like the vintage look when the photos are done processing.","Great camera","I bought this for my sister's wedding and it is a fun camera to use. I don't see us using it all the time, because the film is rather pricey, but for special occasions, it is great.","Very cute instant camera! It was smaller than I expected but that made it easier to find a bag for it.","This was a great gift but more expensive when compared to ones I saw afterwards in a store.","Bought this for my niece on her birthday. She thinks it's AWESOME! and takes lots of pics.","Best thing ever!!!","Almost cancel the order after reading some of the previous reviews.  Glad I didn't...I bought it for my daughter's 10th birthday and she was ecstatic!  Picture quality amazing...","my daughter likes pics are not that great but she seems to like it...","Received it pretty fast, its easy to use, and it's everything I expected it to be :)","Cool camera, I got a few compliments on it- most people were surprised that it was instant film. It's fun as a scrapbook or travel journal camera and the pictures were pretty clear. Minimal settings so you just point and shoot. One of the bad things is there is no timer and taking 'selifes' or close-ups takes some practice because the viewfinder is off from the actual lens. It's a nice little camera as a collection piece or for people who want something fun and simple. As seen in the picture it is an 'off-white' matte color not pure white like the printer paper.","The camera worked really well I wish I had found it earlier.","works great as expected.","the one I bought was new and in good condition, delivered fast and on time, thank you so much..the camera is amazing, it captures precious moments in one instant shot and film. i really really love it! great product!","My daughter is enjoying it","Great little camera","The camera works well. The viewfinder isn't aligned perfectly so resulting pictures are offset. This instant camera's light settings are a little confusing. However, a nice purchase, overall.","Its a pretty nice camera for special moment. Its not a professional camera. The only bad thing is that there is no automatic exposure option","It was perfect for my daughter.  She is still learning how to change the light settings but very nice.","Very good camera to have it you want your pictures right away.","So fun to use! Good photo quality. I love how every one is unique!","Love it","Good!","Fun and good easy to use camera. Huge hit for a baby shower!!!","Excellent.","Got this for my niece on her 16th bday and she was so happy. Works great and is amazing at catching those special memories you want to cherish forever.","Bought this for my daughters 13th birthday.  She absolutely loves this!","Exactly as described... Quick delivery","Love it!","Love it!","Came fast takes great pictures","This camera is just great. I ordered it with film so that I could use it immediately and I have had 0 regrets about it since delivery. I ordered the white one and it's true to the pictures. It was just so spot-on especially in taking pictures. The camera itself functions very well and is convenient to use because it tells you which setting is best for which lighting. Just amazing!","Good","gf loves it","Love it!! It's wonderful!","I have seen these all over Pinterest so I bought one for a family party. It does not come with film you have to buy that separately and it can be a little expensive (I mean who really buys film anymore anyway?). The shipping was pretty quick. I saw the same Camera for about $20 more at Michaels so this was a pretty good deal. When you first get the camera it is a little trial and error. I am so used to using my iphone as a camera that looking through a lens confused me. It has a very small viewer so you have to be careful your finger doesn't cover it. Once you get a hang of it it is pretty fun but it will take you a couple of tries. The whole anticipation is for when the pictures come out. It is so old school and that is half the fun. The picture quality is as best that can be expected for a mini instant camera and the pictures are fairly tiny. The finish of the picture tends to be a little washed out but then again you are not using this camera for high quality photography more like a novelty. The pictures have a little tab at the bottom that that you can use a Sharpie to write messages on.","Bought this for my granddaughter's birthday and she has had so much fun with it..  Now to keep her in film is another story.","It was erevything perfect! Amazing product.","I love it! And it's lighter to hold than I expected","I've been dying to get one and kept on wondering if I should or not. And I'm glad I did! The pictures are really vibrant and crisp. Love it!<br /><br />EDIT<br />mmm... REALLY wish I got a different color...<br />the Yellow one was definitely not my first choice. I wanted the Raspberry one, but it wasn't offered at the time I decide to splurge. And of course, they come out and offer that color the week after I got my camera. The thing about the yellow one, is that it scratched a lot. You can usually rub it off, but the small hits against a zipper, other things inside the bad and more, makes the exterior of the camera really ugly and dirty.<br /><br />The camera's still awesome and I love it, so no stars to take away. But the color, <br /><br />UPDATE 8/16/2016<br />The dial doesn't seem to change the setting anymore.. It's a hit or miss on how the photos will turn out. The film counter's also off and keeps on telling me I have film when I don't, or don't have film when I do. It's very bizarre.","I absoluely love the camera. Thank you for it. It's so beautiful and I use it all the time!!","My daughter loves it!!!","Excellent!","I kept debating on which I should get, the Instax, the Polaroid or the Instax printer for smartphones. It came in today and I'm in love with it. I've only taken 3 photos indoors so far and they came out great. My 8 year old took the photo of our dog and she had no problems using it. I was so happy to see that it takes a few seconds for the photo to develop just like the old ones did. I think the size of the photos are cute and NOT too small. I went with this brand mostly because I wanted the look of the original Polaroid film with the white boarder. Next on my list will be the Instax printer so I can print pictures that are on my phone. Very happy with the product. Going to Lake Winnie tomorrow and can't wait to try the different settings and see how they turn out!","I bought 2 so what  does that tell ya!","I love it. It's really cute, doesn't come with film though. Really easy to use and the photos are adorable. No complaints at all.","Absolutely love this product<br />It performs really well in all lighting - just make sure to change the aperture for the different lighting settings you're in<br />It fits perfectly in my hand and even came with a cute polka dot strap","This camera is so pretty. The photos don't come out absolutely clear so they have a vintage feel. I love it. It is the perfect size.","AMAZING PRODUCT??","What a great camera! Takes really cute pictures that are ready to go straight in the wallet or a fun framed look. Loved the quality and the look.","I love this camera! It's perfect if you like to keep it old fashioned! I personally like having pictures displayed on my wall. Still own a great film camera just so I can develop my pictures and have them for memories! Their are cons...the pictures are very small if you'd like them bigger I recommended getting the wide instant camera. The functions I still can not understand because instructions are in Chinese. Lastly, film is very pricey so point and shoot responsibly!!!!<br />Will be purchasing wide instant camera. ","love this s***","great camera for instant gratification.  we take lots of pics but they get lost on computers, flash drives, and SDcards.  My daughter asked for this for her 12th birthday and really loves it.  Only complaint I have is the size of the pics.  They are definitely smaller that the ones I remember from my childhood.","LOVE THISSSSSS","I wish the film was a little less expensive but I LOVE THIS CAMERA","Works perfectly, very pleased! And the color is adorable!","It's Great! Just as described and we love it!","All was ok, it was that I Bought.<br />I recomend this seller!!","Bought it a month ago. Just used this with my brand new niece and they turned out splendid! My brother in law even opened up the back out of curiosity and the photos still worked.","The camera is in perfect quality. The pictures have a beautiful vintage quality to them. I highly recommend!","love, love, love this camera","Got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it! It's a great product.","I love this camera so much, I use it all the time.","This is awesome! It's cute and I'm gonna decorate my room with the pictures I take with it. It's super fun to play with!","This camera works great!<br />I bought mine from Roberts LP and will continue buying whatever I can from them.<br />Sadly my sister wanted the camera so I decided I'm going to try to buy a new one in a different color hopefully they it works the same!","Got it yesterday, it's not a limited model but it's nice anyway! Love it!!!!","Ships fast and item as described. Not too many options, so very easy to use.","This is so much fun!","I absolutely love it and it was delivered so fast!","I had the mini 7 before and this camera is much lighter. It makes it easier when carrying it in a bag. It's also a bit smaller than the mini 7. The film is the same making it easy as I didn't have to buy new film for this camera. It's a simple camera that anyone can use.","I got the camera on time. I've been using it and it's amazing I love it so much I'm so glad I made the choice of purchasing this camera!","Love It ??","I wasn't really sure about getting the camera but I'm glad i did. Everyone in my family loves it. It's great!","My daughter loves it & so does her brother, who wants his own.","In love with this little thing!","A perfect gift for a photographer wife. This little thing is very cute. Runs great for more than 5 months now and takes sweet pictures. The lighting settings will take a little time to understand.","What was once outdated, is now again popular. The 16-year-old LOVES this thing. And it takes good pictures!","IN MARCH I ORDERED THE CAMERA AND THE ACCESSORIES FOR MY DAUGTHER'S BD IN JUNE. IT CAME VERY FAST AND WAS HIDDEN AT HOME FOR TWO MONTHS. I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE IF SHE'S GONNA LIKE IT AND HOW ARE THE PIC. SHE LOVE IT. THE PICTURES ARE VERY CLEAR...A+ A+++BUY IT! WITH THIS PRODUCT AND ITS PRICE EVERYTHING IS A+","Ok, before I buy this product I made sure to read the reviews, but the only bad thing is that they said had no mirror selfie, then contact these sellers (6 to be specified) and no sellers had the product selfie mirror. and the question is that this was limited and only Japanese or Chinese sellers have products that seek time.<br /><br />I'm happy with the color and the product, to be honest I love my instax and not complicate my life! just buy a mirror selfie. ;) #behappy","Really love this!","I bought it for my girlfriend and she was very happy. The camera is exactly as illustrated arrived in very good conditions and I bought it with 1-Day Shipping.","Camera is nice shade of red. No mirror selfie, but I bought one anyways. It works like a charm, people love it and so do I.","I received my camera three days after I ordered. It came with all of the parts. I've read other reviews where the wristlet was not included, luckily mine was. I've only taken one picture so far but I love it!","Love this product! Super cute and fun! It's a nice way to keep memories. You should buy it!!!!","Got this as a Mother's Day gift & I love it so much. Btw you have to buy the film separately as it doesn't come with any but it's only about $1/print so it's cheap!","LOVE LOVE LOVE!! The only minor defect is that the number where its suppose to tell you how many pictures are left doesn't work. It always stays on zero. doesn't bother me too much but it would be nice if it worked so I can know hoe much film is left. other then that I love this!!","Takes great pictures, just wish they were a tad larger.","The camera is very cute! Also user friendly! My daughter love's it!!","Purchased for my daughter's birthday. She loved it.","Very good and easy to use it","I LOVE THIS CAMERA! too cute! and makes great memories with friends!! LOVE THIS!!!","Love, love, love it!!!","I love it","Love the camera. Its soo cute and easy to use and easy to take with u (if u bought the case for the camera), also love the film that comes out right after taking the photo. Film not included. Have to buy everything separate from the camera.","On time. Got exactly what I purchased. Nothing missing everything in  one piece","Received on time and according to advertised.","My best friend loved it","I got this for my daughter on her birthday and she absolutely loves it. It is so easy and simple. She already has old things like a type writer, record player and more so I knew she would love it!","First day of use I'm already obsessed! The pictures comes out so clear and gives you that old school feel when Polaroids first came out. You will have alot of fun with this and it will not stop.","My wife love this, picture quality is good and it is not very expensive.","Awesome color yellow<br />True to tone<br />Awesone revamped camera from the good old original<br />7 year old loves it!","Polaroids are back!  Cool camera fun memories.","As expected.","great product.","I brought this during a recent vacation with me, and everyone really enjoyed it! My friends kept asking to have their pictures taken. This kind of camera also works great for scrap book pages. As a scrap book owner myself, I recommend!","This camera is so sleek. I really love the picture quality. It arrived just today, and I purchased it yesterday. I will have updates soon, with pictures to show. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone looking for a lightweight, high quality instant capturing camera.","Fun, fun, fun, grand kids love it.","good quality a little expensive","Its really works","Takes amazing pictures. Super cute and easy to carry around with you.","Make sure you put it in the right way because it's a bitch to get out if it's in the wrong way. Hint: If it is in the wrong way, use a key to get it out.","Good camera.","great camera. Film is pricey","Kind of a late review for this but I still ABSOLUTELY LOVE this camera. Its so easy to carry around in my bag and the films can be a bit pricey at times but it still remains a good memory to keep. I decorated mine with full of stickers and it was adorable.","It was a gift and it is well loved and enjoyed.","Fun and easy to use!","Girlfriend loves this!","The camera is great! The pictures have this great vintage effect to them, and the pictures aren't affected by circumstances as they all look great. The camera is very durable and easy to use with multiple settings. Overall, I think this was a great purchase. I love it.","I can only say that I love it... Would totally recommend it .","Only reason why I got this color was for the built-in selfie mirror, which this shipped without. Overall, still the great Instax Mini 8, simply disappointing that I was misled.","Received it great price point everything was on point but after getting the camera it was disappointing it wasn't what I expected but that has nothing to do with the seller just the camera itself is not of great quality so it's just itself a prop in my photos","This is my first Polaroid and I love it! It works perfectly! None of my pictures came out overly bright or dark. And it's the easiest thing to use. (I have other cameras). I took it to the bowling alley and the pics look really 70s, it's awesome! Overall, it's a great camera! A little pricey but great buy!","Ok","So much fun!  Bought this camera for my daughter for her 13th birthday and she couldn't be happier!  Easy to carry,  easy to use. She can hardly put it down!","Takes great indoor pics. Haven't worked out how to take glare free outdoor pics. Close ups of 1 meter of less comes out really good","I love this little camera. Super fun to use at parties... a little bulky to travel with though","Ive always wanted one and i just received mine today! I took 3 pictures and all came out with amazing lighting and quality can't wait to use it this summer definitely worth the money.It was packed very safely and came very quickly.I recommend it to anyone.Very happy with my purchase.","It's awesome","My 13 year old loves this camera. Loves to take it with her where ever she goes. Totally a big hit, Can't go wrong buying this!","completely satisfied!","LOVE it! Ordered it for a family vacation in mexico and it was so fun to print out pictures immediately and have that vintage look. Sometimes when there was too much light the picture would over expose and the picture would be ruined :/, it's my fault but just be careful for that! Otherwise, I love it!","Im obsessed with taking pictures now lol. It's a very nice camera to use on the go, and its also too cute not to use .","Super fun little party camera. Definitely a novelty; these are not pics you're going to do much with afterwards.  Flash goes off every time automatically but unless you're super close to your subject,  it comes out way dark.","Love it","Absolutely awesome, took this to Africa, and was so nice to give something like a photo instead of them giving...buy it!!  This woman in Samburu village had never really seen herself..beautiful...she's holding the photo I took with this camera!","I bought this for my daughter's 10 birthday and she loves it! We also got the case to protect it. Fun, fun, fun.","Love, Love this camera! Can't say enough about it. I think it's something everyone should own. They print out the cutest little pictures right away in seconds. Good quality too!","My daughter is in love with her camera. So far so good, she has had it for few months now. I only wish that the instant film was cheeper. That what will make it expensive in the end.","Purchased as gift for 16 year old girl. She's happy with it. It arrived early from China.","This is an awesome camera. Easy to use, and came early!","Works fine.","I think I'm going to love it but have not used yet.  I bought to take on a mission trip to South Sudan so I can put the children's name with the picture.  I need to get more film so I can try it out.  Great color.","Great polaroid camera! Took a lot of pictures with it when I travel around - but sometimes the films get stuck and never comes out. I turned out had to remove the whole pack and all those new films were wasted","Good price but shipping did seem like a long time. Product came safe and sound love my fujifilm :)","This was the life of the party! Im so happy I bought this","Works as intended. Bought for gift for grandson. He loves it.","So cute and amazing! Picture quality comes out well!","Easy to use. Fun and so cute!  The pictures are business card sized but the quality is nice.","The camera produces good quality pictures.","Takes great photos for a instant photo camera. Wish it can hold more film.","I purchased this for my daughter's 12th birthday and she loves it!","Great","Came in just in time and everything came in tact and all the film were all inside as well","The packaging is really cute. It also comes with a safety wrist holder thing, this product is easy to use and pretty user friendly for individuals like me who are amateurs with polaroid cameras. The only con is that when you go outside on a SUNNY/ bright day make sure to turn the light exposure to the \"Hi-Key\" setting or your pictures will have too much exposure and you'll waste a film. All in all I am very satisfied with it.","I just bought this camera for my daughter to take to college and she absolutely loves it! Her first attempt at using the camera did not turn out well as she tried to take a picture of herself in the mirror and the flash went off. So far the flash has gone off every time (indoor and outdoor on a cloudy day). I am writing a review simply to advise others to not attempt to take mirror selfies as you will simply be wasting film! Also, I suggest you keep the owners manual and quickly scan the english instructions before using the camera for the first time as they were extremely helpful now and will continue to be helpful in the future.","Love it !","My favorite purchase this summer! So fun and easy to use.","My daughter loves it.","This is super cute and very easy to use! We plan on using it for our guest book for our wedding and I think I will need to label the power button and the shutter button but other than that its very simple. Also the photos come out awesome!","Arrived on time, easy to get started, works perfectly!","So glad that i splurged and got this for myself. I love taking photos of my family and having the picture pop out right away. So much fun.","Cute, fun camera.  Pictures small, tho.","Not the best quality pictures but fun to have.","I love my camera ! It's cute and handy ! Very fun to take pictures ! And the picture quality is surprisingly very good ! Would recommend if you want cute Polaroid pictures !","Love it","Im in love, it was just what I want, Its fun, Its so good for those moments you want to save or give to someone, its really nice and simple to use. I really love my new toy!  the pictures have a perfect size (like a credit card size) and its really nice to open a conversation... hope you like it and enjoy it! (( ohhh the yellow is like a pastel yellow... but it so cute! ))","Such a great time owning this camera. Film can be a bit pricey but always buy it online ahead of time and you're good.","Film sheets are pretty pricey...","Absolutely love this product!! Such a fun way to capture moments, only down fall is the film is pretty expensive so you really have to use it wisely!","I bought this because of the color. (Yellow's my favorite.) But it has no film. I should have known.","Luv luv luv this camera!! Very happy with purchase and seller. :)","This was a birthday gift for a friend. I was really looking forward to him taking pictures as soon as he received it. But there were no batteries in the box. So disappointed","My graham daughter loves it.","Bought for 10 year old and they loved it.  Having a lot of fun snapping pictures.  Pictures are clear and although they are smaller than the original instant cameras it is still fun to get the picture right away and see it develop.  Very happy with the purchase.","12 year old granddaughter loves the camera","My new toy! I brought this with me to my grandaughter's kindergarten graduation. The pictures turn out great. All her friends wanted me to take their pictures. They were thrilled to go home with one!","Bought for my 13-year-old granddaughter for her birthday!  She absolutely loves it.","Love it!! It's so perfect! Thank you so much! I recommend this to everyone who wants something vintage yet with a modern twist. Definitely something worth investing in!","Perfect and beautiful camera.","Bought this for my daughter, she is absolutely in love with it.","Awesome","My wife loves it! The pictures actually look awesome! It has an old school feel like the old Polaroids I have in my photo album. My only advice is to take the photos pretty close as portraits so you can fill the frame. The picture frames are long and narrow. Fun camera though! Have fun!","Received my camera today! I love it lol. I remember I didn't understand why there was even a white camera but it's actually the cutest one to me. It's the real deal too with the correct \"instead mini 80\" logo. I keep staring at it and it came with a strap which I didn't know was included.","It's a nice cool camera. The only problem I have is that the number on the back is always on zero, so I don't know how much film I have left.","Although this is the color camera I wanted, like everyone else said there is no selfie mirror on it. I'm not too mad because the camera is so awesome, but they need to change the picture here!!!","Love this camera; lots of fun!  Works great, but getting the exposure right can be tricky. I took this on the beach in bright sunlight and took a picture on the lowest exposure setting and the image was over exposed.  As to be expected with instant film cameras, the quality of the photos is poor, but I feel that's part of the fun!  As long as the exposure is correct and you're not too close to the subject, the subject will be in focus.  Great little camera, but don't expect it to produce quality photographs.","Delivered quickly.  Takes great pictures.","As other reviewers have mentioned, there is not a \"selfie\" mirror attached.  My granddaughter, who I got the camera for, says that is always an extra attachment.<br />She loves the camera.<br />The directions with installing the film need to be much clearer for someone inexperienced with instant cameras. She exposed two pictures trying to get the film into the camera.  Be careful and do NOT remove the cover.  Once the film cartridge is in the camera and the door is closed, the cover will be ejected and you will not have wasted a picture.<br />Also, do realize that this is a fun camera and the pictures really are about the size of a credit card.","I gave it to my friend's kids as a gift. They loved it. It is very easy to use and very cute. I loved pink color.","Great purchase! I love it!!!!!","It's exactly what I ordered and wanted! It's so cute, and so happy to finally have it.","my daughter loves it.","Granddaughter loves it. Everything was what it advertised.","CUTEST THING I'VE EVER BOUGHT EVER!!!! Working fine!! I wish I could give this 10 stars. Plus, best price. No chance I would've paid 100 dollars at urban outfitters! I love it! Definitely recommend it! Worth every penny","1. It resembles a pig  which to me is my spirit animal.<br />2. I love taking pictures and sharing them on social media<br />3. The camera is so affordable and easy to use","Really happy with this purchase. I've always wanted a instant camera and now I have one. Great for making memories. Came in perfect condition. Don't even think twice about this bc it's amazing.","Exactly the way it was described","This is so awesome to see back in action.  The camera shots great little versions of the Polaroid I remember as a kid.  Love to see my daughter enjoying it!","I received my camera in perfect condition promptly on the expected delivery date! As long as you make sure not to expose the film after you've installed it and use the recommended setting, this takes pretty good pictures! I like that the photos are clear while still having a retro look. The film is rather expensive, so you wouldn't want to get too snap happy with it but it's great for special occasions, vacations, or being out with friends and family.<br /><br />One thing that could be negative for some buyers is that the camera I received did not come with a \"limited edition selfie mirror\" as advertised in the description. This could have to do with which seller fulfills your order though. Mine was through Good Luck Bargains. I'm still giving 5 stars though because I chose this camera for the color rather than the mirror. Overall a great purchase that I'm looking forward to using!","The best camera! Such a party hit and takes great quality pictures.","Love it","I LOVE this camera!! I've had it for about 2 months now and have taken about 50 pictures. Only 1 came out too dark but I think it had more to do with the sunlight and not the camera though. Great investment for instant memories.","In love!","Great","It's good!!","??","Perfect timing and product","Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it!! Polaroid still rocks in this digital age.","no selfie mirror as other reviews mentioned.  I wasn't as disappointed since I read previous reviews but that's still unfair to advertise as such. Overall camera takes good pictures-  still learning the settings as some pictures some out too dark or too light.","really nice camera!!","Bought as a gift for a 15 year old.  Loves it!  No end of fun taking pictures.<br />The camera is very light and sturdier than it appears to be.<br />Have experienced no problems with photo quality.","Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she has beyond loved it. It works without a problem and is very easy to use. Overall a great Polaroid camera and I would gladly recommend it!","I love this camera. Strated showing it off and now everyone of y cousins and aunts are buying it. Great to capture memories which are created everyday.","Daughter loved it. The pictures are clear and smaller than the old Polaroids - wallet sized. She had fun getting instant pix of friends at a party.","Works great!","This is one of the most fun cameras I have ever used (and I have used the original polaroids from way back).  The pictures are very small but you can capture a lot on such a small frame.  I get this camera out at family gatherings and give the photos away as people are leaving.  Often when I visit their houses, I see those photos on display up on their refrigerators and bulletin boards!","Got this for my daughter for her 14th Birthday. She loves it! easy to use and pictures come out pretty good for such a little camera. Only complain is that I find the film to be expensive. she went trough the first 50 quiet fast!","TOTALLY LOVE THE CAMERA!!! 100% brand new and easy to use. It also came super fast, I got it like 4 days after placed the order. True color just like in the pictures. I recommend this :)))","This camera is small and easy to carry around. I love the pictures that come out! However, remember that this is a mini so the pictures come out smaller than normal Polaroid pictures. I love my camera so far and have had no issues with it!","Another thing that I bought for my daughter's 15th birthday, aside from the film being a bit costly she loves it!","the pictures were so much smaller than I was expecting, and for a 'mini' camera, its actually awkward and larger than a digital one","It is a great camera and the color is very very nice. I loved it! It was love at first sight. Don't be fooled by the selfie mirror... it does not come with it , but to be honest I don't think it is needed. This camera is amazing just how it is and I will definitely recommend anyone to buy it. I'm so in love!!!","This little camera is great fun!  It takes clear pictures of people and is perfect for what we need.","Easy to go camera for instant developed pictures.","Always wanted to own a polaroid camera. I have long admired the stylistic choices of the olden days, where it was less about post-processing and when it was more about making and framing a good shot. There's something that is truly charming about those simpler days. It felt more authentic also.","good product, great price","Best thing I've ever purchased! Totally worth the money!!","very good product","My son, in high school LOVES it!","I love the size of it and the colour! It works well in cloudy weather and indoors!","Instant fun","Love It","Awesome!","it was intended as a gift for a child moving up her school career. it was received with great anticipation. I imagine it works well as I have not received any complaints; just salutations and kind words. thank you for making this possible.","this camera is so easy to use and so much fun.  it's nice to have photos print automatically, and write messages on the bottom.<br />100% get it!","I really love this camera! While I will take a star away since the camera I received did not have the selfie mirror, I ordered it only for the color. Which, also, was not a bright red but more of a pale red/dark pink. I love it all the same and shipping was fast. :)","So in love. I think it's worth every dollar. I've taken some shots already and they have come out great. It was delivered to my job and so everyone was super excited to take pictures with it and loved it! I'm so pleased!","Just by luck, I've bought the package for the strap mainly. Camera has NO FILM . Seller should have made a note to buyer. Warning. Very Deceptive.","as described","So much fun!!  I love this camera!!","I love it","My 14 year old daughter loves this camera! The instant pictures are a hit at her gatherings! Quality is not great but the kids don't care - they love watching the pictures develop. Just a fun item!","Love love love it. Fits perfectly in my purse arrived quickly and heads up DONT SHAKE THE PHOTO!! That's where the negative reviews for ink running are coming from. Quit that.","My little one love it!","Took a long time to get to me but totally worth the wait","This was a birthday present. It was a big hot and takes great pictures!","Who would have known that this would make a comeback? I didn't either. I bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. Her and I both use it whenever we go out with a bunch of friends. It's very convenient when we take a groupie (group selfie). Because of its capability to instantly print out photos, Fujifulm instax film camera made it my to-go camera every time I go out. The sad part is that I never have a copy for myself since everyone always wants a copy. Here is my review after 6 months of usage:<br /><br />Usability: 9/10<br />Plug and play<br /><br />Affordability: 6/10<br />I remember when cameras like these were less than $50 back in the day, the 90's.<br /><br />Convenience: 9/10<br /><br />This camera definitely makes a great gift if you are planning to buy it for a friend, girlfriend, white-elephant or even for nostalgic value. You will definitely have a lot of fun and get noticed.","This camera is awesome! Not only is it perfectly priced, but so is the film (you have to buy this separately). There's a variety of accessories you can get with this camera, such as stickers, cases, selfie-mirrors, the list goes on. This camera came in on-time with my selection of the FREE 2-Day Shipping. The only down side is that most of the writing in the papers that come with the camera are in a language that isn't english. There is a photo description on how to use it and how to put the film into the camera, not to mention that you can take around 100 photos with the same batteries.<br /><br />Overall, this camera is definitely a great product; it's a must have!<br /><br />(I would not recommend this product for children under 10 years of age, due to the price of the camera, and the specifics needed to do to take a photo. Also, the film is cheap, but a child of this age or under may run through the film much faster, and would waste it.)","Makes for a great nostalgic gift. The pictures are small, smaller than a Polaroid used to be but the technology is similar, it's easy to use and makes for a fun gift!<br /><br />It's very Point and Shoot and the pictures look good. Almost like they have an Instagram Filter.","I love it","Bought it as a birthday present, made a great gift and the birthday girl loved it.","Absolutely LOVE IT!!!!","I bought one for me and I love to play with the camera and I bought one as a gift for my friend. She also loved!!","the product is wonderful! it was packaged in a very secure manner. However, I do have one problem with the camera itself. When i change the lighting setting, the light that indicates which mode you are on does not switch. I cannot tell if it is working or not :/","This is a cute camera. I love that it takes a few min and then you have the picture! One thing that I figured out from reading other reviews is that it suggests the setting your in when you turn the camera on by a small orange light however you can choose whatever setting you would like. Its very easy to use and pretty lightweight as well. One down side to bringing this to events and parties is that people are going to want the pictures that you take!","I had been wondering if something like this would be useful. With a combination of coupons and a little birthday cash, I finally bit the bullet and bought it. We love this little thing! It's easy to use and the photos come out very cute. We bought some of the cute little books that the photos go in and are enjoying the novelty. There's something to be said for aiming, shooting, and not being able to just redo it a hundred times until you get just the right photo. You get what you get, or you pay another dollar for a redo! That is the one downfall, the film is expensive! $.73 is as cheap as I've found per shot. Worth it for the occasional shot. I also ordered the printer for those times I do want to print a photo I took digitally. I can't wait to try that out! So far, so good.","Love the camera! If you are thinking about getting it- then get it. It as so worth the price.","well functioning product","I really like it.","My granddaughter loves it,,, perfect for younger kids for sure","Very fun and works well. However film is in my opinion expensive.","Nice and fun for a gift, but not the best way to store memories","i loved loved loved this Polaroid camera so convenient !! i had it for over a year now i gave it to my sister since she loved it too i like the quality of the pictures as well totally want the wider version of this too!!!","Had this for almost a year and got it as a personal bday gift to myself. Honestly the best little machine to carry around and to parties. Blows peoples minds!","It is easy to work. It is so awesome when u r creating a photo book. I love it","I just wanna say that I love this! It came in just a week and I just take pictures of everything. I even took a pic of my door and let me just say that this camera just made my door look like an awesome door. Film is very expensive so I suggest not taking a pic of ur door unless u have a nice door like me. duhh... I love this camera and hope you found this helpful! :)","It came in really fast I love it!! It also came a week earlier!! All of my friends got them too cause they love taken pictures!!","This was gift for my daughter in law. She loves it. So easy to use. Great quality of pictures.","Great product. I like it. Thumbs up! ","Love this camera. No complaints.","Fun little camera! A cute gift idea!","Love the camara my sister is happy with them. Thanks so mucho","Showed up in time and works great!","Wife loves it for our little ones pics so much fun!","I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE my Instax Mini.  Great price from Amazon, and I use this camera ALL THE TIME.  So many other people have also fallen in love with my camera and have wanted to purchase their own.  It is honestly one of my all-time favourite purchases <3","Just perfect!!! So cute and useful ?","good quality for price.  a little smaller than expected, but it works for the gift that it was given for.","Really into the vintage polaroid trend you can see making the rounds in social media. Love this!","I love this camera so much! Some may complain about the size of the photos, but I like that these pictures are wallet size. That way I can easily carry it with me in my wallet if I wanted to.","Good deal, what I expected, delivered timely.","I absolutely love the camera! So satisfied with the photos I took, it works perfectly.<br />BUT it's NOT as red as it seems. I'd say it's actually PINK. Got really disappointed about that, but overall, Instax Mini 8 is amazing.","My daughter got this 2 years ago, she still takes pictures with it all the time. Great gift for teens!","Bought this one as a present to my niece who loves taking photos. She's been using it for three months now and the polaroid is still as good as new. It snaps good pictures and the resolution is also okay.","Really fun and really cute. A little bulky since we have all gotten used to tiny cameras, but it heist we love it.","I wish the color was whiter, it is a slight creamy white color. But it takes great pictures and it is easy to use. :)","Very good product and seller. Trust!","I bought this as a gift for my 8 year old niece. Yes there are a few functions but after an explanation from my sister on how to use it she's using it with ease. There are super cute film packs available for this camera with cute designs my niece liked. It's a nice throwback to Polaroids and the instant gratification of the picture is such a thrill for her (and me!). Awesome little camera.","It got delivered earlier than expected which is always good. It was just how i expected it to be very cute and easy to use.","This camera is really cute. I love it.","I am disappointed because the instruction manual and photo book that were supposed to be in the box were not there.","absolutely IN LOVE with my new toy :). Easy to use. Great pics. lots of fun.","Great for shots up close. I purchased to use at school for the kids to have pictures right away. The kids love it! The quality of the pictures is about what you expect from a Polaroid. The film can get expensive fast especially if you are used to taking lots of shots on a digital camera.","Purchased for my 7 year old son. He absolutely loves it. Great old skool product with modern day technology. Pictures print right away. It's really cool to look at the picture as it develops. Fun and light weight. Seems durable as well. Happy customer.","best purchase ever","My daughters, ages 11 and 13, were so thrilled about this camera.  It takes some practice to shoot these right and unfortunately, the film is pricey, but worth it to get a unique experience.  It is fun and fairly easy.  I got them each one, and they could choose their favorite color which made it more fun.","Surprised that it takes decent photos","Great products.","My Granddaughter loves it!","Item delivered on time, was as described...Excellent!","I love my instax mini!","Awesome product i enjoy taking pictures with some close friends and girlfriend that perfectly fits in your wallet... I'm a person who travels a lot around America (south & north) and these small pictures let me take some owesome moments with me... Also girls feel really attracted to these stuff (they love pictures) xD","Girlfriend loved it! Thanks guys.","excellent purchase.  great birthday present.","My daughter loves this camera, im getting one for my nephew as well!","https://youtu.be/9HjqsRLc9-k Was a amazing video on how to use this camera I 'it !! I got my film on sale for $8 for a 10 pack !! Love the camera not too heavy ! The 4 settings are indoor ,cloudy , little sun ,and sunny then high key but I don't ever use it . The camera uses double a batteries again it's awesome the video gives you sooooo many tips I recommend you to see it","Great item arrived in time","very good","Perfect. Everything I expected.","BUY THIS","Just be careful if you take pictures outside in the summer because your pictures could get over-developed in the heat. Otherwise it's great after you figure it out.","The camera is a lot lighter than I expected which is great because I'll be taking it to Thailand, love how a set of batteries came with it, but I didn't know the film wouldn't come so I'll have to buy that but its a great product! Thank you!","AMAZING! Came in great time, and packaged very well.","Definitely one of my guilty pleasures in life is taking pictures and I love doing so with this camera. I like taking pictures of my husband and kids. The polaroid camera is very easy to use and once you get the proper lighting and all, you'll get nice pictures.  This is a good camera.","my 12yr old grand daughter absolutely loved receiving this camera for her birthday and had so much fun using it at her birthday sleepover party.","This camera is awesome! It's so easy to use and takes great pictures. I love it! The color is spot on. It's just perfect and cute.","Loved it!! Its the perfect gift","Good","love it ! Its definitely worth getting but if you could invest for a intax mini 90, you should get that one instead.<br />I'm overall happy with what I got except I'd like to take photos on a nice sunny day and the film turns out either too bright or completely white because its way to bright outside. I say a good photo would be from a \" home\" to a \" sunny\". not the last tab on the view set buttons.<br />it takes really good vintage looking pictures but not on a bright day where the sun is hitting it.","My granddaughter literally beged for this camera soI bought it for her 12th birthday gift.  She loves it. I was a bit skeptical because of some of the reviews so I purchased the warranty also.  I used my Amazon Prime and the shipment was received very quickly, well packed and intact.  It's been 3 weeks and 4 film packs and it works beautifully.  The photos aren't lab quality but they are good.  The instructions were easy enough for a 12-yr old to get the camera up and running all by herself.  She is thoroughly enjoying this camera.  I'm really glad I purchased it and would recommend it to anyone.  Hope this review helps if you're straddling the fence on whether to purchase it.","Fun, cute camera! Purchased this for my 12-year-old daughter as a Christmas present as she had placed it on her wish list. Takes fun mini Polaroid pics that remind me of my youth. ;) She loves taking it to sleepovers.","Great camera. Fun to have for projects and one of a kind shots. Our family loves the vintage- esk feel of the pictures.","My daughter loves her camera.","Oh my goodness. Where do I start with this camera. I have been looking online for the past three months in search of an Instax Mini 8. I visited Urban Outfitters, seeing that their cameras were over 100 dollars! The same goes for Michael's. Even EBay had expensive cameras ranging (for a new camera) from 80-100 dollars. When I found this camera, the fact that it was only $69 was shocking. I love it so much. All of my expectations that I had been building up from the videos and reviews on it were actually true! I also recommend 100% buying the film on Amazon too, because places other than Amazon are very overpriced, and can be roughly a dollar per picture! I bought a 2 pack for only $16!!! I love this camera and recommend it to anyone who was like me and obsessing over it!<br />P.S.....<br />I have friends that have the blue and yellow ones, and my favorite is the pink(:","Great","My daughter absolutely loves it. She takes photography at school and likes to have different mediums (not just digital phone pics).","i loveeeeeeeee it, its really cute and easy to use","Cute as a gadget camera","I bought 2 of these for my wedding for our Photo Guest book. Took a few trial photos and they look great so far, however I am really into vintage looking pictures so if you are looking for sharp clarity you may want something else. These are so fun though and I love them!","i received this camera yesterday and have been snapping away ever since. The pictures are way better quality than I had expected and the use of the camera itself takes me back to the days of Polaroids! I love this camera and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, good quality instant camera.","Grandaughter loved it","My daughter likes it.. And now I will order again for my youngest,same product but just different color.","??","My daughter loves this- so fun for her!","Fun color and I got it on sale.  Works great. Younger kids love seeing their picture appear.","Works great and is a lot of fun!","Got it for my daughters birthday and she loved it.","I LOVE this camera. I've been using it for 6 months and it is amazing. I take it on road trips and hiking. My friends always love that i can pull out the picture and hand it to them. I don't like that the flash always fires but i can block it with my finger or something else. These pictures are the perfect size. I do think the film is a bit expensive but i bought a pack of 50 and have used about 34 of them. There is definitely some trial and error. Sometimes i forget to change the light settings and sometimes i miss what i was shooting...oops. It takes some time but its fun to see how they will turn out. I'm very happy with all my photos and really glad i bought this camera. Its well worth it.","I got this camera for my wife to use as a casual camera. She uses it often and I love the size of the Polaroids. Very neat!","This camera is a huge hit among everybody. These aren't very common anymore so it's nice to have one. The quality is great, and I personally like that the pictures come out kind of small. Only negative I have is that the film is rather expensive, but it is worth it to have these hard copies instead of all digital.","i will take this with me one trip every time!","These things are soo cute you<br />couldn't even believe it and there<br />so easy to use also cause there soo<br />small you can carry them around any<br />place.??","Great camera, see my full review here http://youtu.be/O1Y1_fEI1VI","I got the wrong camera color. I ordered the white one but got the blue one.","I bought this camera on Monday and received it in 3 days. I've taken a couple of pictures and they've turned out good. You have to get used to setting the brightness adjustment so that your picture isn't too light or too dark. Overall, I'm pleased with my camera and I'm glad that it shipped quick! This is definitely a 5 star product.","I love it! I was fairly suprised that it delivered so quick to my house. I had the batteries on their wrong side so make sure you put them in correctly or else you'll be like me freaking out why it's not working. Took a test run and it was amazing. It's cute, small and has that grunge effect. Overall happy with this product.","Nice camera and takes great pictures","Got this for my teenage daughter and she loves it.","Such a great price! Comes in the original packaging.","Fun for quick moments, not much control over the images.<br /><br />Dropped it once from 3 1/2 feet in the air and it's done for, so the stability of the design is poor.<br /><br />Getting a Neo Classic instead so I can have more control","Fun and easy to use. Takes great pictures","It's fun but beware, if you buy this, you're going to spend lots on film! but it's fun and cute so...that's what makes it popular, instant picture.","Fun camera and a good gift idea.","Cute & fun camera, perfect for my 8 year old's journal.","It's so nice to have an instant memory to keep forever and this is exactly what this camera gives you. Although quite expensive, you can buy decent digital point and shoots for this price, the novelty of instantly having the snap to put in your wallet or photo album is great. The pink, which I bought, is a lovely pastel pink although I wish I had bought the white one I can't fault it. It's clearly marketed at the asian market however I think any creative person or photography lover would absolutely adore this little camera. It's a little large but still handbag sized. Yes, the film is very expensive, but film has always been expensive and probably always will be. The pictures are the perfect size for your purse or wallet, make a nice gift inside a card or photo album/scrap book and come out clear, good quality, but with a vintagy polaroid feel. I love my instax mini 8 and will use it forever.","Cutest camera ever - and takes really good pictures - very easy to use also.","Bought as a gift and my wife loves it! she uses this more than her iphone to take pictures.","I love my new Polaroid! Although not easy to carry around, it is super cute and pictures have turned out great!","Fantastic. I love the pink color. I wish it wouldn't always use the flash. It's difficult to take outdoor pictures during the day without the photo developing weird.","Great little camera. The color is so cute.","was a gift","Granddaughter just got her package and she is so excited to start taking pictures!","As a few other have commented, I also didn't received the camera that is in the picture. I received the same one in color without the selfie mirror and the close up lens. I was really disappointed when I opened the package and my camera wasn't the special edition but the normal one. Nevertheless, I really love the raspberry color and it's really fun to use it so I'm going to keep mine. All my instructions were in Chinese. The box included the batteries and strap.","Great camera for my daughter, she loves it","I love the camera, but the film tends to be on the more expensive side.","good product","So much fun","I absolutely love this camera. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because no film or batteries come included. The other thing was that the camera is over priced. At Walmart, the same camera in white is about $20 less than this one.","I purchased this camera for my daughter for her sixteenth birthday several months ago.  She really likes the camera and it is small enough that she carries it with her everywhere in her purse.  Her friends all love it when she pulls out the camera, takes a photo and moments later has a picture.  It is fun watching them be so impressed with something old that is new again.  She has taken at least 100 pictures and has not had to replace the batteries yet and the quality of the pictures continues to be the same as the first pictures that she had taken.  The downside is that the film is slightly pricey (around $38 for 50 pictures), so keep that in mind when purchasing the camera.  But, it is worth it to me since she enjoys it so much.  It is also fun to see all the pictures that she has taken and she proudly displays many of them on her desk and nightstand.","Perfect","The way that i expect","This is a great camera, shipping was as told and seller sent them asap, it takes pretty lousy pictures and doesn't focus at all. This is definitely a novelty camera and if you want good pictures with polaroid, i would invest in the neo 90 camera. Overall this is very easy and fun to use, and i really love it. I actually think that the pictures come out better and more vintage looking out of focus. I got it in pink, but it got very old, very quick. Even if you like pink, like i do, get black or white to make sure you will always like it.","This camera is....how can I put this, this camera made me want to visit the galaxy and gave me the courage to face and fight thanos the mad titan, who has murdered fellow comrades. The battle was fierce And treacherous But after a few deathly blows the camera gave me the power to defeat and destroy The mad titan! Nah jk no one can beat that beast....but we did have tea....this camera rocks my socks.","excellent","Pictures are more vibrant than I ever could have expected as a photographer.","My daughter loves this camera. It's great. Brings back old memories.","Love the camera. Wish it came with batteries included but still great and super cute!","excellent easy to use fun camera","I love it!!!","Absolutely love it! It takes great pictures but be mindful of the sun whenever outdoors as photos can turn out with too much light.<br />Easy to load the films and even  easier to use.<br /> Item arrived one day after the expected delivery date.","love love love","Super cute! I cant wait to start taking pictures!","I gave this to my younger sister as a gift and she loved it. Can't blame her though because I fell in love with it too. Works well even if the lighting isn't so good.","Really good gift for my girlfriend, and receiving it was really quick!!! It was in perfect form and I recomend you buying here!!","Very happy with this product ....","Cute","SO CUUTE","MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT!  HAD IT FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW & IT WORKS GREAT.","I bought this model for the selfie mirror, but it did not come with a selfie mirror. The description clearly stated that it was a limited-edition raspberry instax mini 8 with a selfie mirror. It was disappointing but besides that, it is everything I thought it would be. I really enjoy the color of the camera.","Awesome camera! Love how easy it is to use and the various light settings. Used for my wedding day. The Polaroids are much smaller than the traditional Polaroids I grew up with. Overall though, very happy.","thank you for your atention","great, easy to use, fun for kids.  too expensive tho!","love it","Love it! Only downside is tah tis does not come with film, so you need to purchase it separately.","My 12 year old loves her camera.","My daughter loves this cute camera. Only downsides are the credit card sized prints and their ridiculous price.","Super fast shipping! Camera is exactly like pictured.","This was my daughter's big 10th birthday gift...she loves it and so do her friends and their parents. After whipping through the first pack of film (aka wasting it), she has become more responsible with only taking pictures of things that merit taking a picture.","I love it! Ordered it after seeing another friend use it and wanted my own. Really enjoying the retro pics that we get from it and it's fun seeing everything and just nice to have something more than just a digital copy on my phone or tablet. Have taken it on a trip to Italy and around locally and it's great! Just need to get used to the light settings to get the right look on photos...","i love it, its fast a bit tiny but overall i love it.","Best camera I've owned.","This camera is so much fun.  The yellow color almost makes you smile when you take the picture.  It is so bright and silly.  It reminded me of being a kid with the old Polaroid cameras.  I like that the photos come out looking vintage.  It was definitely worth the money!  The battery lasted longer than I imagined too! That was a great plus when I used it at my engagement party.  The film was easy to load, but good thing to know is that when you load the film the first \"picture\" is a blank.  Don't get worried when the photo doesn't develop!","HECK YA I LOVE IT","You get what you paid for","Having a polaroid camera is a childhood dream of mine and it became true after Instax. I can't get over its cuteness and pastel color but what really fascinates me about it the instant picture feature of it (of course that's a polaroid camera but still...) I loved it and I'm still loving it.","My daughter loved her camera. Very easy to use.","Such a fun camera. Got it for my wife for her birthday yesterday. We played around with it and pictures turned out crisp and vintage-like. Excited to try it out some more in the future. So much fun to have little polaroids as memories. Would recommend it to anyone.","Love it","It takes really cute pictures, but you need to be very careful with distance, lighting, etc. Also, I had a film jam half way through a pack of film, hope it doesn't happen again.","i bought this as a gift for my 15yr old daughter who loves anything and everything vintage and she has been longing for one of these she was really happy and the product is great just as described.","Cute","My daughter wanted an instant camera for her 19th birthday. After reading reviews I decided to go with this Fuji. Really, really cute ! The soft pink color gives it a nostalgic feel. The size of the developed picture is like a credit card. She loved it!","My granddaughter love her new camera. The service was great.","Love it! A little heavier than I expected it to be but it came quickly and packaged arrived undamaged.","my girlfriend simply loved it!","I, like many others according to the reviews, received the Instamax Mini 8 in raspberry that does not have a selfie mirror. When I decided between options, I also chose it because it was a unique color and also for the selfie mirror since that was the added bonus. Disappointed the product I received did not have that option as advertised.<br /><br />That being said, it's a fun, instant camera. Throw in the batteries that were included and a pack of film and fun will ensue. Overall, fun, inexpensive instant camera. Much better deal buying through Amazon than through outlets like Urban Outfitters, in every color.","Fujifilm has brought back the nostalgia of having instant photos at your fingertips. The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera is light-weight and affordable compared to other instant film cameras. Polaroids in general have returned to the market with the pop culture movement for instant photos, however Polaroid cameras and the film are far from affordable. The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera provides all the fun and nostalgia of a Polaroid, but at a fraction of the cost. I have used three sleeves of film and have not experienced any problems with the camera itself. It is ergonomic and because it suggests which setting to use based on lighting, it makes photography fun for the little ones as well! While I tend to protect all photography equipment, this camera does tend to scratch due to the plastic body, but the camera function and mechanisms are unscathed. I searched several sites and did a lot of research before deciding on purchasing from this Amazon seller. The product was shipped quickly and was well protected from the negligence of deliverymen. I would purchase from this seller again, and I recommend the Fujifilm Instax 8 Mini Instant Film Camera to all photography novices and instant film enthusiasts.","Such a beautiful camera, loved the color, loved the photos but i must say that no all of the photos get revealed, some of them stay white idk why.","We loved it .. I used it  for my son birthday party, and it was a blast. We had a photo booth and mini camera was perfect for that and the picture we gave them away..","Absolutely the cutest camera ever! It was a present for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it. Easy to use and takes great Polaroid style pics.","Awesome","My daughter loves it","Was a gift and far as I know she loved it.","Great fun and for keepsake photos. Got this and the film for my daughter's bridal shower and bachelorette party. Would recommend","Easy to use, good quality and a lot of fun, brought back a lot of memories from old Polaroid","Great  product !!! It takes good picture and cute looking... Using this to my baby... Taking pictures monthly and posting it in his walls","Came in early. The package is great. The color baby blue is beautiful.","fast shipping, great product we love it","love it! Sure the pictures aren't PERFECT or focused well but if you're a fan of old school pics, this is exactly what you get! Having fun taking pictures while sharing them with family and friends. It's just something about how the picture comes out that gives you a warm feeling. I also recall that many people suggest to angle the camera in a certain way so it can be centered but so far my view lens is pretty accurate every time. Not sure if this is a newer model?","it's super cute! easy to use! totally worth it!","WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS CAMERA!? It is simple A-MA-ZING! I love it! Super easy to use, very cute, light weighted!","Nice camera and color, good choice for a girlfiriend gift","This cameras is excellent. It's great for art projects, which is exactly why I purchased it. It'll also make for great lasting memories. Although it's probably easier and faster to snap photos with your phone it still isn't as fun and cool as having small instant photos to carry around. It's definitely an attention grabber, but better yet a conversation starter. I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a camera out of the ordinary and fun. You can also purchase the film relatively cheap on Amazon, which I suggest buying in bulk as it's more economical and you'll run through a roll pretty quick.","I loved the camera. It was a present for my younger sister takes great pictures. Its a cute gift, very thoughtful and creative.","My daughter loves it, but the quality of the photos isn't great","bought for my daughter as a gift....she loved it!!","Bought this for my 12 year old daughter. She adores it! Very simple to use.","This camera is great.  Love being able to get pictures right when I take them.  Kids love this camera.","Loved","Came in less then a week! I'm already very satisfied with my camera! Works great!","This little gadget is great for fun nights with friends thank you.","My daughter loves this camera! Instant prints are a plus.  The only problem is that even with the sunlight settings, everything is still a bit washed out. Cloudy days are great!","Although the film is extremely expensive, it was totally worth it! The pictures come out so clear and vibrant!","Good camera to play and take funny pictures. But dont expect great images from it.","I love it!!!! Takes me back in time","I got everything I ordered just when I was supposed to! 2 day shipping worked great and nothing came broken or defected. Love it.","Awesome","My daughter loved this when she first got it.  Like all things, it's in the closet now among the dust and shadows.  Good thing maybe because the film was so expensive.  Good for parties to take pictures and let the guests take the photos home right away.","This is one of my most favorite purchases that I've made in a LONG time... I just took my first couple of photos and they turned out absolutely amazing and I am in love with this camera! It takes amazing pictures and they are so cute I cannot wait to start collecting more and more photos to use in scrapbooks, home decor, and little photo albums. Super happy! <3","These are so fun. I love it!","I love this camera its so much fun","Love it!?","My daughter loves this.","Works perfectly! I love it so much!","Good!","Its perfect, its portable and just amazing","It works really well it was a big hit at the party","LOVE IT! Took it to a weddnig and got tons of compliments on it. People were asking about it and where I got it from. Even better I got it a day before I was expecting to. So happy I made this purchase!","Came sooner than expected and it works fantastically.  I love this camera so much.","sooo cute. i decorated mine with puffy molang stickers :)","Takes great photos","Gift for our daughter she loves her camera.","Great gift for a 13 year old girl!  She loves it!  I believe her mom said that she squealed when she opened up her gift.  I am very happy and she is too.","Love my instax camera. It's easy to use and love the photos it takes. Great for parties and scrapbooking.","I loved all of these products","good deal and works well","BE WARNED: If you use this outside you have to cover the flash, and even that only works in overcast conditions. I used in the daytime and covered the flash, set it to the daylight setting, and my photos were just white (meaning way overexposed). :(","Its a great camera and its really cute you can take it anywhere. Its very easy to use as well.","Nice","On time and great thanks","Works great!  We will be using this for a wedding to take a picture of all of the guests for the bride and groom to have instead of a sign in book!  We tried it out first and it worked perfectly!","Not the best, at least not for the money . The film is incredibly expensive so, it's more of a investment in the long run than now.","Love love love! Great way to make a photo album for my child when she gets bigger! Small cute Polaroids ;) worth the money!","Fun camera but not always great prints.  I'm still learning to use it though. Great shipping and got it when they said I would.","It's  perfect.","My best friend used her blue camera with me and it was fun, so I just had to buy a pink one for myself!  It came with the wrist strap and it's easy to use. Takes great photos indoors and outdoors!  The price is worth it because I've seen it in stores for over $100.  And I received this quicker than expected, right before my birthday.  :)  It is perfect in every way. Highly recommend this purchase.","Camera is cute, not too different from the other ones in my opinion, but the mirror is really helpful when taking photos. The color is really nice in person too, but not as bright as what the picture shows.","My daughter loves it. It's easy to use and looks good too","It's so cute. Too bad it doesn't come with film","Love my camera ... Easy to use, perfect for capturing any moment worth remembering. Very cute color... Overall a great product","Excellent product!","Nice","Really a cute camera! I use it in my daily life when hang out with my friends.","It came it late which was super upsetting but I love it. It was in great condition and looked lovely","so happy with my purchase! :)","I bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it simple it works great and shipping was faster than what originally  said","This is so great once you know how to manipulate it to take better pictures ( like, when your outside, cover up the flash). The photos are crystal clear, very sharp, better quality than your iPhone. Since it's so unpredictable, there may be times where  the photos don't come out well but everyone who buys this knows that you're taking a bet and it's totally worth it! I use this camera everyday and it's so special and dear to my heart, I would definitely suggest buying it :)","Awesomee!! Love it the camera!!","I love this!","I am very concerned about the moisture in the box...It wasn't raining or anything it as just there (just kidding it's a awesome camera)","All the pictures come out dark. No instructions on how to change or fix that. Info it comes with doesn't tell you about the features.","MY FAVORITE!","In a world...of digital cameras, sometimes total retro-analog-only one is a nice balance.  I loved the instant cameras growing up. The last one I got some years ago went \"away\" when no film was available. It only did stickers but they were such fun to add in mail, in art, etc. These seem to be used by a lot of young girls and for weddings but the minute I show these to fellow artists they run out and get one. I adore mine. I justified it by wanting to do an art install.  So okay, I'll get around to it sooner or later.  Meanwhile I'm having fun.","My daughter loves this machine. Product name is excellent great purchase","I'm happy with it, thx!!","This is probably my favorite investment this year. My boyfriend and I bought this as something fun to do while we traveled to Asheville, NC. Not only did we love taking photos for ourselves, but we also loved seeing the surprise and joy on people's faces when we offered to take an instant photo of them. It was a great way to document our trip and start conversations with locals. Now my boyfriend and I take the camera everywhere. The quality of the photos is amazing for what it is. It just takes a while to figure out the appropriate light settings above the lens. Word of wisdom - DO NOT \"shake it like a polaroid\" - it is so tempting, I know...","My kid loves this camara","Daughter loved the camera.","ok","We love this camera! The prints are smaller than the old fashion Polaroid pictures, but they come out very clear. It's easy to operate and is a hit at all our gatherings!","I bought this camera in yellow because yellow is probably the silliest color you could get it in.  It looks like a child's toy camera, the kind that is designed to be chunky so that a child's stupid little hands could grab ahold of it and take a poorly composed photograph of an annoyed cat.  This is my level of skill when it comes to photography so it's pretty much right for me.  The pictures come out pretty well as long as you've got the correct light setting picked out, which is pretty simple to do.  Get this if you're just in it to have fun at parties with a dumb camera, not if you're some serious artist trying to make a statement.","Cute camera","Absolutely love this camera! I bought it for my lady and it's exactly what she wanted as far as an instant print camera goes (:","I love it! Got here pretty quick too!","just love this little camera comes in handy for those times you just need a picture now so easy to use and perfect for my scrapbooking","excellent","I felt in love with this camera. Is a little big but I like the pictures it takes. They have the vintage look. Very easy to set up and use.","My 12 yr old daughter loves her camera.. Got 2 from family she keeps one in her back pack.. already started an album of pics...","My daughter said this is a fun camera. Who knew that old fashion film like a poloroid would make a comeback","Perfect!!! Very simple to use and extremely cute","My wife has fallen in love with this camera. She takes client pictures and this helps keep it fun and light. The instant gradification factor is the big upside here. The picture are clear and the different boarders add variety to the film packs. On time shipping and great packaging too.","Great camera. Love the size of the pictures and the ability to have them right away.","Bought it for my niece and she loves it!  Nice price not pics.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the film is pricey.  Nevertheless it's perfect for a teenager.","I purchased this camera for my fiancé and she instantly fell in love with it!","Very good my sister loved and works like a charm thank you","GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT. JUST LIKE THE OLD POLAROID ONLY TINY PICTURES.","Exactly as stated. Fast Delivery!","the quality was very impressive.  i love it.  my bar standards are very high. i hardly ever give a 5 star.  so a 4 star from me means the product is great.","I bought this camera and it worked great the first time... But after that, the flash never went off, so unless you were outside on a really bright day, all of the pictures would turn out black. I wasted a ton of expensive film that didn't turn out. It was a bummer.  So I had to return it and get a new one. Hopefully it works better than the first one!","It is great","Obsessed with this camera, great price and so much fun to use","Daughter loves it, takes nice pictures and film is not too expensive.","bought for my teenage daughter.  so far she loves it. i wish the film were cheaper but that is the only con.  works great.","Absolutely love it. I've been using it for a few months now, very happy with my purchase.","Exactly as expected. Great quality. Would buy again! Wonderful color","Great!! Got it used but can't tell! The box was ripped but the camera looked brand new. I've been using it for 8 months now and it works perfectly! Would highly recommend. All my friends love it too.","Great camera. Good quality pictures. Loved it","I bought this for myself along with a 20 pack of film and a case. Camera takes adorable credit card photos with good but vintage looking quality. Make sure to read all the instrunctions first, oh and it came withing TWO DAYS.","Love it","Packaging wasn't in English but it's all pretty much self explanatory! Everything else was perfect:)<br />Film not included.","Nice","This is an awesome camera.  It's so fun to take out and about - NO ONE prints photos anymore.  Guessing it's becoming more and more popular because I'm seeing the price of film increasing tremendously.  So will probably look for another film option, if there is one.  But definitely a good time!!","In love!","for a tricky tray basket","very cute and my 11 year old daughter loves it and so do I","perfection","I used the camera on my wedding to create a Photobook, everyone love it! The size and weight is perfect, you can carry the camera easily<br />Even when we used the camera during night, the flash and pics quality is good, was a great surprise.<br />The only thing is, the viewfinder its a bit small, so you need to get use to it.","Love it!!","great","really nice case for the money","Love my camera I've had it for months and it's still just as amazing as when I got it.","Love this camera! It was a huge hit at my daughters birthday party","My husband bought me this for Christmas off of Amazon and I absolutely love it. I asked for the light blue color but all the other colors are nice as well. It's a pretty good size,  I normally carry it around in my purse. You have to buy the film separately but you can order them in bulk off of Amazon. It is such a fun camera! The pictures are like small Polaroids, and there are places to write on them if you wish. Great for capturing memories. No complaints, it works well and has an adjustment for lighting. they also have books you can buy where you can put the pictures in. I would recommend this for anyone of any age.","Nice!","So much fun! Now I don't need to pay for a photobooth! All I'm gonna ask for my birthday now is for the mini film with polka dots.","Very excellent and fun to use","I bought this camera almost a year ago, and I have had so much fun with it! I've taken it with me on little vacations and to Disneyland. I really like the size, it fits in most of my bags. It is pretty durable, I've dropped it two or three times, and it still works the same. The color is true to the picture, and it's really easy to clean. There is a bit of a learning curve, so don't expect your first roll to all come out perfect. Film can be pricey, so buy in bulk, maybe the 50 pack? Wouldn't buy the 100 pack, because the film does expire. Don't buy the film from urban outfitters, it's a total rip-off. Everyone who sees is totally smitten with it, as am I. It's nice to have photos to actually hold on to, instead of just a quick snap on your phone that you never look at again.<br />Pros: durable, lightweight, so much fun!<br />Cons: Having to really value your film, like not taking a shot of literally everything, and trying not to give them away (it's hard, people love these things!)","This is one of my favorite things I defiantly recommend this camera mine has held up beautifully. Just make sure you do your research on it before you buy it because some people don't know how expensive the film is and/or don't know how to handle it (which isn't very hard if you watch a tutorial) and end up ruining their film.","The pictures turned out great and the camera is very easy to use.","Replacing the films get expensive","Awesome device and a great gift.","Bueno","LOVE THEM! SO CUTE!","Amazing","My daughter loves it!","I love this camera sooo much!everything is perfect exept the film are expensive but oh well its worth it anyways!","My friend loves it. I bought this for her birthday. The only issue is the instructions were, I guess in Japanese so she had to YouTube how to set it up. Overall she loves it!","takes great pictures","really love it.","Such a fun toy for my grown up life.","Rather bulky, pictures are small (about 3x5\") but the picture quality is very good.","Camera arrived sooner than expected! Camera is not small, but not too big. It is built well, durable and good quality. It takes me back to my childhood! The kids were surprised when the film popped up and they started to see the picture appear.  This is a camera will capture a lot of fun memories! I only wish the film was cheaper!","Good","i bought this as a gift and i have one. i love having it around and using it for parties or family get togethers. i buy the film in bulk on amazon.","Bought a couple of these for a NYE party and they were a huge hit! So much more phone than pics on your phone. They worked great, took decent pictures and withstood the abuse of multiple drops over the course of the night","Daughter loves it and uses it all the time. Great gift.","Good","is perfect.","Bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it! Works great! I would recommend buying a lot of film with it. We mostly use it to capture special occasions and such. I would recommend this to people of all ages because it is easy to use.","so cute love it","Great product","I was impressed. Loved it","Easy to use and works great","Love it. It's timeless. I want 23 more! haha!","Really cute!!! It would make a great Birthday gift for your girlfriend or daughter.","Great litte camera!","Birthday gift for daughter....very happy with this gift.","The best deal ever.","Absolutely love it!","Camera was a gift for an 18 year old and she loves it, but now i have to buy her a case!  She says it is fun to have and the film develops pretty fast and the picture quality is good.","I LOVE IT! Totally worth it! Every time I take pictures with it, people fall in love with it! Love how fast and easy it is!!","My granddaughter loved the camera and the accessory kit","This is an amazing little camera that is an homage to Polaroids of the past.  It is extremely easy to use and produces very nice images.  We recently had a baby so this is perfect for taking little photos and putting them on the wall, corkboard, fridge, wallets, etc.  The film is easy to load and the flash is quite efficient.  If you want to have something for instant cameras feel free to get this!  Everyone that sees us using it always compliments on how wonderful it is.","Súper good","Love it!  But the directions are in Chinese!!","Bought for my wife, she likes it but is use is not often given the ease and accessibility of a smart phone.","Super fun camera. My 13 year old daughter got it for a gift. She loves it. It has s learning curve, though. A couple times the picture got off center when she depressed the button to take a pic.","Love this little camera! It's easy to use, the picture quality is surprisingly good, and it's so much fun to play with!!","My daughter saved her money for this and was very happy with it!","I love it. It was just what I wanted. it fit all my requests and really easy to use.","sweet memory in Disney","A birthday gift for my daughter and she loves it !","Daughter loves taking photos and has enjoyed the camera so far...no issues, easy to use.","I loved the concept and thought about getting one of these for a year before I did it. I'm an avid journaler and wanted the pictures to add to them.  Sadly, I'm not impressed.  I've gone through my first box of film and got only 2 useable pictures for my journals.  In my opinion, the photos are not very clear, and every one comes out too dark no matter the setting.  No happy, I feel I wasted the money :(","Very fast shipment and very satisfied... This was a gift for someone and she absolutely loved it!!! Thank you :)","Love this camera so nice I'm<br /> Always taking pictures if my kids","I like it. It look pretty good.","Great instant film camera. Worked great for my reception and much less expensive than a photo booth.","First off, I didn't even know they still made Polaroid film cameras. Until I saw my sister-in-law with the pink one and that prompted me to do a little research. I got the yellow Instax Mini 8 as a Christmas gift last year and I absolutely love it! Do I think it should replace digital photos? No, but it's a fun and cute way to relive days gone by, especially if you're someone who likes showing off the kind of pictures you can take and you don't need to snap 10 photos in a burst just to get one that looks good.<br /><br />Now that being said, this is why I don't understand the people buying this camera as a gift for their 6 year olds and then complain over the price of the film. Of course it's going to be pricey when being used by someone who will go through an entire pack of film in roughly 90 seconds.<br /><br />Just because the technology is considered a relic by current standards doesn't mean it's best suited for the very young.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Small camera and therefore very suitable for taking it on trips and such.<br />Has just enough weight to it to imply it's well-made but not too heavy.<br />Batteries last a super long time...even the offbrand ones they send with the camera.<br />Despite complaints that pictures come out dark, I will try to elaborate: the background of indoor shots are indeed dark, but the focal point is bright and in focus. At least for me.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Honestly? Curbing the desire to take lots and lots of shots with it.<br /><br />And also, do yourself a favor and buy the accessory bundle that's sold right here on Amazon. For roughly $45, you get a case, mini photo album, selfie mirror and a few other little bits that make it a great deal.","This order was amazing! I use it with all my friends and they all love to watch the picture come out of the top and wait to see how the picture came out. And best of all they get to keep it! The product was perfect and came in wonderful condition.","The pictures are incredibly beautiful!","It's amazing, going to buy 2 more, hopefully a good price range like this blue one I bought.","So adorable and it works great.","Cool","Works great! Even better than what I had expected. The picture quality is good, can be a little less indoors, but still overall can't complain. The order arrived quick and I didn't have any problems.","It is good","Fantastic little instant picture camera. Receive many compliments on camera and pictures. Not light, has some weight to it meaning to me it's good quality. Works great. Bought color Pink and it's very feminine. Adult usage but child could definitely use also. Easy to use. Perfect purchase and much smaller than my old Poloroid which it's impossible to find film for. I purchased an additional box of film and the Accessory kit for this camera which comes with a very nice case in matching color of Pink. I take this camera everywhere now.","Pictures are good quality and a lot of fun. Film is reasonably priced.","Great camera. Reminds me of Polaroid days. Daughter loves it. Colors are not very bright on film but it works. Just a bit on the dark side. Great way for taking memory shots and great for those who scrapbook.","Cute little camera. Takes photos that are the quality you'd expect from a instant print, slightly vintage feel is nice.<br />Love the yellow color and the wrist strap!","Loved it my 12 yr old bbygirl loves it got home when expected .... great purchased!!","I'm 17 and I love it. Good gift.","i just got this and the picture come out prefect","very happy","Daughter loved it","It was a good present for my daughter! she loved it and its easy to take pictures which is great","Perfect!!!","This was a great birthday present for my teen!  Have to buy more film already","nice","Thank you!! Love it!!","Love it!","This camera is phenomenal. We were looking for the easiest and most affordable way to have a photo booth for my daughter's Sweet 16th birthday party. This is it. The camera is a pretty color and wonderfully designed. It is fantastic to be able to get high quality photos instantaneously.","excellent and fun to use.  Works in perfect condition.","I love my Polaroid at first I was afraid of getting one but it's worth it I have so much photos that I love you should order from this seller","about 30% photos come out blank; after researching online this appears to be a defective camera, and is a common defect...  make sure to check yours out while it is in the return/warranty period","Cool and excellent purchase. Great seller!","This camera is amazing!!! Definitely helps create memorable events!!!","LOVE LOVE LOVE my camera!! :)","so in love with this <3","Love it!!!  So excited to use it for my new DIY project","I've wanted one of these for years, and now I finally have one and I'm in love! This is better than my digi cam! Reminds of the good ol' days! I love how small the film is. This will be perfect for my wedding!","I love it! Easy to use..","My 9 year old LOVES this camera!  She has so much fun with it and it's fun with sleep overs when they can have their pictures right away.","Love it!","its great & the photos come out fabulous","Bought this for my 15 year old daughter. She is having fun using it. The film is pretty pricey, but she doesn't use it often. For a fun little camera with fun photos, very worth the price.","Perfect gift for my 11 year old daughter. She absolutely loved it. Best part she was able to figure it out right away. Real simple camera to use.","Nice camera for instant gratification. Wouldn't have been my choice for size of pics, but 12 yr old daughter wanted it and chipped in. Likes it very much. Looks nice.","I'll admit, my Polaroid 600 is a better camera, but for the pure fun of instant photography, you can't get much better than the Instax Mini. Very easy to use, film is closer to reasonably priced, and let's face it - cute as heck. Very pleased with the camera and with the photos it takes.","So much fun!","Love the camera!!!","Daughter  loves it","I love this camera!!! the packaging was okay it came with its original box however I was expecting some film with it so I had to buy it separate but it is a good quality camera! :)","I went to a sweet sixteen where they had a camera at each table along with packs of film. It was so fun taking selfies and pictures that you could draw on and take home that night.  The camera takes pretty high quality shots although the flash can be a little funky.  Definitely a fun idea though.","Cutest camera!  My 8 year old loves using this camera to document the fun she has with her friends.  I've borrowed it to use the film to help me label some toy boxes around the house.  Worth every penny!","my daughter loved it photos nice","Got it for my lady, and she loved it and the color. It is so lovely that someone finally started making instant film again, the impossible film project has been getting pricey, and you can actually find film for them in most camera shops for the instax","I got mines today and I when I opened it up I got the camera working and the moment I took a picture I couldn't stop, I'm in love !","When I first took a pic inside and it was on the indoor the picture came out too bright","Light weight, great photos, very vintage. It's perfect and highly recommended.","In love with this camera! I take it everywhere with me and I love the quality.","We used it for my daughter's wedding shower photo booth, it was tons of fun and the pictures turned out super cute.  It is a very modern version of the old-fashioned? polaroid cameras!!!","Awesome camera :) easy to use and super cute","Love it !","I like t but the film is way too expensive I should have thought about it before I bought it","It is such a beauty, I love it. I'll be taking it to France in July.","Arrived on time.

The pictures are so pretty with a natural filter!!","i love it for many reason and it bring back memories for me.","This was a Christmas present for our 4 year old granddaughter.  She opened it Christmas Eve and spent the rest of the evening taking pictures of EVERYTHING.  Good thing we purchased extra film.","This Camera is awesome. Im a guy and was a bit comprehensive on buying this but let me tell you the camera is attractive and takes great instant pictures","kids loved it","This camera is so easy and fun to use. I love it. The film is a little pricy but I think its worth the nostalgia","I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY INSTAX! I use it for everything and it is the best camera and buy I've ever made. I would definitely recommend. It also has the cheapest instant film and is genuinely a great camera! Super fun. It is bulky, but it's so cute! WOULD BUY IN ALL COLORS IF I COULD.","Excellent.","Got this for a bridal shower. Worked out great!<br />Wish it wasn't so awkward to use in landscape style... the button was placed in a weird spot for some people to use it smoothly.","this camera makes my daughter's heart go pitter pat.","Exactly as advertised!","Everything was fine.","So cute! love this camera","Came in the original box unopened and sealed Inside another box and some bubble wrap to protect the product. Loved it! :D","exactly what I expected no issues with delivery","Excellent camera , I love it !","I'm in love with my camera!","The battery door case thing doesn't even stay on all the way - it's not like it falls off but there's a gap between it and the camera. I'm hoping it doesn't break completely later on.<br />This camera takes beautiful, vintage-esque photos. Just make sure you don't load the film in the wrong way or it will get jammed. I did this and had to pry it out with a knife.<br />If you're deciding between getting this camera or a polaroid, go with this camera. The film is so much cheaper.","This was a gift for my daughter and she has had so much fun with it. Perfect gift.","I'm inlove with this camera!","great camera, fun - pictures aren't always clear and film gets pricey","I absolutely love it. Came in on time and in perfect condition used it for my birthday and at a party and it's perfect no complaints at all.","Got it quick<br />Love it<br />Order film online in packs of 50<br />it's worth it and cheaper than at store<br /><br />Experience:<br />it's best for close ups<br /><br />Always check your flash settings to make the best of exposures<br /><br />In room's were there is no natural light group pics with flash may cause pics to come out dark<br /><br />make sure there is nothing close to lense because it causes darkening of exposure<br /><br />Beautiful colors when pictures are taken in the natural sunlight.","Bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. Everytime we go somewhere new she takes a mini picture. The quality is great given the size.","I love this camera! I just thought that some film would come with it, just a heads up for anyone that buys it, buy film too!","I love this camera so much! It got here very fast and it is described just how it is. Definetly would recommend.","My daughter loves it and enjoys taking pictures!","LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! So much fun to use. Can't get enough.","My granddaughter is having much fun with this camera.  The pictures are small (expected) but are clear.","Kids loved it.","super","Much bigger than I expected but takes great pictures and I love it!","Very good products my girl love it  and my wife ones that toy","My girls asked me to get this camera for a birthday party.  And I'm really glad they did.  It's great for instant photo booth pictures at a party.  I grew up with Polaroid instant pictures, and this is the same concept, only smaller.  The kids loved having their own shots to take home immediately, of course.  It CAN get kind of pricey for film, so shop around and buy in bulk if necessary.  Camera works fairly decent.  All of my pictures are legible and the ones I have posted on my bulletin board haven't faded as of yet.","I love my new Fuji instax camera. It's so easy to use and I absolutely love the color. It takes really cute pictures.","LOVE LOVE LOVE, no complaints. i watched many youtube videos and read many reviews before i bought this and i have been using for about a month, gone through tons of film and i have zero compliants","Taking advantage of some Christmas Amazon gift card gifts, I decided to splurge on this. It was a great decision. The camera looks adorable even when it is not in use, and the pictures are of a nice quality. The camera arrived in great, careful packaging, and it is true to picture. The one drawback is the expense for film, but if you are wise with the pictures you take, and if you have any Amazon gift cards at all, there are plenty of good deals. It is a very fun product, to hear the snap and the film coming out, and to see your picture actually have to take time and develop is very exciting, compared to the quick iPhone pictures that are posted all over social media. I would recommend to anyone!","So much fun!","Great","It came in very good condictions :)","the pictures came out perfect ! I love this camera and it's so easy to use","amazing and awesome fun for kids","AMAZING!!! Although it wish it wasn't so expensive, this was definitely my best investment.","This is perfect. I will be used at a wedding for selfies. Thank You.","This camera is so cute! I love it and the vintage feel to the pictures. Shipping was quick and it got to me all in one piece. I'm 100% glad I got this.","The camera is a bit big and a little annoying to carry around so I wounldnt recommend it for traveling. It is however super fun to use with friends at get togethers and parties!","Couldn't be more happier about this camera!","love it !!","We bought this for our Sons first birthday, we wanted to have a photo booth type thing. It worked great, film is a bit expensive but was loads of fun! We got to keep a lot of pictures for our birthday album and guest got to take ones home to remember the birthday bash!","This is a great product the only reason I took away a star is because the directions to put film in aren't in English but overall I love this camera!!! The pictures came out clear!","i love my polaroid. works fine. Just the instructions are a bit unclear, but it does what its supposed to do!","Great Deal, thank you!","Great camera and came VERY quickly, i love it!!","Super pleased with the product and prompt delivery! I will definitely be a repeat customer!","Had me feeling very nostalgic. Probably gonna upgrade to a digital Polaroid camera next. I'm having way too much fun with this one though so far!","I got it for my niece's Bdays, she love it","Absolutely love this camera I got the yellow one and I love the color and how great it works. It's relatively simple to use I'm still getting used to it and trying to figure out somethings still but it's very simple and I love the instant pictures it's super fun to take pictures with it and see them come out instantly. The camera works great and easy enough for anyone to use I highly recommend it.","A","Great little \"polaroid\" camera. Pictures come out better than we expected.  My daughter loves this little thing....but beware of the film. Mighty pricey.","I purchased this item for a trip and so long as you know its limitations, it's a lot of fun. Don't buy it expecting HD quality images as it is a true Polaroid camera and will print out photos just like the old ones did. It's really best for closeup images, but if you want to take scenery or distance shots, it can work. I found I had to second-guess the light detection for far away shots, but it's quite accurate for anything close up. It's more about the instant satisfaction of the moment and having a physical photo to walk away with.","I really love this produce !! Good price and fast shipping!","Easy to use, great pictures.  I'm using this for my wedding instead of a guest sign in book.  I've practiced with it to see how the pics look and they are perfect.  Lightweight and seems durable.  So excited and happy with the purchase, only downside the film is expensive, but the more you buy the better the discount:)","Camera came in on time and included batteries and a strap. Have not used it yet but by appearance it is everything I expected it to be.","Brightened up my 13 yr old daughter’s life for sure! She loves this camera and the ability to give the pics to her family, friends, and putting the pictures EVERYWHERE! Me being a teenager of the 80's I absolutely loved my Polaroid camera so it is a bit nostalgic for me too! :)","Oh dear, this little camera is going to make me spend so much money on film. I must say, I was pretty hesitant on buying this camera, especially in white. But it has proven me wrong. It is not only cute in white, but the camera itself is amazing. It takes wonderful photos and flashes with every shot (not to worry, this only makes the pictures come out better). I haven't used it outside yet because I heard the temperature may effect the photo and it is freezing where I am right now, but even inside it takes great photos. So worth it!","great price","very happy with purchase","Adorable little camera.  So fun.  Be sure to read the instructions and you'll get great results!","This camera is well worth the price. I've been wanting to buy an instant camera for a while, but was unsure on which product to buy. I was researching various vintage Polaroid cameras, when I came upon Fujifilm instant cameras. I liked the idea of having a modern-made camera, but with a vintage feel. Getting an instant camera from Fujifilm would mean I would have a working camera that printed pictures once I took them, but still have that \"old-memory\" quality to them. As I looked more into the various models, I discovered the Instax Mini 8. I like the simple design and the low-maintenance aspect to it. All you really needed was 2 AA batteries, a pack of film, and (as with all tech products) proper care. [Note: I bought a CAIUL case/bag for my camera that matches its color, as can be seen in my pictures]<br /><br />At first, I was going to buy the simple white color, but I saw the limited-edition Raspberry and Grape ones. I leaned towards buying the Raspberry-colored model because I thought it was more eye-catching. I've taken a few pictures with it and they've all came out beautiful! I think the flash adds to the vintage-quality of the developed photos, because the ones I took looked rather 90s, but clearer. The small selfie-mirror in the front is very helpful because it shows you exactly what you'll be taking a picture of.<br /><br />I have already gotten some compliments on my camera. My best friend, who owns a couple of Polaroid cameras loves the quality of my Instax Mini 8 pictures. She says her Polaroid pictures are nice, but aren't as high quality. So, if you have reservations about buying these instead of the vintage Polaroid cameras, don't. This camera will guarantee you beautiful vintage pictures, and is less than the price of refurbished/working Polaroids. Plus this color is so beautiful and will only be available for a limited amount of time.","I ordered this for my girlfriend since she always wanted a instant film camera. She loved it! She enjoyed taking photos of her events and it was a conversation starter.","I like the color and size. Its not like the old instant camera it actually takes decent pics and so its fun for parties or scrap-booking.","The pics are very small, but works great","My daughter loves it.  I think it's hilarious that young people who have grown up with digital cameras think that this type of camera is so unique!","love it!","Accurate description!","Best buy in recent several months. The picture quality is much better than expectation. It is not just a fun camera. It can keep memories in a fantastic way that digital camera cannot. Strongly recommend that you should buy one. The camera itself is not expensive anyway. Maybe films are pricey a little bit.","Camera works great and arrived on time!!!","Was delivered on time works great and no problems happened","awesome!","very nice thnx..........","Film was as expected","It was exactly what my grand daughter wanted!!","Purchased this camera for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loves it! Will recommend to anyone in the market for one of these.<br />Pros- works great, easy to use and pictures look good.<br />Con's - Film can be a bit pricey.","Bought as a gift for my niece - she loves it but the cost of the film is keeping her artistic self from taking off.  I wish they could come up with more reasonably priced film.","I've given this to two people, and they both absolutely love it.","Love it. Thank you. ??","It ok","Terrific!","Absolutely perfect camera! If only the film the cheaper then i'd definitely use it more","Love my camera","it is super fun and cute way to decorate your room and capture the most important moments i just love it its really really good 5 stars of cores!!!!!!!","this camera is amazing my daughter loves it and uses it all the time..highly recommended","Very good quality","You don't have to be a camera expert to be able to work this film camera and that's why I think I love it so much! It's nice to have something so simple and easy to work. I myself am pretty familiar with varieties of cameras but I love how simple this one is. The camera itself is pretty compact in size, lightweight and comes with a little strap for your wrist. I really wanted either the Grape of Raspberry color but both were backordered on a different site (couldn't find them available on Amazon yet) and the Black was either sold out, on backorder, or way more expensive compared to the rest of the colors so I settled for the Pink and I couldn't be more happier. The film is also great quality at a great value as well. Compared to the new production of Polaroid film, this is the more affordable route. 8 Polaroid exposures/$30 vs. 60 Fugifilm Instax Mini 8 exposures/$48. I'm a very impatient person and the shipping on this item was perfect with Amazon Prime! Ordered on a Friday night, delievered on my doorstep Sunday morning! Absolutely no complaints!","My girlfriend loved the camera, the first photo came out beautifully right out the box! Perfect birthday present, thanks so much!","Very satisfied. I bought the Instax Mini 7S at first and hated it. It was too big, faded white color and bad picture quality. The Mini 8 was a huge step up. Smaller size that's easier to carry around, cute colors and better film quality. Luv it!","Bought this and suprise my girlfriend and she loved it !!!! A+++ TO SELLER.","xmas present but its a cool little camera to have, its like having the old poloroid","Excellent product - quick shipment !<br />Thanks, Steve","THIS CAMERA IS MY LIFE! ughhhh I love it so much!","I SUPER LOVE THIS! High quality photos! Using for visitor coming to meet our newborn baby for the first time. Highly highly recommend this! I just wish film was cheaper... But it's worth it! Love how the photos turn out and the size of them!","took longer than i wanted,butwas happy with the product","GREAT!","Loved this camera. And came on time. Strongly recommend so fun","The camera came in perfect condition and nothing is wrong with it, even though flash goes off even in the daylight, but that's not a big deal. It's exactly what I was hoping for, and I would recommend to anyone wanting a cute (somewhat) cheaper polaroid camera since the older models are a bit pricey.","My teenage daughter loves this!","I gave both  granddaughters this camera.  They asked for it as a gift and they both like it and use it, so I'm  happy.","Very Nice- Love it! So much Fun!","Great product","Favorite thing I've bought! Amazing picture quality and love the fujifilm border theme film packs","very good quality, got it before the expected time, and my girlfriend loves it.","Very cute and not too heavy to carry","greatt!!","Love it (:","This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. Loves having her own camera to take pictures. She is very Happy with this camera.","I like that the photos are instant. The image takes longer to appear than I would have thought, which is roughly a minute. Make sure you're aware of the picture setting. I took some pictures outside during a sunny afternoon and the photos didn't turn out (they were really white, no image appearing). It wasn't until I changed the setting on the camera to sunny that the pictures came out, which still had less definition than I like. The photos tend to be quite white. It probably works better inside than outside.","Just the perfect gift for my daughter and it also arrived in a short time.","My daughter is in love with this product... easy to use and light to carry, she love loves this camera. make a great gift for ages 10 and up.","I wish it saved the pictures to a MicroSD as well as printed them, but you can't have everything!  For what this camera is made for, it works GREAT!  If you're thinking of picking one up, do it!  We're using it at our wedding to let our guests take pictures and tape them into a blank guest book with a little note for us!","loving it, but if u want! but do buy film","Works and looks as expected. I bought mine at $75 (including shipping) and I'm happy with the result. All the functions work and the pictures come out lovely every time! I'm glad to start using this for scrapbooking soon and it's just nice to have your pictures be printed out and be tangible.<br /><br />It's almost as if the memories captured within the photos are tangible themselves.","Daughter loves this! Arrived as expected.","Items received and a good contition.<br />Thanks.","Love this camera! The only drawback is the price of the film- and that there is usually one dud in each film package.","It costed us less, and my daughter is very happy!","I bought this for my daughter & she loves it! Quick delivery.","Great little camera. Slower to develop than old Polaroids and color isn't perfect, but a fun accessory.","Love it, works great","Perfect! Thank you for a good buy!","Love this camera. Still getting used to it but it fits nicely in my hands. It was a gift for my daughter and she was super excited. It's a good size and shape. I'm a camera buff and want my own . Until then I will borrow hers.","Bought it for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves the thing. Only problem is finding the film in stores every now and then. Maybe that's just us, but we've pretty much had to order all the film. Great camera!","super!!!!!!!!!!","So fun","I love it! Absolutely everything I thought it would be! It's perfect size takes the most beautiful pics, it so vintage nd has more meaning to the pictures it takes! Forsure everything I wanted!","Great item & super fast delivery ,!","i love it! :)","film for our new camera and it works like it was supposed to","My camera is a hit or miss. I've taken many photos that either don't develop at all, or they partially develop.. It's a shame! This is my second Fujifilm Instax camera, and this one is so bad compared to the other I had.","7 year old Granddaughter loves this camera. Her an her friends have made a lot of memories.","love IT","It was exactly what I was looking for. The pictures are smaller than traditional polaroids, so you can't really write messages on them, but the print quality is what you'd expect of a polaroid. Overall really fun to use. I used the camera for a throwback theme party because it was cheaper to purchase than a polaroid and it worked out perfectly. It even indicates what setting you should set it to depending on the lighting in the room.","Camera came in quick! And it's big and beautiful! It even came with batteries!","I love this camera! Got it for Christmas. It's so fun and the best Polaroid camera I've ever has. Love the color, and the style it's so hipster!","Great product and prompt delivery.","Everyone that has bought this camera had some free film sadly mine didn't come with any but it's perfect and I love it !","This polaroid has changed my life. Gone is digital pictures and in comes the old fashioned film cameras! I have always longed to own an instant camera and here is a great deal for cheap! I did my research on which would be the best and Fujifilm beats all other odds. It came very quickly in the mail and was well packaged, ensuring that the camera would not be jostled around during shipping period.<br /><br />The camera itself is very cute, comes with a strap and everything! There are multiple light settings you can adjust it to and it even has an automatic sensor to guide you towards which setting is the best in which lighting. There are also so many different types of things you can do with it and is portable. The film is also fairly inexpensive, especially if you buy in bulk and there are so many types to choose from. Overall, this is a wonderful product and can be used in your daily life to preserve and keep those precious memories of events, friends, and family!","Just got my raspberry fujifilm instax mini 8 camera!! I love love love it! Shipping was fast and everything was worth it! Thank you so much!!!","This was a gift for my 8 year old! Love it! Fabulous present!!!","LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera! Came packaged very nicely and works beautifully. Its my baby.","My daughter loves this and so do her friemds","Daughter loves it!","Cute, but photos arent very good quality. Does the job!","Fun camera! Bought for little sister for Christmas but I would consider buying for myself. She had so much fun with it and the pictures turned out pretty cool.","I absolutely love this little Polaroid like camera!! It's not made by Polaroid but it looks like it. The pictures are mini and are perfect for scrap booking and just having the actual picture in your hand instantly. The camera has different settings which is awesome and it automatically sets depending on light. You can switch the settings if you wish to make the picture brighter or darker. It is fun to play with the settings and see what type of pictures come out. The camera is awesome and for a good price but the film is quite expensive. But after you learn to take good pictures then the price of the film isn't that bad, you may waste a lot of film in the beginning practicing with the instant pictures.","My daughter loves this.  She got it from her folks at Christmas.  I wish it was easier to buy the film, but at least there is Amazon where it is easy to order.","It's a great camera we like it very much!","best camera ever, my best friend used hers to take pictures at my little sisters birthday party and it takes some awesome pictures. I connot wait to start taking pictures with mine :)","Super fast delivery - in original box, new unused camera, batteries and a wristband in the box. I love it!","I ordered a black camera and received a pink one...Not sure where the confusion on that order happened. The pictures come out a little off for some reason. I know it's not my flim so I'm not sure what the problem may be. Overall, it's a good product.","Nice pictures","Great device! Works awesome! It's nice to have a lil camera that give you your pictures right at the moment you took them.","What a fun product!  Considering that this is as close to Polaroid as we can get, I highly recommend the Instax.  It's great for parties or something not so conventional.  Easy to use, the option of a warranty is fantastic as well.","Fun","Love it. Is like have your memory with you forever. I won't worry about losing my phone or forgetting my passwords. And I loose those picture. Now I take a picture  and save them and in 10 years I can always look back at them.","I bought this camera for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it! The product is exactly as pictured and very easy to use. My daughter was asking for a Polaroid but she didn't like how bulky my old school full size Polaroid camera was so I was so excited when I ran across this on Amazon. My daughter loves the size of the pictures and has so much fun with her friends snapping pictures on this camera. It was the perfect gift for a teen. I would highly recommend this product.","Good","Everything OK","Got it earlier then expected, love the camera!","Cutest camera ever made easy to use, pictures come out in high quality the only bad thing to me is the film size it's only 10 pictures which I waste like in a day lol bit overall it's an amazing camera and it's a must have","Happy with purchase!! Just as described!","My little girl is so happy with her present.","The camera works great and the pictures were really good but after I took about 3 pictures when I take another it's turns out blank can anyone help?","I like very much nice pictures,good memories","I just got my camera yesterday and I love it. The camera is cute and easy to carry. The pictures come out clear and cute. The only downside is that it doesn't come with any film, so I would recommend ordering some.","first-class","Awesome camera! Cute lil pics!","LOVE this camera but the alignment of the photos are off","Perfect!","Tiny pictures.","great camera","I love this camera!! It came in the mail a lot sooner than i expected! My film hasnt came in the mail yet so i can't try it out until then, but i am very satisfied with my purchase! I had one of these as a kid so i feel like its a necessity to have one now that i am older! Thank you so much~! :)","This camera is great! Pretty self explanatory and our 8 year old took pics! Havent found any downfalls and the pictures turned out beautifully! Some came out with that old polaroid look to them but that made it all the more sweet! Speedy delivery, product is as advertised, and easy to use. Would consider it as a gift fot a loved one/friend. I would give this more stars if I could. Far exceeded my expectations!","La la la la love it!!!","My kids loved the camera","These are the best! so cute and fun :)","Fast shipping just as described","This cute camera came in really fast in perfect condition. Pretty straight forward on how to use it and fun to capture memories to be cherished forever, right there on the spot. It's a great gift too (thanks mom, lol). I use mine to create college memories. :)","My teenager  enjoyed  it very well","Granddaughter loves the camera.  Just what she wanted.","Good product","Perfect little gift. Love the color.","This polaroid camera isn't bulky as it looks in the picture which is perfect for me since I travel a lot, I can easily put it in my bag and go. I can not stop taking pictures. In this era, we all have camera phones and those pictures just stay their without being developed, so I was excited to capture the moment and have a photo in my hands within 3 seconds and put them in a photo album. You do have to play around with the settings though…. If you're not in a brightly lit area, depending on the setting it will come out black…. or if you're in a place that is too bright, everything will be way to contrasted. So have fun with it, see what works and what doesn't. All in all I love this camera.","We like it, but the pics are tiny.","It's perfect!","better than i expected","Grest camera","Greeeeaaaaaat","My pre-teen loves this camera.  Photos are fine, for instant.  They are relatively small.","Awsome equipment","My daughter loved it.","Love it!!","Love it! Got my item in two days really fast shipping!

The film is smaller than the old fashioned ones.","Great camera!","Perfect!","My sister loves it. Great picts!","Love my camera","This was a gift for my daughter, at her request. Remember those polaroid cameras we had as kids...well, these are the latest craze, now in assorted colors! Fuji is a great, well known brand. Very easy to load and use. Loved this color. There are many different film options as well as overlays to make your plain white film borders decorative. Highly recommend this product! Capture those memories!","I can not express how much I love this camera. It is perfect for anything and everything, I love capturing memories with it, can't find a flaw. Film isn't cheap, but it's so worth it.","Adorable..love it!","MY DAUGHTER LOVED HER CAMERA FOE HER BIRTHDAY N PRICE WAS NOT TOO BAD.","perfect for me","All I have to say is YOU are crazy if YOU don't purchase this AMAZING ITEAM!","My daughter loves this retro camera.

Ill definitely buy another one soon.","Works really good and it's super cute.","Absolutely loving it! CUtest little camera, very easy to use, light to carry around and the pics come out just adorable. Totally worth the price","My daughter likes this.","I love this product! My mother got me this for Christmas so I have had it for a month and I definitely recommend for those of you purchasing. I have taken so many photos and my mom knows that I've wanted to have a Polaroid camera ever since she had her Polaroid 600 and I'm glad she got me something similar to it! The Fujifilm credit card sized photos won't ever beat the classic Polaroid but it warms my heart to know that some old ways are coming back into play.","Amazing. Absolutely  in love","I love this camera so much. It was delivered in less than a week. It takes amazing pictures. I recommend getting a package deal of the camera and film. It will save you money and you will have film the same day the camera comes in. Mine came with the batteries which is amazing. The manual said the batteries should last for 100 pictures. There are a lot of accessories you can get to go with this little camera. It is honestly amazing. I highly recommend getting it. Takes amazing pictures.","Absolutely love it!","It cool camera","i absolutely loved this product, its so lightweight and easy to take around with , it takes aboslutely beautiful pictures <3 im in love with it","Who wouldn't love this? I was going to order this from Urban's, but it's always a good idea to check Amazon. I saved over $50. Such a great product that's easy to use.","Soooooo cute and fun. Fairly well made. I wasn't sure if it was going to be some cheapo plastic thing but its pretty sturdy. Easy to use. Obviously the film is a bit pricey but I think its worth it for special occasions. Pictures are clear and develop well. No issues here.","The picture quality is not that great however nice toy for the kids who never used to print pictures","Great camera! I was a little nervous that the camera was not going to last very long but i've had it for over a year and i use it all the time. I have never had one problem with it and the color is so cute. I've brought it to Hawaii with me and got great shots of scenery, myself, people and nature. I definitely recommend this product to people who like the old fashion way of doing things. Great camera, great price, shipped fast. The only complaint I would make is that the film is not as cheap as i would like to be so buy it in bulk.","Awesome camera great for teenage girls!","This was a gift for my 22 year old daughter, who fell in love with it. She takes great pictures and makes the pictures into collages! People comment on it when ever they see it as it's very, very cute!","amazing!! came in super quick & takes amazing photos!!","I love my new polaroid!","My daughter loves her new camera. It really reminds me of my old Polaroid!","Love it. Such a cute color! So much fun taking pictures! But warning, film is pretty expensive","Love this throw back to the instant camera - business card size pictures.  Bought for my kids (14 & 9) and they love them - they are careful not to take frivolous pictures as each picture is about $1 based on film pricing on Amazon - which I've found to be the cheapest - even better than the big box store.  Camera is a little bulky so ages 8 and up is my recommendation","I have always wanted a fujifilm so I asked for one for Christmas. So far there has been no problems and I like it a lot.

It's cute, fun and super easy to use. I had heard that there was a learning curve so that your pictures don't come out white - but I used my dog as a model and everything came out as expected. Such fun - I highly recommend to everyone!","My daughter is still having a blast with this - reminds of back in the day polaroid cameras.  (big black things).  Really happy with it.","My 13 year old granddaughter loves this camera","exactly what my daughter wanted!","Bought for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she loved it, the pictures are small but extremely cute!","great camera, love the small selfie mirror built in, although the color was not at all vibrant as shown in the picture","Its Amazing!!!!

I want one myself!","Daughter loves this camera.","So far so good","Absolutely love it! Works as described and looks as depicted! :) Pictures are the cutest AND it has different settings, but sometimes if it's too bright or too dark, the pictures won't come out. Either way, I love it.","Awesome my daughter loves it! It doesn't take pictures like a digital camera the film develops just like an old model polaroid would though. Be better if it at least had an lcd screen. But my daughter is happy with it either way.","I love it. Fast shipping. The camera is cute and light weight me and my four year old son are loving it!","Great little camera","This camera is super cute!!! I saw my friend with one so I put it on my Christmas list and I couldn't be more pleased. Only thing is the directions it comes with are mostly Japanese so I had to search up things I was unsure of.","This was a gift for my daughter, who really wanted a Polaroid (i blame Taylor Swift).  The price seemed a bit high for a genuine Polaroid, for a gift for a teenager, who has a phone camera for most of her needs.  But this little camera got some great reviews and was more financially accpetable for us.  And while some people might not like the little photos, she thinks they are darling.","I take this camera everywhere I go. I love it","Its amazinggg","It is very cool!","Thank you","A gift for my teenager daughter...she loves it...novelty of it very retro and cool.","Very cute & easy to carry. The only problem was trying to adjust the lighting on the camera. If it's not done right the picture can come out too dark or light, & a lot of film will be wasted.","Bought it for my girlfriend. She LOVES it. Only thing is - the camera WILL let you take a picture while the shutter is closed - I learned that the hard way.","So much fun! Love it!","Been difficult finding film","I am so happy with this Camera. The color is bright and cute and everywhere I go, people always ask me about my camera. It is so much fun to take pictures and have them printed instantly for everyone to see. The pictures are small, about wallet size, but the novelty and fun factor makes up for the small size of the pictures. The film  can be pricy so try to use it in moderation. I totally recommend this camera, you won't be disappointed with it!","fun camera to use. bring it to parties!","Item as described, super fast shipping, great price...100% recommended","It was exactly what we expected very pleased","LOVE IT","Everything I throught it would be! Love this product","My 11 yr old daughter and her friends are having a blast with this camera.  They think the instant developing is the coolest, and the different borders that you can buy on the mini film is fun!","used it for our wedding. so easy! great photos","Gift for my sister when she was getting married and took pictures at the wedding and it was wonderful to give her an album immediately!","Exactly as described.","This thing is my life. Dont even hesitate to buy it, its absolutely perfect. IMPORTANT NOTE: it has settings (which took me a long time to discover) so if your pictures are not coming out, its because you did not use the right setting for your picture. Its SUPER easy to use and its best to look up youtube videos to get a better grasp. Im an 18 year old girl and I love it so if you're thinking about giving it as a gift, its a definite yes for all people over 10 years old.","Bought this for my daughter who is very artistic and 9 years old. She had watched some youtube videos and wanted to try this. She loves it. She has taken tons of pictures. The only issue is that it Is expensive now that I'm used to having digital, but it is fun for her.  Easy to load the film.","It's cute, easy to use and I use it all the time!","Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter.  Nice little camera for a pre-teen who loves taking pictures with her friends.","I really love this camera, easy to use and work with. It is just as easy to use as it is easy to drop because of its matte texture so be very careful.","Great","Camera was great, but haven't taken pictures yet can't get film.  Hope the pictures are good.","It eureka fine but pictures are really small.","This is so fun.  So cute. Such a nostalgic throw back to my youth.  And it's super fun to take a picture of a millennial kid, say, a 22 year old bartender - and then actually hand them a physical picture, right there on the spot and watch their mind get blown IRL.  It's kind of hilarious. Suddenly, this old lady is the fun one taking live selfies in public.  Crazy! Also, it's a good quality instant camera.  More options for lighting than I would have figured.  Super cute size pics.  AWESOME for our annual Halloween party and photo booth - leaving guests with a party favor.  Huge hit!","My daughter really likes this camera. She's been through 3 packs of film already!","Taking decent pictures and figuring out lighting and which flash to use takes some time to get used to but I love my cute little camera!!","Love this camera! Easy to use, shipped somewhat fast, and takes somewhat good quality pictures!","This camera is perfect! Best gift I ever gave myself","very good","Awesome","My frist polaroid camrea and I love it! Aside from its obvious good looks , it's easy to handle , very light and portable.<br />It takes very clear photos that make your skin look flawless! The photos are credit card sized so you can easily put them in wallet or create any type of project with them.<br />The only down fall on this product is that the instax film can be a bit pricey....but aside from that I love this product!","We had this in our wedding. our guests loved taking intant selfies and we love looking back to them.","Love my pink instax camera! I get compliments on it all the time! The actual pictures are smaller than the old Polaroid camera's had but the final result is still the same. Beautiful moments captured in each photo!","love this camera. takes great pics. fun and fast.","Very easy to use and I got exactly what I ordrred","bought it for my daughter, she is so happy","I love this camera it's the best.

It came well packaged, and came quick","Great camera for a 13 yr old, daughter loves it.","Great Camera","Thx Taylor Swift!!","I love this camera, it's great for making memories with friends and family.

I'm happy with it.","Love this little instant camera! Its nice to have actual pictures instead of them being on your phone all the time","Teenage daughter loves this camera","Great service, great product","My 9-year old loves it.

Just as expected.","Price ti high","My daughter loves it","My daughter loved it no wonder it was the hot hard to get Christmas gift this year.","Great! Tks!","This is a really cool camera. It works great. However it did not come with instructions. THere are buttons/lights on the camera but I do not know how to work them. I have to look up instructions from online. It works great though. My daughter has taken several pictures.","Daughter loves it!","I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it.

It is simple to work and she loves the instant pictures!","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera. Yes, the pictures are small (credit card size).. but I basically purchased it specifically for my daughters birthday...

Exceeded my expectations.","Purchased as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter.She loved it!","On time shipping. Product as described.","This camera is super straight forward and simple- and if you take the time it will develop great shots! I bought the basic film for the Instax Mini (they sell rainbow film as well as designed film) and followed the instructions to load my camera. Film can be sensitive so once you load it into the camera you want to avoid opening and closing the compartment because light can affect the film and your pictures may not develop. For more go to http://mandyliz.com/blog/","good product","less than a year old now it doesn't work, ??? still under warranty, bought the extended will see how that goes, cute camera hardly ever used","The very best camera!","Exactly what my granddaughter wanted.","My daughter absolutely loved it!!

This has exceeded our expectations.  This was a gift for a pre-teen, and she absolutely loves it!  Her friends can't seem to get enough of it either.  They are plowing through the film - ha!  Great camera, and comes in different colors.","nice fast shipping thank you","I loved it came in sooner then I thought !!! -Ruth Palma","awesome","Love it but would be nice if it could download pics to the computer too.","Gift for my 11 yr old granddaughter. She loves it and has already shot up 4 rolls of film.","Shipped faster than expected. It's perfect.","Exactly as I (my daughter) expected. Nice camera for fun.","I love this camera! The pictures are small. The size of a credit card but they are just like what I remember. Everyone wants one for tier own fridge! Only down fall is the camera isn't as small as a digital or a cellphone so it's harder to carry around but it's totally worth it! Love it!","Christmas gift for  my 12 year old.  took tons of picts.  good quality. We (as adults) had a blast with it aswell.","Great Camera for someone young. The best quality that you could expect from a polaroid camera. It's light weight and fun to use. The film is sold seperately starting at $10 for 10 sheets. My daughter (17) is very pleased with it.","Does the price move up each day cus yesterday it was a dollar less","Great service, packed well, and works as advertised.

I did not realize the difficulty finding the film locally so I have to purchase it on-line.  The film can be expensive, your looking at a $1 per picture.  But the idea of an instant picture is just plain fun so it is worth the price.  We purchased additional accessories for this camera which include a<br />** Strap : Camera Strap Professional Shoulder Strap for Fuji Instax mini 8 Camera (Yellow)<br />** Case : CAIUL Transparent Crystal Instant Camera Case for Fujifilm Instax Mini 8<br />** Album : Leaf Photo Album for Fujifilm Instax Mini Films - Mint<br />** Decal : CAIUL Decor Sticker For Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 (Yellow)<br />** Stickers : 20 PCS Scandinavian Style Films Sticker For FujiFilm Instax Mini 8 7s 25 50s<br />** Service Plan : Canopy 2-Year Camera Accidental Protection Plan ($75-$100)<br />** Film : Fujifilm Instax Mini Film Winnie the Pooh","Love love love works great love the color great shipping","Great product! Packaged nicely and unharmed!","Good buying experience,  love the camera!","Good","Got this for my husband. He is in love with this product. Got to my house fast and easy. Would recommend this seller to friends and family. Product works perfectly, i love that i can snap pictures and have them right away. Thanks!","I'm not a fan of going back in technology but my daughters are having a great time taking shots of each other. Photos are as they were when this technology came out decades ago but the physical paper is about half the size. I'm guessing that's why my daughters think it's so cute. Paper also has fun patterns like rainbows and stars. Now it's the film that my wife and I knew we would regret. As expected 10-picture cartridges run you about $12. We bought a 5 pack and told our daughters they might have to buy their own after that. Camera wise... very solidly built and easy to use.","Great camera horrible description of what comes with the camera! I had bought one of these cameras for myself and much to my dismay, even though I read the item description and the actual box that the camera was packaged in when it arrived on my doorstep, there was NO FILM packaged with the camera! The online description and camera box itself both said it would contain 2 of the 10 packs of film. I was willing to pay more for the set! $20 dollars more! I was very disappointed that I couldn't use my fun new toy right out of the box.<br /><br />The camera works great and it very fun to use. As long as you have film of course!","I am thrilled with my new instant camera. I purchased it to use it for the guestbook at my upcoming wedding. The mini picures are wonderful and the quality is consistent with any I stand camera.","Great camera.  Love the instant pics and the automatic feature that tells you the best setting.","good","it was in mint condition and meet all expectations!","Love the price!<br />Great present!","Fun!","I love this camera!!! I bought a lot of extra film for it with the borders and it's a bit addicting to take pictures. Be careful though as the pictures come out at a price of about $1 a piece. I like to scrapbook and this makes a great addition to my pages. Always looking for something different to  make things look interesting. I love the size and they also make great little party favors, if you have people over. Take a picture of them and give them the photo. It's very easy to use too, would make a great gift.","Great little camera for kids to play with.  Pictures are nice and clear, bit smaller than view.  Good and easy choice of scene.  Only if the film was cheap than this would be perfect.","Just what granddaughter asked for","Excellent super happy. Bought it as a gift and they loved it so much. Excellent idea for any age and super easy to use","great customer service  great product","It's okay.I wouldn't want to rely on it for any important pictures.

If you plan to purchase this, be aware that the prints are very small. They are not standard polaroid size.","Works as expected.","Does what its suppose to do.","Amazon delivered fast and camera works great! Nice picture.","This has been a fun and cute way for my daughter to cherish the moments with her friends.","Camera is perfect and easy to use I love it!","Thank you for a promo delivery and the merchandise in good working order thanks.","My daughter really wanted this for Christmas. I ordered it a couple of days before Christmas and still got as promised by Christmas eve.","Awesome camera! My granddaughter loves it. Pictures are perfect! I want one for myself.","Great product and shipped fast!","Works great and really cute!!!  Fun for daughter and her friends. Get extra film!!","Great product!","Great Xmas gift, my granddaughter loved it,esp the color.","I bought this polaroid camera as a christmas gift to myself. I love it. The settings are awesome, 98% of my photos turn out really well. I also like that the camera has a dial that indicates how many pictures you  have left in your film.","I love the camera.","Gift for my daughter, she loves it!! Easy to use and fun film boards have her snapping pics of everything!","Makes business card size pics, great for teen get togethers,...or other instant memories...","Nice!","Get the lighting right first when snapping pics with this camera. Film is about $1/pic unless you go with a value pack. Overall, it's girly and a lot of fun!","great price, fast shipping. thank you!","Camera was exactly as described and functions perfectly.  This was a gift and I was concerned about a timely delivery.  Much to my suprise the camera arrived earlier that the manufacturers forecast.","Great product I was a bit Leary The price only being $75 and including two packs of film but it was definatly a great deal I received my package a day early wich is great I got free shipping and the camera was better than I had expected","This is a great and fun camera!!! It is easy to use and the pictures are really nice quality for such a small instant camera. I bought this as a gift for my brother and he loves it!! I would buy this again and recommend it!","Just plain amazing","Love the instant pictures! The pictures are just the right size and the film is very easy to load.","My teen daughter is having fun with this camera.  It is such a concept for her to have immediate printed pictures to share and hang in her room.  The quality is nice and she loved the cute grey and white polka dot strap that came with the camera.  Nice design detail.","my gf loved it!!","Gave to Grandaughter for Christmas. She was thrilled.","Got this as a Christmas present for  my brother and he loves it!","I got this as a gift for my tween/teen nieces; they love it.  It was so fun for them to have actual pictures of them and their friends to put up in their room.  It may seem like a dated idea, but kids rarely actually get pictures printed anymore.  They also really liked just using the camera and waiting for the film to develop.  They show me the pictures they have taken whenever I see them.  I highly recommend this as a gift for anyone.  I think I may also get my sister one to use at her wedding.","Camera kind of gimmicky not pro. but grandaughter was thrilled.","Bought this for my daughter for Christmas it was a big hit for holiday selfies everyone loves it a new twist on an old school hit","Best buy ever! I bought this for my 14 year old daughter, along with a bundle of fun film, and she absolutely LOVES this camera! It's so nice to see pictures of her and her friends in a time where most everything is only on phones and computers! I actually would love to have one for myself too!","Easy to use... Wish pictures were more 'crisp'..... But it is exactly what the soon to be newly weds wanted for their reception","Just as advertised. Worked great  out of the box. Teen loved it. Thankfully less expensive than in other sites.","The cover piece for the battery part will not stay on.","Love this camera!!","My granddaughter was quite pleased!","adorable but pricey","I bought this camera for my granddaughter and she loves it. It's a good camera that is simple to use and you get instant gratification. The pictures are very clear and the camera is easy to handle.","This was a Christmas gift for our daughter who is a photographer. She was beyond pleased with the camera and how well it performed. The price and prompt delivery was great! Thank you again!","Awesome all the way accross includes selfie mirror big plus","just for kids","This was a Christmas present for my pre-teen daughter.  She loved it.  The photos it produces are too small for my taste, but they were perfect to her.  The pictures produced were clear and looked nice.  Just be aware that the camera is a little bulky and the film is a little expensive.","quick delivery and as expected","My 14 year old daughter loves this Christmas present.  Her 19 year old sister is now asking for one also.  Perfect size polaroid picture to hang on a string with clothes pins.","Loved it!!!!","exactly what my daughter was expecting","Taking photos with the camera is just fun.","Could not be happier with it!!!","Amazing! This was indeed worth the prize.","I love my mini polaroid! Just make sure to learn the settings so you can capture each photo at full potential!!","Bought this camera for my daughter's Christmas present, she loves it..Takes it everywhere she goes..Very cute camera and the pics came out great..Package also came on time as expected.","fun camera - remember it doesn't like photographing things more than a foot or two away","So cute and fun to have!!!","Film is expensive!","Amazing instant film camera.<br />I bought it in the beginning of 2014, and it still works as if i bought it yesterday. I haven't even changed the batteries yet! I would definitely recommend this for everyone, it's so vintage, and cute. The picture quality is awesome, yet the one thing I dislike is where you look into the camera to see what you're taking a picture of, it's off to the side of the actual lens, so you kind of have to angle it a little more to the right when you're taking it if you want it centered. But yeah, if you're contemplating on getting these cameras, DO IT. You won't regret it.","Used this for pictures for a sign in book at my wedding. The camera is relatively easy to use; however the instructions are not super clear about how to load film and turn off the camera (to turn off the camera you push the lens back into the camera so it is flush). Guests had a little trouble loading film, but it didn't cause any issues at the wedding.","Excelente producto","Bought this for my 15 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it! All of her friends ask her to bring it with her when they go out. She has a lot of fun taking pictures (once I explained she has to look thru the hole at the top to take the pic). Perfect gift for teenage girls or really anyone who loves to take fun pictures and have them printed out right away. Easy to use and love the different color options.","Got it on time and it came well packed and not damaged at all so I really like this product. ","Fun product and great time in shipping. Thank you.","My granddaughter loves it","Expensive but a great camera","Daughter loves new camera! Just like mommies but more colorful- mine is white. Thanks for fast secure shipping!","Daughter loves her new camera!!!","Saved my daughter's Christmas! Had the last two cams in stock and arrived earlier than I thought was possible!!! The cam was her favorite present by far :)","Quick Delivery.  Item as described.","My Daughters loved it.","She loves the camera","My daughter who is 13 is the pickiest girl. She's difficult to shop for and she absolutely LOVED this camera. The color is popular and so cute. We got the accessory case an kit to go with it. Thank you for shipping it straight away.","My daughter LOVES it!!! Super cute and awesome quality.","My granddaughter loved it!","Super cool","i literally just got this and I'm in love! At first I thought I was doing s*** wrong but then I realized I wasn't and it's just perfect. I love how it has a grunge effect! I showed my brother who hates pictures and he asked for a picture to be taken of him. This thing is worth the money. I just wish the film was cheaper","Quick shipping-good product.","amazing product, fun and cute","Good","My teenage daughter loves this camera!","easy to use","My daughter loved it","My 5 and 7 year olds got these for christmas. They work great and they LOVE them. However the film is crazy expensive and this has proven to be a serious exercise in restraint for kiddos of this age. I'd suggest digital unless your kids are a bit older or not super into photographing everything cool they come across!","got this for my 10 yr old daughter for Christmas! she loved it!! Now she can take pics and give them to her friends and or hang in room. much better then boring pictures sitting on a phone","Good camera.  Provides a nostalgic feel with each picture.  Daughter uses this and takes photos of her friends.","My daughter wanted a \"Polaroid\" camera for Christmas. I saw this and knew this was going to be a hit and it was. It's hard teaching an 8 year old how to go from our digital technology of clicking a photo at anything and being able to delete, to then now be able to pick a good shot that she will wang printed because she has a limited amount of shots. She thinks more about what she is taking pictures of and hasn't put it down since Christmas morning! We received it overnight and we were thrilled with the price and service. Thank you!","As described,  received on time.","My daughter loves this camera. Very pleased with this purchase so far. Very easy to use. I purchased the pale yellow one & it's a very pretty pastel yellow. Looks great with the turquoise blue hard case we also purchased to go with it. :)","perfect","was a gift to granddau. she loves it. have not seen any photos yet.","Fun camera for tween daughter, although the film is expensive.","Perfect little instant pictures. With accessory package lots of ways to save and display the pictures. Camera and bag are well constructed and easy to use. My granddaughter  loves it.","I'm so happy with the camera.","I don't get the hype over this camera. It's very nicely made. It's super cute. But is a total novelty. It takes the worst pics ever. And the size of the photos are so very small. We have used it twice in 1 year. Waste of money unless your teenager.","I love it..","Overall, this camera is fun! It's great for social events and capturing sweet moments. It is light and feels kind of hollow, so I would suggest getting a case for it because leaving it in big bags can bang it up a bit. I would also suggest a close-up lens for selfies otherwise they will never be in focus.<br /><br />There is a \"hi-key\" setting, and the manual will suggest using it every time you are indoors. However I've come to realize it over saturates the exposure with light, so I'd only use it in very dark settings. If the indoor shot you want has some light, just use the regular indoor setting.","Great gift for my daughter she loves it.","So far so good.  My daughter loves her new camera.  Shipping was quick and packaged well.  Would buy again if needed.","Seems easy to use for my 9 year old grandson; however, I didn't realize the pictures are only the size of a credit card.  It would be nice if there was film available other than the mini.","This camera is amazing! I received it as a gift and it was exactly what I expected and more. It's so cute and works amazingly. It doesn't come with film, but luckily I received film also. My family and I enjoy taking pictures and keeping them afterwards, and it was well worth the price.","Product came exactly as advertised. The description was clear and concise. The shipping was very quick.  My granddaughter was extremely excited and squealed with delight on Christmas morning when she unwrapped the camera.","I'm not sure if that's the one she really wanted, she may have to exchange it, but it is the one she put on her wish list! So that's the one I ordered!","my daughter loves it!!","Great camera comes with batteries and a rist strap","I love my camera it fun and captures the moments","So cute I love it :)","My 14 year old daughter enjoys this and it takes good photos. Small but ok for when she's with friends and wants to capture the moment. Film is expensive -- nearly $1 per photo so I do think this will become a limited usage item in the near future once she realizes how expensive it is to use on a regular basis.","My wife loves it. Very hipster looking","My daughter and her friends LOVE this thing. Cracks me up that in this day and age of technology, this throwback 1980s technology is the in thing! Works well and takes decent pictures.","This little camera produces amazing mini photos. Our 6 year old granddaughter loves it!","I'm a huge fan of this camera and it's a really fun item to have around. I've only used it a couple of times and I think the quality is decent. The photos turned out well for indoor portraits. However, I tried taking a picture of a downtown skyline at night and the photo didn't turn out well at all. The flash was set on the lowest setting but the entire picture still turned out black. This camera is best suited for well lit situations or use of flash on close up objects. I wish it had a no flash option. The AA battery feature is also a bit of a hassle, so it'd be nice to see something that is rechargeable. I bought this used in new condition and when I first put in new batteries and film in it and turned it on, all the lights on the front and eyepiece kept blinking. I was afraid that I had bought a bad camera but luckily it worked fine with the switch to different batteries.<br /><br />The price of the film is also a huge downer. However, crutchfield and other sites sell it for around $14.99.<br /><br />**Edit:<br /><br />I ended up upgrading this camera to the Neo Classic Instax 90 which is more than double the price unfortunately but I'm hoping it'll be a better investment. The Instax Mini 8 is great if you're taking indoor photos of friends and parties but because my use was primarily landscape, the limited functions of this camera were hard to work with. I definitely debated whether or not to switch because this was so much fun to work with but if you're hoping to invest more in the photos then possibly this camera isn't for you or a DSLR is. It's also rather awkward and bulky. I did have a number of great shots in the small amount of time I had this though so it does the job for a low(er) cost!","I got it when the price was about $60 so I'm very lucky! This camera is perfect. When the photos develop it has a cute filter on it to always make your pictures look amazing.","This camera is awesome. The pictures turn out great! Perfect for someone who loves to take pictures and use them for crafts or give away as gifts.","I bought this camera for my 22 year old daughter and she has enjoyed being able to share her photos instantly with friends.  It's easy to use and a handy size.","So far so good, my daughter loves it. Having a hard time finding film, guess we'll  be ordering more online.","Loved it!","I bought this for my 14 year old granddaughter for Christmas, and she took several pics on Christmas day.  She seemed happy with it.<br />The only question I have is I purchased film, delivered on time and in accordance with the order, but I also paid for the plan to cover any problems in the first 2 years, but I got no paperwork.  Shouldn't I have something in writing instructing us what to do in case of a problem?<br /><br />Thanks","Eeh. I was really looking forward to getting this, and I finally got it! It's super fun to use and all. But the photo quality and lighting is terrible. The picture is very dark and hard to see. I recommend it... Just maybe try finding a better film than I used.","Very nice color of yellow and my daughter, 19, loved it. Develops pictures like a Polaroid.  Pictures are smaller, but fine with her! Picture quality is just like a Polaroid. Daughter loved this camera!","love it the best gift to buy!","This is a great camera, but the film is VERY expensive, making it unusable very quickly.","would have been great with a case.","Great camera.  In the age of cell phone technology, my kids love the instant'print aspect of this camera.  Its bigger than most of their high-tech gadgets, but they have fun.","I would rate this higher because my daughter loves it BUT the picture and the badly worded description implies that the film is included with the set. I found the camera for less money from other retailers but thought this included a pack of film. I realize it is my mistake but I won't  make it again.","There was no film with the camera or accessory pack.  We couldn't find any locally either.  What a disappointment on Christmas Day!","This was a Christmas present for my daughter. She loves it!!!","Fun camera. The instant little pictures are still fun.","My daughter loves this thing. In a time of iPhones and selfies it's a polaroid that turned out to be her favorite gift. The only thing is an 11 year old that is always taking pictures on an iPhone needs to learn that real film costs money. lol. Great quality. She says it's the new-old big thing. Best Christmas gift by far.","this camera is fun to use, The pictures are clear.","The camera is an adorable size, but the quality of the photographs is definitely not what I expected. I actually gave it to my toddler as a toy, I used up all the film trying different settings but it just was not what I was looking for. The pictures are about the size of a credit card, and they mostly come out blurry and faded. I bought about ten rolls of film and went through it all so quick, but I've used professional cameras before, so maybe my standards are just too high. Some people seem to really enjoy this camera! If you've got the money to try it out, do, you may really enjoy it.","works awesome so pretty and cool and they ship is SUPER fast!! Love it","Purchased for my daughter and she has loved taking pictures and seeing them immediately print out.Very popular with the teenage crowd. Highly recommend.","My daughter loves this camera. Easy to operate.","Nice little photos. Old style of no retakes. Fun","Pretty darn great for making memories.","I got this for my Girlfriend, for her birthday. She has always loved old Polaroid cameras, so when I saw that these mini ones were made, this was a no brainer. They produce a credit card sized photo, with a really great quality to it. Surprisingly high quality, in fact. The film refills are a bit pricey and can add up, but its worth it. This thing is fun and its really cool having these instant photos around for capturing those really dumb moments. Film will always carry more emotions/memories with it.","Perfect gift for my niece. Super Fast Shipping! thank you","Its a gift. Didn't open yet.","This is the best thing ever. I LOVE IT. its better than other cameras. i wasnt shure of buying it, but its really cool. you get your photo instantaneously and is super cute.","Plastic cover for the battery broke off on day one, could not find a way to return or exchange the camera. Using scothc tape to keep the batteries in.","a gift for my daughter and she is having lots of fun with it.","It works beautifully, and the pictures are so cool!","Perfect!","My girlfriend loves it..however I did not recieve the film on time so we had to buy some at target which was ridiculously expensive.. almost 2.00 dollars a picture  yikes... still i recommend it..its awesome","I got a ton of compliments on it and everyone kept asking where I bought it Amazon of course super fast delivery over all awesome purchase","Came in perfect!","it's amazing!!","This adorable camera is my new baby. She works perfectly and I couldn't be happier plus the price was cheaper than in Urban Outfitters and most other sellers.","lovely camera","I wrote the camera review on the film recommendation space.  That's what you get for not reading first.  Life goes on.  My granddaughter loves both the camera and the film.","Awesome Camera!","Gift for my daughter for Christmas, so not sure how well it works, but it definitely is cute.","It took long to get to my place but I'm so happy I got it cause it's so fun to use :) thanks it's worth it get one","I love this camera. I use my camera for pictures of my son all the time. It is easy to use and whimsical.","Granddaughter likes.","I think it's difficult to manage photos for a kid who is use to a phone. It's hard to take a good picture.  The quality comes out questionable each time.  It takes time.  It's just okay because it's not as easy to use and because of this, it sits in her room on her shelf.","The girl loves it!","This camera is perfect for creating an impromptu photo booth or just adding a touch of fun to events where the most used camera is someone's phone! I was really looking for something simple to use and this model definitely does the trick!","It's for Christmas and I haven't opened it yet.","wonderful","Good buy","i wish it came with film...the camera works really nicely and the images are vintage but high in quality - the film is just  an added expense that adds up quickly. it should come wit ha at least a few","I love it so much I wanna buy them all! Lol it's seriously my favorite camera..","We bought this camera for our daughter for her birthday. It was a big hit with all the kids.  Picture just ok","I'm using it well~<br />Thank you so much ^^","I had always wanted a polaroid and have so far been pleased with this one. It's small and lightweight and easy to toss in your bag. As long as you pay attention to which setting you're using photos come out with good quality. Having the camera on the wrong setting can result in over exposed white photos if you're not paying attention. My only dislikes are the price of the film and the location of the shutter release button. You have to be careful that your fingers gripping the side of the camera aren't in the photo.","great product and seller","Super cute cameras, very easy to use, the pictures are small but they are great for cards, for crafting, love it love it love it.","This thing is awesome and really easy to use. I could see myself using this for a long time.","This is a very basic Polaroid camera with very small pics.  It's point and click with only outdoor or indoor settings.  Flash is always on.  You load the film, matching yellow inserts to make sure it's upright.<br /><br />The pics are pretty good.  Total classic Polaroids, so forgiving unlike digital.  You can't see wrinkles on faces or zits. That kind of thing.<br /><br />We purchased some of the fun, creative films to make this even more cool.  We also bought a case to protect it while not in use as it's not the sturdiest contraption.  Just very basic plastic.<br /><br />Overall, my son loves it.  It's a great novelty item for teens or Polaroid lovers.  We are getting a wire to hang photos in his room.  Lightweight and easy to use","Great for kids!!","Great little camera..Love getting pictures instantly..Reminds me of all that was good about the Eighties.","It's prefect. Exactly what I want","This camera is really cute and the film is not expensive.  I totally recommend this camera.","But I returned it because the films are way too expensive. This camera was great. Had it in yellow, which was beautiful. I only wished the film would have been cheaper, I would have kept it.","My daughter loved getting this camera for her 10th birthday. She was able to take cute pictures with all her friends during her party and throughout the year. She pins most of her pictures on a cork board in her room. Fun, cute, easy to use!","Ordered a couple of these to go on the tables at our Wedding Reception.  Everyone LOVED taking photos all night and we put together a book after of all the pics ;)  Order LOTS of FILM!!! None comes with the camera.","Nice","Amazing pictures","love this product<br />works great, firm grip, easy to use","I'm inlove with this camera. I like taking pictures with it. I don't take pictures of anything random like others may use it but I use it during family occasions and holidays. It's great to a give a memory away to family. It feels like a toy but it's not :D","love it. i'll be a good Christmas gift,Thanks.","Love, I simply love it.","pictures are smaller than I thought though","Instant photos!!!","very good","Love it","Took forever to get to me but when I got it...it was worth the wait.  Very fun camera","Works great!","Great buy! A lot of fun","Used this camera at work for a project and knew it would make a fantastic Christmas gift, bought two with loads of film. Recommend for anyone, fun at parties, for scrapbooking, really anything!","Delivered timely and worked as expected. Light weight and good price.","My granddaughter loved this.","Oh my gosh! Best camera! Everywhere I go people are so jealous from ALL ages!","Bought for my middle aged daughter.  She loves it!  Old school rules!","So far it has worked great for my 12 your old niece. She loved it","I love it.","Item as described, fast shipping. My little girl is going to love this Christmas morning.","Such a great purchase. Been wanting an instant film camera for a while and this was worth the wait! So easy to use. Creates fun photos. Always put the crowd in awe!","Not very portable, but a very nice and modern looking camera. The film is a bit expensive, but we bought a 50 pack so hopefully that will last for a good amount of time. Since the pictures come out credit card size, it can be a little small if you are taking a picture of something farther away, too bad there isn't a way to zoom. Also, Its kind of hard if you want a \"random\" person to take a group picture since with this camera, you have to be pretty careful of how you take it since the picture comes out right away, and you don't want to waste too much film. I reccommend to have good experience with photography if you are planning to get this. Otherwise, it's a very cute & cool camera.","my doughter loved, we have so much fun","I bought this camera in March of 2014. I am very pleased with how it has held up. The only problem I've faced with it is the camera did overheat while I was at Disneyworld and the photos couldn't develop because of it. That was my own fault though, since I knew that I shouldn't let the film or camera get over heated. My sister and friend also have intax cameras, and we often share the pictures with each other and display them in our rooms. I am extremely happy with this purchase. It made a wonderful addition to my camera collection!","Great and handy.","Very nice, came on time","Everyone loved this added little gift at the wedding. used it to take polaroids of my wedding guest. It was so much fun.","It was a hit on my weeding.","My girlfriend love it, creates great moments with it","I love love love my camera<br />It's so awesome and easy to use.<br />It works great<br />Just wished I purchased more film lol!!!!<br />It's very cute<br />Love this camera<br />Will recommend this purchase.<br />My hubby made a great buy<br />.  Thanks","the pic came out not really good, the pics came out dark no matter I took them at night or day time. The color of the camera is cute though","Too expensive for this camera since is one to use only for certain occasions, but once is time to prepare the camera for that one special picture it truly does a good job.","My daughter loves this, it's amazing how we revert back to older type of cameras. It's allot of fun.","Quality of pictures in regards to color isn't great.  Not sure if it is the packet of film being used or the camera.","perfect christmas gift!","I honestly love this. I take it everywhere with me and everyone loves the photos. It's a great choice for anyone who wants a physical picture and not carrying around a bulky camera","love it","I love my insta mini so much. Really great investment.","This is the best camera I've gotten my girlfriend. It's fun to use when going out, to snap some memories. Due to the high-cost of the film (about $1.00 per shot) we only take a few shots. Hope the cost of film goes down. But it's a great camera!","daughter loves it.","Love the camera!","Works great! I bought it for a camera for a \"photo booth\" at my daughters 20th birthday!","OKAY","very good","Nice camera for a young girl. I bought this for my 8 yr old granddaughter and she just loves it. Worked fine right from the first shot. Be sure to read the instructions BEFORE operating it and you will not have any problems. Also instruct who ever will be using this camera there is no second chance to erase and take another. Be sure of the shot and don't take random pics as you would with a electronic camera with SD card. Each photo will cost 50 cents or so. It's a re-learning thing.","Well made, sturdy and fit the description.  The camera worked as advertised and the pictures (although small) come out clear and bright. Love it.","i love it, everyone loves it too! They have asked me so many questions as where to get it, and how much. I dont think the price is too much, specially since ive seen it somewhere else for $100. Is $1 a picture too expensive? yes. But i still love it,, the pictures come out pretty good, just try not to take selfies.","My daughter loves it!","love my instant polaroid camera.","Great. As expected","AWESOME! thank you!","Daughter was happy with purchase. . It was a birthday present and her birthday is on halloween. An extra film purchase is recommended. It was funny cause I had to explain to her that it developed its self. And boy did that make me feel old!","Loved it","i love it","Love this item, Will make a great Birthday gift for my daughter!! Fast Shipping!!","pictures come out clearly, camera is not centered so you have to make sure you have the camera pointed were you want to take the picture","I love this camera it's amazing!  If you thinking of buying one you should because it is a lot of fun","I used to have a Kodak Instamatic, which I loved, but it went the way of the dodo-bird.<br /><br />In some ways this Fuji camera is better, in that the instant pictures are more in the  2x3 range, and in a way, more \"artistic.\"<br /><br />What I love about this camera is the instant picture.  A phone may take 100 pictures to look at, but with this camera you hold in your have every picture you take.","Just as other reviewers said. Its a bulbously looking camera, kinda playful, but everywhere you go with it people look. I love the reaction from waiters who we ask to take a picture for us - they always get really excited and loop back after a few minutes just to see how the picture turned out. Obviously it is a basic camera - you can only pick the ISO and the camera gives you a suggested number depending on light levels it detects, and you select the level by rotating the ring around the lens. Obviously you cant change aperture or shutter speet and you cant zoom - but thats beside the point, its a polaroid! The viewfinder is slightly off target but we have gotten used it it after a few shots. The flash is super bright so we put white cloth medical tape on it to diffuse the light, which works well. Also obviously in low light its not that great and the flash ALWAYS fires (cant turn it off) so watch out for whitewashing your subject and having black behind them - cover the flash a bit or have a light source behind you. In the same way, at night it cannot pick up buildings or fountains behind you if theyre more than 5-10 feet away. Daytime shooting in parks and streets is great. I havent tried the macro (zoom) mode yet bc I didnt want to waste any shots on things like food, but Id imagine that would be the only way to manually change the aperture so you could get that nice blurry background behind the subject. Maybe I'll try and report back.","Fun","Love it! It's small and easy to carry! It's also great that it automatically suggests which light setting to use.","Fast delivery, great camera.","Ehhh.","I bought two of these cameras, each for a 13 year old girl. The cameras were shipped quickly and the items were exactly as depicted/described. The girls love them and the merchant was great.","Love it!  Hung the cute pictures on a string around my mirror!","I had a few problems with the shipment but finally arrived with 2 days of delay. I love it! ?? It is so beautiful and it's the same color as the picture. Definitely my fav christmas present ever.","This is by far one of the best impulse purchases I have made in a while. It is extremely easy to use and the photos turn out great! Just make sure you have plenty of film on hand, because you'll run through it quickly. Everything you need is included with this purchase except for the film itself.  It's also less expensive to buy in bulk.","Everything was great! Really fast shipping.","Fun!","The pictures are so cute. Although I wished it had come with better instruction (took me a while to figure out how to insert the films).","Felt like a kid again :'(<br /><br />it just reminded me with childhood. It produces excellent photos with a touch of old-look. I felt the photos were like 80's or 70's, which I LOVED BIG TIME.<br /><br />I kept taking photos for every single member of my big family, relatives & friends. They all loved it","nice item shipped fast","Absolutely love it!!! Awesome","Daughter loves it.  A little gimmicky, but that is expected.  Works fine.  Pictures are business card sized.","Everything was perfect","Daughter loves it and everyone we meet are amazed by it. The only thing is for those of us who remember the original Polaroids, the size of the picture was much bigger. Would definitely recommend!","the color is cute ,i buy it for my friend‘s daughter ,she likes  it so much .","It was a gift for my daughter, she is very happy!","As listed! Great service!!","Just as expected. Great for party's not so much at the beach but overall a great camera with a great vibe to it. Films a bit expensive but it lasts a long time!","Fun and cute","Bought it as a gift for my 16 year old.  It's been a great little camera!","OMG! I seriously take this where ever I go! I love this camera! It's my baby! It's so vintage! And the film you can buy for it is endless!  It's so light and easy to carry. Easy to use! A child could do it! It comes in different colors. There's many accessories you can buy for it. It's seriously a must have! My friends are always making sure I carry my camera on me at all times. Picture prints right there and then. Great quality! && they are perfect to give out. I've gotten many compliments! Only thing is, it works better when there is sunlight or just any light. When its dark it doesn't take the best pictures but other than that its awesome! Film is easy to put in and it's battery operated but it lasts for a good while before you have to change them!","works perfectly, great resolution! loved it for a photobooth","Had difficulties with opening the battery panel.","I t was a nice gift for my daughter. than you","Yes. INSTANT PICTURES. YES","My boyfriend doesn't like taking pictures. This camera changed my life now he loves to take pictures as we can have it at the moment.  I love this camera. It's awesome","Excellente!","This camera is a lot of fun. I decided to try it out and I'm very happy with the purchase. It's fun to bring along on travels for random snapshots. I am still trying to master the exposure, since it has minimal settings... but that's part of the fun, too!","Item came as described and works great. Really happy with it so far.","Wonderful !","I love this thing.","Awesome! Very fun and easy to use.","Ordered this for a Christmas gift, so haven't seen it in use yet. Im sure will work fine and my nephew will like it.","Bought for my daughters reception and what a blast people had with this camera, taking selfies and being able to write on the bottom of it to leave advice..  It was the hit at the reception","nice","Works awesome! Love it!<br />Have used it for several events and people like the mini size photo that pops out! So quick and easy! A great value","I cannot wait to get this polaroid for my daughter. From all of the reviews we read, I think that I will not at all regret getting her this for Christmas. People say it is perfectly small, fun, and easy to use. Also, the colors look amazing! She cannot wait to get it and use it! It will be her very first polaroid, and I am sure she will love it! Totally recommend.","Amaz-Balls!","best thing ever","Very nice camera, which is mostly a novelty.<br /><br />When I was a kid, my parents (in the 70's) had a polaroid camera and we thought the quality was bad, but nowadays, my daughter who got this camera, in the era of 16 MegaPixel cameras on smartphone, think it is the coolest thing in the world.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Definitely has a novelty factor.<br />-Nostalgics will love this too (I am one of them)<br />-Great subject of conversation.<br />-Due to price of films, you really value and think about photos you take (which we no longer do with digital equipment)<br />-Good quality build.<br />-Very easy to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-This is a novelty item, so quality of photo is for a pure fun factor and is poor in itself (I take one star off for that).<br />-Price of the film is outrageous.<br />-Size of the photos are about 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches, so smaller than our old polaroid photos.","Easy to assemble and fun for a 9 year old.","this is the best one in the world","Bought as a birthday present - fast delivery, daughter loves it","My daughter loved this camera, lots of fun. Good quality.","Love it!!","It's so cute I fell in love when I opened it. Very easy to set up, it included the batteries and a strap already so that was nice. The pictures turn out gorgeous. Keeping this for a long time.","Girlfriend loves this camera.....i don't get it","Oh what fun we've had with this camera.  It's very retro and it takes some time to get used to the sun settings.  You will find yourself having to retake a few shots while you get used to the camera.  However, my daughter loves it!","Beautiful and fun...","works great and was delivered very quickly","LOVE THIS CAMERA! its a bit bigger than I anticipated but great to snap timeless memories! The pictures come out tiny but great quality!","Good for girls","Keep in mind the film is incredibly expensive!!!","use this remember good time","Love, love, love this little camera!!!  Great pics if you pay attention to the settings (for light), and so much fun!  We use this a lot to take pics of my 10 year old and her friends so they can all have a copy to remember.  The film is pricey (about $1 per pic), but totally worth it for certain occasions!","Nice camera. MY GIRL REALLY LIKE IT. EASY TO USE","Bought this as a gift for boyfriends daughter. She LOVES it! I think it's a great little camera for what it's worth... Polaroids, fun but certainly not digital. They are just as I remember - sensitive to too much or not enough light - except these pics are extra small making it more challenging to get a great pic. Hey, if she likes it, I love it!","Bought this for my 11yr old for Christmas and I know it will be the highlight of her Christmas Day!!!","Awesome camera.","super cute!! Absolutely loved it, its so easy to use & pictures come out great!","Our 14yr. Old daughter loves it so much! When she opened the box the day she got it our 16yr. Old daughter begged for one as well!

We are going to use it at our holiday party and give pictures to everyone.","It's a great camera. Old Polaroids are just too expensive to use and this is a great alternative.","A gift for our grandchild","catchers Ozel crazy moments is that a phone just can't do","I use it all the time. Film is expensive but worth it","We like this camera, but found that the exposed film does not come up out of the camera automatically unless or until we pushed the picture-taking button a second time.  This may be an anomoly of the camera we purchased, because we were unable to find any mention of this in the instructions or elsewhere.","I loved it!!","I used this camera at my wedding for guest book photos with fun props. Huge hit. I ended up buying two more as thank you gifts!","My kids love it.","excellent service and product....in love with my new camera!!!!!!","Amazing product! I ordered this for a bridal shower so our guests can take pictures of themselves. It was easy to use and the quality was perfect!

Product was as stated","im so getting it and its my favorite color...PINK!!!  my brother has one and accept its black i took a picture of me and it looked great!!!","perfect little camera!","i purchased hello kitty Instax and pink Instax cameras.  Both work perfectly. One for me and one for my 9 year old daughter.  We both love the credit card sized film. She's learned to operate and load the film herself.","AWWWWWWEEEEESOMEEEE","good","This is such a fun little camera. It takes a while to get a feel for the lighting options and distances. It is especially versatile if you buy the accessories (different lenses). The picture quality is pretty clear. The pictures are about the size of a credit card so you can do a lot with them. I love it!","Great product. Very happy.","Everything was done on time and with efficiency!","I LOVE IT ! ! ! That is all I am going to say.","Such a fun camera!  The film is about the size of a credit card and develops within minutes.  No shaking of the film is required.  Great to bring sight seeing or to parties!","I wasn't happy with shipping, it was late and it sat in a carrier facility for 3 days. The person I talked to from customer service emailed me back right away and was very very nice. So thank you for that. I love the camera, I've already started using it and it takes awesome pictures. The film is great also. Anyone looking to get this camera should get it, I got it for my smash books and the pictures and the perfect size so I don't have to cut anymore. :)","Great!",";)","A fun toy","Soooo in love with this adorable camera. The sky blue is just the prettiest color and my camera just fits perfectly in my hand. The pictures are just what I expected from a Polaroid style camera. But that's what I wanted for my art journaling. They were very clear and looked high quality don't get me wrong. But are not going for that look. Then this isn't for you. Best purchase for me tho. I just wish the film wasn't so expensive","Its suuuuper cute and takes cute polaroid pic! The only downside is that it is kinda bulky compare to a camera and a bit of a pain to carry around sometimes if you perfer small purses and the film is costly but besides that its a great product! You could also do a lot of diy projects with the photos taken too. And if youre not using it, it could also be a really cute decorative piece!","This product was very satisfying. I bought it for my friend for her birthday along with a twin pack of film and she used it for her birthday photos. They make almost any event look great! I am contimplating buying myself one as well. Also, its a better and cheap alternative to buy it on amazon prime rather than other places like urban outfitters or something that sells the same product for 100$.","Cute. My daughter loves this camera and uses it a lot.  Usually have to buy the film online. Some stores have it, but film is a little tough to find locally.<br /><br />Takes credit card polaroid pictures.","Quality is good, I like","My granddaughter loves this little camera.","Love this cam. It is fun and perfect for events; wedding, birthdays, tracking your child from baby to adult, etc. However, not something I would use daily. Film is costly and using my phone and regular camera is more convenient and practical. Love the size of the instant print. Very cute!","just got my camera today! I ordered it October 31st & got it November 4th (about 5 days) it's so cute and light (: I got the pink one with the 10x5 (50) film because it's cheaper to order it in bundles","I used this camera for a guest photobook at wedding and it worked great! I now have a great collection of polaroids from wedding.","I LOVE these Cameras they are so pretty and halpful and easy to carry around!!! I totally recomend these and thay have beautiful colors!!!!! <3","Don't expect studio quality photos with this camera, but if you're feeling nostalgic and want instant photos reminiscent of Polaroids, then this camera is great. The photos are pretty small, but great for wallets or to post around the house or in the car. Great instant camera for those on a budget.","Beautiful and perfect!","Love it","Fun to have around","Good value.","Bought this as a gift. Shipping came very fast and my friend loved it!","it is a great little camera ,and its perfect for what i need to use it for.  many thanks<br /><br />  joseph falzon","Best deal !

It fulfilled my expectations completely.","Love this item! Very fun product!","I love it! Came in 2 days! I thought it would take longer. So cute, love it. Exactly what I wanted. :) completely satisfied and super happy!","Supercute, the quality of the camera isn't HD T_T But i still LIKE IT ALOT!!!!!!","I looked everywhere for this camera but no one else had it. i can always count on Amazon. The camera works great and I love it.","This polaroid is so cool! it works really well, and you can even adjust the lighting on the flash. Sidenote- it also comes with a wrist strap","It's a fun, cute camera to have at parties.  My teens and their friends love taking \"selfies\" with this camera.  It actually produces mini photographs (remember those?) that can be put into wallets,  on the walls, or tape onto to scrap books.","such a good deeal! & I love it !... package came within 3 days","I love it!! it's so cute, fun, and easy to use. Definitely recommend it.","Love it.","Credit Card sized photos for my wallet - fab!","I ordered the camera for my niece's birthday.  The camera came in perfect condition and works great.  The baby blue color is beautiful.  My niece loves it.  Competitive price & fast shipping from PlusDigUSA.","I honestly miss old school cameras. There's something exhilarating about not knowing how a picture will turn out after you click a physical button and the room fills with a flash. The anticipation to see how your photo turned out reminds me of my childhood, running to the picture section of Costco and hoping my eyes weren't closed in the pictures.<br /><br />Great value compared to most places I shopped and the camera is definitely cool. Purchased the Instax as a gift for a friend and she loved it. The pink color looked great and the material is a nice matte finish and doesn't feel cheap. Picture size is that of a credit card making it convenient to hang up anywhere and a perfect size. A ton of people complimented the camera and the picture quality is pretty good with multiple photo settings. I recommend watching some youtube videos for some tips on how to take a great shot with this little guy.","I liked this product has quality. My espectation was good.","This camera besides being so cute in pink works really great good price and good pics.  I used it for my birthday at a restaurant and it looked great.  Definitely worth buying","As a serious amateur photographer, and a creative professional my entire adult life, I have to say this little camera is a marvel. I recently bought it as a gift for my seven-year-old daughter. She already has an old iPhone of mine that she uses to take snapshots, but this camera gave her an appreciation for film and the value of taking the time to compose shots. Once she realized that each picture cost money and was (essentially) one-of-a-kind an unable to be reproduced, she started spending a lot of time composing and directing each shot. Rather than being disposable images that appear only on screen, each item is a tangible object of which there is only one in existence.<br /><br />Though I mourn the death of Polaroid, the fact is, Fuji Instax is a far superior film. Images are sharp and contrasty, albeit smaller than the Polaroids of yore. The camera itself work like a charm. My daughter was able to load a cartridge with only minimal, verbal instruction. It also appears to be quite well-made. I have no doubt it can sustain bumps and drops far better than my infinitely more expensive (and fragile) digital system can.","This is my first purchase of polaroid, and I love it so much. It was also delivered 5 days early from the estimated date. Also, the picture comes out nice. Overall, i'd give 5 stars for this.<br /><br />Note: Does not come with the film.","Great camera. It takes high quality of pictures and it's very handy and user friendly. Very easy to use also.","good","Good!","Cool, Camera ive personally enjoyed it so far.","It was a gift for my daughter, and she loved! She is having lots of fun taking pictures with her friends.","This camera is so much fun. We take pics of our house guests and put them in our little yellow guest book that we bought to hold these particular mini-photos. My son loves taking pics, and the photos run out pretty quick. The only downside is it doesn't have a counter to tell you how many photos are left, so you never know when you are going to run out.","love it!","Absolutely love it !!!","This little camera takes great pictures.  My son asked me to buy this for him - I didn't know anyone still made these type cameras. It was great to have prints to share immediately.","I love the colors, convenience, & flexibility of prints. Great gift for my scrapbooking teens!","I love this camera! It makes family and friend get togethers even more fun! It's really fun to be able to have a hard copy of the picture right away. I highly recommend this camera. The pictures are the size of a credit card and are super adorable!","It was exactly what I was expecting! I'm soooo happy with it! It's a short range camera. You have to be somewhat close to the te object or person to get a decent picture. But I still love it and enjoy it! It's fun (:","Love it","Love it","good","Works great! Very fun!","I don't even know what to say... I love this camera, it's insanely durable (I've dropped it a few times) and get complimented constantly. I can't express how awesome of an investment this was.","Such a good investment!  Yes it's bulky and yes the shots are small but it's fun and light for the price you pay! The only thing is the cartridge only has 10 sheets and if you get camera happy like I do at events then it sucks.","Love it!! A little difficult with sun, but it's great.","Love this camera. Takes a while to learn what settings you should use in each lighting so I generally prefer taking pictures indoors. Very simple settings though. Not a very hard camera to learn. I was worried it would feel cheap, light, and like a toy, but it has a god weight/feeling in your hands. Photos print right away but it does not come with film. Film can get expensive but I just like to buy on Amazon and if you think about it, back then we did use to develop all our photos. You just have to be mindful of what you take pictures of. The size of the pictures are like business cards. I was hoping for bigger photos but I thought this was a better deal overall and actually now love how cute the size is. I recommend this for all ages. I got it in a nice classic black color.","Exactly as noted in ad.  Fast shipping too.","I initially thought of buying this for a SoMo concert that was coming up. On the day of the concert, I brought this with me and it took clear, memorable, and awesome (when timed correctly) pictures! This is probably one of the best investments I've had so far. Excluding the fact that the film cost a fortune, this is a really great camera!","IN LOVE WITH THIS CAMERA!!! Shipped very fast","Love the camera. Perfect for college students to decorate dorm or apartment!","Good and versatile camera but film is far too expensive!","I absolutely love this camera! The photos are adorable and make amazing gifts. You have to remember that this isn't a digital camera and not every photo will come out perfectly. Sometimes the photos come out dark or not quite as expected but I think it's part of the fun. Most of the photos come out clean and have an an Instagram 1977 filter type feel to them. The outer case is a durable plastic but it will get a little scuffy if you aren't very gentle with it. The device itself is extremely easy to use. However if you want someone else to take your photo warn them that the photo will come out on top. I had a few kind strangers in NYC take photos of me and friends and they were all extremely surprised! I originally bought this as a birthday present to myself so I could look cool at Bonnaroo and this lil fella did not disappoint. Everyone loved it and wanted to know how they could acquire one. I took shots of strangers and gave them away as presents or used them to barter. People absolutely loved them. If you want to make friends at a music festival one of these is a must. Overall I think this is a really cute product. You may think you're buying a camera but you're really purchasing a conversation starter, present maker, and way to make people smile.","Good","My granddaughter loves it!","I get so many compliments on this camera. It's cute and portable and the picture quality isn't bad. The film is a bit expensive but this camera is so much fun.","Came in short amount of time, thank you!","I used this for a party and people absolutely loved it!!!","Got it for Christmas it what she whated","perfect gift","It's perfect! It had nothing wrong with it the package was fine and I LOVE IT with all my heart XD","My daughter loves it","LOVE","Fun change from your regular camera.  It uses smaller film, works well!","Pretty awesome !","In love with it! Best purchase ever! My life is rockin' now c;","LOVE the pictures","Works fine, no complaints here!","LOVE IT! I got a white one and my family members saw and 3 other people bought it! Came on time and it was brand new.","Good little camera.","AMAZING, I love it soooo much","It's cute and fun. My teenager love it!","Love it","Loooove it","Good camera :-D you have to find out when and how to use it but it's worth it","My granddaughter loves this camera. She loves to take pictures of her horse Willy.","I love this product. It's fun & always a great thing to have. Polaroid is back!","I LOVE IT SO MUCHHH! I ordered 2 Day shipping, but i got it the very next day! I use this camera almost everyday! I love it so so so so so much! Thanks Mom! <3","Love this camera","GOOD CAMERA!!","Gave this a gift to a 13 year old and she takes it everywhere now.","Gorgeous camera, takes lovely pictures. I just wish it was easier to clean & created less smudges.","arrived in a timely manner and as expected","Nice little camera.","Great camera, compact and does just what I had expected! Would also make a lovely gift for someone!","Absolutely adore this point-and-shoot camera :) simply click the button to open the lens, allow the camera to suggest a flash setting based on the room brightness, and take the picture. Pictures always turn out wonderful, but avoid taking snaps of bright objects or sunny areas. The flash cannot be turned off so these areas might come out washed out.","LOVE this camera. It is so cute, and although it's quite expensive to keep taking instant photos with, they almost always turn out cute.","I love it so much","Easy to use and easy to carry. Great for picture lovers! No complaints.","so cute! so tiny! so perfect!!!!","While I am still working on how to take my best pictures (with the settings) I love this camera.  My first picture was awful but it has gotten better and better since then.  Very unique and perfect size.  Yellow is also the greatest color, love the retro feel. I also love all the photo ideas that it sparks.  A great little birthday gift to myself.","Did not realized it didn't come with any film so still haven't used it yet.","Works perfectly; had no problems setting it up and I mean it's such a good and cute way to capture memories.. I LOVE IT!!","so cute ! I love it!","love the camera.","This was a gift for my sister and she loves it!","I loved it!!","Delivered quickly and works perfectly","Nice product, like the vintage quality of the photos. Just wish the film could be printed on larger paper, prints about the size of a business card.","Super cute!! Easy and fun to use!!!!!","Thumbs up","I love this","Nice for kids","cant wait to use this for the wedding we are doing a photo guest book!","...i love my new camera!!!!!!!!X3 i take everywhere =D sometimes some pix don't come out like i want them to :/ but most all of them are pretty rad. I love my instax.X3?  perfect gift for anybody.","really love it","Very fun","I love this camera so much! It was the best thing I ever bought on Amazon. I honestly take this everywhere with me! It was love at first sight.","my daughter loves it","Used for our wedding reception. Loved the ease of use and it takes good photos for an instant.","Who doesn't love a good old fashioned polaroid? Even if the name isn't Polaroid, this is just as good. The film is smaller than a traditional Polaroid, but I like that about it because they fit well in a wallet. Don't expect digital camera quality; that would just detract from what it is -- an ode to a time long ago.","Love it and fast shipping!","I LOVE THIS CAMERA","She begged, I folded.  She loved it and dropped it accidentally.  Lens cover and an internal part went flying.  Now DOA.  Heartbroken kid.  Not the camera's fault but shouldn't it be able to handle a simple fall?","Love this camera it's so much fun, I used it at my baby shower as guests walked in, they had their picture taken and put in a little scrap book where they wrote to my daughter. It's not going to take the most amazing pictures but it's super cool and easy to use, for things like that or just for fun. Kids especially love to play with it (It's pretty durable so don't be nervous about having a kid hold it), the film is a bit expensive but I think it's worth it :) everyone loves when I bring it to a party, I can easily take their picture and give it right to them. This camera honestly is more for fun than anything else really and it gets 5 stars from me for doing just that","Perfect amazing I love it","It's soo cute ? it's great ! Very happy","Cool little camera. Bought as a gift for my 13 year old daughter and she is thrilled with it.","This is so much fun at a party!","My brother love this camera, I gave to him in her birthday","Great camera, my daughter who's 12 loves it.","My 17 year old daughter loves this camera.  She really has to think about the photos she is taking!  She is having fun with it.  She asked for one for her 17th birthday ... \"it is just what she wanted.\"","Love it ! Fast shipping too!","I love it! The pictures are great. It took a few wasted pictures to get the settings right but once I did they've all come out great. It's also a great conversation piece. Everyone has something to say about it!","my girlfriend love it so much... nice look and easy to use. than yoy","it is great my grand daughter loves it very much","My daughter loves this. Camera","It's so cool!","It's great! Thank you (:","The color of the pics is cool. I love this new camera.","I used it for our wedding guest book. It was not a traditional reception so my sister took photos for the guest then they pasted them on a piece of card stock with their congratulations/words of wisdom.<br />First of all it was super easy to use. Second, it took great photos, perfect size. It took me a long time to buy this camera because of the size of the photos, I thought the photos would be to small; I was wrong. The credit card size is perfect and adorable. Lastly, I had numerous guest ask to buy it after the party and/or where I got it and how much it is. I will not be selling it, I actually can't wait to take more photos with it!!","Small and easy to carry around. Takes lovely and clear photos. Prints are a bit expensive, but cheaper than Polaroid film, and if you buy it in bulk, you can save a lot of money. It's a really great camera. Only cons are are that you can't shut off the flash (i've had to cover it with dark tape sometimes) and the view-finder isn't centered with the lens. But other than that, i completely recommend if you want really adorable photos and love the versatility of having you pictures printed wherever you go!","My daughter loves it. I don't understand why since the photos are small but she loves the novelty of instant photos.","I love this camera! It's the perfect size, takes really great pictures and is definitely worth the price.","This isn't a fancy technical camera but is great for taking photos at the spur of the moment. It's wonderful to have the picture developed on the spot instead of having them stored on your digital camera.","Oh god, I love this product. It's lightweight, resilient, takes AMAZING photographs and is just all around the best purchase I've made.","Nice, inexpensive instant camera. After using it for two packs of film I wish I had gone for the 210 wide version just for the larger prints. Kind of tricky using outside as exposure setting changes quickly with slightest movement of the camera. Inside, no problem. Flash fires all the time, would be nice to be able to disable if you wished to.","So much fun! Love my instax mini!","came just on time! works great.","It's exactly what you'd hope for - It's simple, easy to use, and actually pretty cute. It takes a while to get used to the light settings (7/10 of your first photos may look over/under-exposed), and it's a little bulky, but overall a great product. I wish the film was less expensive!","I love it!","I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift and she loved it! Great for taking pictures of moments you'd like to keep in a scrap book or a wallet. Subtracted a star because the film can be pricey, around 70 cents - $1 per shot.","This was a complete was of money.  There is a reason that polorid cameras went out like a blink of an eye.  No matter what setting I used all the pictures were horrible.","Absolutely love this camera! It really was everything I expected it to be. I just wish the film was a little bigger but other than that no complaints!!","Love this camera!!","What a great gift! Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it! Easy to use and great quality.","It was fun once we fried out the exposure issues. We took it on a 16 day trip to across the country to Yellowstone. The girls, 4 and 8, lived capturing their adventures and seeing the results right away!","The camera itself is perfect and so cute although it has a fault. The veiw finder is not centered","Excellent","LOVE IT!!!!","Incredible! VERY easy to use, and although most of the instructions are in Japanese, there are plenty of online tutorials showing you how to use it. Don't let the few poor reviews stop you from getting this camera. It is worth every penny!","What a fun camera! We are now back to Polaroids! Watching the picture come to life is fun. The small size (about the size of a credit card) makes it easy to bring on trips.","Exactly what I wanted","Fun easy little camera, easy for my kid and of course instant fun! The only drawback is that the film comes in such small packages and can be quite expensive.","Great little camera","good","exposure is bad. from going to just even a toy film camera to this...It's cute and I get my polaroids but if you shoot sunsets, the whites clip with a black dot on the picture! It just really doesn't expose itself well either for being film...But it's cute and does its job","Got it EXTREMELY fast! It's for a bridal shower, it's easy and fun to use. I just love it!","Awesome!! works perfectly!!","I bought this camera because I'm a scrap booking junkie. The camera works great and is fun to take pictures and watch them develop. Also, the photos are small and easily \"smashed\"!","i love it so much the picture is better when the background its darker as the flash works its magic..... ran out of film and it sucks.","Excellent!!!","Awesome","It is great! You can capture great memories with it and it has fun vintage feel!","its my favorite cam!!!","Love this item. Fun","For fun it is great. And my daughter enjoys it very much.","Great camera for the price. Going to use it at our wedding recption. We'll have guests take photos and add into the guest book.","Bought this camera for my daughters 14th birthday, was a bit hesitant as the polaroids of olden days were big and bulky and film was quite pricey. I did some research and read through many reviews on the latest polaroids. This little blue guy got a lot of good reviews and seems to be the best bang for the buck. The film is still pretty pricey and hard to find in local retailers. We do like the camera. The extra lens that pops on the front, we are not sure if it really does anything, it is not a zoom that is for sure. Some of the photos come out dark and they are very small. Mini really does mean mini. My daughter and her friends have loved taking pictures with it. We also find the photos do take quite a long time (more than 10 minutes) to fully develop. Overall I am happy with the camera as we bought it for fun.","Excellent little camera! It's super cute, and super efficient! Better than what I expected!","Bought it for my daughter for a gift and she loves it! What's old is new again and kids love these cameras.","My daughter love it ...","Love it!","So much fun to use!! Perfect for celebrations. Used it at our wedding and we love our photos:)","Awesome :)","Excelent<br />Thanks","Everything I expected and more, great gift","This is basically the most adorable camera on the planet. I'm a professional photographer, but I wanted to have this as just a fun thing to use at my Lolita meetups.<br /><br />Pros: This camera is adorable and easy to use. Because it is a new camera, the film is also much easier to find (and much cheaper) than traditional instant cameras (such as Polaroid). There are also a few different settings available, so you can theoretically use it in brighter or darker settings. It is also MUCH cheaper on Amazon than what it costs at Michael's or Walmart.<br /><br />Cons: The settings are not FULLY manual. You have the option of indoors, outside/cloudy, outside/kind of sunny, outside/very bright, and Hi-Key. The biggest con here is that I don't think the settings accurately reflect how they're supposed to be used. For example, on a pretty overcast day, I chose the \"cloudy\" setting, and the photo came out way over-exposed (as though it were much darker out and needed more flash). I'm still getting used to figuring out what constitutes as \"cloudy\", but I kind of like the over-exposed look, as it is more flattering on skin (blows out any imperfections), and gives you that old-school feel of a less-than-perfect camera. I'm still giving the camera five stars, because I would rather an image be over-exposed than under-exposed, and I have enough setting choices that I think I can figure it out eventually.<br /><br />Pro/Con: The camera, in my experience so far, seems to take the best photos indoors, which seems to be the opposite of most cameras (digital or film) out there. Just an interesting point to note.<br /><br />I think this camera is pretty awesome, and I may be buying more as Christmas presents this year. :)","This was a great camera for just the fun ability to print photos on spot! Although the instax mini does not take high quality pictures and will overexpose your photos at times, it is still really fun! To keep in mind when buying this camera: It is more a toy than a \"photography camera\". It feels plastic and fairly cheap (probably because it is) and if you drop it you may just no longer have an instant camera. But if you just want it for the fun of having a polaroid it suffices! I have had a lot of fun taking snapshots all summer, and it's a great this to have along for the ride, to capture moment, right in the moment. I have really enjoyed this.<br />Also, do keep in mind that the film is about credit card size.","My daughter loved it. Thank you.","The pictures don't come out as great as I thought but it still does the job :) and it's cute","I love my camera, it is compact and take great pictures :)","Great camera! Super easy to navigate, great pictures!! Absolutely LOVE IT!","It's good, I like it.","Love it ! Fun camera to take pictures with.","Quite the hit at the wedding.  I wouldn't use it as an everyday camera because it can get expensive but it did what it wanted and pictures turned out well.","Thanks its great","cute color and easy to use after you get used to the flash/environment settings.","This was the best idea for a teen party! They sure loved it and I do too.","My daughter just loved it..","Very fun and easy to use. Still getting used to the settings to use in different lighting. Also, the film count seems to be off frequently and I've prematurely exposed some film thinking my Instax was empty, or missed a shot thinking it still had film in it. Batteries are still kicking after about 200 pictures (it uses classic AA batteries).","I love the camara! It's cute and practical and takes much better pictures than you would expect but only if it's in the right conditions which I why I don't give it a full 5 stars. Overall, it's a very fun, artsy, and unique camara!","Takes me back to the old days! I recently moved out of state and my friends borrowed my camera and made a heartwarming album...Love it!","It was a gift my daughter gave to herself. She loves the camera. She said that it was the best gift! The pictures are so clear. The size of the camera, and the pictures are very cute!","My daughter loves it.  Cheaper than Urban Outfitters.","I love my camera everybody wants me to take their picture and it's very cute I love it a great buy","Its great.  Was a super gift for my niece","I love this camera, takes good quality pictures and fun","Great and a cool little camera","It's really worth your money. Just don't waste the film because that's what costs a lot. I guarantee you'll enjoy this camera!","Just what i was expecting.","OK camera films too high.","film is costly","This camera is great for my project life.","A really cute and compact camera. Can take it on the go and take a quick snapshot with your photo ready in seconds. Amazing buy and takes good quality pictures as well. Very simple to use and the directions are simple with pictures. :)","believe me, you need this in your life. has worked perfectly so far, has had it for over 6 months now and still hasn't had to change the battery. films are super cute and come out perfect every time","For a year now, I've been eyeing this camera ever since I saw youtubers showing it in their videos. I finally bought it and its definitely worth it! I love the colors it comes in and I got the yellow one! It's the perfect size to carry around while traveling and it's really fun to use just to take random pictures of friends and families (: does not come with film btw. People complain about the film price but its a Polaroid camera and buying film is part of the investment of having one. This camera if for the people who want to take photos for fun and not for business (;","Exactly what my granddaughter wanted for her birthday. Delivered almost immediately. Great service!","I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee My new camera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its greattttttttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","What can I say..........My grandaughter loves it.  Ordering from Amazon and I checked many places...they were the cheapest!","This straight up old school camera was a hit with my tween daughter and her friends.  It is available in a variety of colors, but strangely, did not even come with a basic case.  It takes decent enough pictures, but it is mostly for the instant gratification factor for a generation growing accustomed to just that.","I ordered a pink one and got a blue one...but I'm digging this blue one better hehe. Overall I think this was a great order, it looked like a used box but the camera is super new. It comes with a little hand strap and two AA batteries. Everything is easy to use, instructions were easy to follow. I took one picture and it came out super nice! Shipping was much faster than I expected. I love it!!","The pictures are all dark","It's like way too cute!! I can't wait to use it:)","great product !! bought it as a gift .. received as descibed .. thank you","Love this.","I LOVE this camera it is perfect for taking cute little pictures. I have no complaints and I came just in time -Suzanne's daughter","The camera was amazing and I'm so happy with the results !! I really recommend this purchase and I promise I'm not lying.","Loved it! I don't know much about Polaroids so I feel like this was a great way for me to start. It's super lightweight and a nice size. I defiantly recommend it!","Very happy w/ product","Love this camera. Feels great to hold. Really hard to see through the lens viewer but everyone talks about it when I use it and wants one ;)","My wife loved this camera! Perfect size and easy to use.","I purchased this camera for my daughter's 11th birthday and she absolutely loves it.  We were able to pop in the batteries and the film and start taking photos immediately.  She and her brother were amazed at the picture appearing \"magically\" on the film in just a couple of minutes.  The pictures are about the size of a business card and the quality is very good.  It's funny, but I think people look better in these photos ... 16 megapixels really doesn't do anyone any favors!<br /><br />I did purchase several packs of film and accessories to go with the camera including a clear hard plastic case that snaps around the camera with a neck strap, a snap-on lense with a little mirror on for selfies, a pack of decorative stickers to put on the camera body, and a photo album to hold the photos. It was such a hit that my son has asked for the same setup for his 9th birthday coming up in December.  I did caution my daughter to \"conserve\" the film.  Both kids take photos on their tablets and tend to take random multiple pics of all sorts of inanimate objects but she's been using her film wisely so far.  And speaking of film, the Fuji tends to be cheaper than the comparable Polariod film.  I averaged $.75/photo and I didn't see the Polaroid film on Amazon cheaper than $1/photo even when bundled.  We'll be giving the kids film as gifts for holidays going forward (Xmas stocking stuffers, Valentines, Easter, etc.).<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera.  Any adults who've seen it and our photos so far have been completely charmed!","My daughter loves her new camera! It takes nice little pictures.","I'M SO IN LOVE WITH THIS CAMERA! Fast delivery and very well packaged!!! Well trusted seller! A+++++ Thank you so much!!!","loved it","good","Super great, totally recommend if you're trying to look for a instant film camera. I love the quality!","Great product!","PERFECT","Excelent camera! I ordered for Venezuela It came less then a month. Y bougth it to 50 Films for 35$. It only take 3 minutes for the image appears in the film! The size of the photos is like a credit card! The color aré awesome! If u like the old school photos. Dont miss this oportunity. The camera cames With a strap, 2 batteries and manuals!","Love it. My daughter is having so much fun with it.","Granddaughter is loving it","Great \"Instant\" camera, finally a replacement for the old Polaroid. Have tried the Impossible Project film in my old 600, but too many problems. This little guy performs beautifully, just have to be conscious of the settings, an instruction book would do wonders for this camera, hint Fuji? Only complaint is the photos are a tad small, but are excellent. They do sell a bigger version, but the camera is so big and unwieldy that you won' take it with you. This little guy is GREAT !","use it all the time. a fun camera to capture the moments!","Got this for my girlfriend because she really wanted it, I got her this and she got the film at walmart, and she absolutely loves this camera. I would reccomend this","LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera! I've only had it for seven hours, but I can already tell that I love it! Super cute and easy to use. I love the vintage look to the pictures. The one downside is that it can only hold 10 pictures at a time, and the film is kind of expensive. I wish I could afford to just snap away at every random thing I see, because it is SO much fun.","I love this camera","Works amazing!","Love this Camera, so cute!!! and Fast Shipping","Best gift for a teen girl. I got this camera for my niece and she uses it all the time!","My older kids love this, but I wish instead we got one that allowed you to preview the photo before wasting expensive film on bad photos. Of course, then it's not a true polaroid, which is what they were after. Oh well.","Good product","it turned out to be just the way i wanted it","good","My daughter (13) loves it","super fashion","Looks nice and works great. Bought it for a gift, they love it. The film that you need to buy to use it is kind of expensive, but it's not for daily use, just to capture a special moment, so it's doable.","Very good~!","great camara take good care of it it can get dirty easily","It was a great buy","Great price and super fast shipping","It was aweosme it works so we'll","Sooooo cute and sooooo much fun. Cheapest website that sold it! It arrived on time and it came in perfect condition! Definitely recommend it!!! #loveit","Everything that was expected and more, great buy","Nice and simple to use.

She really loves it & so do her friends!!","Amazing<br />Came in two days with the free shipping!!!<br />Everything about it was amazing only thing that sucked is that it doesn't come with the film. Other than that I highly recommend it!!!","I love my instax mini 8","Great!","Fun instant camera ... price was  amazing  on other website price was a lot higher. Arrived faster than predicted in perfect condition works and I love it. Thank you","I love it. I take pictures in every moment that I want to keep and remember. The film is pricey but worth every penny. I would recommend it to anyone.","Takes great pictures when it is cloudy. Even when set on sunny the sky can become white.","Fun for family gatherings, the kids love using it and its simple! Instant photos to take along with you. I can see myself using this for crafts and special projects.","Daughter loves it.","Before it arrived, I thought, With advances in photographic technology, the pictures from this device must be extraordinary, if small.  The pictures are as instant pictures always have been, only smaller: a disappointment.  The camera comes in a cute little box but is too large and bulky and just oddly dimensioned to be very cute itself.  It does not fit the hand(s) well.  If you thought of buying this camera as a gift for a child, you would do better to find a better instrument (in terms of what it can do).  This camera will not of itself open vast worlds of creative exploration, as the right camera can.  I had thought it would function like the Kodak Brownies of old, bringing high-quality photography within the reach of just about anyone, but it does not.","love it!","Great product and transaction.","LOVE IT!!!!!","Was fast and exactly what I ordered","good","Amazing cam and always complimented on the photos!","I love this camera it's co cute/kawaii I love how it looks on my desk and I love the small pictures it takes I colors are all cute and the picture quality it's really great. I haven't used it as much as I thought I would but still enjoy it a lot","Great photos, I'm very surprised.","We love this camera.  What a fun addition to have around.  Used it on vacation for a sweet set of photos instantly!","Awesome ty","Clear picture.  Films are cheaper than old polariod cameras.  Only problem is that view finder doesn't match what you need to capture.  You have to guesstimate and hope it turns out good but it's good for selfies, even though I'm not all caught up with the whole selfie thing.  I believe an awesome photographer won't sink to that level .  The other problem is when you set it to the right environment light  for oustide, the background is completely black.  So just leave it for indoor setting.  I wished I had purchased the black edition instead of the whiet because there's more visible dirt.  Either than that the camera is pretty awesome to take that old school polariod shots.","Loved it! totally worth it! :)","Everiting good","This camera is absolutely adorable! Polaroids are really making a come back! This camera is portable, easy to use, and a pretty great price compared to the prices it's sold at in stores! Highly recommend, love this camera :)","Love it~!! it was perfect","cute camera, sturdy build and everything. if only the film wasn't so expensive! however, you really need to learn how to use this camera with the whole lighting exposure settings. some of the first few pictures i took ended up way too dark or too light, even though i followed the light indicator. all in all, a great purchase, and would make an amazing gift.","It is so awsome I got it for my 12th b-day do cool your daughter or son will like this if they're into photographing Great price to iwent to Michael's craft store and it was 119.99","Such a fun and cute camera! I love it!","Perfect! Very satisfied!","The camera is GREAT! It is exactly what I wanted- instant pictures and easy to use. It is small enough to be convenient but still big enough to feel comfortable when taking pictures. The pictures themselves are a good size as they can be easily displayed or stored in a wallet. I actually was planning on buying this camera for awhile but was still considering my options. My Dad had given me his old Polaroid but the film was so expensive ($24 for 8 pictures!!). So I finally decided to purchase the Instax Mini 8 and I could not have been happier. Film is still a little expensive to keep buying but for the value pack of 50 pictures for $39, it is a much more reasonable purchase. Also, word of warning, make sure to buy film as the camera does not come with any. And if you don't want to customize the films' edges yourself, there are really nice decorative films available as well.","Really cool","So beatfull","I use this camera to take pics every few weeks in order to keep monthly journal/scrapbook for each of my kids. Makes it so convenient in a time where we have so many digital photos that we tend to store and not print out! Love this camera! A classic with a modern look!","Really fast shipping!!! I totally adore this camera. However, it doesn't come with close up len which is for taking selfie.  It doesn't matter that much though.  The camera is really light and easy to use. I am going to bring this mini 8 to my boyfriend's house during this Christmas and create some special memories with him. Can't wait !!!! Love Fuji insta mini 8 !!","My family loves it!!","I bought this as a birthday present for my wife, and she loves it! It is the perfect storm for anyone who loves pink, loves taking pictures, and loves to scrap book/commemorate occasions. The film which accompanies it is somewhat expensive, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger than their teens or as a replacement for a digital camera. It's meant for novelty and nostalgia, not for volume photography.","Just like the old Polaroid except the mini version. Pictures  are the fun size, Easy to operate, but not as compact as I would have liked.","This is such a fun little camera! I love the blue color, it is so pretty. Picture quality is decent;  for the price and for all of the things you can use the pictures for, it is a fun camera to have. I use the photos in my project life albums, in my planner, and hanging up in my craft room from a long piece of twine (with cute clips!)","Really cute pictures, easy to use, a bit hard to take pictures of yourself with, but otherwise a great camera!","Love love love","Great and fun camera! Used it to capture 'vintage looking' moments leading up to our wedding!","Nice exactly as shown in picture","I used this as a guest book at my wedding and it was perfect. Great price, great pictures, and just fun to have.","Love it, love it, love it.  I love all things retro and this camera definitely takes me back to the 80's when we had a Polaroid camera. The pictures come out looking like they were taken a decade ago but I like it, no filter needed with this camera!","My only problem is that it doesn't have an option with NO flash. But overall its a great instant camera.","Finally bought this camera, I've been thinking about this for years since I'm going on a trip to mexico soon might as well buy it. I'm really happy and it's everything I expected. Great buy! :)","The camera works really well except the only annoying thing about it is that yes it does come with the batteries for t but not with film and the film is the quite expensive part.","Very good. Thanks!","Purchased as a birthday gift for my 16 year old granddaughter. She loves it and went through 5 packages of film very quickly. Thankfully, she has slowed down a little! Her friends love the pictures and the quality is very good for a small instant camera. It definitely beats the quality that I remember from the old Polaroid cameras of 20 years ago and how you had to swipe them with a pink thing to protect the image. These pictures are very nice, a little small, but just the right size for her generation.<br /><br />You can also purchase the film with different borders and she loves that aspect of the camera. The pink color is perfect for her, it's small enough to carry in a purse or backpack and takes a lot of abuse without having. I was skeptical at first but her and her friends love it and several of them have even purchased one. A great buy - papa did good!","Such a great item! I love how it takes pictures and its easy to use! The pictures are the size of a credit card but still great!","Very retro!","I used up about 7 shots until I got the hang of it w/ the lighting I was using indoors, because the initial photos were too dark or had unacceptable glare. But there is a separate instruction sheet regarding the use of a feature inexplicably called \"Hi-Key.\" This is the key to good indoor shots! First you let the camera settle on its automatic lighting setting, & then you move the lens to the \"Hi-Key\" position (not the \"indoor\" position). This lightens up the indoor shots. Once I figured that out, all went well. I used it to take photos at a special event for a non-profit organization, & asked for donations. I had a large '59 Pink Cadillac standee that people stood behind while I snapped a photo with the Fuji. Worked very well. young kids especially liked the \"magic\" of the photo developing before their eyes!","This camera is so cute and easy to use . the pictures usually turn out great the only time there hard to see is if your in a dark lighting . But other than that this is a great camera and I love it !","Best contraption EVER! We bought this to use at our wedding for a sign in book and the pictures are so cool. They obviously look older and not anywhere near high end photography but that is what we are going for. Super light and durable.","Great camera!","Happy with the Product but disappointed it didn't come with film. The Film doesn't seem easy to find either. Havent gotten the film yet therefore haven't been able to use the Camera yet.","Great fun for our daughter! Works well, easy to use.","My daughter loves this thing. Film is expensive but you can save money buying in bulk.","Bought this for my granddaughter's 13th birthday. She loves it!","Im in love with this camera!","Its a pretty cool camera, my daughter loves it, it was a gift for her birthday, thanks.","Fun !","Perfect camera for a teenager! We got this for our niece and she has not stopped taking pictures. Her creativity has been sparked. Easy to use but obviously has some photographic limitations.  Film can get pricey.","The best toy I've bought in a while so must fun to take photos of family and pets also very cool building also. If you love the vintage Polaroid look then this is for you!!","This seller and camera are ahhhhmazing.<br /><br />And everyone has this camera, including celebrities.. SOO I guess that speaks for itself.","Everything was good","Easy as ever to use and a nice small size for traveling. Would warn the user to make sure your aperture setting is lined up to the light - I forgot to check before I took a couple photos and they came out too light. Other than that I love it!","This is an AWESOME camera for a great price. I got the pink one and it works like a dream. It comes with a wrist strap in the original, authentic box. The camera body is sturdy plastic with a smooth matte feeling and though it's a little awkward to handle when you first get it, after you play with it for a while it's just perfect in your hand. The view hole and the aperture don't line up perfectly, but with a little practice you can take professional, beautiful pictures that are easy to display and give to people.<br />I recommend this as hands down one of the best cameras I've ever used. Instant film is just nostalgic and Fujifilm nailed it. It doesn't come with film, but the five-pack box is a really good deal. I also bought a small instax mini photo album to keep my pictures in.<br />Best purchase of the year!","does it come with film? I really want to buy it but idk if I comes with film or not","Such an awesome camera. Lightweight and just as i expected. Make sure to let your picture develop in the dark or it won't develop! The suggested settings aren't always right so you need to find what works and what doesn't but it's fairly easy to do so. Would definitely reccomend!","Great pictures and good photo resolution.","This was a perfect camera for sleep away camp where electronics are prohibited.","Excellent quality and easy to use!","The product is quite wonderful. It's a great size; it's very light and small enough to fit in my purse. The photos are vintage-y and surprisingly good quality. I'd been warned ahead of time that Polaroid photo quality was terrible, so I was pleasantly surprised by how my first photo turned out. Granted, they aren't the quality of a Canon EOS, but they're still very nice. They are on the smaller side, however. They're about the size of a credit card, not the slightly larger ones usually associated with Polaroid photos. The camera doesn't come with film, I realized. For immediate use, purchase the film packets and the camera at the same time. The camera is very easy to use. Just click a button, and the photo slides up at the top. Overall, it's honestly one of my favorite purchases. It's a lot of fun, and it gets a good response out of people around me. With realistic expectations, it won't disappoint.","Cool camera!","This is my first time EVER writing a review on amazon, but I just wanted to let anyone know who's curious about this camera that it's a GREAT purchase! It came the exact day it said it would and takes awesome pictures! I absolutely love my fuijifilm camera! I just got it yesterday and I can't wait to start taking photos of memories and with friends. This is a great investment!","I'm in LOVE with this camera! I've always wanted a polaroid and was very indecisive about which one to get, but I definitely don't regret getting this one. There's different settings for brightness and it's a bit confusing at first, but if you read the manual, you'll be fine. Not only do my pictures turn out great, but when I'm not using this camera, I set it on my desk and it's just such a pretty camera.","It's a really cute color and at such an affordable price! I wish Fujifilm would make more colors though. I will definitely buy another camera if they make a lavender one!","This camera works great. The only catch is that the film is back ordered on Amazon and hasn't shipped from our order from two weeks ago. I checked all the Best Buy's, Walmarts etc and they are all sold out of the film. I found out the Polaroid 300 uses the exact same film, but it's about 30 cents more per picture. I went and bought some from Target and the Polaroid 300 film, in fact, works with this Fujifilm instax Mini 8 camera.","very adorable","I love this camera! I have wanted a polaroid camera for a while now, and when I saw this one, I went for it, and I think it was a great investment. Easy to use, cute and takes good pictures!","Nice!","I love love LOVE this camera!! Great price, fast shipping! I love that you instantly get a picture, very good for having an instant keepsake. The credit card sized prints are perfect for keepsakes, memory books, and party favors! The picture quality is pretty decent for an instant camera that has automatic settings. The pictures come out clear and have a unique look about them. Very simple to use. In some situations, the flash is a bit bright, but some masking tape over the flash will help dull it, as well as give a unique filter to the shot. And you always get the 'wow' factor when you snap an instant shot on a night out.<br />I would definitely recommend this product!","My niece that just graduated from High School Loved this Little Camera she took a photo with film I also bought her and its Adorable.","Awesome and practical","This is the same camera that everyone wants but costs less! There are no zoom capabilities. Just point and shoot.","Love it","for our hollidays it was good","Saved up for this beauty and it was worth it! The pink camera online looks a bit too toyish but in real life it is a pastel pink that is super cute! Some people might say this looks like a toy camera, but hey, at least when you bring it outdoors theres a lesser chance of it being stolen cause its a \"toy\" appearance! Came in a solid cardboard box and safely bubble wrapped. Includes 2 batteries and manuals. It's a great camera to have! I love everything about it.","The 12-year old granddaughter loves this little camera.  The film is a bit expensive, but this age group loves the pictures they get and they can put them in their scrapbooks.  It is a clever, little camera, perfect for younger kids.","Amazing and just right!","i like","I love this camera for take and give photos, I just wish the lens was a little better to give a little sharper pics. It's ok, and I suppose that adds to the charm but I wish I would have bought the $150 one which gives a little nicer results.","Great little camera! Fun and easy to use! Perfect for all occasions!","Love it","So Awesome!! It's adorable and very easy to use and load film into. I've taken over 20 pictures so far! Just a quick note on photography with this camera- it doesn't work very well at closeups, its blurry or washed out if you get too close. However, it does say that its range starts at .5m, so that's not their fault :). Love it!","Great and fun camera!","I bought this mostly for nostalgic reasons. It is a fun little camera. The photos are SMALL and have that sort of 70s patina. Not great photos but fun to use. My daughter strings all her little snaps along a wire in her room and together they look really cool.","Love this camera, worth every dollar","Excellent!!!!","This was a birthday present for my 13 year old granddaughter. She loved it. I was surprised at how clear the pictures were.","Works great!","Bought this for my daughter's birthday.  She absolutely loves it!  Who would have thought kids today would like old school type cameras.  But it's cute and takes pictures almost like a photo booth but you don't have to be sitting in it.","My daughter wanted this old school instant developing camera for her 9th birthday and she loves it! Note, film has proven a bit challenging to obtain while traveling.","Amazing Camera! Shipping was so quick! I ordered it on a Tuesday and it arrived on Thursday! I would definitely recommend!","Absolutely the best purchase I have ever made on Amazon. This is the coolest camera, and all of my friends are jealous! The film is a little steep in price, but I buy the film on Amazon so it's not so bad. But if you're thinking of buying this product, I recommend it! It's especially great for parties and wedding registry ideas.","i like it","LOVE this camera. It's so cute, and it's just awesome taking instant credit card sized photos.","Perfect for my daughter","love it just what I expected","My daughter loved it ... Amazing gift !!! Retro style and modern concept !!!","Love my new instax mini it is adorable just like the picture I ordered the camera and the twin pack of 10 film things in each, got all of this for a great price can't beat that anywhere else, shipping was fast and my items arrived safe & sound :)","Amazing love it !","Love my new camera!","Im a photographer and this is one of my favorite cameras!","Fun little camera! My teenager loved it","Just received my camera and live everything about it! oh! And also amazing quality pics!!","Very easy to use! And it's fun!! Came very very fast also!","A little disappointed that the camera doesn't come with film but the camera itself is very cute and affordable!","it was for my girlfriend. She love takes pictures and offcourse she loves this camera. Perfect for special and beauty photos. :D","Cute fun","I love using this because it is so adorable and easy to use!","I purchased this camera and film for my granddaughter's 13th birthday, she loves it. Just wish the pictures were larger, like the old cameras.","Best purchase ever <3","My daughter absolutely loves it!","I love the camera, but I really ended it for a specific event and when we ordered it it said the camera would be on time and then we called and they ensures us it would make it in time for our event. But it didn't show up until 3 days after","This product is just so awesome!!!!!!!! But the films cost more......","I was looking for a camera to just take Polaroids and save them for memories. Then my friend showed me this one and i fell in love immediately. It's perfect. Photos are smaller than regular Polaroids but I think that's what makes them special and cute. Quality is fine. You have to realize is not a digital professional camera. But I love how old and vintage the photos look.","I love it! It's working very good. It is a good product! I recommend.","I am smitten with this Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Camera.  I owned a Polaroid instant camera as a teenager and used it all the time.  This camera is so cute and light.  I purchased the baby pink color.  The photographs are credit card size.  This camera is a great Birthday or Christmas gift.  You can use the photographs as place card settings at a dinner. You will love this camera.","Love the color so much","It's so cute! I am having a lot of fun with it. The pictures aren't perfect as the digital camera but they still look great.","Very nice color and good quality, the only thing wrong is the first one sent got lost in the mail and it just took a little longer than expected to get here.","Product not as shown. It just says Instax mini 8. Thought that was weird. I dropped it a couple of days after I got it and the lens came out. Super difficult to find anyone who can repair an instax mini. Not sure if it comes with any warranty.","Really glad I bought this polaroid. Went on a weekend trip to Philly with a few friends and brought this camera along. We had an awesome time taking some vintage looking photos. The film is about the size of business card, and the photos come out really beautiful! The camera senses the type of setting you're in and shows you what the camera should be on. Definitely saved us on wasting film. Really light weight, and beautifully made.","love this camera and works well. only thing i dont like is the auto-flash (yeah i know i know) cuz i actually like to adjust the light settings manually.","So glad that I bought it! Does exactly what I wanted and the price was right.","This camera is great! I've already snapped so many photos and it works very well. No problems at all. Easy to load and operate. One of my favorite purchases","Pictures come out so well! And it's adorable! The small size makes it easy to carry with you wherever you go!","love it","Love it!!!! So cute and perfect","I love it the color it so cute!  the pictures come out so good!","Love The camera!","I LOVE LOVE LOVEEEE THIS CAMERA. It's so cute and it comes in so many cool colors. I got the yellow one and I'm not disappointing. It's a nice pail/pastel yellow. I like how it has the different lighting options, so the picture doesn't ever come out to bright or dark if you set it to the right mode. I was conused on how to turn it on when I first got it all you have to do is press the button next the the lens the a little red light will start blinking next to the view finder and when you want to turn it off if you just press the lens back in and vuala! The only thing I'm ehh about it that you can't turn off the flash.<br />Definitely recommend this camera, every one should have one of these bad boys (:","Great!","Love it cutest camera get so many compliments only down is not so great in dark areas","Amazing camera I love it!!!","This is a wonderful camera. I ordered it with film so that I could use it immediately and I have had 0 regrets about it since delivery. The box it came in was so light I thought they forgot to put the camera in! It turns out that the camera itself is very made of very lightweight plastic, yet it's very durable and easy to clean. I ordered the pink color and it's true to the pictures. No shimmer or anything. Just a milky matte pink. In the box, there were plenty of instructions in many languages varying from English to Chinese and French. Not that you would really need detailed instructions since it's just a point and shoot camera, but it's nice to have. Included with the camera are batteries and a wrist strap in a color that matches the camera. It unfortunately does not come with film of its own so you will need to order it separately (the Twin packs are a good deal if you plan on buying many packs at once).  The camera itself functions very well and is convenient to use because it tells you which setting is best for which lighting so the likelihood of you wasting costly film is very low! The shots are exactly the size of a credit card, and the back of the box the camera comes in gives you an actual size estimate before you take a picture. Photo quality is very good! Very vintage and cute. They develop within the minute too.<br /><br />Overall a very good buy! Would 10/10 recommend to anyone interested in an instant camera!<br /><br />TIPS ON TAKING PICTURES!!<br />? the viewfinder doesn't accutately predict the picture due to its positioning, so for best accuracy, move the lens slightly right and up to get the center you want<br /><br />? take care not to cover to two holes next to the flash because those are the light sensors that will determine optimal flash.<br /><br />? you cannot turn the flash off!! at all. to remedy this, I reccomend taking a small piece of white electrical tape and covering the flash to soften the light instead when necessary.<br /><br />? the hi key option is similar to the high beams of a car. It's there but you won't ever really need it. use it when the auto sensor is on indoors to produce a lighter looking picture.","(:","Love it","Very good camera","Instax mini 8 is great. I dont have any problen with it. But 'fujifilm' is not written at the write place as it is on original fujifilm instax 8. So i think it may not be original but its quality is good also shipping is fast and true color","My daughter loves her camera.  It takes great pictures.  We love it!","Pictures come out beautiful. I bought this for my daughters future wedding and we tested it out and took a few photos. She loved them. Will use as a extra camera for the photos taken with props.","Great camera...love it!","Excellent conditions","LOVE OUR NEW CAMERA.. IT IS GREAT  FOR FUN PICTURES AND TAKES AMAZING PHOTOS","I absolutely love this camera! I just got it yesterday and it is just wonderful so far. (: It looks so classy and take wonderful pictures. The setting help a lot too. Just don't forget to order film when you order this because its doesn't come with it. (:","So far no regrets! My daughter loves her camera. To me the photos are small and not very clearly focused, but my daughter likes the small size and believes the not-so-sharp image is what makes the photo look retro.","It came well packed and in a great condition, just as I was expecting. I havent had the chance to try it and see if its working perfectly, but so far I am very pleased!","Fun little camera. Got exactly what I paid for and I am happy.","Fits the description","It was great!!","I bought this for my wife as a random surprise after we saw someone with one at a wedding.  She absolutely loves it!!  The quality of the pictures is incredible.","I am in love with this camera!! I was bugging my boyfriend about it an he got it for me as a birthday gift and its both the best choice and worst mistake he has made because it keeps me happy but my film supply is paid for by him :) everyone always has something cool to say when i take it to parties and everyone loves taking pictures so much sweeter than a camera phone","Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it, I bought her the twin pack of instant film as well.<br />This makes a GREAT gift for any girl really.","Super freaking cute~ for my 13 year old sister, and even for myself. I bought it originally for me since I was in love with these. My little sister wanted the blue one and I had originally at the end loved the yellow color. I love the pastel colors for the polaroid cameras! they make them even cuter with that e girly touch! I just bought a yellow one -lol 5/5 Product!","It is very simple to use, and is an eye catcher. I love to use it, It makes me really happy. Well worth the money. Don't buy it at Urban Outfitters.","It's super cute!! It is in perfect condition and my new favorite thing !!","My niece LOVES this camera!  She's having a ball taking all kinds of pictures and posting them in creative ways.","It doesn't take pictures at the beaches, don't try you'll just waste film. But overall it's my bestfriend I love it.<br />-Why take a picture with your phone and eventually delete it when you can freeze a moment and keep it forever. Yes, they are such things as digital but some people are too lazy to print them at a store that they store them in a computer and forget about them.  Why go through the same struggle when you can have it printed right then and there?","Great price! Love it!","Best purchase I've ever made. Absolutely love it!","I love this camera the photos are so clear and vintage looking","daughter loving her instant camera, very cute too :)","So cute!<br />I love it! I can't wait to accessorize mine!

She loved it.","Came super fast and everything was just perfect. Highly recommend it.","Easy to use. Could be a bit easier to understand the lighting setups.","Absolutely love it. If you enjoy taking pictures this camera is perfectt! The delivery was pretty quick!  And The pictures come out looking kinda vintage, despite the picture size this camera was exactly what I was looking for!!","This is wonderful! I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!!!","Surprised my daughter with this camera and she loves it!  I love all the different film options. Very easy to use and so much fun!","Perfect condition!","Great camera! So much fun, you just have to learn how to use it correctly. At first you may waste one, two, or three films (which are kind of pricey) trying to figure out how to use the camera. Do not open the back once you have inserted film!!!","I love this camera! It's just like a Polaroid but the pics are credit card size. It will be perfect for my event.","Awesome! Fast shipping...great quality!","I love this camera!  I initially purchased it to quickly take pictures of my shoes in order to place it on the clear plastic box I keep them in.  But I love it especially for things like family reunions and children parties.  I have to hide it from my nieces, who not only love the color but love having a picture within minutes of taking it.","Very fast shipping - item is as described.","need more film, kids love taking pictures","I am having so much fun with my Mini! It truly was a great purchase.","Very cute, delivered on time, exactly what I expected. Took another rater's advice and purchased twin pack film, best deal.  Perfect for a 9 year old girl.","Luv the camera.. They sent me the wrong color camera","I purchased this as a gift for my daughter who simply loves photography, Its now one of her favorite pieces","Was my granddaughters request but when it was paired up with the case and album it was more than she expected and is loving it.","My girlfriend is fascinated with this camera, it was a great gift.","I love my instax mini!","It was for my daughter who is 13 and she loves it. It certainly is a novelty item though. She has used it pretty much continuously. It is basically a polaroid type camera, just a little smaller.","Great! !!!!","I bought this to make decorations for my dorm room--it works great, the pictures come out really well (except sometimes when I take pictures of my kittens, but that's because they move so fast), and it only takes about 3 minutes or so for the pictures to develop. Only problem is that I can't figure out how to turn off the flash, but that's probably just me.","My daughter loves this camera!","This is a really cute camera , it doesn't come with film, (I read discription) but it took so long , it was supposed to come 5 days before but it had a delivery attempt which sucked, but it's a cute camera , I'll probably order film from here","This product is fun. The only thing that's annoying is the light setting. The camera change's it's preferred lighting often and you have to make sure you change it to that setting before taking the pic.","Love it!","thank you","Best purchase!!!!  This is great for parties, great for craft projects!","the kids loved it","I am so inlove with my camera!<br />It's the best.","its perfect for vacation it prints the photo out the minute you take it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! also the camera its self is very cute","In  love with my camera!

But is you are a creative person this camera is for you, because is ideal for scrapbooking.","It is actually a really good camera! You can take really beautiful photos and they come out perfect. But I only have on complaint. When you take a photo of for example a sunset, and point directly at the sun, the photo doesnt reveal. And blue dots appear on the paper... :/","We absolutely love this. Great Christmas gift :)","LOVE THE CAMERA. I wish the pictures were bigger but I did know that they would be credit card sized before I bought it so I shouldn't complain.<br /><br />Best money I ever spent.

I love it!","My sister loves it. The only thing she wants is to be able to turn the flash off sometimes","So happy I got this camera! Works well and isn't complicated to use. Been using it with my friends and my fiance. It just has that fun nostalgic feel to each photo. :)","LOVE LOVE LOVE this camera!  Perfect for any occasion! ???","Growing up I thought Polaroids were really cool and always wanted one.I had seen this camera on tumblr and some of my favorite youtubers had it, thought it was adorable, but I always thought it would cost more then this, so I never bothered to look it up. However when I graduated from high school I had been giving quite a bit for grad money decided to look up how much they were and I was very happily surprised with the cost.  For me this was perfect it; was super cute, good priced, easy to use, and well, instant.<br /><br />For me this camera does a lot, with just graduating high school this is the last summer I will see half my friends, so every moment counts. Why not take some awesome pictures to have it saved forever? The pictures are easy to take a few shots hand em' out, then everyone has them with them in our dorms. Well not the cheapest thing to do out there, it means so much more. I showed it to all my friends and they want a camera too, some are even geting one!<br /><br />Well I don't think that the pictures are perfect, I don't mind. They do want they need to and they give off a bit of a retro vibe. Sometimes I am a bit washed out but I don't know if it is the camera or because I am insanely pale, I do have this problem with digital cameras too. I don't really seem to have any problems with blurryness, but I don't take anything too too close up. It did everything I wanted so I am more then happy. The price of film is not favorable but not too high, well there are certainly cheaper was to take some pictures, this is the most fun and cute.","I received my camera on Wednesday & I ordered it on Sunday. It came super fast & it was padded real well. I've been debating on getting one but it's well worth the money! The only thing bad is how expensive the films are!! Save your films & buy when there around $13! Not $20!!! Super easy & I'm very obsessed with it ! Will be buying as gifts for people!","I've been wanting this camera for so long. Bought it for myself as a graduation present. Definitely worth it. Every picture is beautiful and the camera itself is adorable and fashionable. It's very user friendly. Lots of different limited edition films to collect too. It would make a great gift for anybody.","love love love it!!! and fast delivery..","Great value for $","Awesome little camera!! Its fun and easy to use. The small circle in the view finder in my opinion is not really centered when the actual picture comes out. Therefore aim slightly above the little circle and your pictures should come out just fine :)","Super cute and easy to use!<br />The pictures are really mini; about the size of the palm of your hand.<br />Everyone is always really interested in it and always want to have their picture taken.","Bought this as a gift for my niece and she loved it... great gift for a teenage girl!","Worked great for our wedding reception diy photo booth!","My sister loves it!! Better & cheaper price on here than urban outfitters!!","Had so much fun with this on vacation. Film quality isn't very good.  Lighting has to be just right.","This is such a fun camera and our four year loves to have pictures immediately, rather than wait for mommy to order them. I used the pictures from this and a \"smashbook\" for a guest book at my sister's baby shower recently. It was SO awesome!! The guests all took pictures with my sister and then decorated a page in the book and wrote a note for mama and baby for later on. Totally recommend this camera, it is so much fun.","I bought this camera and the blue case for my granddaughter for her birthday along with a variety of film. She loved it and immediately began to take pictures.  Great purchase for a 13 year old.","The camera is fun and I love making excuses to get a chance to use this :) my only complaint is that it's very hard to get a good picture indoors unless it's well lit. Even if the subjects come out well, the background might completely be dark. Or the background is fine but the subjects are freakishly bright. Also the flash is always on, haha. But I guess that's just how these Polaroids are so it's not really the Polaroids problem. Overall, it's doing exactly what I bought it for, so I can't complain :) it's lighter than I thought too","Came with batteries which was great and an adorable little wrislet so you can hold it on your wrist. The pink is such a pretty pastel, I regularly get comments on this camera. What a neat vintage idea this camera is!","I am totally in love with every photo that I take with it. It's very easy to operate and absolutely worth it.","Quality equipment, not cheap junk I had seen by another mfg","Just received this little camera and I love it!! I ordered the film along with the camera so I can start using it right away. The camera is pretty easy to use and the included instructions are easy to follow. I was pleasantly surprised to find the lighting settings on the camera because I wasn't aware that this nifty little camera had that capability. So far I've used it indoors as well as outdoors and the pictures turned out so well! I love that the polaroids have such a vintage feel to them and look forward to using them to decorate my dorm room soon :) PS. I got the pink one and its just as cute as it is in the picture. I plan to put the camera on a bookshelf to add a nice pop of color to my room!","Great, fun little camera!","Beautiful","Got this for my 13 year old granddaughter who is enjoying it very much. She loves to see the pictures develop in front of her. The pictures are small, but evidently this is what she likes about it.","Very trendy. Daughter loves it. Got to play around with distance and lighting so get extra film.","Very pleased","Easy to use & very handy to carry or in your bag. Fast startup.","its all fun time again with this camera XD small easy, of course the film is pain to pay off, but hey if u love fun stuff, and don't expected super high quality photo..its instant camera...mean to be a fun camera :D","excellent. was big into polaroid but couldnt afford the film from overseas thru impossible project. this is an even better alternative","This camera made me excited as a 5 years old child. I recommend everyone to buy it and enjoy the memories!!","Gave it a 4 star because I didn't know the pictures would come out so small but it's still a good camera and I use it would recommend if you dont mind the pictures being on the smaller side","nice product","My friend got one of these yesterday and I've been wanting one for a while but I wanted to make sure it actually worked good! It's awesome. The pictures come out so good! So I ordered one last night and I came home the next day and it was on my front porch. Super quick delivery and the cameras amazing!","great","Great camera. You have to make sure that the camera is on the right setting before taking the picture. Pictures from far away aren't very clear and the polaroid film is quite small so it is difficult to see people more than 3 meters away. Also make sure that your fingers aren't covering the light sensors because it will mess up the exposure. Overall, it is such a fun camera to use and it is a crowd pleaser.","Love how you can take a picture and have a concrete copy of it on the spot! The only downside to this is that the film is a bit expensive, but it's worth the fun you'll have with this camera. Super careful packaging when it arrived and on time too! Everything about this camera is amazing.","thank you.","best thing i purchased !!","Perfect conditions and resonable priceing. Best camera i've bought.","its a hit!!! everyone loves taking mini photos!!!! great at parties!!","Love it! Film isn't too pricey either!","Loved everything about this camera.  The pictures come out great! it really exceeded my expectations!","AMAZING! so cute! and so cheap! had to buy one for my friend and one for myself! the light sensitivity switch is a bit odd since that light on there doesn't move with you when switching to another mode but it works just fine, just a lil design flaw, not a product flaw. It's kid friendly and elderly friendly. anyone can use it and its pretty enduring. ONE SLIGHT DOWNSIDE: the peephole where you would look to take a photo of someone else is kinda off. sometimes the angle on point and some times its off. because the actual lens where it takes the photo is so far away on the camera from the hole you look through, the angles are gonna be slightly off all the time (better for selfies and closeups). but that is something that can be corrected over use and familiarity of how the angles work.","nice picture and the camera 's form","I Love It<br />I Love It<br />I Love It<br />I Am In A Honey Moon With My Camera!","Its soo cute i love it:)","Bought this as a gift for a teen. Been working well for over six months now.","The flash in the day time outside isn't nice but the overall quality is nice.","It's everything my dreams thought it would be and more. I find myself longingly staring at it with much joy. Thank you for fulfilling my dreams","The best camera ever. It is great.","Super cute photos from a super cute camera. I get compliments on it and I am always asked where I got it. Although the camera feels almost toy like, the pictures look great!","I really think this is a good camera","This camera works well for taking pictures at birthdays, special events, and silly pictures with friends and family. I love how the film is cheaper for the polaroid instant film camera. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants an instant print camera for fun. Totally worth what it's priced.","Good product,  fast shipping!","Was so happy to get such a good price and fast shipping,it was as said and pictured when revived, it was a present for a friend but she said she loves it. Very happy","I love this camera. It's so cute and fun! I'm still learning how to use it. Took some cute pictures on my trip!","Perfect camera. Love it so much.","Wonderful quality. I gave it to my sister and she loves it. It prints awesome photos.","I like this camera. It does what the description says. It doesn't come with any film but the description doesn't say it does. The pictures it takes are like the old instant polaroid pictures except they are a little smaller. It makes for fun little pictures instantly. Its not suppose to take amazing pictures and print them off instantly. Read the quality in the description before you buy it. If you are looking for amazing perfectly clear pictures then don't be an idiot and expect a $60 instant film camera to work for you. It got delivered when it was suppose to and works like it is suppose to.","Good camera takes decent pictures the flash is not as bright as a you wanted it to be also turning it on you have to pull the camera lens which I think is not as smart because it may damage it but it does the job","I bought it as a present for my best friend and it was SO CUTE! Everyone who sees her with it end up wanting one too, me included!","We had a lot of fun with this camera at my wedding and we also have a nice archive of pictures that were pasted into the guestbook. I guess my only qualm about the product is that I don't imagine using it a lot in the future; it is large and the film is somewhat expensive, so it sits on our shelf for now—perhaps we will revisit it.","totally love this camera, super cute and super fun!","Love this. We are using this for taking pictures for a guest book at our wedding, and of course we had to give it some practice before the big day. We've thoroughly enjoyed taking pictures with it. The setting indicators are really helpful -- and so far they have always been correct. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun and easy way to take snapshots","Does its Job.","Two thumbs up ","I LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!<br />It's the first polaroid I ever owned, and Im loving it. It's adorable, light weight, and easy to use. Play with the settings a bit, and get yourself familiarized.","It's adorable! I love it! It's true to the color online.","Good","I bought this camera for my birthday, it came in as expected and in great shape! The only down side to it is Amazon gave me the wrong order. I ordered the original version camera and i have the recipes on amazon to prove my clame. Amazon unfortunately gave me the limited edition version which you can buy on Amazon, this disappointed me because i didnt care for the poka dotted arm strap, i just wanted the original arm strap version (limited edition was cheaper so didnt get fair sale). Also the labal on the front right ONLY says Instax mini 8. Ive done my research well enough to know its suppose to say fujifilm instax mini 8. The only reason why im giving this a 4 star is because it works great as original, its just not what i ordered. I still wish i had gotten what i paid for the original, but i guess this'll have to do.","used for our destination wedding photo booth and it turned out great","Love it! Cute and trendy camera.","Okay so this Polaroid is amazing. The shipping was fast and it was 100 dollars well spent( that's including two boxes of film and taxes). The quality is great. I wish I would have gotten a different color but that's my fault lol. It kind of looks too childish for me, I'm already 19 and look 16 but any who... It is super easy to use and I am so excited to use it this fourth of July weekend.","Awesome","Such a cool little invention! My daughter LOVES this thing, when she's a good girl I can get her film!","My daughter was bouncing off the walls when she got this!","works as it is suppose to.","It's so exciting and fun when taking pictures with this instax mini 8 camera! ;))<br />The photos come out crisp, clear,  and very well detailed. Good for a very cheap price. Had to mess with some films a little to know how to control the lighting and composure, a tad bit difficult. Used about 17 films after just receiving it (so much fun!). The films are so pricey but it's worth the money. Cute yet very trendy right now, especially for the teens. Loving the vintage look, was hard to look for these kind of cameras nowadays.<br /><br />Edit: For people who are saying the fujifilm camera is fake, it clearly says fujifilm on the top where the picture comes out.","My daughters birthday present and she thinks it cool even though I had one 30 years ago","Love the cute camera. Saw it at a friends place, got it and it is so adorable.Everyone around me loves it too. Brings me back the old film camera days","Cool camera for fun pics. Not for taking a lot of pictures unless you have a lot of refills. Pictures are size of a credit card and good quality.","Bought this camera for my daughter's wedding reception. We heard of others using the camera for guests to snap their picture and hang them up. Kind of a different thing to do instead of a guest book. So after purchasing the camera and film, we really didn't know how to display the pics in a way that would please us. Decided the whole idea was stupid. As the wedding approached we were going to just ditch the idea. Since it was to late to return the camera we reluctantly decided to make something anyways. So we covered a foam board with photo album paper and added burlap lace over that, inserted the board in a 24 x 36 frame. We used spring loaded mini clothes pins to hang the pics. Figured that was the end of that....nope it was a huge hit. EVERYONE loved it!! The pictures are really cute and the guests had fun taking them. The camera was in demand the whole night and guests were waiting to get a turn. We just let it float around, no need to monitor it. The quality is not bad for a poloriod camera. (And we are a family of professional photographers.) The pictures are about the size of a credit card  and the camera is simple to use. Anyone can use it. So glad we did this, definitely recommend this camera!","Ahmazingggg.. i have been wanting one of these cameras for a while.. i had actually been looking for a vintage instant camera.. i saw this and fell in love... the pink is alot brighter online but i knew it would be and i wanted the more pastel pink! I love the matte finish of it too! It comes with batts and a strap also! It came super fast, a day earlier then i thought it would! they packaged it nicely and securely. I am so excited to take some great pics!","I gave it to my daughter as a present and she loved it. She would take pictures with her friends and the places she goes to. She would take pictures for memories and decorate her room. She said it was the best and its really easy to use. If you have a teen age daughter I would highly recommend it to you.","Exactly as described. Works perfectly fine. Its been two months now and has no problem with it so far ^_^","I bought this camera for an upcoming trip because I wanted something a little nostalgic that was easy to carry around. While it of course did not replace having a digital camera, it was fantastic. I'm still learning what the best settings for the light are, but so far I've gotten some amazing and unique photographs. Plus, I'm able to give pictures away to the people who are in them as a wonderful little souvenir. The film develops clearly and the camera is small enough and light enough to put in a medium sized purse. Children from elementary to teenage years think it is the most fascinating device and LOVE getting to watch the film develop and keep it. Although, after a week of camping it's looking a little worn. I don't mind, but if you're not one for dust or finger stains and don't want to have to wipe it down a lot I would recommend a case or a different color.","this camera is awesome!! it came in the right amount of time and no damage whatsoever.","I absolutely LOVE my new fugifilm! I recently used it at a bridal shower for the photo booth and it is brilliant!! Everyone asked where I got it from. The only doenside is how expensive the film can be. The film goes fast because of all the fun to be had!! It is definitely a good time for people of all ages.","Love it! Got to my house very quickly, within a couple of days! Resonable price and the camera works great. Only knocked off a star because the white is a little bit hard to keep clean. Always touch it with clean hands.","What I really loved was how fast it came in ! I was going on a trip to disneyland and was hoping it would come in before I left and it did ! Very happy !","Personally, I think that this camera is such a great investment! I'm still testing to see how each setting affects different lighting environments but it's so great to bring to trips or casual outings. Originally I did not think that this camera was practical since each frame costs almost $1, but I've grown to love it nonetheless. Makes you treasure each photo more. The battery life is also great! The fujifilm website sites that each battery set (2 AA)  lasts for about 3 film packs but I've gone through 4 or 5 film packs with the same batteries. I also considered instax mini 7s but this instax mini 8 is a better upgrade for about the same price.  I didn't really care for paying $30 more for macro, separate shutter buttons for horizontal or vertical photos, or a selfie \"mirror\" so instax mini 25 wasn't my thing. I hang my polaroids with twine and wooden clothespins on my wall and it looks fabulous.","It's perfect for the project I'm doing!! The only thing is remember to do the settings right and to take the picture in bright light.  Doesn't really work indoors or in darker settings!  But it does take really awesome little pictures that are really fun!","I love it! Very cute pictures. I plan to use it to take pictures for a travel scrapbook I plan to make during my vacation.","just wooow. i love taking pictures with my boyfriend with this camera they come out so perfect amazing memories to hold","I adore this camera. There is something so great about being able to take a picture and not being able to edit it or slap a filter on it. It just is what it is. The film size is also perfect for wallet photos too!","the pics come out nice,though would have liked the pics to be little bigger, but just love it..<br />its like soo cool to have it wid friends around..and everybody jus loved it!!!..:)))))","Color is good, photo quality is great. Cannot focus on objects too close to the camera (within 1 meter). Another problem is what you see in the viewer will shift a bit to the left on the photo.","Excellent product and I really liked my expectation filled the qualify because everything arrived as requested I really I liked all the pretty enough to recommend to all the community through Amazon not change.<br /> would recommend vendor to other to purchase their much needed items, i really like the service and the products that i have received.","I got this for my sons 7 year old birthday and he was in love. The film is decently priced. I have an older Polaroid he used to use and the film is hard to come by now.","My 11 yr. old son saved his money to buy this instant camera. He really has a blast using it. It's so easy to use. I'm considering buying one for myself. The pictures come out really neat. He loves it.","It's a very good camera you just need to take pictures in a very well lighted room so the pictures, good otherwise the dark and look like pictures from the 70s. Also the pictures are small so make sure that you are aware of how small the pictures","I love this thing. I am definitely not one of those canon camera type people. Don't get me wrong their pictures can be beautiful but I enjoy the convenience of not having to upload photos, fix them, send them, and pick up and pay process. Let me just say, I never develop them. Plus, if I want a detailed pictures to look at I'll just take it on my I-phone where I can control a lot more, duh.<br /><br />The quality of the pictures is really cute and slightly retro looking. The camera is always catching peoples attention especially because it looks like a little toy. And I have so much fun taking pictures with my friends. The only down side is you can't make copies of that one photo, I guess that's an upside too, you have fun trying to recreate that photo. This camera is also really convenient for travel, I think people wont try to steal it as much since it's not a professional camera. It's a reasonable price on amazon and if ever stolen the robber will have to spend more money to get more pictures.","I really like the item, it was in mint condition but I wish the film was included with the package instead of buying it separately","I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! THE COLOR IS SO BEAUTIFUL! ALSO IT CAME 4 DAYS EARLIER THAN WHAT I EXPECTED. I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT! IM SO GLAD I BOUGHT IT!","Shipping took longer than i thought, but it was worth the wait. It's a very cute camera, although I don't know why there was a thirty dollar price difference when comparing the pink with the blue one. Blue was my first choice, but I went with the cheaper pink. This camera is fun to use, I'm just mindful of what I choose to take pictures of because the film is the pricey point of this camera. I bought the (2) 10x2 packs for $13 each. As one of the other reviews said, that is a better deal than some of the big bundles out there. It's easy to use, but beware it takes some time to figure out how to center a picture since the viewfinder doesnt line up with the lens. Also, the flash is very bright. I found that it washed out a lot of my indoor pictures. I taped over it with some masking tape just to tone it down a bit. Other than that,  it is a fun camera and if you dont mind shelling out money for film then this is a good product","I bought this camera for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it. It is nice size and just what we expected. Pictures come out nice as well.","I absolutely love this camera! It is just the cutest thing ever, and the picture's come out great! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!","Camera was the hit of the party along with a variety of props....instant Photo Booth!  Everyone had a photo to take home to remember the event.","I have fallen in love with this, it's a cheap and cute camera and plain adorable. It's small, which makes it easy to carry around. Easy to understand, and I love how the pictures turn out. It has been the best things have ever bought from Amazon and I will be getting more stuff from fujifilm.","Luv it, pretty heavy & durable. The color is really cute. Worth what I paid for it. Wish it came with case","I have been looking for a polaroid camera for ages and well, a lot of them are pretty pricey. I have seen these cameras all over the internet and noticed that many people have been buying them. I decided to take it upon myself to purchase one as well and let me tell you... I was not disappointed. This camera is easy to understand and its cute! What more could you ask for? The pictures may be small but it is a MINI instant film camera for a reason.<br />I say buy it now! It's great! <3<3<3","i ordered.this beautiful camera as a birthday gift for my daughter and it really arrived  on time so my daughter enjoyed it present and I am a very glad daddy. Thank you for this Good product and delivery.","once you recieve it is great but it did take forever to receive but it is very nice and alot of fun to use","I had major envy when my sister came home with this camera and its so AMAZING I had to get myself one. The look and feel of these photos are so cool and vintage i love them. Worth the buy for all ages.","amazing camera love how nice and clear the pictures come out is also a very good price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love the size small and cute","I love this little camera and it's a great camera. It's perfect for decorating and scrape booking. If you are into crafts and looking to create vintage look I would recommend this camera!!","My daughter loved it.  Only thing after awhile it gets very heavy on her tiny shoulders.  Other than that it took great photos and whenever she brought it out at Disneyland, people would look and check her and her camera out.  Very cute and love the color pink.","This camera is very good quality for the price. I love the colour and the pictures come out great (just make sure you use the right setting)! The only downside is the price of the film but overall great purchase!!","I liked this camera a lot. Well, any Polaroid really. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that it's a mini. I would try to take a big group picture but it wouldn't get everyone. So I ended up selling it, since I couldn't return it, and bought a Hello Kitty Wide one and I have no regrets.","using at my wedding for a \"photo table\" item.. .and it is perfect! My colors are blue and white and it is perfect!","My youngest always wanted an instamatic film camera. Told her good luck because they don't make film anymore for them. (we have an old one). Surprise! After searching on amazon, found this one. It fit the bill because it also had to be pink. She really enjoys the camera and her friends have had fun sharing the pictures.","This thing is like my baby! The pictures are so fun. I got it as an alternative for my Polaroid Land Camera, since film is much more pricey for it than the Instax mini. Super good buy; the camera is light, adorable, very portable, and easy to use. The only thing is when I switch modes, the light doesn't move too. It still functions the same though :*","absolutely love this! shipping was super quick and the camera was packaged well! also the camera is amazing! loved that it came with batteries :)love love love <3","So I have the fujifilm instax mini 8 in yellow. It is an amazing camera but there are a few things I found that set it back. The camera works well and has a nice selection of settings. One problem I find most frustrating is that when you use the camera inside it doesn't come out as well. Natural light works best.<br /><br /> Another thing to think about before you purchase the camera is the long term costs. The film costs about $0.73-$1.20 per picture. If you wanted to make an album of about 100 pictures you would be looking at about $100 + the cost of the album.<br />One great thing about the camera is that it's versatile. It works well in dark places and in light places. It has 5 settings : indoors, cloudy, sunny, very sunny, and hi key. They all work as promised but you can't use them in the wrong lighting. For example, if you use the cloudy setting in the light than what you are taking a picture of has to be in flash range otherwise it won't show up completely. Even then it's not as bright as you would want.<br /><br />The camera is super cute and vintage/hipster looking so that is a plus if you want to complete a look and take pictures.<br />Over all, the camera has great quality pictures and a good array of settings. It is very pricy but worth it if you are in to photography. If you do decide to purchase it there are many great places to look for tutorials.??","Arrived a day early and in good condition. I was worried it would be too small at first but it's actually just the right size! All I have to do now is wait for all my film to come in tomorrow!","I love it so much!!! People and my peers compliment my camera a lot. I'm so glad i purchased this item. Keep up the good work!","the camera came in excellent condition, started using it immediately and it takes very cute pictures.extremely satisfied with this camera","It arrived a day before the estimated time it was delivered. I love how small and light the camera is. I thought it would be bulkier and wider but the size is really nice. I hope to take a lot of photos to make some memories. Going to be a new hobby from now on. I just hope to get reasonable priced film for it in the future.","I bought this for my 8 year old daughter who wanted a Polaroid camera for her birthday.  After doing some research, I discovered that the film for the Fuji is much less expensive, even though the camera itself is a bit more than Polaroid. She loves the size of the pictures & adores the pink color.  I am beyond satisfied with this purchase!","the color of camera is very nice, it a good camera, I think you will like it, just the film a little bit expansive.","Love the camera, its easy to use my granddaughter is having a ball with it and now her friends are buying them too.","I got this camera as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it. It is a very nice and simple camera that is very fun to use. We been using it pretty much all the time and it does take some nice photos. I would highly recommend this product to anyone !","Good. The style is awesome. The product has been easy to use. Looking forward to capturing more photos in the future.","i love it! great packaging and cant wait to capture memories.","Nice product and great color! Bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. It is kinda heavy, but useful!","I have no issues with this camera. The color is beautiful and it takes pretty good pictures. It is also simple and fun to use and very nostalgic.","I LOVE THIS. I use this at parties or when I want to do a polaroid style photo shoot with a model. It is fun to use. The Instant film is at a fair price.","Prefect gift for any pre-teen/ or teenager. Takes great pictures. There's a variety of different film borders that can be purchased.","I love my new fuji camera, I missed having these around. It really does help catch that one exact moment","I purchased this camera in the pink shade. I heard so much about this cameras all over the internet. I love the idea of snapping a photo and it comes out right away. This camera is pretty easy to use, there's only two buttons (start, and snap). You can twist the lens to adjust the lighting (which can be tricky to figure out in the beginning). Sometimes if the lens aren't adjusted to the proper light setting, the photos may come out too bright or too dark. Another defect is, whatever view/angle you see in the lens, the photo comes out slightly shifted to the left, because of the placement of the lens (you look into) and the camera lens possibly because of different locations on the device itself. This camera comes with a wrist strip and two batteries. (No film is provided, you must purchases separately). Overall, I love my camera! It is perfect for the summer time, captures every moment under the sun.","I got this for my roommates birthday and this was so cute! She kept telling me how much she loved it, definitely recommend.","Skeptical at first but its officially clear that I'm in Love this instant camera! Although film is practically a dollar per photo its definitely worth it. Since you have a hardcopy for yourself you can keep your photos in an album or wallet for years.The sizes of the photo are quite small (wallet size) but thats what makes them adorable. I took a selfie and gave it to my boyfriend and he loved it and decided to keep the photo in his wallet. I love how its easy to use to camera and its pretty lightweight. Worth every penny and wonderful for keeping those special memories. I love how this camera make everyone look good. Regardless how awful you make look this camera filter is somehow able to make someone ten times better looking. Make sure not to waste your film as much. I only take photos on special occasions or date nights:)","This camera is so easy to use and so much fun. The best part is getting the pictures right away! I'm so used to taking pictures on my iPhone and never getting them developed but now I can take a fun picture and have it that instant...so cool","Love this camera.  It's mini pics are just adorable and it's portable as well.  I am thrilled with the quality and the nostalgic feeling it gives me.","Purchased for bridal shower, wedding, etc and really love using this camera. The photos turn out great just learn how to use the light settings","What a fun camera this is!  Photos come out clear and are a great size for shoot-and-take photo memories!  The camera was recommended to me by a photographer friend and I am happy I followed her advice!","The camera works well, and was perfect for my wedding guest book. The different settings are great for adjusting to different lighting situations. It is really nice that it has a flash, but I will say that if it is really dark the photos don't turn out very well (but that is to be expected).","This instant camera was just what I expected it would be: cute and brings people together! My friends loved it and we have such a great time in parties taking pictures. Everyone wants to have one, haha. Just be sure to adjust to the right/recommended aperture setting or your picture will be ruined.","I love it! I've always wanted a polaroid, and this is perfect. It's super portable and the mini film is so cute! I like to decorate my walls with them. I get worried about getting the camera dirty though, since it's white. But it's actually still very clean, just don't be rowdy with it and what not. The only thing that sucks is that you have to be careful with the lighting! Sometimes a picture will come out completely white or black if the setting isn't correct. This isn't one of those automatic things, so be sure to set it correctly!","I am in love with my new camera. I take it every where I go. It is great for capturing moments in a new way.","I got it delivered really quickly and was so so so so excited when I did. It's light weight so I can carry it everywhere and I even bought a little messenger bag to carry it in. The film comes out quick and the pink color is really settle. Would get this again for a friend.","I bought this instant film camera because she has been bugging me about a polaroid camera. I bought this one in particular because of the reviews. Overall she is very pleased with it.","My fiancé bought this for me and I am obsessed! I already had the 210 for about two years but I wanted the mini to take to parties and such. I just took it to our birthday party and everyone loved it! It was a huge hit! The blue color is my favorite and I know I will get so much use out of this!","I have been missing my Joycam for many years, so as soon as I saw the Instax Mini, I knew I had to get one. Taking pictures are so much fun even though the film is kind of expensive. Makes a great gift - especially for yourself!","So glad to see instant cameras making a comeback and the price of film for this camera is not too expensive, especially here on Amazon. I gave this as a gift and she was very pleased.","awesome and extremely adorable camera! love the pink color option. highly recommend to anyone interested in an instant camera :)","Came in brand-new, the color is so cute, like a chalky pale yellow. takes the cutest pictures. the settings are quite tricky but i think after using two packs of film, i finally got it.","Got it as a gift from my friend and I LOVE IT! Its super easy to use and prints out great pictures! Its really dummy proof and takes amazing pictures!","I've always wanted an Instax Mini and the price kills!!! <///3 UNTIL I FOUND THIS HOT JACKPOT! It's really worth the price and you'' really have fun with the item, no lie! I'm out of words, awesome gift for my birthday! :3","Works as it should, pics are a bit small but I knew from the beginning so  i'm fine with that.","I really loved it. It's light, easy to use and you can put it in your handbag !. It's perfect as a present, and it's a easy way to make a quick and unforgettable memories.","Purchase N See. I love photography a lot. Captures good pictures.. I wish the film was a bit cheaper. I still like it overall","I bought this camera for my 8 years old daughter as a gift, she loves it! It is easy to use and the pictures are great!","Love it! Cute and light way easy to snap a quick pic of you and your friends or anything else","Love my new camera and it really isn't as big as I thought it was much bigger than it was, considering reviews that said it's huge. It's not huge. It's smaller than the Mini 7s if I remember well. Or maybe my eye is wrong on the comparison. I've already taken fun pictures with it. :)","Such a great little instant camera!  Easy to use, sturdy, and cute to boot.  When I first ordered mine it was defective - the film came out only partially developed as if something was internally blocking it or there was uneven pressure on the rollers, so I just returned the camera.  Sadly I wasted a half a box of film on it (silly me) but strangely enough the first camera came with film already inside of it and my new camera did not...weird right?  I returned it & my new one works great.  Overall I would say do NOT buy at Urban Outfitters, way too overpriced (as everything there is) and customer service here is probably better anyway.  Also be careful not to snap away because film goes quickly - I buy mine in bulk.  Happy instax-ing!","Perfect!!! Great addition to our wedding...wish film was cheaper :/ it was almost as much as the camera when I was done paying though","camera was in perfect condition. worked great my girlfriend loved this gift good for memories in scrap book may be a little big to walk around but good for trips","We bought this camera to use at our wedding reception. It took pretty great pictures, especially since its an instant camera. Our guests had a lot of fun taking candid shots of everyone. It was great.","Very good. Such good quality. Should come with film though. Either way it's a must get camera. Very good camera.","I ordered the Instax Mini 8 a few months ago because I liked the idea of a physical copy in your hand in an instant. I found myself not using it as much as I wanted but I still recommend this camera to anyone who likes photography and wants that vintage look this camera gives. The cameras have a matte finish and I would recommend finding a case and a neck strap. The prices vary, so if they are high, wait awhile and they might go down.","Pros:<br />+ Looks pretty nice<br />+ Was the cheapest, yet most quality among polaroid cameras<br />+ Feels quite sturdy and can probably take a lot of drops<br />+ Compact and can easily be carried around<br />+ Pictures come out quite nice though sometimes blurry<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Even though its focused, sometimes it can come out a little blurry<br />- It doesn't come with any film, you have to buy it separately<br />- The counter for packs of film is messed up on mines, it counts 1 more than I actually have<br /><br />Extra Info:<br />I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  Not much else to say about it. 4/5 for the messed up film counter","If ur looking for a cute new modern fujifilm Polaroid this is it!! I see so many pink and white versions. But the yellow one is a great spring and summer color to carry around and snap cute pictures with ur friends or selfies hahaha","Yes the film is costly but it always makes you pause before you capture a moment so you only save your precious memories on print. And there is no better feel than getting the image in hand as soon as you capture it!","Loved it, but my parents are making me return it because it's a \"girl\" color. I wish they didn't judge me so much.","Price was right and camera is easy to use. I went onto YouTube to see how to load and use. Nothing tricky about it.<br />Small size print but was perfect to add to album. To center subject move camera to right and down just a bit.","I like the pink color but the camera itself isn't as good as people described. The color effect is just okay, not very fancy.","I absolutely love this camera. I thought it was going to be difficult to manage but it was fairly easy. I absolutely love it and so does my friends and family","The camera works great and is true to color, but it took me a while to get it too work... I wish that the instructions were clearer, which is ridiculous considering how simple a camera it is.","i love it i received it very fast, takes great pictures only downfall as usual is that the film is quite pricey but overall great camera im happy i bought it!","I love it...not just because pink is my favorite color...it's because it's so cool...I use this camera at first time in Mothers Day Celebration it was fun to use..I really enjoyed it..thank you so much ^_^","I bought this camera on a whim and I love it! Anytime I go somewhere like a theme park, or somewhere special, I take it with me. The instant little pictures are a lot of fun and bring some playfulness to the days. They also fit just right in a smash book compared to regular photos!","Great item would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a cool gift. Check me out the mini film for it","Early b-day gift<br />Order this product Monday and came in Saturday on standard shipping<br />Super fast shipping. Highly recommended to all film loves<br />Camera works fantastic !! No problems<br />Pictures came out beautifully<br />Can't wait to buy another one for my niece and my sister in law .","I received this a few days after ordering it and it was so cute !!!!! Fast shipping, very fast !!!! Picture quality is pretty good for an instant camera on the go. My little sister loved it, We both love the color, bright yet still pale, just enough pop of color. Thank you !!! Will buy again !","This is my second Instax Mini because my niece took my let one. Why? They're fun, and hey, they're instant.<br />I like taking them with me when I go out and gifting people with a memorable, cute , little photo.<br />I'm sure you can think of other uses.<br />No matter what you do, they're just darn cute and fun! I highly recommend playing with one!","only had it for several days and have only taken 3 pics. the pictures are very clear for as small as they are (but I knew they were credit card size when purchasing camera).  so far I love it.  I think it will be fun for parties, reunions, etc.","i have been looking at this camera for 2 years now, to make sure i didn't buy something that would break the next day. but it is the most wonderful thing! it has a almost toy like appearance, gives good photos, easy to handle, and very portable! i fell in love with film cameras all over again with the first shot i took :)","This will allow me to enjoy instant pics and give them out immediately.  Not like the old instamatic polaroid but it works.","A great little flash back from the retro days<br />Film breaks down to almost a dollar a shot, but hey, a picture is worth a thousand words. I recommend YouTubing videos of pros who have used the camera enough to learn all of its little tips/tricks. IE, working with the flash, the frame adjustment.. ect","The purchase of this item brought everyone back to \"the old days.\"  It worked very well and the younger kids at the party (for which we bought the item) were amazed to see the photos magically appear.  We will definitely be using it regularly.  The size of the pictures was fine (I have seen smaller pictures from a similar version).  Purchasing from Amazon was also less expensive than what I had seen at local retailers.","Not much has changed since that old Polaroid I had when I was a kid... I got this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it.  It works the same as the old Polaroid Instant, but the pictures are considerably smaller... probably 1/2 to 2/3's the size... and the film is still expensive.  But she's having fun with it and as long as we don't end up in the poor house buying film, I'd say it was a great little gadget.","I love the camera i had no issue with it, fast delivery ordered it on sunday got it on wednesday (and that was with standard shipping) uhmm i wrote this review on films and id figure that after u buy the camera u deal with the costly issue with films so hear is my review \"Sooo, 5 stars i got what i wanted just as is advertised- but heres the better deal, On Amazon! They sell a twin pack (20 films) for 13.40, I being the curious one decided to try out all film packs they r selling and decide what is the best choice. Sooo they sell a 100 pack for 84.50, if u buy the twin pack (5quantities , 100 films) it would only be 67$. Wow. They sell a 40$ pack for 32.95, if u buy 2 twin pack (2quantities, 40 films) it would be 26.80! , they also sell a 50 pack (this item) which cost 36.75, But i found out after purchasing that if u buy 3 twin packs (3quantities, 60! Films) its 40.20, pretty much 3-4 bucks for 10 more films. So yea overall i learned that buying the 13.40 twinpack (20 films) is always the better way to go. (I hope this helped) ! <3 love the product. I also bought a pink case from caiul about 27$ its a good case. Love tht tooo lol anyway!\" Hope this helps!","Bought this camera because I wanted to have some fun with my family.  The pictures are small (which I already knew) but SUPER cute!!!  It's solidly built and easy to use.  Plus, it's kind-of old school coming from the digital age!!  Frankly, I purchased this over polaroid because of the reviews- and I'm super happy with it!!  Film is reasonable too- another purchasing factor!  And the colors it comes in are cute for younger people.  Picture quality is great.","This camera is the best. it is so cool. I have no problems with it so far. it takes really good pictures expect in the sun.","My grand-daughter asked for this camera for her 13th birthday.  Since she is of the age that has never had to purchase camera film I question her about that issue and the expense of the film.  Of course at 13 or almost 13 she still wanted the camera.  Since receiving it she has made small scrapbooks of pictures of her friends and seems very happy with the camera.  I have found film makes good gifts for holidays such as Easter etc.<br />Now would I want this camera of course the answer is no, but for a kid, sorry teenager guess it's fun.","Photography is a hobby of mine and this vintage version will be a nice addition.  The credit card size photos are charming and have the look that brings back nostalgic memories.  I have always wanted an instant camera and like that this camera is smaller than others, although the Instax 210 looks cool too.  The pictures I've taken have turned out better than I was expecting and the few available settings seem to work well.  Framing a picture also seems easier than I thought - just keep in mind the viewfinder and lens will capture slightly different views, especially when you are close to your subject.  The flash fires with all pictures taken, so I've read other reviews recommending the use of white electrical tape over the flash to prevent parts of the photo from being too overexposed.","This is so much fun at a get-together!  Instant pictures that are good!  Everyone wants their own copy of the pictures!","This camera is cuter and more fun than it looks or is described on the net.<br />It makes super sharp and colorful prints that are so fun to keep or give away.  It looks adorable and starts conversations at parties.  It is a lot less bulky or heavy than the original Polaroid cameras of old.  Even in this age of digital and cell phone cameras, there is nothing more fun than an instant camera that produces the shot in less than a minute.  Yay!","It's lightweight almost makes the product seem like a joke. But it's ok. it works... but i tried and wasted a couple frames on this camera..<br /><br />This camera cannot take close up photos very well (1ft - 2ft) and the VIEWFINDER IS MISLEADING. My advice: when you press the shutter button, hold your position for another 5 - 10 seconds. the quality of the photos aren't as clear and vibrant as i had hoped. the photos on the advertising is WAY OFF. but it's fun. and still a good idea for scrap booking.","I love it!! Pictures come out perfect & vintage! The only drawback is the amount of film you have to continuously buy. Luckily the film is relatively cheap","Cute, handheld. Remember to always go with their suggested setting for lighting or at least change it because the picture won't turn out well.","I love this camera! It's definitely one of the cutest and best purchases I made. The pictures turn out so nice. Like it's not possible to look bad in one of these pictures lol. The camera came on a Friday and I placed the order on a Monday! On top of that I used free shipping. Oh and btw it does not come with film. That's something I wondered when ordering it but I purchased my own separately. But overall I am in love and I can't wait to start capturing more memories with this camera.","Used this for a party and everyone loved it.  It's been so long the older generations has long forgotten about it and the younger generations are fascinated by having a photo printed right then and there.","This is the best birthday gift I could have given my daughter!!! She is so happy with it, and enjoying every time she is taking pictures...<br /><br />I highly recommend.  The pictures come out like in the old days, but much better.  I have explained my daughter the shaking process that we had to do back then.  She loves her new camera.<br /><br />The good thing is that you get the  pictures right away, and you can create a collage with them.","This Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera (Blue) is so cute, I bought it for a party photo booth and the pics taken were sharp and the colors were  bright.","Used camera at party in a photo booth and everyone loved the instant view of photos. Very Happy with outcome.","I got this for my upcoming wedding and took a test shot of my kitty.  It's going to be perfect for my guest book!","Can't seem to get the correct lighting desired in any of my photos, but I love that it is instant and the photos are cute. Wish there were more \"light leak\" type coloring in the prints instead of just a regular \"overexposed\" or underexposed which are typically just black to white. Do wish they were a LITTLE bigger, and though there is a bigger fujifilm instax camera, I already find this one is pretty large. The other camera is a little crazy in size and pretty impractical for me.","the color is what i expected and it is really really cute!! just waiting for the films to come and i will try it out","If you're considering buying this camera, do it!! I debated over buying it for months, I was worried the pictures were going to be too small (they're credit card sized), but I finally got it and I couldn't be happier with it. It's just such a cool camera to have, really different..as well as being super cute!! Small enough to throw in your bag or purse and I just love everything about it, I can't wait to take it on vacation. Wish I would have purchased it sooner, I HIGHLY recommend!","While digital photos are great there's something about having physical prints to hold onto.  It's a wonderful experience to go through shoe boxes of photos with friends and family.  Being able to create those pictures with an instant camera and your kids dds to the fun (and silliness).<br /><br />When Polaroid went the way of the dinosaur I was worried that we wouldn't ever have an instant camera to use as our boys grew up.  This camera filled void and has been great.<br /><br />Fun<br />Easy to use<br />Nice quality pictures<br /><br />I have recommended this camera to all of my friends with kids and those who have gotten it love it as much as we do.","Good service!","I bought my daughter this for her 10th birthday and she loved it! She had a great time taking pictures with her friends and the camera was a big hit. The only thing I have to remind them of is that the film is kind of pricey and they can't just keep \"snapping away\" they way they would with a digital camera.  It is more of a novelty type gift but something my family has a lot of fun with. I'm very happy with this purchase.","This is a terrific camera.  Well made.  Takes fairly good pictures for what it is.  These little mini pics are adorable.","i purchased this camera purely based on the reviews without much thought to the utility.<br />however, it turned out to be a great product. I used it when I met my friends and they liked it a lot.<br />my friends got excited and kept all the snaps as souvenirs and they planned to buy the same camera<br /><br />The camera works favorably in all the conditions, care to be taken for the light.<br />Works great in the sun light and even in the dusk. During nights, ensure there is full light all over.<br /><br />All-in-all its worthy and you can have some good nice important memories :)","Great little camera for new school polaroid. Took on a cruise when we first got it and works perfect for what we got it for.","I really like this camera! it is so cute and the quality of the pictures is great! I'm glad I purchased it!","I am so excited to receive my fabulous camera!! Not only is it much cheaper then it is at urban outfitters but it's an awesome camera to have!! All my friends love them! I can't wait to receive my white camera!<br />I ordered this yesterday so my shipment is still being processed but this company is awesome to order from I accidentally ordered two of them instead of one (whoops) and they were so quick in responding to me and canceling one of the cameras for me, they were extremely helpful and very nice! I would definitely order this camera and from this company as well!","It's everything it says it is. It's really good and the pictures are so cute, they look really old fashioned.","Got this as a gift for my younger cousin & she absolutely loves it! Would recommend it to anyone that wants a camera without all that extra weight. Was expecting it to be really tiny, but thank goodness it isn't. Suits her very well for a petite girl. A must buy if you don't want to have a bulky camera.","I freaking LOVE this camera. I use it when I go to parties and all my friends love it and want one now. It's super simple to use.","This Fuji mini polaroid is so adorable.  It takes me back in time when polaroid's were popular.  It's easy to use and the pictures are a mini version of what we were used to.","It's a wonderful camera reminds me of old school. All my family and friends love it also.  I can see it on their next shopping list.","I love how affordable this camera is and how good it is with its job.<br />I took a couple of pictures with it and I love the sentimental value attached to every special picture captured. It's a more different experience compared to just taking loads of snapshots with your phone, not filtering out really what are the best moments.<br />So far, it feels durable. I'll have to have the camera for a couple months to really tell. But thankfull I have the mini zippered case for the instax.<br /><br />Oh by the way, DON'T FORGET TO ADJUST THE SLIDER! I mistakenly forgot to do  that and my picture was washed out!","I'm so glad I got this Camera it's so cute I got the blue one and I use it all the time. I got a clear case so I can still see the past blue color. It takes great outdoors photos just remember to change it to sunny or cloudy.  Very easy to take photos it's basic stuff turn on off and snap button. Very light not heavy I have a strap that go around my neck. It comes with a cute strap the color of the camera.","I'm using these camera for guests at my wedding to snap photos for my quest book and to keep for themselves. Also, after using I can see myself snapping these photos at every family get together or party. It's really fun to use and the photos came out great. Way more than i expected.","I love this camera! It's so easy & fun to use. My only complaint is the cost of the film but other than that the pictures are amazing quality for this little thing. I can't wait to take it on vacation with me! Definitely a must have for any teenager even adults trust me you will love it.","Arrived on time and works like a charm. It's so cute and the perfect camera to carry around with you. My first Polaroid came out looking great and had very good quality.","My best friend has a pink one. We take photos a lot and I love it. The camera looks cute in pink.","my sons were amazed at the pictures that came out right away, and quality on the credit card sized photo paper was excellent!","I love this camera. I am a photographer. I love shooting images with this camera, the film is beautiful and warm, and its just nice to not have to set a bunch of controls just to grab a snapshot of my wife. I love handing this camera to a waitress so she can take a snap of me and my friends out to eat. They always look at the back trying to see the screen that doesn't exist. Everyone is always tickled when I hand them a little print right on the spot. So much fun.<br />The camera itself is simple to use. The one exposure control is easy to understand and manipulate. This camera has a nice heavy feel to it. Not that it is heavy, but that there is a little heft to it, giving the sense that it is not just a toy. Images come out nice and sharp. The film for this camera has a lot of detail and is pretty good in low light. I have not bothered looking into the ISO of the film but seems like a nice average.<br />I really missed the i-zone that Polaroid made  a few years back. That was a fun camera to play with, in my opinion this one is better. I like the size of the prints, just large enough for some detail, small enough to keep it in the novelty arena. I have scanned a bunch of these images and really like the results when reprinting them a little larger.<br />If you are into toy cameras like the i-zone or the Holga this camera will be a nice addition to your collection. If you still use the old Polaroid land camera to take snapshots you might consider this camera to be a cool variation on instant film.","Great little camera! So much fun to play with! Wish there was a timer on it though. Besides that awesome!","So excited i ordered this! Absolutely no regrets! Loving every moments with this camera! My sister wants one and can not wait to get her one.","Fairly simple to use but takes a bit of trial-and-error to get the lighting right. Each picture is about the size of a business card or credit card. Needs batteries.","this camera is durable, cute, fun, easy to use, and a great way to keep memories. whenever i bring it out at get-togethers its always a big hit and everyone wants a picture. i do recommend watching youtube tutorials on how to work the camera so you wont waste as much film. dont forget to set it to the right setting before taking a picture! i've been having lots of fun with this device. the only con is that no stores sell it around me besides urban outfitters (which is expensive) so i have to buy it online, but whenever im down to my last pack i know to buy another one. this is such a great deal and im glad i didnt settle for any other price. if youre trying to find the best price for this camera, buy it here. you wont find a better deal!","This camera is great. I was looking into the instax for awhile just never actually bought one so I'm very glad I went ahead and picked one up","i love my camera it is so cute and handy ! the pink is gorgeous! i would recomment ot every girl who loves pink!","Fits perfectly and matches the Fuji camera just fine. The colrs are a perfect match as well. Provides good protection","Everyone should own one at some point in their lives. I like unplanned photographs and cameras that make sounds. Imperfection is more fun to look at.","It's very useful for me. I can use it to record the beautiful memories. It's really good! Awesome! Excellent! U can buy it now!","I was hesitant to buy this camera, as I was a kid the last time instant film cameras were popular. They didn't take great pictures, and the film was expensive. I'm a camera junkie though, so I didn't want to miss out on trying it.<br />As the mom of a toddler, I figured taking pictures of her with it was out of the question. I was totally wrong. This camera takes pictures very quickly, and we haven't had a blurry one yet. Plus, she is mesmerized by seeing the picture come out of the camera. I can't wait until she is a little older, and can take some pictures with it herself.<br />In an age of photos that live on hard drives, there is just something so fun about having your picture instantly. We've already created a board to hand them on, and I love looking at it and seeing the pictures we've taken each day.","It was really nice and exactly the way I expected it to be since I watched a bunch of reviews on YouTube and read a lot of reviews before buying this camera. Batteries are included which is a plus. The strap is a decent length, but most of the time when I use my camera, I don't use the strap. The camera is really nice and everything was perfect.","By far the Best purchase I've made in a while!:) I love love love love this camera! I take it every where and capture cute moments of my everyday life to remember :)","I am happy with this camera! time I wanted to buy one, and I loved it! beautiful colors, and I have so much fun with it! I use it to scrapbook and photo album of memories","Received it right on time.  Have only used it to take 3 pictures so far.  Saving for a wedding in May.","I originally bought this camera for my self but my sister in laws birthday came up and I decided to give it to her she loves it and I decided to get my self a white one.<br />these cameras are great for family or friend events<br />to capture all the great moment<br />you wont regret buying this!","I had a Polaroid when I was younger, but now that they don't sell film for it, it is very expensive. So I found this and the film is very affordable! Love the color and just love the product itself.","I love this camera! Despite it being around 67 dollars at the time of purchase, I bought this on impulse. However, I do not regret it. I love this camera and it has quickly become a favorite item. I bought this camera on April 3rd, and received it two days later on April 5th around evening using Amazon Prime, FedEx shipping. It came right on time for the event I was hoping to use it for! Now, I wish that there was a timer on it, or that flash was optional, but otherwise it's fine. The fact it's so cute is another plus! The pictures literally are the size of a credit card, I compared it myself! Make sure you are wary of lighting, flash is automatic, and if it's really cloudy outside, the pictures may or may not look right, although the mood does adjust based on lighting. Be careful of what you take pictures of, because pictures print instantly and you don't want to waste film, which can be expensive (usually 11-30 dollar range). This camera can only hold 10  photos at a time, which is why most packs come in packs of 10, but some packs come so you buy 20 or more, usually at a higher price but may be worth it if you don't want to keep buying more film each time you finish 10. Despite it's cute, almost toylike appearance, I wouldn't give this camera to a child. At least not to a non responsible one. The camera isn't really small so it's not something you can stash in a pocket and go, but it will fit nice in a decent sized purse, or in a backpack. I recommend this camera very much!","Wonderful quality, easy to use and a very pretty color. Nothing unexpected or unwanted. Came as expected, a great purchase!","Works perfect indoors or in very shaded areas but if you try and take pictures outside while it is sunny the pictures do no develop correctly. Only the darks in the picture would show up and everything else would be white.","I really like this little cute camera! I brought this camera for my best friend's birthday present and she love it so much! The product came on time and the quality is pretty good. I recommend this product.","Fujifilm Instax Mini was everything I was expecting and more, absolutely love this camera. I would definitely recommend buying this!","Item in perfect condition when arrived, works great! Very happy with it, not too big easy to carry around. love it","Amazing. Takes great pictures! It has lots of settings to play with. Comes out instantly. Only thing is it doesn't come with film.","i wanted the pink one because it just reminds me of a camera i saw my cousin have. its just cute and the pastel pink is what i was looking for. i purchased this for nostalgic reasons. completely happy with it but film costs a lot.","This camera is easy and fun for the family.  It's just like the old camera when I was a kid.  Point, shoot the picture and out comes the film and develops right before your eyes! The camera appears to be well built, time will tell.<br /><br />I would recommend this for the kids!","It's a pretty neat camera! Was exactly what I expected. The only bad thing I have it say is that the camera takes pictures slightly to the right which does get annoying because sometimes you can't take the pic you wanted, it just takes a few times to get used to it and after that you should be fine.","Pretty handy camera to have. <br /> Perfect for wallet pics to carry around fun or cute pics with you too.","For paying $70 for this really cool looking camera, I thought the quality of the photos would be a little nicer.","this is perfect.  doesnt look as cool as the other one, but perfect easy to use and no problem with it at all. worth getting on amazon with the discount since everywhere else is full price.  its  atad chunky and looking through the viewfinder can be tough (esp drunk)","Good product bought it as a gift lets see what happens after a few uses see I'd it holds up","I love it! Super cute and the photos come out great. I just wish the film wasn't so expensive. Almost feels like a toy and it might break but it's been working fine for the past few months.","I bought this camera for a trip to Disney World. Everything about it is absolutely perfect!  it is cute, works just fine and I received a lot of compliments for it. I would recommend this to anyone look for an instant camera with a convenient price.","I bought this as one of my fiancee's gifts this last Christmas and she just loves it. It's awkwardly large compared to your modern cameras, but the pictures it delivers are retro and fun for projects. Every time we use it someone mentions how they love it and they need one right away. People are always asking us to take a photo of them.","It is a party hit every time!  Worth it just to get instant photos to be able to give to friends","The camera arrived well on time in exactly the color as shown on the pictures. Camera difficult to find in this color elsewhere at a reasonable price.","Bought this camera for our PTA to  use at events and it has been a huge hit!  Kids are amazed.  Camera works great.  Very simple.","I never thought this camera was going to be the success it is with my children. They are enjoying it. Perfect condition and perfect transaction. Highly recommended vendor!","This camera is so much fun! We bought it for our kids to take on a trip for scrapbooking along the way. It was so perfect for instant pictures for them to see and be able to put in their books right away. Fantastic!!!","Not only does this have an air of nostalgia, I just love the pastel yellow color I got which also seems retro, and it's fun to take to events and the photo's turn out well.","I love it! Its amazing!!! Fun to have around for special occasions and especially for trips! Definitely worth your money!","Very good câmera is the best!!!!! Love much, I want to buy more colors.... Is fast and fun. J'adore :)","Words can not express how amazing this camera is!  Very kawaii and girly and PINK of course :)!  I love the tiny polaroids!  Brings me back to my childhood!","This camera is great for gatherings!<br />I can't go anywhere without it.<br />It is so fun and easy to use.","This was a birthday gift for our high school son and he loves it. It takes great pictures and is easy to operate.","I love my camera so much! I get many complements too, but i don't like to buy the films too pricy. );","Did not have to wait a long time before I received it, brand new as described, great product! Looking forward to more adventures with this baby.","Purchased this camera because a friend had one and pulled it out one day at a social function and starting taking pics of us and others, but than gave us our printed picture right at that moment! Updated version Fujifilm has come up with of the old polaroid. Whenever I am out taking pictures most people love that I can hand them their picture right there.","people often forget what kind of camera they are buying when they purchase this - it DOES require the instax instant film, so don't forget to buy a pack or two when ordering! i had originally wanted the pink version, but it was easily twenty dollars more. i'm glad i got the white as it's much more classic and i know i won't be as obsessed with keeping it spotless.<br />this camera is absolutely adorable! it's very easy to use and you won't even need instructions to set it up as it's pretty self explanatory. it tells you what setting to put it in and everything, very simple. the film develops in a few minutes. i knew exactly what i was getting myself in to with this camera and for that reason i am very happy with my purchase!","I would surely recommend this product to others. Its a great Camera that takes clear photos. There is a light that tells you what setting to use before taking a quick snap of your subject. The pictures are a great size, im glad i started scrap booking again. The only thing is, there is no actual zoom, so you do hat=ve to be close to your subject. Other than that, its pretty awesome.","I love this camera. I wanted the pink one but the white one was considerably cheaper until after I bought it, then the pink one was cheaper.","Great product got here on time and my gf loved it as a birthday present. If your looking for a reliable instant camera this is it!","THIS IS THE BEST THING I'VE EVER PURCHASED<br />I BRING IT WITH ME EVERYWHERE<br />ITS SO EASY TO USE AND THE FILM ISN'T INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE","If you loved classic polaroid photos this is your dream instant photo camera! I love it so much, I get to snap super cute pics of my son and get them instantly in my hand to put up!","I bought this for my cousin on her 12th birthday so she could instantly capture and print memories with her friends. She's loved the gift -- there are lots of different instax film packs you can buy for it (Mickey Mouse, for example) and even little frames and albums that are the perfect size for the prints. Great gift.","This camera was exactly what I hoped for. It came on time and it was exactly what was advertised. Couldn't be happier with the product.","This camera works great! It's a bit larger than I thought it would be, but is easy to hold, point + shoot.<br />I have yet to use it in natural light, but the flash does a good job of illuminating dark or indoor photos.<br />I don't have any complaints.","I use it when I hang out with friends/family, and everyone loves it. It makes me happy that I can give a picture to other people right away, and see how happy they are. It might not work that well when the light is not perfect, there is a light to indicate which mode to use basing on light, but sometimes it changes too frequently I can't seem to make the best choice. I might just need to be more patient at this. Overall, I love it!","I purchased this camera for my 14 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  She loves it.  Easy to use and pictures come out just as expected.","You have to be careful I repeat HAVE TO BE CAREFUL with the sun You can easily waste film if its too bright even if you adjust the dial the photo will end up white . Also DO NOT open the back where the film goes it will completely mess up the order of film you have left I was very curious as to what happens if I opened it and messed up the order I had 4 pictures left and the dial said 8 ! Very frustrating. Over all very great camera :)","This camera is perfect. The color is very kawaii and the pictures are easy and fun to take. Absolute perfection!","The pictures come out so nice and clear! It is adorable and a great color. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Very happy with the purchase.","I bought it for my daughter's birthday. She is having a lot of fun with the camera. That's all I have to say!","Definitely suited my purposes of having photos in hand whenever I want to send one to a friend. I wish the flash wasn't more controllable and the instructions were more clear.<br />Otherwise it's a good camera.","I bought this little gem along with a scrapbook, multipack film, glue sticks and a set of multicolored, fine tip sharpies.  It was the prefect combo for my 40th birthday party.  The camera was such a hit and everyone was so excited to see a throwback form the good 'ol days.  The pictures are small which is perfect for my 12x12 scrapbook.  One problem I had was I had to reel people in when they yelled \"doover!\"  No, no, no...the film is not cheap and it's not a smartphone.  Funny how times have changed.  Great fun for the price....you won't regret it.","It was packaged so nicely!<br />When i got it, it was smaller than i had expected, but it was still really cute. I love this camera so much.","Used this as well as a 7S at my moms 60th birthday party to add pictures to a scrap book.  People loved it and were taking pictures all night!  Will also use it for the guest book at my wedding in 3 months.","I had wanted one of these cameras for ages and was thrilled when I saw how cheap they are now, so I went for the light blue camera. The camera arrived in pristine condition with a really cute box. It also came with a camera strap (with strap holes on both sides of the camera) and two AA batteries. The camera does not come with film (you have to buy that seperately, the twin packs run at about 13 bucks for 20 exposures) but the camera is very aesthetically pleasing and makes it fun and easy to take pictures. It produces credit-card sized photos that are super cute and fun to carry around. If you're looking for a camera that produces larger photos you might wanna go for an Instax Wide instead but this is a really fun camera and I'm very glad I finally bought one. Would definitely reccomend!","Takes suprisingly great pictures. Is extremely compact and super freaking cute. The film Is a little expensive but is well worth it. All around great buy.","I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this camera, and I was mot disappointed. It came well packed, as pictured/described, and delivered ahead of schedule. I only wish my film would have came the same day, so I could start snapping away immediately.","The camera is great. It's easy to carry around and fun to have when you go out with friends. The only downside is that I accidently jammed the counter.","I really wanted to get a Polaroid instant camera but it (and the film) were quite expensive. This is the same, if not better. The color is a light rose pink and is very cute. Unlike Polaroid, its newer. I like that because it gives that vintage look, but with a modern device. The film is more of a rectangle but I personally like it better. I had to take some time to get use to it, but I am very happy that I got it. Be very careful with shots that are close up. Its better to be a few feet away from something because it can get blurry when too close. Also I took a picture of the sun and it made it black. Prior to purchasing this, I didn't know much about instant camera with film, but be careful with too much light. Instead it will just make it black. Other than those two adjustments, its a really good product and I haven't had much difficulty with it. Very pleased!","I totally love this camera! It is great for sweet moments you want to capture. Worth $70 for sure. Great buy","Love it!!!! Little expensive for film but totally worth it, takes awesome pictures. I would recommend this to anyone any age.","Seriously this is a bad ass camera, I love it.. Its funny and easy to use, just got to get  used to adjusting light settings but I've gone through almost 70 film and just about everyone of them are perfect. Love love love.. And the seller is great, trustworthy and friendly would defiantly buy from again..","There's nothing quite like taking a shot and a little picture coming out of the top of this camera. It's so much fun!<br /><br />My favorite thing about this camera, besides the design & color (I got blue), is the fact that I am choosing my shots carefully. Unlike with a digital camera, you'll want to be selective about which moments you choose to capture since it's not like you can click away endlessly. This adds charm to it, for me anyways.<br /><br />This camera can really capture the moment in a beautiful way. You just have to play with the exposure at first to get the feel for the best shots. Also, don't shoot too close to your subject or it/they will be blurry. It's fun to play around with it aside from the film being a bit too expensive to waste for test shots.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for an instant camera.","Color has been enhanced since the days of the Polaroid Pronto, Great Product and will keep using it, keep the price low!","This camera is totally cute. Very easy to use, just make sure to follow all instructions.  This camera is perfect for all kind of parties.  Instant memories!","OK so i got this for Christmas and it takes the best photots in the world like i love it and all my friends are so jealous and want one now i totally recommend it!!!!!","All I have to say is after weeks my kid asking for it, gave it to her as a gift and she is so happy with it, has no complaints.","It was great! The color of the camera was nice. Other than the blurry lightning at times, the camera is great.","I bought his with credit from amazon so ended paying just 30$ For it. It takes amazing photos! I wasted just like two practicing. Everything is perfect of it. Took it to Mexico City for a baptism ;) everyone loved it!","This is a great little camera we have had so much fun with it already. I purchased for a diy photo booth for my daughters wedding and we have been playing with it. The kids love to watch the film pop up and then watch the picture develop.","Cute, fun, Polariod-like camera.  My wife used it to take pictures and create a collage while still on vacation.  We still need practice to determine the right light setting.  So far the pictures have been a mix of too light, too dark, and just right.  Hopefully we get better!","My daughter bought this camera for a friend's birthday. Her friend loved it. I got to se it yesterday to take a picture. Point , click and out pops the picture. the quality of the picture was good.","This camera is adorable!  The old school polaroids just got cooler!  Bought this for my niece for her birthday and she is creating  an art collage with all the cool photos she's taking!  Recommend this for young and old!  it's an inexpensive way to create unique art!","This is the year 2014, everything is digital.  I live in NYC.  I absolutely love this camera.  it is so much fun.  Tourists and locals all are amazed that I have it and want one.  People love taking pictures of us with it wherever we go and it is so much fun.  Everyone always asks me where I got it.  Digital is one thing but we all have that and use it, and over use it.... but something you can touch and feel and put in your wallet is really unique these days.  Our fridge is covered with these pictures and everyone who comes over asks where I got this camera.  I never write reviews, but this is one I felt compelled to write.  My sister and I are going on a seven day cruise through the Southern Caribbean, I bought 11 packs of film for the trip :)","This is a durable camera. I've dropped this thing multiple times and it shoots pictures just as well as the first time I used it.","Great Christmas gift for my 12 year old. She had a blast with it. The whole family has had fun with it a great gift.","This camera is FANTASTIC! It's an updated throwback to the Polaroid! It turns on quickly, no waiting and the settings are easy too. It's a little bulky but if you wanted something lesser so, just take pics with your smartphone. This is a toy and a conversation piece and will bring many people's memories back to the Polaroid days.","I love this camera! its small and portable, and has good quality photos.  Its a good price for something like this.  I recommend this for anyone!","I bought this for my daughter.  It was easy to use and she love it.  I choose this over the polaroid and I am glad I did.","I bought this for my younger 17 year old sister for Christmas.  She absolutly loves it and all her friends really liked it to.  She used it on NYE and got a lot of great pictures.  I also have one but the larger one, and I love mine!  Great product, would recommend.","it is a little too pricey and so are the films but i have little kids and its easier to keep track with memories! :) love the item!!","I bought this camera for my personal enjoyment. I love it and so does all my friends. Instant pics that are clear. Definitely fun to have around. Nostalgia from my childhood.","OH. MY. GOSH. The camera was beautiful, small, and adorable. It was easy to use, came SUPER SUPER FAST and well packaged, came with instructions AND a cute little matching blue string so I could wear it around my neck. The pictures came out flawless, clear, and cute. I taped them up on my wall. The pictures were focused and I cannot get over how cute the whole thing is, and kids can use it. So, if you're debating whether to get this or not, I totally totally reccomend it. It was EXACTLY what I was looking for, even more, and prettier, cuter, (sorry for the overuse of the word cute, it's just so CUTE!) and easier than a typical Polaroid. It's my favorite thing EVER, even though the flash might hurt you or your pets eyes.","Absolutely love this camera! I really wish the film wasn't so expensive and that it would come with a pack, but I love the different flash options you can use and the film quality is great!","I'm in love with this camera. This is exactly what I've been looking for. I definitely recommend this camera it's so cute !!","It's a really nice camera, it came in fast and is very easy to use. The film is expensive but I really enjoy the quality I the photos.","I love this camera!  I will use it frequently, size is right, cool looking, and the price is right!  Good purchase.","great camera!!! I love using it!! warning thought if you take a direct pictur of the sun as in a sunset or sunrise  you will get a little blue dot in the middle so you guys don't think it's defective. other than that I love it! be careful not to take pictures in a lot of a lot of sunlight because it may turn out white but you just have to play around with it OH AND BUY FILM BC IT DOESNT COME WITH IT","This camera was amazing! It came to be half the price it is on urban outfitters  and in mint condition! I can't stop using this camera, it's perfect!","The product was very good, however the size of the film are much smaller than they seem, i was a little disappointed but in the end, there was no malfunctions and it was in a great condition.","I gave it as a gift and it was one of the best things I could have done. It's exactly what they wanted.","I love my camera! It shipped very quickly and on time.<br />It's super cute, comes with simple instructions and comes with a wrist strap.<br />It takes good photos except in poor lighted areas but it's a Polaroid so that's kind of what I expected.<br />The film/ size of the picture it spits out is about the size of a business card. It's really cute and great for journaling or scrap booking.<br />I had very reasonable expectations for this camera and it is honestly just a lot of fun.<br />Seems to be very durable.<br />Takes two double A batteries (If I remember right) and they actually provide them to you within the box.<br />Very good product.","I got this cute blue camera on Valentine's day. I love it.so much. The blue color is cute.and the picture is beautiful.","This was a really good gift for my teenage daughter.  She uses it a lot. The film is a little high but you can find some deals on multi packs.  I love that the camera came in colors.  Im sure her and her friends will enjoy this a lot..","Used this at the sign in table for my wedding.  Instead of a book, I had my greeters take pictures of the guests to display on a photo board.  Was a huge hit.  The camera was also a huge hit!!  Love the business size photo cards.  Great quality for such a small instant camera.","Camera was well-packaged and came with everything described. Note that the camera doesn't come with film so you have to buy film packs separately.<br />Unfortunately, I am left-eye dominant, so looking through the viewfinder is a little silly compared to cameras with the viewfinder centered.<br />Overall, satisfied with this except that it arrived two days later than expected, and shipping information didn't update during those two days.","Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 8 year-old granddaughter.  It was a favorite.  Film is a bit pricey, but well worth it for the enjoyment of instant printed photos.","This pink carema was very nice ! So my friend liked it!!!I will buy it next month!!3Q very much!!!!(*^__^*) U","I love this camera. It is so cute and lightweight intake it everywhere! The pictures look vintage and mostly clear, it's great!","I use this at most parties and people are interested in it. It great to hang the photos on the wall or put the photos in your wallet.","As a lover of the past brings back many memories using this type of technology because by keeping it on the market","Bought this camera for my daughter. She really likes it. I was having a difficult time finding this camera at stores, so I finally tried the internet. It was delivered within the time promised.","It's so cute and love the light blue color! It's a bit more lightweight than the original Instax camera that I have and I think the functions are awesome. Auto detection for lighting is so much better than the original camera because you can't gauge how dark or light some pictures will come out based on where you are inside or outside. Love that it's not as clunky! Definite great buy. Just wished that it didn't feel so cheap, the plastic kind of feels like if you dropped the camera it would just fall apart.","It was as described, very compact, easily portable, and very cute! I got it as a gift for my sister and she loves it. Takes great pictures.","It is very nice look. Good quality I have ever seen. It is a very good gift choice. I like it.","loved it! very and on time just like it was advertised - does what its supposed to so im happy","Well I'm not expecting any further function on this camera other than instant photo. It works great and got to make sure you switch to the right mode where you are picturing (indoor, outside, etc).","It's a very camera to use. I bring it around with me every time I meet up with friends. And I always get compliments on how cute the camera is!","We purchased this camera for our daughter & as parents remember the old Polaroid instant pictures. This is camera is more advanced as it has modes to adjust for the lighting & the pictures come out on top in the size of a credit card. The film can be purchased here on Amazon but have recently began to see them at local Wal-Mart's. If you have a teenage daughter then I'm sure they'll love this gift for years to come.","I love this camera, its so cute ! and the pictures come out great ! So happy with this item!","This came earlier than expected! I recently purchased this because i felt like these are my teen years and that i'd love to reflect and look back on these pictures when I'm older. the camera is the perfect size and is adorable. it's amazingly fun and all of my family members and friends keep asking to get their picture taken to be added to my scrapbook. this is great if you want to catch some of your memories over the years without having to go and get them printed. I'm already recommending this to all my friends and this is a perfect gift for a teen or someone who is into photography.","quality camera with all the charm film brings but with a modern look and functionality. came new with packing and very speedy shipping. I would definitely recommend this item.","My 9 year old daughter received this for her birthday. She loves it! The pictures turn out clear. She also got the sticker pack to decorate the frame of each picture. The polka dot camera case is great for her to carry it around and take pictures without taking the camera out. I love it!","In love with this mini instant camera!! Extremely easy to use, the photos are adorable and the price can't be beat.","Bought my daughter this camera. And her and her friends just loves it. Very light and easy to take around with them. Pictures come out well. And she loves the deco film we can order for it as well.","I love this camera.  The reason I wanted one was because I missed using Polaroids and I used them growing up as a kid.<br /><br />I love the functionality and the pretty colors that it comes in.<br /><br />I am very happy with the quality that Fujifilm has for their products, and am excited to buy film with different designs upon them all!","Love this little camera. It is lots of fun. U pay a little more for film but its worth it. Everywhere u take it is a big hit.","I love my Polaroid! it's so great and it come w/ settings to change your brightness! definitely get it! a","This is perfect, try not to use it in light backgrounds but i've gotten some really good candids of my friends and family. It took really cool pictures of my plants and the snow outside. I love it!","Really happy with the purchase, was exactly what I was expecting.  With the actual specs of the camera, it's kind of annoying that flash can't be turned off, so I've covered it in black electrical tape, but that's about it.  Really nice camera to have when trying to take quick pictures and have 'instant gratification' with the physical photo in your hand.  I would really recommend this for someone who wants a good instant camera, but isn't willing to pay the 40+ dollars for polaroid film and/or a 100 dollar camera.","It is so cute! The product itself is adorable! And The picture filmed by it is very clear, love it!","The camera is fun to use and easy to travel with. With the small size I can throw the camera in my purse and I'm ready to go! This would also make a great gift for someone!","I got the pink color and it is so cute! Easy to use, great for travel. I will actually use this for my wedding guestbook/photobook! I bought it with Fujifilm Instax Mini Instant Film, 10 Sheets (5-Pack).","This is such a fun camera.  It brings back memories of the old polaroids!  The picture quality is very similar to the old polaroids as well, so don't expect \"today's digital camera\" quality :)  I debated between these small prints and the larger ones, but with the cost of the film, figured I'd stick to the tiny pics.  Film is too expensive to waste, so I only break out this camera on certain occasions!  Just a lot of fun, and all my friends get a good laugh when they try it out (at least those that are old enough to remember the other instant cameras)!","Dinner with the family and the Instax was the only thing she asked for on her 16th birthday. She loves it!","Very cute small camera, portable and instant. Took a lot picture with it, but be careful not to expose too much sunlight when waiting for the film. Otherwise the picture will be totally white","I love this camera I've always wanted a instant film camera and I was so happy when I found it on the website and I was able to get it for very reasonable price I'm very happy with this product and I would definitely recommend it to others the pictures are great and it is very inexpensive.","My guilty pleasure. I love this tiny little thing! I honestly think I have better pictures with this camera than our dslr. We choose film that has the normal background edges or the ones with different colors, or characters. It's wonderful!<br /><br />I purchased the case with it an it works great too. It's nice when you're out and about, take photos and are able to put them on the side compartment until you can store them somewhere else. I'm extremely happy with this purchase.","This camera produces great quality prints, and it's so fun to use! The different light settings easily capture proper lighting for different settings.","This camera is very good! And the shipment is very good too. It's very fast. And this camera is soooo cute!<br />I love it!","This is the coolest camera ever! If you like old school polaroid cameras then this is a classy, fun way to go.  The pink color is cute and retro and it comes with some film. I love it!","I bought this for my young daughter because she is always taking pictures with my digital camera and never gets to do anything with the results (I'm one of those people who's pictures pretty much sit on the computer). I also thought it would help her take more clear pictures because she would see the results right away.<br /><br />She loves it, and I've had tons of fun with it as well. She has her own little journal that is enhanced with photos (of Christmas, vacations, etc). Will definitely need to order more film!<br /><br />Bottom line- the camera works like you would expect (if you've ever seen an instant film camera and the resulting picture) and everyone wants to use it or have their photo taken. I spent way too long comparing the different cameras, now I see it just doesn't matter! Photos look exactly like they did on my old mini Polaroid I had 15 years ago, and on the full size Polaroid my parents had before that. I chose the Fuji brand because I liked the color and shape (thought my daughter would), the price, size and price of film, but I don't think the various models really make a difference.","If your looking for a Polaroid camera well by this one. You can chose the colors you want by blue,pink,yellow,black and white and very good quality picture.","this is a great little camera. got it for my daughter for Christmas present. and she just loved it.  its amazing you actually get pictures in your hand. better than digital!! just like the old days! I want one!!","Camera is a great price and the film is a bit expensive but the sentimental value is worth it :)","This is an awesome camera to bring to the party. Many people at the party didn't know what this is and how it worked. I guess technology does move fast. haha But really wonderful machine and it's really fun to use it with friends.","Because it is all what i asked for and everything that is explained i. The reviews i love this camera very vintage and hipster if you are looking for something like that!","Works wonderfully. The next best thing to a Polaroid 600. Works fast. Great color! Wonderful. I would love to try the bigger version.","My pink instax mini is my first camera and i wanted it to be retro. It is  a convocation starter exciting people who thought that these cameras where extinct and easy way to take pictures and keep them as memoirs. Great for scrap booking or for the start of enjoying photography.","I got this camera so I could take quick fast pictures of my new puppy. It does pretty well with taking inside pictures but outside pictures can be iffy. I took two pictures of my puppy in snow and on them both the whole picture looks like it is still waiting to fully develop. Overall though it is a great camera and I am really happy with this purchase.","This camera is sooo cool! Brings back memories of the 80's when I had an Polaroid instant camera. The only down side is the cost of the film.","I am so glad I made the right decision and asked for the Instax mini 8. I had to choose between the instax 25 and the 8 and i made the right choice. My pictures came out better than I expected. I am so happy. This product is a must get and an upgrade from my old polaroid","my wife wanted this camera for a long time im glad you guys had it for a great price thanks","I bought this product for my sister who really wanted a Polaroid camera for Christmas.<br />The packaging was secured and the item was clean and very good to use.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars because it was not really for me and I never used it but overall, she seems to be satisfied and it came on time!","I love the camera. Gives me everything I expected and wanted. No regrets at all. Very light weight and great for traveling. Just used it to test it out and it was amazing. Great for memories and events! would love to recommend to others about this amazing camera. Would make people jealous and envious about how cool this instant camera is! love love!","It's a great and affordable camera that gives you that fantastic nostalgic feeling! Very easy to use and the photos turn out great! Hipsters would definitely approve. If I had a time machine, I'd go back in time and buy this again and again.","Fun and an easy camera to use.  The pictures can be a little small though so be prepared for small visuals.","I love pink so much so I bought this pink camera for myself. Really enjoyed taking it with me during my super wonderful trip!","My step daughter absolutely loved it. She got it for Christmas and she has been enjoying it with friends and family.","My daughter got this camera at Christmas and we have found it works very well. It does exactly what it is designed to do - produce instant pictures. But if you are looking for high resolution portrait type quality, this is not designed to do that. It gives you nice little pictures to give to others on the spot.","I wish there was an instant camera available that took bigger pictures, otherwise the camera works well and the prints are good quality","My daughter loves this camera.<br />It works great and is great for a kids scrapbook.<br />The pictures are good quality for being so small.","Got this camera for our honeymoon this summer and cannot wait to use it, absolutely love this product it is great!","This camera was exactly what I was looking for. Shipping was fast. It's a great value for the money. Would buy again.","I love how it's really lightweight, pretty, and easy to handle. All you have to do is load the film, look in the viewfinder, and press the button! The only thing that bothered me was the parallax of the viewfinder, but thats for almost every type of camera. It can get scratched easily, but the texture of it is nice. It's also convenient that it came with batteries to get you started, and a strap to protect it from accidentally falling out of your hand haha. It's also a good price (I got it for 70 with free shipping) for such a nice camera that is the upgraded version of the 7s! :)","This is a fantastic little instant camera.  The design is fun and modern.  The pics, while -very small, come out pretty crisp and clear.  While instant film cameras will never replace digital or even traditional film cameras, if you're looking for something fun and something that can sate your need for \"instant gratification\", I would go with this camera.","I ordered this camera to use at my wedding for people to include pics when they signed the guestbook.  It is perfect.","Got this for my nephew for Christmas this year. I thought he'd like it, but I didn't know just how much he would love it. He called to tell me it is his favorite Christmas gift, and then he went on to explain all of the features/everything he's taken a photo of so far. He takes it with him everywhere. Glad I got it for him!","Bought this for my girlfriend because they are all the craze right now. It was significantly cheaper than ones in stores such as Urban Outfitters. The camera works great and my girlfriend was satisfied! Great camera for the money.","this camera is an amazing throwback product of the 80's that adds wonder to the art of photography. somehow the thrill has returned to taking pictures and having a tangible \"actual photograph\" to give to a friend to remember you by. this was a gift for my wife and it has made her so happy that precious memories are no longer at constant risk of ending up on the internet but will remain with you privately. the quality of the pictures are amazing inspite of the small size of the film. we took photos in broad daylight and the pictures came out crisp and clear. the time it takes for the film to develop was fast but just enough to cause some suspense. the size of the film is perfect for a shirt pocket so shoot away!","Works as well as described and is easy to use, pictures have great color and sharpness! Love the look of the retro photos!","We have had so much fun with this camera.  Be forewarned, the pictures are smaller than the polaroids of the 70's, but they are fun to take.  Using it for a project in room décor, hanging the pictures along a hanging wire on the wall, really cute.","The camera is cute and the kids get a kick out of it....but the picture is very small and you need to get quite a bit closer thatn you would generally need to in order to get the close up picture that you wanted.<br /><br />The film is also expensive....this is more just a novelty gift as opposed to a functional camera.....but it's fun!","I had low expectations for this camera, and boy, was I pleasantly surprised! Camera takes excellent close to mid range shots. So far, I haven't taken that many shots (because of the price of the film, around a $1 per photo), but most of them have turned out excellent. I have received many compliments on the quality of the photo and its uniqueness. I only wish the it had optional flash; the flash is always used on every photo. It's my new go to camera for parties, and it's great to share an actual photo with friends and family. If you are looking to spend a little bit more money, I would recommend and looking at the newer, more stylish and more featured Fujifilm Instax camera, but for those who are looking to replicate the older Polaroid cameras, this is a great buy!","Great quality with less expense and fast delivery. I'll definitely recommend this product. I bought for my sister and she just loves it!","Great! Shipped super lightning fast. My wife loves her new gift. It's great. We get to have these little keepsake instant pictures of our kids.","The pictures are smaller than I thought they would be they are clear.  I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others","Everything was as expected and I am very happy with it. The camera is great and so much fun to use.","It has a great look, and takes good quality pictures.<br />This is really good to have if you're making a scrapbook, collage, etc.","exactly what we hoped for when we got it. pictures are a little smaller than we expected, kind of a bit smaller than traditional baseball cards. but great!","I couldn't give it a 5 star for a simple reason.<br />I still can't figure out the perfect lighting for perfect occasion.<br />But overall, it's very easy to use and SO CUTE to carry around.<br />It's a good size and weight.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it especially at this price.","This camera was exactly what I wanted. The size is a little smaller than what a \"Polaroid\" would be but as stated, the size was exactly what I wanted.","It's a great camera. Fun, easy to use and takes good pics! Plus it's pink and it's perfect for a teen!","Good product.... Good transaction....overall good experience... Would definitely shop with Amazon again especially when the holidays are drawing near !","I bought three of the Instax Minis for a family Christmas gift -- a family scavenger hunt around our city.  They are cute, and a fun gimmick.  Because I bought three, with the scavenger hunt in mind, I wasn't concerned about the size of the prints; however, the prints are small (the size of a credit card, as someone else posted).  These cameras are a great, fun way to share a few smiles and laughs at parties.","This camera it's absolutely amazing, incredible photos, everyone ask us where we bought it !, incredible delivery, I definitely recommend buying this! Everyone enjoys it and luv intax pics it's TOTALLY FETCH!!!! ILUV IT ","My daughter loves this and although it took a few more days to get it, it was worth it.  She loves retro and it takes really awesome small instant pictures. Easy to use, instant gratification","Easy to use, love the color. I recommend the printed film for any occasion. Purchased the holiday pack because this was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She enjoyed taking photos of family and friends during the holiday. The plain film is good but not as fun. I also purchased the brown leather artisan vintage case for it. She loves it!","Would have loved the pink but daughter was very happy, this is a fun item but, film can get pricey! Should come with at least one pack of film!","These are adorable, fun and they take great photos (well... they take great instant photos which are traditionally very very poor)<br /><br />When my daughter started asking for one of these for Christmas I was pretty annoyed since she already owns a Canon PowerShot G series and she uses my Digital SLR. I could not understand why anyone would want an instant camera which costs approximately $1 per photo and takes awful pictures.<br /><br />However - This deal on Amazon makes it acceptable (if still sort of pointless) in that you can buy 2 rolls of 10 pictures for $13 and the camera at a steal.<br /><br />Compared to digital this is a joke and a toy - but compared to finding a decent Polaroid and paying for THAT film, this is quite frugal and fun.","The camera brought a lot of joy to our 7 year old at Christmas as her very first camera. Thanks","While I would love to say it worked out well, aside from it being a pink camera, (her favorite color), it's a little foreign to present this to our 5 year old, in hopes that \"instant gratification of a printed picture and watching it develop before her eyes\" would have won her over, with the age of digital cameras and photographs. Maybe in a year or so, she will have more patience to wait to capture a moment, and enjoy the printed picture, or sharing it with friends. That is our hope! We did get a couple of good pictures, but we had to walk her through the process and we definitely wasted several pictures in the interim. With only 10 per roll, timing and patience are key.","The camera is sturdy and easy to use. My eight year old daughter had a blast with it. Maybe too good a time; she went through 40 exposures in one day!<br /><br />Be warned, the film is very pricey so this is not a camera for everyday use.","After doing some research, Amazon is the cheapest, most convenient way to buy the Instax Mini 8 online. A trip to Urbanscape would burn u an extra 40usd plus for the same thing.","I like this camera a lot! I have taken great pictures on it. However the dial that adjusts the settings doesn't seem to work :( I twist it and it stays on the outdoor setting.","Love this reminds me of my school days with the old Polaroid. The pictures are DL size but so vintage and camera is good quality too and great price.","we got this during our Christmas Holiday celebration , passed it around and everyone used it remembering the old Polraoids we had when we were younger.  My son, 9 thinks it the BOMB!","I bought this instant camera for my ten year old daughter and she loves it! Here is her review on it:  Its fairly easy to start and I love how this camera is small and modern but at the same time you get the old school feeling as well. When I took My first picture I was surprised that it came out white but my Mom and dad both laughed and told me that I had to wait for it to dry before I could see actual colors! The day that I got the camera was also my dads birthday so when we went out to dinner I took at least 8 pictures! Thanks Mom!","This is exactly what she wanted, in the style and color she requested. She was using it within minutes of opening the package.","I bought it for my girlfriend and I had the mini7 and this one is so much better,  its thinner and has more features.  Good product","good looking does the job granddaughter happy too soon to give more details but over haul great camera. waiting for first set of pictures","Bought this for our 12 yr. old granddaughter for her family's mission trip to Haiti, where they helped with a Vacation Bible School.  She loved it - and it filled the purpose for her of taking lots of pixs of the children.  A neat side note, she gave away the pixs to the kids, many whom had never seen a pixture of themselves!  I bought the 100 pix pack so she was even able to take photos as souviners for the family.  The photos are small but that was okay. It's an easy-to-use camera, which was the whole point of buying it for a young girl. I purchased the camera bag as well, which she told me was very handy and kept it clean. Since arriving back home, I ordered for film for her to use with her friends. I consider it a real good buy, especially for the original purpose!","I love it, its perfect! The only dissappointment is how expensive the film is. :/ The pictures I have taken are really great so far! :)","I love this camera!  In the digital age all my pics end up stored on sd cards or computer files or on facebook and it can be a time cosuming project to sort and print these.  This camera is really fun and takes great (however small) pictures.  My kids loved the novelty of it.","This was a Christmas gift and well worth the money!  The picture is clear and you can capture the moment and have the picture right there as it happens.  The only thing that would make this product better, would be including a small package of film.  I thought that it came with a small package of film and luckily I took the camera out for inspection.  That was my fault, however, it would have been nice.  :)","This polaroid camera takes good pictures under the right lighting.  It isn't something you would want to rely on for those \"have to capture\" moments.  But it is a solid and simple throwback to a time where polaroids were our only affordable option.  The size of the picture is smaller than the old-style polaroid.  Approximately 2 x 3.  It was a gift for my pre-teen daughter and she LOVES it.","I always wanted one of these! It's amazing! But the film can be a bit pricey. It's also kinda difficult to pick in the beginning which one to choose for a setting in the camera.","i've been wanting this camera how a long time and i found the price to be very reasonable. this camera is super super cute and fun to use! i brought it to school and all my friends wanted to take pictures and they kept saying how cute it was!<br /><br />everything about this camera is cute. but something that i really wanted to know when buying this was if it came with film or not. IT DOES NOT COME WITH FILM. you do not know how many times i've looked for this answer to this \"question\". BUY FILM. luckily i did buy film.<br /><br />it takes small pictures but the pictures are cute.","We bought this camera for our teenage daughter for Christmas and it's one of her favorite presents!  She took it to a sleepover recently and it was a huge hit with her friends, too!  The pictures are tiny and cute and mostly clear in sunny conditions.  She LOVES getting the picture right away to pass out to her friends and it's super easy to set up and use.  A+ gift for a teenager!!!","My 10 year old daughter loves this camera. It was her favorite Christmas gift. Easy to use and good picture quality.","Did not want to get my girl some technology just because everyone else was getting it--expensive and we are not ready to start patrolling her internet exposure. Instant photos are fun and the hit of every party. She loves it.","This camera is so cute!  And it works well.  The pictures are clear but still appear retro grainy - which makes it even more fun!  The camera is slippery though so I bought the case made for the camera - you can leave the bottom portion of the case on the camera and still take pictures - which makes it easier to handle!","i love it!! i have been taking so many pictures ever since i got it and its great. definatly get this camera!","Had a lot of good and surprise comments about Polaroid.  Good camera for my daub<br />Daughter to fool around with cuzzins.","This is a good product for the money. I took a picture of a lighted christmas tree indoor and the photo was more white shaded with the flash on. But its is ok. the camera serves my purpose.","we will not use it for the important things, but will have a lot of fun using it for parties and my 13 year old daughter will use if often with her friends.  It works great!","I love this camera so much! My dear sister got it for me as a birthday gift and it works just fine. If you know how to use the settings, the picture comes out perfect. Plus look at the color! Cute! If you are looking for a Polaroid camera, look no further!","Love love love this!  It was my 9 year old daughters favorite gift!!  All her friends want one now. I think it will encourage her to be a better photographer because she won't just take endless digital pictures","Great little 'Polaroid'. We had fun taking photos of children at an event and then giving them the photos immediately allowing them to watch the photo develop. The children were amazed as they had never seen a Polaroid type photo before.","Best gift ever! According to my 16 year old granddaughter !  Thank you, now I need a lot more film","I have a spouse that loves cameras and pictures. The camera itself is built well. The pictures are fun since they are instant. The camera takes good pictures in various light conditions to include low lighting. If your a photo person or happen to be married to one, you will want to get this camera.","Searched for a better price and Amazon, of course, came through as the best. This camera was bought as a gift. My son loves it. The hardest part was finding film. Amazon had that as well. A lot nicer than conventional Polaroid. Takes nice pictures.","love my fujifilm instax mini 8 very easy to use buying the big bundle of the film is better it saves you plenty of money.","I gave this to my eight year old and I think I might get one for myself. It is so fun, the kids all love it. We use it to put pictures in their journals. Totally recommend","ORDERED FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER.  IT ARRIVED JUST AS EXPECTED.  SHE WAS THRILLED WITH IT.  WOULD ORDER AGAIN WITHOUT A PROBLEM.","It's amazing!!!! I loved the camera and my family freak out with too,everybody wants a Polaroid now...Amazing delivery and amazing camera","Got this for my granddaughter and she loves, loves, loves it!!!  The pictures turn out clear and sharp.  Just too cute!!!!!","Help my friend to buy one. I don't open it but looks nice. Very cute and beautiful.<br />It fits girls.","My 16-year old wanted an instant camera but didn't know which brand to get.  After reviewing feedback from others on Amazon, I decided to purchase the Instax Mini 8 instant film camera.  I don't regret it.  My daughter is happy with it, with the quality of the pictures, and ease of use.  It is definitely a straight-forward camera to use.  Glad we went with the Fujifilm instax mini 8!","This was a Christmas gift for our 13 yr old granddaughter.  She loves it.  The pictures are decent and camera is easy to operate.","I purchased this camera for our 6-year old granddaughter because it would enable her to take pictures and see the outcomes quickly. The fact that it was available in her favorite color contributed to my decision. She opened the box under the Christmas tree and absolutely loved it.  As it is easy to operate, she immediately took a couple of pictures.  Her excitement at seeing the people in the pictures shortly after was infectious. Everyone wanted to look at the pictures and try the camera.  She hung onto the snapshots still the next day when waving us good bye from the car. She said, 'How did Santa know that that is exactly what I wanted?\" I gave it a rating of four because the pictures are good but do not expect top notch quality. I recommend this camera to anyone who likes to see pictures rather than store them in cyberspace. Can you imagine its usefulness at a children's birthday party?  The hostess may take pic of everyone invited with the B-day baby and give it to them as a souvenir. Handy and fun sums up this camera!","she likes it and that's all. Though at first we need to figure out how to use it. Happy New Year","This was a gift for my 15 yr old daughter. She loves it and it is easy to use.The only downside is the expensive film that is only available online.","Great camera for kids 9+ years. They get a kick out of the pictures developing in an instant. Camera came in quick....","What a great investment!  We've used the camera for a reunion for our therapy clients.  They loved the instant memory with their family member!  Good quality pix and processing!","I hope a lot of you have looked around places other than amazon to get this camera. The price on here is ludicris. You can get this camera at walmart, target, and newegg.com for 50-60 dollas I stead of 100. Just wanted all of you to knlw this before you invest your money in this!!","I have loved instant cameras all my life and I am glad I chose this one. It is not for everyday use but perfect for documenting all of my holiday events and it amazed everyone who saw me us it. Love the nostalgia.","easy to set up & use, pictures came out clear, bought for kids and they love the novelty of it! Just have to remind them there's only 10 photo's per film as they're used to taking numerous ones with their digital.","I have nothing bad to say about this camera...and neither do any of the other people who see it.  It's just such a cute, cool, retro item to have.","Arrived on time. Meets the description. Happy with  the product, no complaints whatsoever. Bought it as a gift for my little sister, she loves it.","This is awesome camera, takes great pictures, easy to use, simple settings, and it is just plain fun to use.","This camera takes sweet little instant pics. This camera feels good to. It doesnt feel like a cheap item. Its got a little weight and feels well made. Highly recommend for teens and scrap/smash bookers.","bought this for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loves it.  A great buy.  Thinking about buying one for my mom.","I like it. It takes the best pictures and it's really cute. The pictures have a really good quality and design","Gave it to my 13 year old daughter for her birthday party. She liked the instant viewing of the pictures so much she used up all the film during the party.","the Fiji instax is so adorable and perfect to capture memories. Although its not the best quality it was exactly what I was looking for I take it everywhere. Something that I want forever","Great little camera got it for my daughter who's 10 she loved it..film not to bad priced through amazon ...","Does what it says and prints decent quality instant photos. Easy to use and seems quite sturdy. This camera was for my 8 yr old daughter and she and I are both really happy with it.","This was by far by 9 year old daughter's favorite Christmas gift. She loves getting instant pictures. And it's easy to use!","Purchased this for my 5 year old for Christmas. She is able to handle the camera on her own and was instantly able to turn it on and snap away!  Love the color and ease of this product!","Bought this camera for my daughter and although the pics are not high def. they are cute and perfect! Would recommend for any teen!!","My granddaughter, age 8, loves this camera I got her for Christmas.  I also got the clear camera case to protect it.  Only down side is they did not include film with it but luckily I bought some for extra so she was able to take pictures as soon as we had it together for her.  Highly recommend for grade school age children anyway.","perfect! paid a little more than in the stores, but worth it as it was in stock and arrived on time!!","It's good in some cases but not that good quality<br />well i guess you get what you paid for<br />also, my light keeps blinking in the wrong setting<br />I guess ill tell square trade ...since i have one","So easy to operate.  Takes great clear pictures.  Everyone loved it at the Christmas party.  It was a big hit.<br />Everything old becomes new again.","My daughter received this camera for Christmas. It happens to be her favorite gift! The film prints out the top of the camera and takes a few minutes to develop. The film is costly, and the photos are small. However, the quality of the prints are not bad at all. I would recommend for anyone who is looking for a small, compact instant film camera.","Granddaughter just loved the instant gratification this camera gives....took her a little while to get on to how close she needed to be to get a good pic. Used the twin-paks of film already!","I absolutely LOVE this camera! I have a Polaroid Sun 660 but they stopped making film for it, and it's super expensive from other sellers. The Instax Mini 8 is both cute and portable, and the film is pretty cheap: 20 photos for ~$13. Can't beat it.<br /><br />The only problem I have is that night photos are awful and rarely develop. Make sure you're in at least semi-good lighting because the little flash on the camera won't do much good in darker settings.","Bought this as a gift for my young adult daughter who is into photography.  Her first comment was that it seemed a little cheaply made, but she's use to the quality, weight and feel of a high-end Canon.  It works very well and seem simple to use.","I love this camera its perfect and really fun! I take it everywhere with me! Im a bit couscous about what i take pictures of because the film is kind of pricey. But other than that, it works well and the pictures turn out great and full of color!","The camera is easy to use but came with no film to start off with. I didn't order a box of film and my granddaughter was very disappointed she couldn't take any pictures. It would have been an extremely<br />courteous gesture to have included a small role of film.","My daughter loves it and it produced quality pictures. They are small pics but she likes it. Easy to use also.","We bought this for a picture guest book for our wedding. The wedding was in the evening and the pictures were a little darker than we would like. You have to get really close to see the faces and some things around them.<br />The camera is actually easy to use. Just the quality of the pictures that we were a little disappointed with.<br />The camera came in as expected, no problems or anything.","It is good, I like it. And the color is also beautiful. It is real a good thing. Thank you.","It is a nice product, easy to setup and use, picture clarity also pretty good. Really handy for instant pictures","My daughter loved this present. It takes decent pictures but I think the flash is a bit too strong. Washes them out a bit.","Product exceeded my expectations and I would recommend this item to all my family and friends! Great quality and awesome customer service.","I would recommend this camera to anyone that doesn't mind spending money on film. I love this camera. I do wish, however, that there were a way I could turn the flash off. Other than that, 5/5 star rating.","i like it !!it is so good for me to take photo! i like this price ~~ it is good!","I love this camera and sometimes retro is better. You have to be careful with the type of lighting that you have and it doesn't really come with directions about the setting but other than that no complaints. Plus the color is cute and its light enough to slip in your purse","This camera is beautifully crafted. I love the matte finish of the pastel color. It doesn't become a fingerprint magnet. It has that vintage feel with modern twists to it. The different lighting settings are easy to use and gives you the best possible shot. This pictures itself have that retro, filtered look that instagram tries to mimic. My friends and I have so much fun with this camera. I love taking pictures at parties. The camera is kind of like a magnet, it just draws everyone towards it. Most definitely the life of the party. There's nothing better than seeing the look on people's faces while they're watching the film develop right in front of their eyes. If you have any hesitations about buying the camera... don't. I believe it's money well spent. Be wary that with instant cameras, it now cost money to take pictures and mistakes can cost you an exposure, but it's all part of the experience. It's a great buy.","Love this camera! So fun and takes cute little pictures. It's fun to watch the pictures develop right in front of you. Takes pretty decent pictures too. Very easy to use. Definitely would recommend.","I got this camera for my daughter's 10th birthday, and we both love it. It's very easy to figure out and use. The only thing we had to look at the instructions for was the direction to load the film. Everything on it works perfectly.","awesome little polaroid you can take on the go. The picture comes out really nice and the fixed focus makes things much easier. Unfortunately the film is quite expensive, so make sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you invest into these things!","Great color, Great price, Great Quality. The Camera prints instant photos you can hold and share. Great way for cheap reliable photos.","Exactly what I wanted. Fun and easy to use. Big but I like that it stands out. Film is easy to find. Price was way cheaper on amazon than any store. Love it love it love it","i like it. it was very simple. i'm not fancy pictures came out pretty clear. in our dark house we had to make sure it was high def.","Although it took me a while to figure out the brightness settings when taking indoor pictures, I really have enjoyed having the ability to have them printed out instantly. It is not a high quality camera, but one worth having if you are looking to decorate your space with unique photographs.","This camera is spectacular. It's a bit big but I lOVE it and the way it takes pictures especially how the film is wallet sized.  They are too cute","I bought this as a present after lots of research, and I couldn't be happier! I'm not familiar with polaroid or fujifilm instax cameras, but I am very happy that I got the Instax Mini 8. The pictures turn out WAY better than I expected, making very unique mementos. Images were clear, flash isn't too bright, and believe it or not, we actually managed to take a very nice \"selfie!\" Don't worry if you can't read Japanese -- putting the film and batteries into the camera was very straightforward and easy. Can't wait to take this to future events with friends and family!","The mini 8 is really cute and easy to use. I love the color of light mint. The price is also comparatively good.","Great fun for my 5-year-old twins.  They can take pictures themselves and unlike pictures taken on the phone they can keep the photos.","I really love this camera! It is fairly small, it's easy to take selfies or pictures with another person. The quality of the picture really depends on your lighting. The automatic light detection feature is pretty nice. It doesn't always work perfectly, but there's only really been 1 out of about 15 pictures that i've taken that hasn't come out good because of it. The only complaint is that the pictures are fairly small, but that's kind of the point.","This one is really good, i bought this for taking pictures for my baby. it is useful. it is worth  this money.","really love this cute one, the color is bright and fresh, really fashionable, brought me so much fun, recommend this to people who have this affection.","Came on time, I super love it. And the packaging was goood too. I really love the pink. I do wish they provided at least a film or two. Good thing my film came in first so do order films","my daughter loves it! it was a early christmas gift. the bad part... i need to check for good deals on films","Great little camera. Durable and easy to use. GF and kids love it. I hate that the pink colour was the cheapest however. Would have liked to gotten in black, but I'm not paying $10 more just for different colour.","Remember polaroids?  This camera is the technological successor to the bygone instant camera.  It's a little fancier around the edges than an old school polariod, but the pictures comes out on tiny little business card shaped film.  Adorable for a novelty, but not really for any sort of serious photography.","Kids, you will be the first on your street with this.  If you love tiny pictures in your wallet, this is for you.<br />It's a trip to 1955.","fun to use and less expensive than the polariod models, love the color choices for this camera, easy to operate...just plain fun to use","I LOVE this camera. Its so cute and fun. My only negative is that where you look through is small and a bit awkward. But my kids love it when I take pictures of them with this camera.","Very cute camera and easy to use! I love the color too! I brought it to a party and had a good time!","So much fun.  I already have one and this was a gift for a teenager so she can chronicle her life.  Love the instant film, though it's expensive!","This takes amazing pictures. We are using it for a birthday party.  Each girl will make a scrapbook page for the birthday girl for her to keep.","One of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon. I adore this camera. It's simple to use and pictures \"develop\" within minutes. I've always wanted an instant camera, and I'm so glad I picked this one!","After much debate, I decided to go with an older model- which isn't to say that the camera is any less better than the newer models, but because I have never owned one, I figured if I break it or something, $60 isn't too steep.<br /><br />First of all, get amazon prime, quickest shipping ever.<br /><br />Second, I love love love the camera! It's not too bulky or too large for me to use one handed (mind you I have really small hands). The shutter button is located on the left side of the camera and the settings are turn-to based- meaning you turn the lens to the setting that best suits your situation. It takes double AA batteries which isn't too bad, better than some other models and it also includes a wrist strap.<br /><br />Third, make sure you purchase instant film, lots of it because you'll want to just snap snap snap at everything.<br /><br />And fourth, I'm having a blast with it and will probably purchase other models when I can to test them all out.","I love this camera so much! I bring it with me almost everywhere, although it takes some space in my bag and can get a little heavy, I'm ready at any moment to capture a event to put on my wall. Very easy to use and I absolutly recommend to anyone! The pictures are kinda small but hey, you get what you pay for. And the picture quality is surprisingly good. All in all I love this camera!<br /><br />Also it's a great conversation piece.","My sister loves this. It takes really cool pictures. I wish the pics were slightly larger...but she absolutely loves it...and they are quite cute when they develop","Absolutely the greatest little camera ever! I purchased this camera specifically to take on vacation with me, and I do not regret it one bit. Easy to carry, easy to use. I have recommended it to several friends already.","I bought this camera for my daughter she wanted it as a birthday gift. It turns out the whole family loves it the pictures are really good.","This Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is worth buying!<br />Very affordable.<br />Comes with a pack of batteries (two AA) and a pink wrist strap.<br />Film needs to be bought separate but the quality of your photos are great! The camera comes with photo settings on the dial.<br />The photo is ready quickly and the photo is the size of a credit card.<br />This pink is the perfect shade.","this is good Camera i purchase form the amazon, the picture come out showing very class and nice, also small camera easy to carry, don't need to spend a lot of money to get a good camera. good Quality make not easy to break.","i love it! so cute and beautiful camera. the only one point i dont like it is the light can not be close alone.","I absolutely love this camera! Great for parties!!! Very fun camera! Only draw back is if you take a pic outside when its sunny, the pic looks washed out...other than that, I highly recommend!!!","I love this camera! Probably an unnecessary purchase, but so much fun.  I took it to a holiday party, and my friends went nuts over it. One of my friends even went in search of one on the way home! The pictures are the perfect size, not too small or too big, and everyone was commenting on how good the picture quality is for a Polaroid. I am sure I will keep this camera for many years to come, and I can't wait to scrapbook with the shots. Highly recommend.","Super cute! Whenever I bring it out my friends all want a picture. Plus I inspired several other friends to buy their own! The pics are tiny but cute. Two people will fit in a frame perfectly, anymore than that and the flash spreads out too far and you can't see everyone. I use it just to capture moments of me and my friends. The film is expensive, so buy it in bulk and use it wisely. The camera fits in my purse and isn't super heavy but you will notice it in a bag.","my girlfriend loves it, she was singing for fujiflim since after i showed her and she is playing with it all the time now<br />If my girlfriend loves it, then i am happy too.","Seriously fun to use. Works perfectly and was easy to start using. The size of the photos is perfect for a memory keepsake.","I bought it as a gift for my girl friend and she loves it. It's really easy and fun to use.","Made my husband so happy with this. He has such fun w/the kids and their friends.  Imagine taking photos the old fashioned way and still getting  a kick out of it.  Takes good shots.","i have been using it when i went out with my friends. it really convenient to carry out and memory the moments with them.","it so cute and it work well!!!! Both my best friend and I got one. it is the camera i'm looking for","I would consider this camera one of my best purchases of all time. I am totally in love with every photo that I take with it. It's very easy to operate and absolutely worth it. I try to use it as often as I can! ?","fun camera but the pictures come out looking blurry/ out of focus. the color looks faded and pics look old","Love this camera So cute and so much fun to play with. I love how the photos have turned out","This camera is light, fun and SUPER easy to use. Make sure you have good batteries (they come with) or else you'll be a little confused as to why the camera won't turn on or load film. It was almost too easy that I overlooked the simplicity and had a little trouble…oops! Anyway, it's fun. I bought it for a guest book and it takes decent pictures and it's very easy to use. It's much larger than it seems online-which I'm very happy with. I recommend it for fun! If you want professional looking photos, this isn't for you.","The cutest instant camera out there! I love the flash settings, and film is easy to find. Lightweight and easy to take along.","Ordered this to do pictures of guests as they arrived at our wedding( instead of a guest book).<br />We clipped them all onto a stand for viewing and EVERYONE loved it!<br /><br />It's a novelty, not for every day use but we were able to capture almost every one of our guests and most were smiling from ear to ear after seeing their photo.<br /><br />Fast delivery and decent pictures. Cute , small but ordered a album with sticker frames too. A real keepsake for us vs. a book of names we will never look at.","I sent it as a gift so that I did not play it at all. But I love the color and my friends like it. That is wonderful.","Love it! Cute and easy to use plus the size is not that big it makes it easy to carry around.","perfect discount! Also, the color is perfect! Though the price of the camera is not expensive, the instant film is so expensiveTOT","LOVE IT!!!! I adore this camera, the pictures are great, the price is affordable (both the camera and the instant films) and it captures wonderful memories of a credit card size. Everybody loves my new camera :)","Nice gadget. I love it. Especially my girl friend likes the pink appearance. Very fit for entertainment. Cool to see a picture coming into force.","My daughter (11) loved it! Now my son and other daughter want one too. The film can get spendy, but it is worth it. I love it because they can take a picture and put it in their junk journal, write about it, and have memories to look back on. Great buy, and it looks like I'm buying 2 more for Christmas!","It's so pretty and not scratched! Love the pastel pink and would definitely recommend it :) Its worth its price and easy to use :D","Easy to use and awesome! The color is softer than shown on the screen. Overall it's great! I love it so much.","LOVE THIS LIL THING. WORTH EVERY PENNY. RECOMMENDED SELLER!! FAST SHIPMENT, GREAT PRICE. GREAT FOR ANY OCCASION, GET TO CAPTURE DOWN EVERY MEMORABLE MOMENT.","I wish Fujifilm had designed the string attachment to the side with the picture button (its on the opposite side, so virtually impossible to have the string around your wrist and take a picture with the same hand).","It was delivered promptly and it is exactly has pictured.<br />Will be a great Christmas gift.  I would recommend to anyone.","This is a cute camera. Only thing is if it's too bright outside your photo may come out white like a blank polaroid. So of course I wasted a few shots because of the sunlight. It's a bit hard to tell what settings work best but definitely play around the camera. Very light & easy to carry. Love using it!!!","i ordered it right before traveling abroad. It was fine. Still trying to figure out the light setting, sometimes it's too dark, other times it's bright and pretty. That's probably my lack of knowledge. Otherwise it's a fun piece to have. pretty light.","It is pretty good, have lots of mode and easy to take.but the price is almost the same as walmart.","I always want a instant film camera and decided to get this until I see the yellow one. It's just so adorable and fancy that I have to buy it. And it's not too expensive!","there is small black point on the picture. For every picture. It waste me about 2 pack. Can u give me a answer? Its problem from camera or sheet.","This camera is amazing not only is it cute it takes great pictures. It's a great conversation starter.  I have gotten plenty of complements. You cannot turn  the flash of but that's okay.  The shopping was really fast that was good.","Bought this as a gift for my daughter, she loves it!!!!  Makes me want to get my old Polaroid out, except cant find the film anywhere, and it doesn't work!!!  Great gift for late teens early adults!","Guys, this camera is definitely a great gift for your girlfriend!!!<br />Not too expensive, good quality, cute color.<br />five stars!","When i received, it's really perfect.I'm so excited to get this, it's really cute and the picture is awesome !!!!!!!!!!!","All her friends now want to buy one! Great little instant camera and fun and very compact. Early teachings of photography!","I love to create mini albums for when I go on trips, this allows me to have an instant picture and journal in realtime. Next adventure China in 2 weeks!","amazing camera. has 4 settings AND  a auto light sensor. small and easy to carry around. very great item. easy to use","I bought this camera for my teenage daughter! She loves it! I love the fact that it brings back great memories of the polaroid and when people used to place pictures in an actual photo album!","I absolutely love this little baby of a camera. I was torn on the colors between pink, white or yellow. I was hesitant to go for the yellow, fearing it would be too bright and not subtle. I was very happy to find out that its a really soft canary yellow - its easy on the eyes! The camera is a little bigger than your palm and it does have an interesting (weird) shape, but I see it more of a toy than anything else so I don't mind. It's not meant for practicality, its meant for fun! This is a great instant camera to have and I would recommend it to anyone. The pictures it produces are really sharp and clear!","I did not realize how handy this little camera would be.  It is so much fun for a party to take and print the pictures immediately.","I recently bought this camera and took it to New York. It is so cute, fun and small enough to fit in my hand and in my purse. It takes clear pictures and is so fun for vacations. I recommend buying film from amazon, its the cheapest","I loved it I'm glad I bought this. I take it with me everywhere. Everyone's loves it too they want one","Great product, came right on time! I can buy the film right down the street which is amazing..<br />Get to play with it a little to get adjusted to the settings. I love my new toy!","Love this camera! So easy to use and the pictures are adorable. Great for scrapbooking and taking everywhere (especially places you don't want to bring a big expensive DSLR camera)","What a fun party accessory!<br />Easy to use for everyone<br />pictures are small but fun<br />seems durable<br />I think all ages can use it","I got this is a gift for my girlfriend and her one criticism is that you cannot control the flash which has a tendency to wash some photos out even when you are outside. The only solution is to cover it with your hand or a piece of electrical tape which is a minor work around. But this is a straight up polaroid camera so people expecting to get high quality photos should just go digital. This is a nostalgic type camera good for having fun with. Great for portraits and taking to parties and whatnot with friends because the film is about the size of a business card. People LOVE polaroids and this is a good solid camera. Feels like a fisher price toy in the hands but is ultimately solid. Film can be expensive at about .75-$1 per sheet so be prepared for that.","I had been eyeing this camera for awhile, but just couldn't bring myself to buy it. I already own the Instax Wide camera, which is great, but I got tired of how much space it was taking up in my bag every time I brought it along. I had received an amazon gift card from my bosses and had an upcoming anniversary trip so I finally took the step and purchased this camera. It's very simple to use, even if you're a complete novice and comes in such cute colors. It's small, so it doesn't take up much space in your bag, and fits comfortably in your hand. The film isn't a bad price, either, and it's actually cheaper than the Polaroid film I used to be in my golden age of polaroid use (90s/early 2000s). The quality is much better than I expected, being so small. Very crisp and clear, as most fujifilms are.","Great camera! Fun and cute.  Not sure why people complain about the size and quality.  It's not a camera to use for taking great shots.  Yes, the photos are small and not great quality but they are fun and artsy when you put them in an album and stuff.  I hope it lasts a long time.","This was a great alternative to the Polaroid camera.  The film was cheaper and everyone loved it at the party.","Super fun and really easy to use. I like how it has settings for indoor/outdoor and sunny/cloudy. The pictures come out nice. Not the greatest quality, but it's sole purpose isn't for anything professional. It's a nice camera to have for social gatherings and such.","Great camera to use for our guestbook at our wedding.  It was very easy to use.  Everyone had a great time using it and loved the way they looked in the film.","Bought this as a gift for my 14 year old niece and she loves it! She had it out of the box, loaded with film and was taking pictures in just 10 minutes. It is easy to use, but her only complaint was that it is kind of hard to handle due to the size/bulkiness and layout of the buttons. The picture quality could be better, I suppose, but just like Polaroids, the look of the image is part of what is fun about it. We'll have to wait to see how she likes after more use, but overall I am happy with this purchase.","This is such a fun little camera that even has some cool and unexpected high tech features! Recommended to all my friends.","Bought it as a gift for my sister. She loved it and enjoys using it everyday. It's easy to use.","The shipping was pretty slow. I had waited for almost 2 weeks but other than that everything is GREAT! The camera looks so cute in pink and comes in a good size. I would recomend other ppl to get one !","Really great for taking random photos and getting that throwback instant film feel. I really love it, great camera, very portable and if you buy the zippered camera case for it, you are good to go.","THE ONLY THING IS THAT THE FILM IS QUITE EXPENSIVE , THE PICTURES ARE NOT AS NIT AS I THOUGH THEY WERE GOING TO BE","Item was received sooner than expected. This camera was a gift. It is the perfect color and style. Customer is pleased with quality of merchandise.","I really love this baby blue color, I was debating between this and the pink one. I'm glad that I made a right choice. Just love the color and the design is very cute as well. Easy to take pics, easy to carry around.","I am not really good at use this camera, but I am trying to use it. White is really cute.","We are using this at a church for pictures of people at functions that they can take home instead of printing and mailing.  Downfall is they are small.","My son asked for this camera for his 14th birthday. I was sort of apprehensive about buying it after reading some of the reviews that talked about the small picture size and clarity. I also wondered how much money we would end up spending on film because of his desire to take pictures of EVERYTHING. His cell phone already has a camera, so why have another camera to carry around that will produce pictures that will ultimately lay around the house or end up in a drawer? After all of my doubts, this turned out to be a great gift. My son is very selective about what he shoots and the pictures are no smaller than expected. There hasn't been a problem with the clarity of the pictures that wasn't a result of user error. The kids all love it! It's pretty interesting to see them shooting pictures with an instant camera again.","This little camera is great! Smaller than I thought which makes it all the more portable. Perfect way to capture the moment. Recommended.","OMG i love this, it's so much fun to use and make wonderful memories with love ones. Plus i can fit it in my purse so easily","so cute!! product is new, good for it's price :) I haven't tried it yet because my boyfriend and I decided to wait until our 100th day of dating to use the camera, but it had batteries to start with and no damage :) thanks!","Works and looks great! Glad I came across this, I would recommend it to others! Amazon always follows threw for me","I freakin very like it<br />I will give five star for this product<br />It was a very cool mini camera","I'm a first timer here at amazon and i took the chance to order this camera cause i've ben wanting this and finally i have something to call my own.. im super in love with it.. well not just me but my boyfriend and the family :) i actually got super excited when i got them with the film.. I know film is kinda pricey but its worth it! I just use mines for special occasion or to take a picture for the kids, even them they liked.. i don't see any problem with it so far..","I loved this camera! It is so compact and adorable. I loved the flash settings on this! The photos were what you would expect from an instant camera.","this color is very beautiful. my bff bought a pink one. it's also really pretty.<br /><br />and it works good. i love it!!","I really like the color its soft yellow. The camera is super cute. Very happy w me purchase. It take great pictures.","Hazel loves it !!!!Bought this for my girlfriend and she cant stop taking picures....It was such a good deal too","This camera is super cute!! and you really get what you paid for. The pictures come out in the cutest business card size photos that you can literally put them anywhere (like inside a wallet!)<br /><br />I think the only issue that I have is that you can't really take pictures in really sunny areas because the photo won't come out great but that's expected with this type of camera.<br /><br />Also you go through film real easy! so stock up!","Great camera very handy lovely blue color and great features for shooting indoor and outdoor A must have love it!","i like the color and the quality it is really good i will try in the next days travel very excited","this camera is great. it works pretty good. i would not recomend this camera for professional use. it has one small problem.since the viewing glass and the camera are not on top of each other when you take the picture you have to  kinda slant the view of whatever tour taking this picture of to the right. if not the picture wont come out how you want itto. but other then that small glitch the camera is amazing.","My new addiction! I LOVE this camera. It makes taking pictures so special and memorable. If you're not into photography, you will be. The quality is amazing and the camera is too cute!","Just received my instax 8 in the mail today. Came to me earlier than expected and I'm so happy. I can't stop taking photos! It's a bummer that film is so expensive but it's so worth it. The package was in great condition. I highly recommend this product.","It's definitely a fun camera, the pictures look so cool and has a nostalgic feeling to it. It's a shame the prints are a bit small.","Uhm. I love it but I Wish it came with sample film. Cuz now I need to buy some -.-","I have always wanted one ! I am having so much fun using it :) greatly recommended for those who likes taking pictures :)","i just love this. although i wish the film was cheaper, i generally like taking pics but i love how i can have my pics instantly!!! every where i go, i would take it with me and i call it my baby haha but seriously i love it so much","I am very happy with this camera! I'm looking foward to having it to make memories with on my wedding day!","Really like camera so far. Ordered it for an 80s party. Wanted that polaroid type fill and the camera delivered.","Great camera so easy to use simply drop the film in and you are ready to shoot. So glad I got it!","Its so much fun to use and fits in a little purse so you can bring it anywhere & it's everything I expected it to be. Is just a little tricky choosing the correct light setting for the perfect picture, so some of my first pictures came out a little dark, but other than that I loved it!","This is so much fun to have, and i am very happy with my purchase! I cant wait to take it on trips with me and i love using it when i go out with my friends!. I wish the Polaroid film was less expensive but that is the only downfall! But overall this is a fun film camera!","I began taking pictures with my roommate as soon as I received it! It is easy to use and the effect is quite good, better than I expected.","Bought it for my Best friend as a birthday gift! Looks great! She loves it! Althought it's kind of expensive","This camera is the cutest thing ever! The pictures come out wonderful and are the perfect size. I highly recommend buying this camera! Not only is it adorable but it is easy to use and the pictures are great quality as well. The only draw back is that the film costs quite a lot of money but you can usually find pretty good deals here on amazon. I was deciding whether to \"invest\" in this camera and i am so happy i persuaded myself into buying it.","Love this camera!!!! It takes amazing pics in all types of lighting! The size of the photos are perfect and the resolution is crystal clear!! All of my friends were so jealous! Now they all want one too :)","I love it . The Pink one is so great, so I bought this again for my friend's birthday too!","I seriously love this camera so freaking much! I don't get to use it much since the film is so expensive but it's still worth it...at least to me. I don't know how other people will feel considering you can't take as many pictures as you would on a digital camera.","Fast and nice looking!<br />Love it so much..<br />Make me have so much fun with my friends!!<br />And yellow is a very special color for camera..","This camera was on my granddaughter's wish list. She loves it and the business card size photos are a lot of fun for all of us.","I'd been wanting an instant camera for a while now, and this was just so perfectly pink. The delivery was nice and speedy (though I wasn't in town to get it!) and everything was all in order. That was when I realized I'd forgotten to buy film, but that wasn't so bad. All in all, it fits great in my purse and it has all those quick adjustment flashes for indoor/outdoor transitions. Muy bueno!","It is cheaper than many film camera.The photos that took were nice.That's so good! It's cheaper than that in China.","I love these cameras and was so happy with them!  I ordered them and got them very quickly!  I even needed the shipping address changed and they changed it easily without delay!","I gave 4 stars, because one of my instax came black on a cloudy day, even though I used that function...so, unless you are taking pictures on a really really cloudy day, use the normal function, that should work.<br />It's a great present for everybody and I'm really happy with my purchase, I would recommend this to any pro or amateur photographer","My daughter loved this camera. Gave it to her for her 9th day. It was a hit with kids & grown ups alike.....very nostalgic of the Polaroid my grandmother had.","I love the camera! The photo quality is awesome too! And its in my favorite color! And you can put the pictures in your wallet!","First off, I want to say that this is absolutely the cutest camera I have ever seen.  It takes such adorable photos and is very easy to use.  It is larger than I anticipated, but is nothing enormous. I'll be honest, I was/am a bit nervous when I first received it as it is made mostly out of plastic.  I am used to the metal frame of an SLR camera, so the light weight and more fragile exterior is just something I will have to get used to!  Other than that, it was pretty simple putting the whole thing together and the only set up it needed was to put in two AA batteries (comes included.)<br /><br />I'll be honest, I had a hard time figuring out the lighting settings.  I am probably one of the few with this issue as it seems a lot more straightforward than I was expecting.  This camera comes with around 6 light settings.  A light would illuminate one of the settings (they are located above the lens) but I couldn't tell why or when it was changing.  The instructions have a sentence description of the setting so I felt like it didn't explain enough.  But after trial and error I realized that the light indicates the recommended light setting depending on the environment.  So as you move your camera around, the light may change and all you have to do is move the it until it is set where it is illuminated.","Cute camera. Easy to use!<br />It's light and easy to carry around, I would suggest buying the black case<br />Definitely recommend it to people who are looking for a polaroid camera.","I'm so happy with this purchase! I've been looking to buy polaroid camera for years, and I was never sure which one to buy. Recently, my friend has recommended this model and I decided to give it a try. And, I'm glad I did because it's worth every penny. The pink is almost like pastel pink and  it's super cute! The only thing to consider before buying this is the cost of the films. They are expensive, and I recommend to buy in large packs.","I brought it as a birthday gift for my friend.  It is very convenient.  And the photos looks clearly.  She loves it, and I am very satisfied with it! v(^_^v)?","I got the color in baby blue it's a cute camera to use :) the only downside is it does not come with a close up lens. some reviewers did come with it. well overall it is a adorable. Enjoy taking pictures with it !!<br /><br />Super Fast shipping & Well packaged :)","I got this as a gift and they absolutely love it. Blew threw two packs of film in a few days, prints credit card size photos and they fit perfectly in a wallet. Highly recommended.","Very nice camera. To fun with friends in a real time analog photography. I really recomend for real world people.","Included in the package:<br />/Strap<br />/Instruction manuals<br />/a pair of batteries<br />/the camera<br />One review said it came with a close up lens, but it does not, sadly :( Also, the strap cannot adjust. As in, you cannot make it tighter or looser, which is a downside in case it slips.<br /><br />It's easy to insert film (which you have to buy separately) and came on time. I can't wait to use it! I saw one of my friends with it and it takes very cute, neat pictures so I thought I should get one too. Some of her pictures turn out really bright/white though, so settings will have to be played around with. The instruction manual kind of guides you on what settings to use depending on the lighting/background.<br />There was no damage to the box or the camera.The camera is easy to use and is compact enough to fit in my small hand. It's light and lean, but since i got a white camera i have to be careful not to get it dirty. True to picture and descriptions!","first of all, cute as a button I love how it looks<br />and with a little practice, it gives great pictures and is really fun to use and watch the picture appear before your eyes!<br />all around love this camera, pretty easy to use too","This camera is so much fun and perfect for creating long lasting memories. Blue camera color is just as described. Perfect for creating collages or giving pictures as gifts. The pictures are smaller than I expected them to be but nonetheless I am in love with this camera.","When I first saw the camera I knew I wanted it because I love polaroids and it's just adorable. I didn't think the picture quality would be all that good but it actually is. I just took my first picture and it's so clear. I thought it would be really grainy but it's not. The picture also looks vintage and cool. The camera is really easy to use too. I would definitely recommend buying this camera.","It's super cute, fun, and works great :). I used it for a photo booth. Love the yellow color as well!","It takes better pics than I ever imagined.  With pictures I like instant that I can hold in my hand and this is the camera.  I absolutely love and the price of the camera and film are very reasonable...I love the blue color","Got this one for my wife, she loves it. It has that vintage look and she enjoys it a lot. With 2 small kids she is very happy taking photos of the kids","I love having this camera! I took it to a wedding and it was a huge hit! Everyone wanted to have their picture taken with it! I also like how it has the lighting options for different locations, though I haven't quite figured out the best way to gauge the light myself. The picture quality is great at night and indoors. I have had some hit or miss results with outdoor, super-sunny pictures, but I'm not sure if that is user error or just that the camera isn't ideal for these types of shots. I'll have to play with it more to figure it out. The pictures are also a really great size - small and narrow - a lot of people commented on how much they liked the actual shape and size of the picture. An obvious and expected complaint: the film is too expensive. But that is just something you have to live with if you want to take instant pictures I guess. One comment on the color - I bought the yellow one and really like it. It's more of a pastel color - think yellow post-it note or a pastel lemon.","I was kind of scared of buying this because this is amazon and I don't know who to trust, but when this came in the mail, it was exactly what I needed. I've used this so much that I need to order more films!  It is brand spanking new and it works 100%.","As a professional photographer of forty years I always enjoy past photography appreciations. While the Instax is no Polaroid SX-70 the sheer pleasure of watching people see a picture develop in their hands is priceless. It is a \"toy\" but a really good one.","I looked for a reliable, classy-looking Polaroid camera as a wedding reception guest book. After thorough research, I determined Instax was cheaper and just as reliable, if not more, than the new Polaroid instant cameras. Both cameras function similarly and use the same film; yet Instax has better reviews and is cheaper. The 8S has a few extra bells and whistles: a clip-on lens for close-up pictures, light/dark and indoor/outdoor settings, the mirror on the front of the camera, and two shutter buttons for either landscape or portrait photographs. Also, the lithium batteries are not hard to find for sale online; I haven't had to replace ours yet, but we know that availability and price would afford on inconvenience.<br /> I have loved it; it was perfect for the party and I still use it frequently. The film is fairly inexpensive, so we continue to use it. The pictures are the size of a credit card with white borders, and the camera comfortably fits in a small purse. On our honeymoon, the good quality allowed us to take pictures of us in front of landmarks and beautiful areas. Also, a little mirror resides on the front of the camera to facilitate quick self-portraits, which can be taped later into journals as keepsakes. Learning which lighting settings work best in certain conditions took some trial and error, but every picture turned out vintage-y and fun, so no film was wasted.<br />One last word on durability: I didn't have the wrist strap around my arm and accidentally dropped the camera on a ceramic-tiled floor. The film flew out of the back of the camera, but nothing broke off or dented. The camera still looks great and functions optimally, and I only lost the top film, the rest of the cartridge still printed great pictures. That was a while ago, and I haven't had any problems at all!","We got it for a sign in book for the wedding.  Very cute and worked great.  Pictures are instant pictures, so don't expect anything more.  Fun to use and guests loved it.  A couple of guests asked me where to get it and of course I told them Amazon.  Would definitely buy again and we're keeping it for future parties.","Doesn't take the clearest pictures but it's so nostalgic. My boyfriend say it feels like the seventies.<br />Very easy to operate. Slimmer and lighter than the Instax Mini 7. It comes with a 35 cm lens clip.<br />Film looks like it'll be about a buck a shot, but it's instant. Be mindful of the distance of what you are shooting.<br /><br />Came with 2 batteries and also a safety strap.","Yes, film is little expensive, but this is just for fun.  Little bulkier and lighter blue than I thought, but I still love it.  Been wanting one forever and decided to treat myself.  Faster delivery than originally quoted!","My friend Loves it. that is a gift. she is so happy got it. thank you very much.<br />Sandy Yi","if you miss polaroids you MUST HAVE THIS CAMERA! even not missing polaroids i think this camera is amazing. its so much fun, easy to use and definitely makes for great pictures!<br /><br />the camera literally works just like a polaroid, i previously bought the Polaroid Z2300 10MP Digital Instant Print Camera, which dont get me wrong is a great instant print camera, but it just didnt work like an old polaroid it was more like a camera/compact camera printer, you can choose the pictures you want to print on that one, and view them. also on that camera, the photo came out printed, there was no waiting for the picture to \"develop\" which is cool but isnt polaroidish. THIS camera (fujifilm model) is just like that, polaroid, even though its fujifilm lol, you snap the picture and the picture comes out immediately and you wait for it to develop. there is no option with this camera as far as choosing which picture you want to print or not.<br /><br />i like the options this has for inside or outside and others, helpful for better photos.<br /><br />the film is a tad pricey but better when bought in bulk<br /><br />ultimately this camera is exactly what i wanted","Didn't try it now , But i love the pink color which exactly what i want .<br />it would be great if come with film.....","I was hoping for a better photo, they are a bit grainy. But I needed something that would spit out a photo right there. You are paying for the convenience not the quality of the photo.","I love this pink which is not too bright, its like....soft pink mixed with milk! Whats more, I purchased it yesterday night and received it this morning, its so fast!","Bought the camera for my niece's 16th birthday. Her response: this gift beats all the others! Perfect gift for anyone in the family.","First off, I've been wanting one of these for FOREVER. So when I finally got one for my birthday, I was extrememely excited to get my hands on it. The estimated arrival date was spot on, no earlier, no later. The camera itself is ADORABLE, and I paired it with some Hello Kitty film to boot. By far the easiest camera I've ever used! Definitely recommend to those thinking about purchasing.","it is very nice and useful, i love it. the price is not very expensive. i really enjoy time with it.","I have been wanting to get a polaroid camera for SO long and this camera has truly fit the bill.It has a cute color(I chose yellow), user friendly functions and all round, a load of fun!

It was a big hit as a present!","very nice Camera.. but just not really know how to take a better photo.<br />I might need some help to do it.","I bought one of these cameras about a year ago for one of my daughters on their birthday.  She simply loves it because while a digital camera is a modern marvel, the polaroid technology is still a big hit.  A big hit because you get the picture right away.  No wait time to load the picture to a printer and no printer ink to buy.  I bought another, this pink one for another daughter and it still has the same effect.","Bought this for my niece's 14th birthday.. It was a huge hit! Easy to operate and the picture quality was good!","It's fun and easy to use !

Everyone needs an instant film camera. Totally worth every penny!<br /><br />All my friends want one now too!<br /><br />and it works great for smashbook pages! So I can make the prefect layouts with this size picture with the size of the original smashbook! I recommend to people who like to take pictures and store them in a junk journal or smash book! This makes the cutest layouts!<br />(: RECOMMEND RECOMMEND RECOMMEND","if you want to take picture in a easy an old fashion way, this is the camera.<br />It only have a small viewfinder, and is in a millon distance from digital ones.<br />But i like it.","it said it will need 1-3 months for delivery, but i received it in a week!!!!! Awesome!! it is so cute and adorable! Much smaller than i thought and very easy to use. It's baby pink and fits girls lol","Very unique way to save some memories in my Wedding. easy to keep easy to use easy to shoot Unique","It is a good product and it is useful for me. I like it!

(I live in america) I was so sad and so impatient about it, but guess what? It came only after two weeks! I was so happy and im very sarisfied with the camera. Its cute. Very cute! It snaps pictures well, and its so fun to take pictures!","This is one of the best things i bought on amazon. Its hard not to like. It's compact and works wonderfully.

I can tell it is definitely brand new.","This was a Christmas present for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it. She uses it every chance she gets.

I have taken photos of my little one with and without the setting on and without its a hair blurry but with it on it comes out nice very nice fujifilm.... Let me tell you about the battery life on this thing it is INCREDIBLE! i have only charged it once and it was because i was leaving town and it was half way used and that was from the first charge out of the box and that was at least 5 months if not longer and several hundred photos! i have used the black and white film and the color film with white borders and the film with black and colored borders and the pictures always turn out awesome! i have a old cigar box i keep the photos in and it is about half full! i love being able to have a hard copy of the photos to someday pass down to my little one of her child hood... now there is one con it does not capture a digital copy! i would love for it to!  Fujifilm has a new one coming out the sq10 in may it has a screen on the back and looks to take a bigger instant picture.. the biggest thing is it accepts a micro SD card and saves a digital copy...  i am going to probably have to upgrade when it comes out i would love to do a review on that camera when it comes out to post on amazon... so Fujifilm if you are reading this i would love to do a review of the sq10 you have coming out next month as i have a lot of experience with the mini 90 you can contact me any time and i would be happy to do a full review!","Best instax camera out there. I wish they would make a similar one for the wide film.","The control layout could be better and the viewfinder is a bit small. Battery life isn't incredible but it's rechargeable.

I upgraded from the 70 to this one and have been super pleased! I love that it has a rechargeable battery!","Bought this for my significant other and she loved it.","I bought it for my mom and she's in love with this camera.","fun and versatile. feels a bit cheap because the body is plastic but functions perfectly so far.","This made for a great gift. Everyone has fun passing the camera around and keeping the photos. Makes for a great makeshift photo booth for parties. (Lightweight and comes with a strap).","Really easy to use and quality camera. My kids loved it for their birthday party. It is fun to use and reminds me of the instant cameras of my youth. Fun to have an alternative to the phone cameras!","Works amazing and is surprisingly sturdy. It has several different modes ranging from landscape and fast movement to lightening or darkening a picture before you take it. There is a small learning curve if you have never used one before but I think its great and portable I have so far used it at a birthday party where I was able to take pictures and give away the photos.","this camera is the bomb i love it i have taken so many photos with it! the size is nice and i like the photo size too... the pictures come out very well and i love all of the options you have especially the child setting.

This was given as a gift from my boyfriend and I just love all the features...especially the double exposure.  I take it with me every where, constantly taking pictures.","Really enjoy using this camera. I've had this camera for 4 months now but didn't use it much during the winter (because of the film's temperature range - winter too cold!). I recently went on a trip to Seattle and tested out the various modes. The colors come out pretty great and there's wonderful clarity on landscape mode. I love the somewhat grungy/vintage look that prints without using any of the modes as well. Super fun and great camera!<br /><br />P.S. When they say don't point the camera at the sun, really don't. I caught the sun in one of my photos and it was a beautiful black circle in the sky. Haha.","Love the camera. However I haven't been able to use it much since I live in Michigan, USA and it came with a European charger... was never mentioned in the description. Other than that everything is just as good as I thought it would be.","Fun camera - We have had it for a few months and have enjoyed all the pictures.","Love it! Takes better quality photos than the Fujifilm polaroid","I love this thing! Huge step up from the mini 80. More features and he vintage look is awesome!","I tried a few different cameras and wasn't fully satisfied until I found this one.<br />good light and you can play around with it and get creative!<br />Absolutely love this camera!","love it, but the pictures are to small for me, i ordered the ones with the larger pictures as well. :)","I would recommend this!! It does the job and it's easy to carry around and it fits in my purse and backpack! Pictures turns out great!!","Love this camera. I tried out a couple instant cameras before finding this one. Great photo quality, affordable, and I like the style too.","Came in perfectly, no issues, I love it so much. Can't wait to get a case.","Fun to use","What an awesome product. Bought it to take to Daytona bike week, and what a great item to have on hand. It shipped quickly and is compact enough to fit in my inside vest pocket. The instructions are helpful, however like every other camera you will have a bit of a learning curve.","Brought as a present, came in perfect condition","Loving this camera,  mostly bought this model for the double exposure feature, which has opened up ma0ny possibilities of fun! Do wish the photos were slightly bigger, but 60 cents a shot compared to the dollar a picture of the Polaroid mini or even $3 a picture for the new full size Polaroid film isn't too bad. Not to mention it is super cute!","We love it. Wish the pictures were bigger but I guess we can just buy another camera for those purposes.","Just got this camera last Monday and I am so happy I decided to pay extra for a better quality pictures which are made by this instax 90! I love that this camera has different modes to help you take a perfect photo. Would recommend considering this one over the cheaper ones","You can mever go wrong with this! It's amazing! If you're someone who's into photography and polaroids this is the BEST camera for you. Lots of settings you can play with ","I really like this camera. It has all the fun of instant photography, but with enough features to get creative original Images. Nothing else out there has this much for the price. Landscape mode works really well with good sharpness and color saturation. Bulb mode, action mode, flash controls, exposure (dark to light+) all work well. The MOST fun for creativity is the double exposure mode! You can combine images in endless ways for some really interesting shots. I took one star away because of the macro mode. This was a major selling point for me that turned out to be very disappointing. With the small print size I was looking forward to close up images to fill the frame. The reality is that you are recommended to be a good 12 inches away from your subject. Even following tips I have not gotten a single good image in this mode. It invariably focuses on minor backgrounds instead of the subject, producing blurry, blown out pics. The macro on my phone does a much better job. All in all, a great little camera at a very reasonable price for all you get. Get one, and have some fun!","Love it,","It takes great pictures","I was really blown away by how good the pictures turned out if you actually focus on the object. Takes a bit of time to figure out some of the buttons but, it's a great camera. I love it","better than expected","Best purchase ever!","Excellent camera--fun and takes  little to get used to but worth the money--we bought color and B&W film for it. My daughter got the first one and then my son wanted one.","This camera is SO cute and it is a ton of fun! If you want an instant camera, this is the one to buy!","I love the product, but I was a little disappointed by the box it came in. It was opened and the box was ripped. Everything inside seems okay so far though. Looking forward to taking photos with this camera!","Absolutely adore this camera! It's fast, takes wonderful pictures, and is just astonishing! If anyone is debating on buying this than you totally should! Not a waste of money whatsoever!","I've had this Instax for over a year now, and love it! The film is easy to load and the battery holds a fairly long charge. I pull mine out for special occasions and adventures, and always love the results.","A perfect gift!<br /><br />Beware that the films this camera uses are the mini sizes (not the square ones). The size is similar to a credit card. Perfect for wallets or notebooks.","Loved the camera. it does take time to get used to learning which modes to use. Had difficulty the 1st times in bright places & the prints will come out very dark. It's a learning experience and I'm sure it'll be easier after time.","Love the camera but not the quality of the picture maybe I got too excited reading the reviews and watching YouTube videos on this camera but I still love the concept","??","Works great! Awesome piece!","I love this camera! It's perfect for capturing the moment instantly and having something in your hand. I'm old school and have developed 20% of my digital. This is automatically preserved. The settings are great! Just make sure when you take photos of people, you take it really close. The film is small but when you get people tight in the screen it's really awesome. I got the Faux leather. And the leather case which I love also. I get great compliments all the time and have had it only two weeks. 2 people have shown me that they ordered one or have one now. Double exposure is fun. Action shooting works great. I wish all these options were on the 300... only cuz I like the film size. But I love these too!!! I am 44 yrs old peeps.","My 11 year old daughter loves this camera.  We took it to our family holiday party and everyone including the adults were waiting on line to get a picture.","Prints small but clear pictures. Thought I was getting camara that would be more like the older model of instant pictures.","The camera itself is good, but for the money, I was expecting better pictures.","BEAUTUFUL","It uses light to capture time! Good job being caught so easily time!","3/9/17.  Great so far.  I've ordered 3 in total.  May order more.","This camer is awesome! Love it I also have the lomography instant mini and this Neo90 blows it out of the water! If you are debating on buying this camera you will NOT be dissapointed!","Awesome camera. Receiver of this gift loves it. Only thing I can complain about is the eye viewing piece. Difficult to see and aim through but overall great camera!","Super cute !","I don't like the bulky marshmallow look of the mini 8, but was looking for a more aesthetically pleasing camera so I chose this. Many people compliment me on it and it makes for a great conversation starter because many people have forgotten about instant cameras. I highly recommend this camera if you're looking for an aesthetically & good quality camera! It's a little more expensive but it's worth it!","Great camera! It is fun to take pictures with it!","Love love love it! Allows more flexibility for better creativity. I love that I can get close up shots now that aren't blurry and that there are settings for low light. I love the retro design, and it is less bulky and lighter than the mini 8. And no more buying batteries!","works great!","Far beyond my expectations! This camera does everything that you expected to do and more.  Definitely glad I picked this model instead of the models with lesser options and features! Plus I get so many compliments on the cute design!","Great camera. Tons of settings to change, really portable, and fun to use. You can really take great photos with this, even night shots. Definitely worth the buy!","It was a gift to my husband ,he is an artist,he loved it ,this was my first buy on Amazon ,it was a pleasure ,and it arrived just when you said it would ,thanks I will be shopping on Amazon again","Having a lot of fun with this camera, flash off is a necessity.","nice little instant camera","awesome pictures","Love It!","Amazon shipped the Mini 90 right out along with the film, good thing, cause I had a celebration a few days later. These small pictures were pasted along side the entries of my guess in a book of remembrance.<br />I also wanted to make sure I had enough batteries, and bought some for back up. I shot 100 pictures on less than one half battery charge. This was ex lent battery life usage. Pictures turned out very good, we had alot of fun so far.","Love it so much. It a great way to little memories.","The pictures are very small so you really need to either macro the picture or get really close to your subject. Would not use it for panoramas or landscapes.","I ordered this as an upgrade. I already have the mini 26 and though I liked it, I wanted more control. I have to say the 90 gives a good amount of control to the user with all of its modes and settings. I Do wish you could use landscape mode with Double exposure, but all of the modes seem to work well. The self timer is a nice addition and so is bulb mode. I do wish it had a remote shutter for bulb mode, though. I haven't tried to keep it still on a tripod yet and light paint but I plan to.<br />I have played with it well and it does better indoors than my 26 did without me doing anything additional to the settings... its macro lens is also nicer than my close up lens attachment was. Overall I'm quite happy.<br />Mine did, however, come with the EU adapter for the charger and not the American, I spoke to amazon and to Fujifilm and you can get the correct plug from fujifilm directly so if anyone needs it, contact them! They will help you.<br /><br />That's my only reason for four stars, was that I had to chase down the right adapter, but other than that I'm quite happy and have gotten some artistic shots. I have one Double exposure that makes my son look like a ghost and that wasn't my attempt. May have taken the pics backwards.. I got a good one of my dog though, too, while just playing around. This will do great on trips!<br /><br />I like putting all of them into an album and I do look through it quite a lot. It takes more thought to get the shot exactly right than on a cell phone or a digital camera, and I'm enjoying that.","nice instant camera.....wish the photos were as big as the old polaroids though......","My favorite camera ever. I get so many compliments on how it looks and a lot of people do not know that instant cameras still exist. The film is easy to load and it is very lightweight. It also has cool effects. Highly recommend this for a photo enthusiast or a casual photographer.","I LOVE this camera. It's so cute and takes great pictures that create great memories. I bring it with me everywhere. The only downside is that the film costs so much money.","There are some good and some bad reviews on here. This is so perfect and I already love it. I got this for my photo booth for my wedding and bought a bunch of film. While yes there are some errors, like there is a white spot in one of the pictures they are so cute and easy and actually focus themselves well to the point that really everyone looks good in the pictures. I am so happy with this tiny little camera and couldn't be more happy with the results","I really like the camera but it's a lot bigger and bulkier then I expected!","It was a gift that was loved.","It's just FUN.","Great little camera. But every user must know that it is limited by what film can do and what it can't. But that is exactly the magic of it. Meant for people that want something more than just snapping a digital picture. Can't replace todays digital, but is a great add-on for old fashioned fun.","I am very amazed how this Instant camera take pictures. So crisp and very detail. I actually own a Polaroid instant camera Z2300 ... its photos are good but this camera far exceeds my expectations... can't wait to use it for events to come.","temporarily cures G.A.S.","love love love something about the instant photo that makes it so nostalgic","Love it!!","I like the product it self but I am not sure if the piece i got was unreliable, the display on the back is already having problem and it doesn't show properly. No of reel left or modes are not visible. I wish I could return the product.","My sister loved it ","Great camera.","Good product.  If you're debating on this and the mini 8, get this.","Loved it","Super sweet camera!! I love it!! It takes great pictures and there are all kinds of setting to use. I haven't really figured then out yet because film is so expensive but it's definetly a great buy! Well, what are you waiting for!? Buy it!!<br /><br />With an exception that the photos are about the size of a credit card.","I'm i love with my little camera!! I take it every where. Only thing is film is a bit pricey!","what a delightful fun intuitive camera that takes really nice shots with amazing results in a nice small polaroid style, only vastly improves on the former make","So far, I've been using it for about a month and a half. Sure the adapter isn't US but it's only a couple bucks to buy the USadapter to connect it to the wall. The sleek style of this camera combined with its various options makes it a great buy at an average to be expected price! Rock on Fujifilm. Been having a blast with mine.","great","I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!! Easy to use and takes great photos!! I would Recommend  this product to a friend.","I am so in love this this camera. I know people had some issues after a while, so I got an extended warranty. That being said I have had so much fun with this and I can't wait for all of the memories I get to make with this camera.","Love this thang","love this camera yet it broke within a year... definitely would still buy again because of the quality photos and features","decent pictures.  a giant hit with the grand kids!","I love it!  It is a party ice-breaker, kids love it and the adults giggle!  It is way too much fun! The pictures are small, yes, but it's the fun of people posing and smiling that makes it a great toy.","LOVE it!<br />I had the lower end version and fell in love with these. It was a must have. Worth the price :)","I love this little camera with all my heart. I bought it as an upgrade to my 7s and as a graduation present to myself. Ever since, it has given me hours of enjoyment. It is a significant upgrade to the more ~basic~ models of mini instax adding features that should've honestly been available from the get-go. My pictures are dramatically better with this little guy. It's remarkable.<br /><br />I only really have one complaint and it's that the strap the camera comes with kind of sucks. It slips out of the little hooks provided for attaching it easily. It's slipped out and onto the ground an embarrassing number of times. But hey, good news! This camera is sturdy and durable!! It can take a few mistakes and keep rolling.<br /><br />Highly recommended. This is probably the best first-party instax camera to date.","Excellent quality..but you guys didn't mention it did not come with its own battery.","Very easy to learn how to use. Lot more options and settings than the other Instax cameras, which is why I chose this one. Looks good and doesn't feel cheap.","Great design. easy to use. the only thing i do not like is the view finder is kinda hard to look through at times, its kinda awkward. and obviously doesn't look through the lens so you can line up stuff perfectly, but its a polaroid so..","I cant stress enough how good this camera is, i know its a bit expensive than the Fujifilm models but the \"modes\" and the \"flash\" and the \"selfie button\" are really good... the rest, is mostly the same ;)","Cool device, but lighting is a BIG factor.","This camera is awesome, the seller shipped it very fast even during the holidays. Very happy because my wife is very happy! Thank you","Fabulous quality and lightweight to carry. A fun camera to bring a retro feel back to your travels or daily picture taking. (Photos are about half the size of the original Polaroids)","purchased this camera for a family member as a Christmas gift ...<br />bare in mind this is the camera she wanted...<br />and she loves it!!!","Good price, awesome product... The only issue was to get it shipped to me (Canary Islands). Besides that, just perfect!!","Great Product","I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS CAMERA!","Great product, and I highly recommend this seller! Awesome Job.","Such a great product! I have used the heck out of it, and messed around with all the different settings. This is a 5 star product!","Came new as expected and works great!","She loves it!!<br />My girl friend, she hates photography and she hates me taking pictures.<br />But one day she was talking about this camera, so I took my chances and got this for her birthday.<br />Guess what?  She loves it!","ok","LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  IT!!! I love the look and the features really worth the extra bucks!!","One of the best purchases I've ever made.  Pictures I can physically hold onto, and don't just delete because I need more memory.  Check out the monochrome film, you'll love it too!","Really fun and great product!","Im in love with it. Best product ever. Brand new with everything it needs except the film.","I ordered from Fujifilm. Perfect condition. Comes with a strap and a battery and a charger. Everything works and it takes gr8 pictures.","AAAA+","This fujifilm is great and love the quality of photos vs. the other ones on the market.  I bought it as a gift for my wife.  I researched all of them on the market and found this one to have the best reviews and best quality of pictures.  No doubt this thing is exactly what I thought.  The only downside is that the film can get expensive but I justify it by saying that you cant put a price on memories.","so much fun to use at parties/outings. easy to learn to use","Fun camera, just wish the photos were bigger like the old instants.","Bought this as a gift and it works beautifully. I'm a little skeptical of the functionality of the camera with no flash, or long exposure, as we haven't taken one successful picture like that yet, but I guess a tripod would help. Enjoy them minis!","Love this camera. It even has some settings, unlike some of the other polariods.  Very fun and highly recommend","Bought 2 for gifts and they are definitely happy with the cameras. Well used and would buy again!","It's nice but I wish the pictures were bigger. Why not just use the old Polaroid technology and get pics you can really see and enjoy. Just saying...","Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter and she loves it. It takes nice cute photos, and you are able to adjust the light, etc. before shooting. The photos are a little small for me, but she, and her friends love it.","As expected","I purchased this as a present for my wife for Christmas. She's a professional photographer and loves collecting old cameras. She absolutely loves it.The look is very vintage which is very cool. The zoom lens gives you a variety of options including macro for tight close ups. The double exposure mode is a lot of fun. There's a ton of dual cat pictures all over our fridge. Rechargeable battery. A Flash which you you totally need for indoor shots.<br />The best part is it's totally old school photography. No memory card, no preview just bare bones photography. You frame it,shoot it and see what comes out. Some reviews complained about the way you have to hold it but that hasn't been a problem for her. All in all a fun little camera that gives you a lot of bang for your buck.","Amazing :)","GF loved it as a x-mas present. This camera is great. Who doesn't love the nostalgia of playing with an old Polaroid camera? With this you get that nostalgia, but with much better film that exposes quickly. Ppl love this thing. I've already sold 3 of the \"kiddie version\" to my friends and family. I do have to say that this Mini 90 version feels sturdier then the Mini 8 and looks great with that retro feel. love the rechargeable battery and shooting modes are easy to adjust. Great fun for family/friend get togethers<br /><br />only problem is that the GF wants to drag this everywhere","it is a great product works perfectly and shipped fast","LOVE this camera. I use it probably once or twice every few weeks. I wish the pictures lasted longer, but that isn't the fault of the camera. I just have a hunch in 10 years they're going to be faded.","Definitely fun. Takes some practice to get the photos you want (close up portraits are best), but purchase extra film and it's a fun deal.","Great look and feel of the camera, takes great small instant shots that the kids love. I like that it has 2 shutter release buttons for portrait and landscape.","Great; use for closeups if you want clearer picture.","GOT THIS FOR MY 17 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE LOVES IT!","The pictures are just okay. It's more of a fun part toy than anything. Everyone loves getting their just okay picture taken with it.","Love this camera! Pics are so much better than my original Fuji Instax!","I love this camera!!!","It arrived on time!! got this for my boyfriend and he loved it. Awesome fun gift for anyone :D","Beautiful camera!!!!!  I was debating whether to buy this one or the larger model. I decided on this one because it has so many options for pictures and settings. The double capture button is brilliant. The size is reasonable and it looks very vintage and cute.","This is amazing!!! I love love love love it so so so so much!","good","I bought this for my daughter in law.  She thought it was too bulky and the film was too expensive.","This was exactly what my daughter wanted for Christmas and $70 cheaper than Michael's!","Bought as a gift. Arrived very fast and works great.","Love it","LOVE this camera!  Great pic quality and lots of photo options.  Easy to use!","buy it and use it....a great little camera ......easy to use and the ability to turn off the flash is a selling point....mine is dedicated for the Instax B/W film","I actually won this camera in a contest. I recieved it right before Christmas and absolutely love it! Takes clear photos, prints perfect size photos. The camera itself is easy to use and lightweight. I dont mind carrying it around. I've wanted an instax camera for quite some time and was lucky enough to get one free! Excited to put the photos in a new album :)","Very fun. Retro. Pics come out nice for Polaroid pics and are also somewhat vintage looking. I like that it gives you options to adjust certain aspects before the picture comes out, and the timer is awesome. Product manual and user guides etc. are very hard to follow - so many languages jumbled on it. Overall great product and purchase!","Graet work very will","Made a great Christmas present","Delivered timely and she loves it!!","Learning curve to get used to the flash settings, however, great product and prints out great photos","This camera is awesome for the price. Takes me back to seeing retro cameras and we love getting instant pictures. My gf loved it as her birthday surprise! So good for families and scrapbooking.","Absolutely loved it!!!!!! We don't have the brown one in Mexico.","My boyfriend really loves it","Gave to daughter as a gift.  Put the film in backwards at first. (The directions are in many different languages and a little hard to follow.  Some of the directions are in pictures.)  That being said, we figured out the problem, put the film in correctly (it wasn't ruined) and started taking photos right away. My daughter was very pleased with the camera and photos.  The photos are mini (business size).","I love the Camera! The photos are so much fun to take and the flash is super bright, which is exactly what you need. The only issue I had was with the battery dying instantly, but the seller took care of that immediately and shipped me a new one almost over-night. Still, the pictuers are great quality and super fun to take and see printed out right in your hand. It will be a super awesome addition to our family albums","I have another version of he instax and the moment I saw this one I knew I just had to have it. Unlike the other instax, the thing I like about this one is that the batteries are rechargeable.<br /><br />It has many more options. It is easy to use and match with a case and it's even better.","Photos are usually hit or miss. Highly recommend not using it in lowlight. But if you must, make the photos lighter.","works great but the film gets expensive","I love the vintage look and feel of this camera, but the fact that we get instant photos.  This was a win win purchase.  We have been happy with the quality of the instant photos.","I've been wanting an Instax camera for a while but couldn't decide between this one and the 300 wide. I ultimately chose this one because of the features and being able to buy the film in a store if I needed to.<br /><br />I brought this with me on vacation and it was so fun to print out my pictures and give to family and friends. I'm still trying to figure out how to get the best image quality as it seems my photos came out slightly overexposed. It was a cloudy day and not super sunny, so I think it will just take a while to figure out the best settings for certain lighting situations.<br /><br />Minus the learning curve, this camera is cute, lightweight, and easy to use. I love having fun prints to share!","This is a perfect perfect gift for your self or as a gift I got this for my daughter and she is so excited ..","Amazing camera! The bew features are totally worth it","So much fun!","A lot is fun and enjoy the additional features","Thiiiiiissssss is so much more then I expected. High quality, rechargeable battery, sleek look, nice weight and easy to use. I loved it so much that I bought one for myself","I love this camera.  It was a big hit on Christmas but as everyone else has been reporting it does come with a EU charger.  Luckily, I travel a bit and had an adapter.  I'lm not going to order a US charger just continue to use the adapter. I'm sure that is the most economical way to go.","Great camera, amazing features...the best!","Purchase as a gift and was a hit. She took pics all day and everyone wanted to take one ..","Highly recommend this camera. The double exposure is extremely fun. I've taken some great shots already. I'm loving it. The modes alone make it a huge upgrade from the instax mini 8. Plus you have control over the flash. It's quieter, smoother, thinner. It's well worth the money.","Cool camera","This was exactly what I hoped it would be. It has a old time classic look and comes with film.  We were very happy with this purchase.","I recieved the camera but it came with european plug insted of the american 120 volt plug.","I've had this camera for almost 2 years and I still love it. It's not a camera you use everyday but I love to bring it when I go on trips or am going to a special occasion and such. It does take a while to get use to the camera and it's settings and you might get a few photos that end up wonky in the process but it's still fun. Each photo is a suprise when it comes out and you never know how it's going to turn out. I've taken 100+ photos and am still buying more film. I've also have only reached low battery on this camera once and it was after a full year of having it, so the battery life is incredible! Over all it's a fun and light camera to take on the go. Unlike the pictures we take on our phone and forget we get a hard copy right away. I've also noticed while I'm out with this camera you really pay more attention to your sourroundings, searching for a good shot cause you don't want to waste film. So unlike snapping 50 pictures of everything on your phone, you really look around and search for something unique to take a photo of. Love this camera! Highly recommend!","Super simple to use. The pictures are easy to load, battery is easy to charge, and there's not much more to it besides hitting the button to take the picture. These tend to turn out a little dark, so turn on the flash if it's a low-light room. There are several settings I'm still experimenting with so I'm not qualified to say how good they are, but even on the most basic settings I'm quite satisfied with this camera.<br /><br />Exterior looks very nice and classic, in my opinion, compared to the pink/blue versions. It \"feels\" a little cheap, but the bright side of that is this camera isn't very heavy. Throw it in a bag to take some pictures on a trip and you'll barely notice any extra weight.<br /><br />Be prepared that it's kind of a large camera that produces very small photos, thus the \"mini\". These won't be the size of our old school Polaroids and I wouldn't use them as the Pinteresty booth-camera at a wedding or anything. The photos are a little smaller than a credit card. A friend had one of the minis so I saw how small they were before I bought this and am cool with that. They're easy to hand to a friend if you take a good photo of them. Easy to fit in your wallet or to paste on a card.<br /><br />Also be aware that the film isn't exactly cheap. I think it's about 70 cents per picture, depending on what package you buy. I'm usually frugal with my hobbies. But this camera is really fun to take on the occasional trip, a unique way to give friends a little memory of it, so for me it's worth the occasional expense.","I got this for my daughter' 16th birthday. She loves it. Works just as well as the old school instant cameras I remember as a kid. The retro look design is cool and loved by my hipster kid.  Seems to be built quite well-sturdy, not cheaply put together.","seems great.  It's a Christmas gift so time will tell","The camera looks just like the picture. I was urgent to buy this for an event (my Senior year of high school, last first day of school). Amazon was kind enough to help ship it to me as quickly as possibly due to an error in my order. They upgraded me to first-class shipping for free. I always get compliments of questions whenever I bring it. It's a great conversation starter between the younger and older generation. I'm extremely happy with the camera and the future memories to come.","Images are not as good as I expected. Images look like they have been taken years ago. However it is easy to use, so I gave it to my 4 year old.","It's great! It takes lovely photos and I love the extra modes it gives me compared to the other FujiFilm models. Since I'm not really acquainted with other companies that make polaroids, I can't compare, but if you're looking for both fashion as well as great photos. buy this product. I'd recommed black as the brown is just more expensive and honestly a waste of money for a little extra \"style\" I guess. Silly to me really, since I find black looks better with much more stuff.","I was going back and forth whether I should buy an expensive DSLR camera or an instant camera. I finally decided to get this one for a couple of reasons:<br />1. Sometimes I feel these new DSLR camera show TOO much detail am I right? Like do we need to see every little detail of ppl? There is some utility in having a less than HD photo especially if you're a weirdo that analyzes all your flaws...but I digress...<br />2. I never...i mean NEVER print out photos or have them printed out at the store. Call it laziness or just being overwhelmed at HOW MANY pics I take...I just have them on my computer...and that's a drag...I want hard copy photos...but I\"m a millennial and want them right now right now.<br /><br />This camera is nowhere near a DSLR camera in terms of quality. The pics look more like 90's throwback photos that seem not blurry...but rather \"softened.\" So if you're looking for professional grade photography then I suggest you look somewhere else.<br /><br />The film is not included in this. It can be found for cheap online averaging about 10 bucks for 10 sheets but you can find it for way cheaper (i found 5 packs for 30 dollars). This is something to keep in mind.<br /><br />There are many things you can do with this camera: macro mode for shooting close up, landscape mode, party mode, kid mode, double exposure, bulb mode (long exposure). You can turn the flash on, turn the flash off, and even correct for red eye.<br /><br />I'm in love with this camera because it is amazing. I mainly take pictures of my dog (who I am also obsessed with). Try it, I don't think you will be disappointed. :)","Most people I talk to think Instax Mini is a great party format, but generally inferior to digital otherwise.  They are really missing out.  This camera's strengths really shine through with (1) the right composition, and (2) the right lighting.  When I stick to the rules below, it does an amazing job of capturing mood and feel, in a way few people can snag with a DSLR, much less a cell phone.  The instant photo format also makes \"involuntary\" photo subjects willing participants in the process.  Many people may not like it when a street photographer raises the camera and fires, but when the instant photo pops out, they get curious, even happy.<br /><br />If I try to use it for photos other than the ones I describe below, it's rubbish.  I'm better off getting out a smart phone (ughh), really.  The camera's automatic shutter speed system with a single f-stop offers far less exposure flexibility than people have become accustomed to in the digital photo era.  When you're shooting film, you need light, period.  And, Instax is pretty much a daylight balanced film, so in anything but a fair amount of sunlight, you're liable to get color shifts.  Again, digital has gotten pretty good at automatic \"white balance,\" so people aren't used to dealing with this aspect of film.  Even with the ability the camera offers to lighten the exposure two clicks, darken it one, and turn off the flash, the most likely outcome for large field use or scenes with wide ranges of shadow to light is blown out highlights and fuzzy images.<br /><br />For composition, it's best for people when I'm around 4 to 6 feet away, and not trying to capture anything more than the upper half of the model, or even better the upper third.  For street and interior scene work, the entire composition of interest needs to be something I could fit into a semi trailer, shooting from the door end, with at least 60% of the interest elements in the 60% of space that's closest to me.  Any scenes bigger than that, with models or in the street, gets lost in the small image size and relatively low detail of the film.<br /><br />For interior lighting, it is best when the subject is already well-lit with window light and the camera is not straight-on at the subject, but off at an angle by at least 45 degrees so the flash fills in from the darker side.  Straight-on interior flash shots of people will usually give bluish skin, and interior shots lit mostly with normal incandescent/LED bulbs will be orange.<br /><br />I have gotten away with exposures of ceiling-lit rooms (think a small diner) by turning off the flash and lightening two clicks, but the shutter slows down to the point where I have to factor in quite a bit of motion blur.<br /><br />Low light work, inside our out, really stretches the shutter speed, and the colors go in weird directions as a result.  Instax film color-shifts more like color slide film than color print film.  It's weird, considering how high the ISO is.<br /><br />For exterior work, it's really happiest after sunrise, before sunset, with no or very limited haze or cloud cover, and a scene that's pretty uniformly lit.  Not a lot of shadow detail available.  The flash is not up to the job of daylight fill work, so I always just turn it off; otherwise it will often over-light the closest object in the scene.  A light-colored subject that's brightly lit with direct sun will almost always over-expose, so I use the 1-click dark option there.<br /><br />If I just follow those rules, I get photos people will linger over and absorb.  I'm glad I bought the camera, and lately I throw it in my briefcase or carry-on wherever I go.  I run across a couple good scenes a week, just in my day-to-day life, without even trying.  Can't beat it.","Great camera! It's a lot of fun!","Great camera!  I use it allot with my journaling","The camera works well. But my battery charger is not working. Ive only had it for 6 months and the battery light no longer lights up when plugged in. How do you get a hold of their customer service?","photo quality isn't great but this isn't the camera you use for great photography - it's the one you use so you can give instant shots to friends or use the pics (with tape) to label storage boxes.","great - everyone loves the pic and the camera. I've had many people ask where to get it","I had been waiting anxiously for it to arrive. It did not disappoint. Very lightweight and handy. Would recommend buying a case for it.","It's a gift it looks great thoe","I bought this to take a picture of me and my girlfriend through a trip that we had. We run out the films after 3 days. The pictures come out amazing but it's kind of hard to make them good at the beginning. Consider also that the films are kind of expensive but you can always find a good deal on internet.","Love the retro look. Takes a few tries to get the lighting and coloring right for its settings","I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and it's been great! We have had nothing but a total blast with this camera! Can't wait to take it back home and use it for family Holiday parties. Great buy.","Love this camera so much!!","Has some cool features. A fun camera to have and collect pictures from.","one of the best buy I've done, bought it for a friend she loved it.","I bought this to replace my mini 25. It has more functions and settings than the Fuji mini 25. It looks classical but not cute as the mini 25. The pictures do not show much better quality than the mini 25 as I expected.","I love this camera and such a great quality!","I was looking for something that didn't look too much like a toy like the other fujifilm cameras and this was perfect! It's super cute and takes pretty great pictures. Highly recommend!!","Takes good pictures<br />Kids love having this<br />Great to give as gifts as party favors","My fiancee and I bought this camera to take with us on a two-week trip to Amsterdam and Paris. In the age of smartphones equipped with excellent cameras and large amounts of memory, it was nice to be carrying something that made us be deliberate about the things we shot, having only brought enough film for 40 photographs. This camera gives its subjects a timeless quality, and creates an instant memento of a place and time. Polaroid film seems to be quite expensive these days, and this was a welcome alternative. The credit-card sized format is nice as well, and the vintage look of the camera itself is cool without trying too hard.<br />We have since taken this camera on multiple voyages, and it continues to perform admirably.","My Wife loves this camera, the nostalgia of a \"Polaroid\" style instant photo camera is awesome and reminds us of a time when you had to wait a few minutes for your instant picture.  way before instant gratification of digital photography, and cell phone cameras.","just what both my daughter and i wanted","i dont know if i use this more or my partner, but we love it","Love this camera!! I purchased this camera to have physical pictures rather than pictures just being on my phone. Let me say this camera is amazing! The features are awesome the rechargeable battery is great and the size is perfect! I only wish there was a zoom option!","Excelente","I absolutely love this camera! I started out with the instead mini 8 and loved it, but wanted something that was better and didn't feel like a child's camera. The instead mini 90 is just that","Great polaroid camera with cool features. Attractive styling. Not cheap feeling. Uses common sized film.","I bought this for my bestie's 20th birthday, she loved it so much.<br /><br />she once told me that she gotta move the camera to the left a little bit so that the object of your picture could finally end up as you see thru the viewfinder.","I didn't purchase this from Amazon but I wanted to leave a review.  The camera is cute and has a vintage-y feel.  I bought the brown because I thought it would have a more retro feel but I think the hard plastic makes it look a bit cheap, not enough to make me regret buying it but if I was to repurchase it I would definitely opt for the more classic black style.<br /><br />The quality of the pictures is fine for what it is. There's no zoom.  In bright light, sometimes the pictures can look a bit blurry but the film is so small it doesn't matter much.  It's a fun camera, not a serious one.  I did have a couple of issues when I first purchased the camera that I think all related to the film.  Sometimes pictures wouldn't print. I think I also remember seeing the \"E\" error.  I don't know if the computer wasn't recognizing the command or the film itself was jammed or not releasing prints for whatever reason.  I just took the film out (wasteful but...)  drained and recharged the battery and luckily that resolved any issues.  I haven't had any problems since then, though, I don't use the camera that frequently.  Make sure the film cartridge is inserted perfectly and don't leave film in the camera too long (though I do this and don't have any issues).<br /><br />I would definitely purchase this fun, cute camera again.  In fact, I was here looking because I was considering making another Fuji Instax purchase.  As far as $$, I think it's at the top of it's price point.  I'm not sure I would pay more that $120-130 for it.","Bought this camera for my wife, who is crazy about photography. She loves it, and uses it constantly. It works flawlessly, and all of the functions set this one far ahead of any other polaroid camera on the market.<br /><br />The only downside is the price of the film. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE CAMERA TO SHOOT. However, if you're okay with that, I would absolutely recommend it for any photographer.","works great takes cool pics and the exposure stuff is fun","I'm a full time professional photographer and currently this is the camera I have the most fun using.  If you're wanting an instax camera this is the one to get.  I also have the Fuji Mini 8, but it drives me bonkers that I can't turn off the flash on it and that I have so little control over what it does.  Absolutely worth the extra money for the extra function and control the mini 90 has over the mini 8.  It also just looks awesome :).","Great instant camera!","This is a grear lil camera! I bought for our 10 year wedding anniversary trip to Bisbee and it was perfect! I love the different setting options and it takes great photos! So happy with this purchase!","It didn't come with the film. I was so upset cause I couldn't try the product. So sad.","Really like it. Alway want to have a instant film camera. This one is just perfect!","I absolutely love this camera I reccomend this instax over all the other ones. It's has way more features and modes. Excellent. ??","My daughter is thrilled with instant pictures.  She arrived after Polaroid which I grew up with.","After years of wanting an instant photo camera, I finally made my purchase and went with the Fujifilm Instax Mini 90. Watched many YouTube reviews, read a bunch of reviews on Amazon and I'm glad to say I'm a satisfied buyer.","Love this camera. I bought it as an upgrade from the Instax mini 8. Battery life rocks, love all the adjustments I can make (double exposure and timer are awesome features not found on the more basic models) Only big problem I ran into with this camera is film having a tendency to jam inside. When I take a photo it whirs like the photo is coming out and nothing happens, like the film gets stuck. I have to open the back and ruin the rest of my pack of film to get it to work again. It's really frustrating and makes me waste a lot of money buying replacement film.","Fun camera. Wish the pics were a bit bigger. But otherwise it performs pretty well. You will waste at least a couple from every 10 shooting bad shots. So get used to that.","Bought this as a birthday present for myself and I couldn't be happier with it. The camera is just the right size and gorgeously made. It's definitely bringing back old childhood memories of when you had to really time your shots to get the perfect picture. The print size is really cute, and I'm having a lot of fun getting creative with them. Definitely recommended!","Ok","wow! what a treat! super fun and awesome","I finally got a chance to try this out about a week after purchase. There are a lot of things to like beyond the obvious instant photo:<br /><br />-It's lightweight<br />-The battery charged fast out of the box<br />-The menu/settings are easy to determine, even if the manuals are a nightmare/mess<br /><br />I went to my state fair and with blue skies and sunlight galore, I got great shots of roller coasters/rides, games, etc.. It performed great and was very responsive. I foresee using this for a long time to come.","Love it. Multiple exposures are great! Flash isn't overpowering, good metering!","This is a nice instant camera to take out and about. Film costs about $0.50 per picture, so this is not like your digital camera where you want to take hundreds of photos lol. I used it both indoors, outdoors, and in low-light settings and am very happy with the quality of the pictures. It is great to have on you at special events. I took it to a party and got a picture of my favorite DJ, and then was able to have him autograph it. That's what makes this great.","Best thing I've purchased off Amazon all year ","I own several instax and this is my favorite so far, the picture quality is great!!","Cool retro look with the instant picture throw back of the old Polaroids of bygone days!","This was a gift for a dear friend who was going to study abroad in Italy for a semester. It was perfect! I LOVE this sleek modern look on a polaroid camera! It was beautiful and durable. I would highly recommend this for an individual who is looking for a good Polaroid camera that looks like a camera and not a toy. I bought this one in black but I have also seen the brown one in person and they are both gorgeous!","So far so good as we've only had it a short while. Nice features for the extra price compared to other models. Pictures  are a little smaller than we expected, but it's still pretty nice . The kids love seeing an actual print come out. We would definitely recommend this fun little camera. Photo attached with penny for scale.","The Fujifilm Instax Mini 90 Neo Classic Instant Camera is a definitely a thing of beauty! I am a photographer and I own a Nikon Df which has the same old school aesthetic look as this one. I was definitely willing to spent more than Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 just for that old school style. Here are some of my pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Old school appearance catches the eye of other people<br />2. Easy to use<br />3. Lots of modes (Macro, bulb, double exposure, landscape, etc.)<br />4. Ability to turn on/off the flash is useful especially if you're already into photography<br />5. Convenience of having 2 shutters (Portrait vs landscape)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Quite expensive just to get that old school appearance<br /><br />Photography should be loved regardless of the gear. This instant camera definitely has a lot of modes and options to help you get that shot that you want compared to other instant cameras out there in the market. This camera will give you a lot of creative options that will surely make you love photography more.","I loved my camera ... really simple to use. Has many useful features.","easy to use and great for capturing moments!","I bought the Brown because I figured, why not! This little camera is a hoot- people get such a kick out of watching a picture pop out! Kids love it too. This gives you that unmistakable retro look in the photo, very fun and has enough options to keep you happy in any setting. Comes with a battery, charger, strap and of course the camera. I recommend buying film on Amazon as it's more pricey elsewhere.","Amazing little camera. I've taken at least 100 shots so far, and only had four or five that didn't turn out the way I wanted them to. Has tons of options, great for indoor and outdoor, all around a great little camera and I couldn't be happier with it!","These are great. Any company still manufacturing cameras that use actual film are aces in my book. We all shoot so many photos now with our phones and share them instantaneously that it kind of desensitizes us to the whole thing. Having a tactile experience with photography, to me, is similar to the vinyl experience with music. It adds something to it. These are not professional cameras by any stretch of the imagination, but they are very fun and addictive. You can do several \"trick\" photographs with this model which is cool. The photos are smaller (about half the size of the old standard polaroids), so in some situations I've wished I had a little bigger canvas to work with, but for the portability it's an easy tradeoff.","this was a gift, but was liked very much.","Super product! The best purchase I have ever made! Countless fun and great memories!","FAST SHIPPING NICE ITEM","Great item!! Item as described. love taking this camera on trips!","Favorite item to travel with.","Great little camera. True colors, fast developing, small images, oh ya good luck trying to frame an image with the closeup setting on. The view finder is most likely the worst part of this camera. Make sure you alway frame much looser. I burned several images off just to get close to center framing with the closeup setting on. Hey Fuji how about sending me a roll of film for having to eyeball your poor view finder. LOL","Fine","Have it for about ten days now. Still learning my way around it.  The view finder is a bit off. Usually what I do is that I frame my shot, take a small step forward, then move the camera horizontally to the left (just a little bit).  Other than that, I'm still trying to figure out all the settings. I find that the light/lighter setting is useless for selfies when you turn the flash off. Things get really blurry.  It's better to just use the flash light and regular setting for selfies, except in super sunny and bright outdoor setting.","Awesome little camera!<br />Great instant film camera. Uses instax mini film which is one of the cheapest instant films u can buy.<br />Plenty of settings on the camera for a variety of lighting and speed conditions, as well as a long exposure (blub) mode, which we have had fun with.<br />Great battery life, since its not a digital camera with a screen.","It's alright, the settings are a bit confusing and not guaranteed results, focus is off sometimes too. Overall it was fine.","The light of my life!!! Long time Polaroid user, but the film is too expensive to use anymore, the impossible film looks washed out and is fussy. The resolution on these pics is great, the double exposure function is amazing, they don't need to be hidden from all light for the first 40 mins like the impossible stuff. The film is cheap enough you don't have to feel all uptight and precious about taking as many pics as you want. I can't say enough about what a fun camera this is!!!! I'm enjoying the hell out of it. Buy it and take pics with reckless abandon!!","Extremely pleased!","This was a gift for a good friend of mine. He absolutely loves it and has been taking pictures everywhere he goes. I didn't even know about long exposure light pictures until he told me about it with this camera. Great buy & gift!","if you are lover of polaroids, this camera will speak to your heart.<br />i bought it and i love it. settings are very easy and in matter of few shoots you will be able to play with settings and have pictures with great results. The life of the battery is really good, i didn't change mine for a month now.","Wow this is an awesome Camera definitely recommend this! The price is perfect , you have to remember it comes with a rechargable battery. That's the main reason why i bought it because i didn't want to have to keep buying the disposable batteries . Overall get it ! You will love it just as much as i do !!","Love it!!!","Great camera!","Bought this for my girlfriend and she uses it everywhere we go. The film is moderately pricey but not as much as full sized polaroid film.","Awesome camera, I love the Instax film now and am considering getting a printer to complement it.","I love it.","Bought it for my GF and she loves it! We are still figuring out how to shoot in the center because most of our pictures are usually off centered. What appeared in the lens is not the same when the picture is taken","The sample pics and the actual pics are no where near!!<br />But works as expected for a such camera.","i love it!","great camera","Cute, easy to use and so much fun at parties!","Love the camera!","Delivery took longer than expected but otherwise amazing. Photos look gorgeous and the look of the camera gives you a really hip/retro vibe.","Great!","Great product for kids or hipsters.  If you can afford the film.  We used these at our wedding to build our scrapbook.  The photos take about 60 seconds to appear.  This is much better quality than the wide version.","Very nice looking. It does its job as taking picture.","Love this camera!  Delivery was so fast and I got the best deal I could find.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.","This works great but I recommend getting the larger camera.  Pictures are very small on this one.","add to cart","This camera does have a learning curve. It will take some time and film (at least 10 bad photos) to learn how to properly work all the functions of this camera. When people are experiencing white or black film being developed it may be due to some reasons of over exposure of the film or under exposure of the film when taking a photograph, or the film is damaged by exposure to light before being placed into the camera, heat or cold temperatures (below 41\"f and above 104\"f), or the film was exposed to x-rays. Other than the learning curve and the few things that could happen to the film to cause damage the camera is actually a very good way to make memories with people you care about and places you have been. Every photo taken is going to be a one of a kind and there will be no other one like it. Every photo will be special so you should think about lighting and placement before taking the photo. The camera its self is fairly good quality but I would recommend not dropping it. It takes some time to learn how every setting works and also look up some guides too, but over all being this instant camera it is very good and fun.","Best camera ever!!!!","This camera is a blast to play with.  Just wish the film wasn't so expensive.","It's very pretty and works really well :)","Love this camera!","Lightweight, easy to use, multiple photo options, and good quality pictures. A great camera to bring to parties - just remember to pack extra film, because once people see the instant camera, everyone wants a photo.","Just what you would expect from a modern instant film camera! Takes photos and I love the multi exposure mode. I have a DSLR, but bought this for the intimacy of it. I am not disappointed!","Camera and concept is great. Quality of photos is OK. You got what you paid for. Overall great camera, would definitely recommend to anyone looking for instant photo camera.","Polaroids are just magical. This little camera takes excellent pictures, so I'm happy.<br /><br />I would be remiss not to mention the design of the device, though. I'm a product designer, so please don't let this impact your decision to buy if you don't get hung up on these details. It's made of plastic and feels a bit like a toy, as the price point would lead you to guess, but the industrial design of this product is LAUGHABLE. As in.... 100% bewildering. I'm baffled it made it to market. It looks like an confused intern started CAD modeling in SketchUp and then had a seizure. I get the gesture they were going for- throwback leica camera, I'm all for it- but the surfacing is a mess, the molded leather plastic is cheesy, and every detail is completely unresolved. I'm not even mad about it because it's so funny.<br /><br />So from a CE design standpoint it's impressively bad. But, it takes great pictures and adds something amazing to any get-together. It says something that I fully recommend buying it despite its design hardships.","great product ,!!!","Daughter likes it. works well for instant pics.","I LOVE this camera. I've had it for a year now.<br /><br />It's a superior, cheaper alternative to using old Polaroid cameras (with stupidly overpriced film).<br /><br />Tons of features, very versatile, and very aesthetic.<br /><br />The main reason I didnt like the mini instax cameras was that they look like toys. Plus the flash cannot be turned off on those ones.<br /><br />This camera is cool, sleek, and professional looking. It's plastic but it certainly doesn't feel cheap.<br /><br />The pictures come out great. Although if you're unfamiliar with instant photos, each picture is an experiment and a gamble. Example: my mirror selfie which turned out way too dark and blurry.<br /><br />It's insanely satisfying to get the perfect shot.<br /><br />Film is about pretty pricey, but mot overpriced. So if you're the type of person who takes lots of pictures, you may wanna go digital.<br /><br />Dont waste your time buying packs at stores. 20 pictures is 25 dollars in stores but on amazon you can get 60 for the same price<br /><br />Overall, great camera. Lots of features, very fun.","I gave it as a birthday present for my wife and she loves it.","I just wanna say that I am in love with this câmera. It's adicting to take pics with it.","It was a present for my daughter who wanted one desperately for some reason she says it's fantastic and works well","Bought for a friend. Arrived promptly. Sleek and vintage aesthetic. Works great. They loved it.","my son like it","many setting, great fun","Good camera","overexposes images A LOT..","Works about as well as you would expect.  Faults in photos are not due to camera, but of film not being very sensitive. I really wish the modes you set when the camera is on would persist when you turn the camera back on.  For example, if you turn off the flash and put on extra light mode, when you turn it off, all the settings will reset.<br /><br />Also, it would be nice if the viewfinder was a bit more accurate.  A SLR would have been awesome, but also more expensive.","Honestly I love this, I have an old Polaroid but it's needed to be fixed and the film is just so pricey. This is perfect, good size, the film is well priced, and the pictures turn out pretty well. I would definitely recommend, camera has also held up well to some bumps I took it to Disney and Universal and it fell a few times.","Great little camera. Takes awesome pictures. My only complaint is it's hard to do the proper composition for it - the view finder is positioned on the left of the camera so your view is not in line with the lens. It's fine for when I'm taking pictures because I've learned to adjust, but annoying to explain to others when they take a picture.","We are really enjoying this camera. Having a physical picture just a minute after taking the photo has made our moments that we capture really special. This particular model has great features to allow us to take photos in a lot of different circumstances and still have them come out well.<br /><br />Very happy with this purchase!","It took a while to get a handle on the settings, but otherwise, its awesome. A nice compact little nostalgia item.","so much fun","I am a long time photographer. My camera gear costs more that my car, and I love each individual piece. With that in mind, I want to say that I absolutely LOVE this camera. I bring it with me everywhere. I take pictures of my friends and family, as well as bringing it to concerts so I can snap a pic of the performer if they have a meet and greet.<br /><br />This is pure and simple, a fun camera. If you are expecting pictures of a DSLR quality, you are going to be disappointed (and a little naive). I bought this because a friend of mine passed away far too young, and it made me realize that I didn't have a single picture of him. ME! The photographer. It crushed me. So I bought this and I have been taking pictures of my loved ones nonstop.<br /><br />It is built very well, and I love the nostalgia of the \"instant pic\". I can't help but shake the picture, even though it does nothing. I enjoy the flash control that is offered on this model (Mini 90). The prints costing roughly $1.00 each forces me to slow down and think before I click.<br /><br />The main concern I have is with the archivability of the format. You are left with a single copy of the picture, and it is too early to tell how well it will hold up years (decades?) down the line.<br /><br />Buy this camera to preserve precious memories.","Love this camera!! I am able to capture so many memories, and am currently making a photo album full of them","Recently took this camera to Africa with me as a way to \"give pictures\" to the people in remote villages who may not have ever seen a picture of themselves let alone possessed one.  (used the Fugifilm Instax film)<br />The camera was absolutely awesome - it was perfect, reliable, took excellent pictures (which started to develop before their eyes).<br />In several cases, I actually ended up taking Instax pictures of the village chief, his wives and all the children who were home.  I could not believe how this one camera made such a huge impression on so many people (And it made for a magical experience for me)<br />I am planning on taking this with me on all my future travel adventures - what a great icebreaker and fun maker.","First impression:<br /><br />The physical aesthetics of this camera is phenomenal. I was quite impressed seeing the many different features that this little guy has built in. Comes with a rechargeable battery instead of needing double A batteries. All together a nice fun little camera!","I bought this as a gift to my wife, she is very happy with this product. It has all the features she expected and plus very high quality pictures.","Lots of fun","I love this camera!!!!","Really like this camera, a lot of fun to shoot with! Have been using it for about three weeks and haven't encountered any problems. Came with charger, battery, neck strap and instructions in package. Film is not included. Delivery was fast.","This is a fun little camera--takes quality images and really fun to have at parties.  I keep it around my house when I have company, and everyone likes being able to take a picture home.  I wish the wide format camera had the same quality as this one.  Lots of functions to play around with as well.  A little bit awkward at first, but you get used to it!  Buy the film on Amazon--price can't be beat.","Such an amazing camera. So retro and fun and the quality isn't bad at all! Very very worth it.","works perfectly well, awesome pics","Delivered early with bo defects.  I'd never heard of this before my sister put it on her birthday wish list. Pretty stylin!","Love it!","My daughter-in-law loved this...blown away with this camera.  Starting shooting pictures as soon as she finished opening presents at her party.","My boyfriend and I love taking this camera places to have that instant printout. Everything works as it says!","It was a great gift, all I heard was good things. Makes me want to buy one for myself.","Fast shipment, well packed, good price all a customer can ask for","Looks so much better than the 8. I'm sure I would have been okay with the 8, but it looks so much like a toy. The 90 also gives you the capability to turn the flash off, which is really nice. The double exposure option is nice as well, but not a necessity. My friend has the 8 and her pictures are really nice but I think the ones taken with the 90 are slightly better because of the settings available.","The coolest camera I've owned. Hands down. I'm a nostalgic kind of guy and when I grew up I always wanted one of these cameras but I couldn't afford to buy one on my own and my parents never got me one. Now that I'm older and I have some money I got one the moment I thought of a good project to use a polaroid style camera for. Also this thing really turns heads.<br /><br />I got this camera because I was officiating my cousin's wedding and I wanted to give them a wedding present that would be really fun for them to have right after the wedding. I got this camera with 3 double packs of film so I could take photos from the moment I got there to the end of the ceremony. I'd take the photo and stick it in the journal I bought to write the officiation speech down in and used scrap book photo corners to hold it in. They loved it because it provided an instant wedding album that they could look at right away. It wasn't as great as the professional one, but regardless a very cool thing to have on hand.<br /><br />Now my crafting aside, this camera takes photos on a polaroid style film that is about the size of a credit card (that includes the whites). The image itself is a little smaller. The moment you take a photo though you get that vintage feel of the photo. It's also one of those exhilarating feelings when you take photos with this camera because it's 60 cents a shot pretty much and you don't know how the next photo is going to take. Will it turn out? Who knows until you shake it until it shows up. A lot of people at the wedding complimented the camera and some wanted a photo they could keep. The nice thing about the small card sized polaroid is that it's easy to pocket without having to bend or be bent in a pocket.<br /><br />I'm not going to give this camera any negatives stars for the quality of image because it is solely based on the user taking photos with it. This camera is very forgiving when it comes to taking photos (selfies, portraits, action, etc.). I got this particular model because it has settings that can adjust based on the photos you are taking (such as action for kids running around or dancing). The camera itself does correct itself a bit when it comes to distance pictures, but photos within 10 feet of the camera does produce some of the best photos. The camera does come with a flash, but also does have options to make photos lighter or darker based on the environment they you are taking photos in.<br /><br />TL:DR - Conclusions on this camera are thus: If you are person who is nostalgic for a time when photo taking meant taking a photo meant wasting a resource, but enjoyed the suspense and surprise of that kind of risk taking then this is a great camera for you. It's also a camera that is guaranteed to turn a lot of heads. My generation (kids of the late 80s and 90s) may remember them, older generations have nearly forgotten about them, and the younger generation most likely don't even know about them (quite a few of those I've met or known, haven't). It produced a lot of smiles and \"Oh, that's so cool.\" Or the funnier responses I got that weekend of photo taking was \"so the printer is built in?\" at which point, being a little bit of a photo nerd I had to explain it to them.<br /><br />TL:DR of the TL:DR - Buy this camera if you want nostalgic, classic looking photos that a person can walk away with without having to friend them on facebook or e-mail them to share the image.","Cool camera. Made a fantastic gift for the girlfriend. Easy to use, easy to replace film. Haven't broken anything on it. Produces the kind of nostalgic-warm-memory looking photos you buy a polaroid for. A little expensive, but a great value. I don't think you can do better for cheaper","Perfect.  Daughter loves it.  Is a conversation piece at parties.","A lot of cool features. Takes a little practice to get used too but well worth in the end.","Amazing! I love it!","Its bigger than i thought it would be which isn't a problem. It just feels more secure in my hands. Even though its made of plastic it feels amazing. Good quality build but still not something you'd want to drop. It came with everything you'd expect: battery, charger, strap, camera, manuals. However it didn't come with film, I already anticipated that so it wasn't a problem.","Rad mode options, especially the double exposures. Classic polaroid with a fun twist. The photos are small, but it's by no means a con.","bought for my daughter, she's 12, loves it! easy to use, great quality. Photographers dream, so cool! Taking time to compose a shot and then wait for it to appear, so fun! works great!","so far so good! I loved my polaroid in the 90s and this really brings back those memories. still getting used to the settings but it is very fun.","Way too big with relatively thin straps","I'm so glad I got this. I like the style over the big plastic ones, as I have always used a lot of old film cameras and I am drawn to this look because of it. Aside from aesthetics, it works great and the double exposure feature was a selling point for me. Best deal for film is on Amazon as well.","This camera is great. They offer the cheaper Instax but I'd recommend getting this one - high quality images, including macro and double exposure.  I bought the multipack Instax film from Amazon, and it was a good value. I love the retro look of the camera, and it came with a nice carrying strap as well. Would purchase again in a heartbeat, all my friends love it too.","Lot's of fun to use. Cute little pictures.","SO MUCH FUN. I love the look of the camera, size, and the size of the film it shoots. Having a quick and easy way to take *real* photos has been wonderful.","I LOVE IT!","Great gift.","Daughter Loves it","Works well, great fun for my daughter!","Love it. Love the design, quality, durability, and style. Works perfect. Good for keeping great memories.","Absolutely in love with this camera! It takes such good pictures and the film isn't a bad price either. The battery life is pretty awesome. I would recommend anyone who wants their pictures fast and enjoys the older things in life, like when there were no digital screens to make sure your hair was perfect or your eyes were closed. There's just something about having that one goofy photo where no one was ready and there's no going back.","This little camera is amazing! I've charged the battery only once since I've purchased it and I've gone through at least 80 pictures and the battery still says its full! I also love that there's so many options on it compared to the other models so I can actually get a sharp Selfie, a party image with ambient light in the bg, dual exposure and such!","The best purchase. I used this for my wedding and tons of friends went out to buy their own after getting to play with mine. Love snapping quick photos of my little one as well.","Excellent quality of the pictures!","Nice looking camera but I think a little pricey","I will be honest.. I am not a photographer... I am pretty bad at it.. The reason I got this over the regular cheaper colored Instax is that I felt maybe down the road I could use some of the more advanced settings.<br /><br />I originally bought this as my wife has had to move home to take care of her mother for the last year. I was going to visit and thought it might be fun to take some old time POLAROID style pics.  Everyone LOVES this camera.. Who didn't love getting an instant pic back in the day? They are fun. They immediately lighten peoples moods. I did laugh when an older lady at my office asked \"So then you can email them?\" no... \"well you can upload them to computer right?\" LOL NO...NO and I do not want to so NO!.<br /><br />Here are my pros and cons<br />Pro<br />Film is more consistent than the impossible project polaroid film. Actually consistent to me it is night and day better... as the impossible project seems to me to tweak theirs as it is still using a mix of old and new technique and technology and chemicals.<br />film is cheaper<br />old school look is really cool and gets lots of looks.<br />photos do not need to be shielded from light at first<br /><br />Cons<br />pictures are somewhat tiny, tinier than polaroids for sure. They do make a wide version of the instax camera and film but the thing is HUGE. I would not want to lug it around.<br />This camera takes some work to figure out. Be prepared to waste some prints figuring it out. It is FUN figuring it out but still on box 3 and pics still come out like UHHHH WHAT DID I DO.<br />Film is a cost factor.. I have found them for about 63 cents per pic.. Bout as cheapest as I have found.<br />Other cost factors... BAIL MONEY when someone asks you to email them a copy and you slap them back to 1985 faster than Marty McFly in a Delorean.<br /><br />This is really fun. I really wanted to send it back as I felt I would not use it for the money but I just can't lol. It is fun. It takes you back. It is nice to just have something in your hand. To know only ONE copy exists . That that copy was THERE at that MOMENT when it happened.","I loved the product. So far it's been great! I need to play around with the setting more, but most of the picture I've taken are awesome!","I heard about the error problem and I wasn't sure of getting it because of that. In the end i decided to get it and it just arrived yesterday, shipping took a little bit more than a week. The camera came in great condition, it looks new. I tried it and took some pictures and they came out great. So far there is nothing wrong with it but I'll update if anything does happen.","I purchased this for a good friend of mine, and she uses it all of the time.  The film is a little pricey, but it's easy to get, and it's not like you take a picture of everything with this.  She loves it, and people love to have her take their \"old school\" picture.  It makes it look like an older picture, sorta like a filter, but such an awesome look for special times you'd like to capture.","The most affordable way to enjoy the analog glory of instant gratification. The 90 offers a few more adjustments than the lesser Instax models which makes it more versatile. While the prints are relatively tiny, they're affordable enough that it takes the doubt of whether capturing a moment is \"worth the expense\" out of the equation. The experience as a whole is much more satisfying than the thousands of phone camera shots taken and forgotten or never revisited.","Bought for my daughter.  Loves it!  This is not a Dslr and has almost no functionality, but is perfect for that vintage look and instant pictures are fun!!  Also the actual pictures are pretty small but the kids love it.  Buy film in bulk.  be glad you did!","Just bought this around a month ago and have been taking as many photos as i can! Whenever my friends and I go on a hike or the beach I am always sure to bring this. It is very portable and compared to the other fujifilm mini this has many more options and with the double exposure you can take much better pictures. Be aware that the selfie mirror is not directly where the lens is and it takes a little practice to get a hang of when centering the photo. This problem also goes along with the viewfinder which is more upper left than the actual lens is so be aware of these factors when you are taking your photos.","Love it so far! Color is pretty good, but do expect the \"vintage\" feel of the photo will result in less vibrant colors. Quick shipment, selected 2 days and got it in a day. Haven't used it extensively yet just did a few test shots, some definitely came out too bright but love the function to make it darker. Easy to use even though I've never had a instant camera before. I got this for wedding guests book / DIY Photo Booth, and now I have to buy extra films because I'm having too much fun using it before the wedding. and I haven't even played with the other cool features yet!<br /><br />Only slight negative is the manufacturer booklet for user's manual is not super helpful in explaining all the features...","The brown leather is really pretty. Definitely a good buy. I especially like that it has a timer!","Really great product, came in a really nice box, with all you need, film separate though, though it didn't matter because I went with the bundle of Insta Film to come with the camera. Anyways it's a Great Buy!","It feels a little cheap, the photos are not centered.  Did not expect off centered photos for the price.  However, it's a fun camera and I will get use out of it.  I like the options of filters, and I have always loved Polaroid.","Love love love this camera. It worked perfectly for what I needed ti for. I brought this to Uganda with me and I was able to print out pictures right away for women, children and men who some have never seen their picture. it was a complete joy. ;)","I bought this to enjoy with my 2 year old neice. She absolutely adores snapping a photo and watching the picture come out immediately. It is so cute!! This is a nice size and lightweight. There are two spots for pressing the snapshot button, making using it like a traditional camera or a new age one a breeze. I'm not super in love with the photo quality, I would never use this as a primary camera for an important event. But for playing around with - sure. Its adorable, and the pictures are so nostalgic. My friends and I dress up like 90s kids and have a blast!! The pictures are super tiny, but I can think of so many fun things to do with them. Love it!","Teens had a blast using this at prom party!!  Quality of pics are same as I remember from instant photos, no fault of this particular camera, but price of film and quality of print lends me to give a 4 star review.  However, who actually gets to hold a pic anymore??  It was a novelty for the teens!!","This camera is perfect for the grab and go memories.  Very nostalgic looking and easy to use.","Perfect","Love this camera! Definitely have to learn how to use it though...","Bought this for my girlfriend and really love it! Just really wish it came with film. I accidentally gifted it without any film. I think this should be more clear, or it should at least come with a pack of 5!","Just like the good ol' days.  Kids are intrigued by this new, physical form of pictures.  Surprising, in that they can't post on Instagram! ;) Nevertheless, pictures of friends seem to mean more when you're holding a unique picture.  Camera works perfectly, just remember to hold it vertically. Not essential, but the printed picture does have a thicker border on the long side.","I got one for vacation and my kids and I both use it all the time! It takes great pictures!","I am pleased with the product- it works as advertised.<br /><br />Yes, I wish the pics were a teeny bit larger.<br /><br />Yes, I wish the viewfinder was better aligned with the lens.<br /><br />And yes, I wish the results were a bit more consistent... but I'm hopeful I'll learn the tricks of the trade and my shots will improve.<br /><br />BUT,... overall it's a barrel of fun to leave the camera out at a gathering and watch folks gawk over the pics they take as they develop. Well worth the price of admission!","I'm still on my first pack of film, but so far I LOVE this camera!<br />I've been rooting for real film and instant photos for years. It was really sad to watch the decline.<br />Originally I bought a Polaroid Snap, because I thought the print and digital combo were a cool \"upgrade\" to instant film. Boy was I wrong. That camera was TERRIBLE, with lots of design flaws. I exchanged it for this camera and am so happy I did. It feels like a camera, and nothing beats the instant film. I'm very happy with all of the setting options and the size of it.<br /><br />My only gripe so far is that I took some photos during an overcast day and they came out very washed out. Could be the setting, could just be what the camera/film will do. But it's nothing too terrible to make me hate it. It looks like old-school Polaroid film. :)","This is my first working instant print camera. I love this one in particular because you can change so many settings to get cool effects on your pictures. It also has a thread on the bottom that you can attach to a tripod which I find very nice. The pictures you get out of it are much smaller than a classic Polaroid, but they're stunning! I never thought instant print would be so beautiful. Its really cool that you get your picture instantly, and it kind of reminds us of what photography used to be.With digital now we take 50 pictures and narrow down to 5 we like. With this, I capture shots with more thought put into them. I love it.","I bought it as a gift to my friend. She love the classic looking, but she's still getting a hard time learning how to use it. If you don't know how to use it, it can't even compete with a cheap mini8.","Absolutely love the camera. I had initially purchased the Fujifilm instax 8 and decided to return it for this one instead. best thing I could have done. It not only has a nicer look but also more features. Takes great quality of photos.","I like that the camera has multiple different shooting modes, a flash that can be turned off, and the shutter button in the front can be used as a mirror when taking selfies with friends :) The film packs are easy to load too.","Great camera.  I got this camera for my wife for Mothers Day and she is in love with it.  It is very easy to use and has lots of settings.  The camera is very easy to load with the film.  The camera looks just like it does on Amazon, and it is a great quality camera.  The pictures come out great (flash needed in dark areas).<br /><br />It didn't come with any film so I bought some from target.  I suggest buying the film through Amazon.  At Target the film was $20 for 20 shots, on amazon it is $12 for 20 shots.","We had a previous model of the Fujifilm Instax, but decided to upgrade with this one.  It certainly takes much better photos and has various settings that were not available on the previous Instax.  It features a double feature setting that is fun to use.  One thing that is also fun about it is the design, it has a cute vintage look to it and fits nicely into a small purse.","If you're wanting an instant camera, but don't want to haul around one of the bigger Polaroid jobs, this is a good choice.  This is a nice, little camera.  I've had it less than 24 hours, so the star count might change with more use.  But, for now, it seems to be working out well.  On first inspection, the design is nice.  Not too large, though cumbersome if you want to stuff it in your pocket.  It won't take up a ton of room in a medium size purse.  It seems well built.  The buttons are all positioned in a way you can get to them.  Though, there are these 3 'faux buttons' on the back, no idea what they're for.  I don't know if they're supposed to be from some old model and they just left them on there, but they don't press.  They're just there.  They eject slot for the picture is on the side.  So, don't keep you hand in the way after you take a picture.  I like that you have the ability to make minor adjustments.  Let's face it.  It's an instant film camera.  You're not gonna get great depth of field and Annie Leibovitz caliber shots.  They're going to be a little blown out, a little fuzzy, a little too close/too far.  But, that's the charm of the instant camera.  With the light/dark button, macro, ability to turn off the flash, you have a little bit more control to do some tweeking ahead of time.  Fair warning- your first cartridge of film is going to be the guinea pig.  You're just going to have to start snapping pics of dogs and rocks and twigs and husbands and wives and chairs to see what this little guy can do in the house, at night, outside during the day, etc.  Just start mashing buttons and taking pictures.  The picture size isn't the size of the old Polaroids.  They're smaller, but that can't be helped.  They're small enough you can stick them in your wallet.<br /><br />So, whether you're an oldie like me, from back in the day of the abacus and before wheels were round, or you're young enough to where this is your first foray into 'film' cameras, I think you'll get a kick out of this.  Like everyone says, the film isn't cheap.  But, I got it on Amazon.  That's the cheapest I can find.  Be sure and get a case or little sack to put this in.  It's a toy, but a kind of expensive one.  And, don't forget that trick from way back when.  When the picture comes out, be sure and shake it.  It makes it develop faster :)  Where do you think they came up with that line, \"Shake it like a Polaroid picture!\" came from?","The camera is very lightweight and exactly what I was looking for.  I haven't been able to mess around with it too much, but the pictures I have taken so far are what I expected.","I love it! It came on time and it works amazing.","Took this to a music festival (Coachella) and made some great friends and pictures with it. Though it looks better than the original one everyone has, the pictures come out darker and the settings don't work as well as they should. Still a great investment but no one has the film to sit there all day and experiment. Not too great for a sunny day","Great little camera to bring back nostalgia from when you were a child showing kids nowadays what polaroid pictures were and are is a great feeling to let them see what you did as a child or what your parents did as a child when they took pictures","Great product, fast service!! Thank you!","works as advertised","excellent","I'm so happy can't wait to use it more","Colors are a bit dull but that's instant film these days.I like the double exposure feature. Auto exposure and focus work well.","great value- fun to use!","Love love love this camera!<br /><br />I had always wanted a Polaroid after doing film work in high school, and when I saw this camera I fell in love. I got it as a gift last Christmas, and now my wall is covered in pictures I've taken in various places, on many adventures.<br /><br />The camera is so fun and has so many features, it's unlike any other Polaroid in this price range out there, and even compared to more expensive ones it can easily hold its place.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I honestly don't have any, the camera is amazing. The only issue you may run into is some highlight clipping on your film if you're taking a photo that's too bright, but that will be with any film camera, and that wouldn't be the cameras fault.<br /><br />Really, I think this is a must for any photographer or photo lover who wants to try something new and have fun!","Easy to load and mode function is great.","Great instant photo camera.","Bought this for my sisters Birthday. She loves it and I'm now thinking of buying the brown version  of this camera. I'd recommend this to anyone who's into non-over-filtered pictures. Has Lo-Fi? ...Just buy the instax printer, edit, and print. Pfft.","I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter, and I think I have enjoyed it just as much as she has! The pictures are very sharp and clear; it is very easy to use.  The film comes in different fun boarders and on average is about a dollar a picture. Overall its a fun camera that takes great pictures!","Perfect","Bought it as a gift for my daughter and ordered this new version instead of the previous one she wanted. She is not happy about the brightness feature. All the picture seem to be coming out very bright. Need to see if there is a way to fix this","Highly recommended.","It's the best instant camera I've owned by instax what can I say?<br />I own the wide and owned the mini 8<br />And fujifilm by far exceeded my expectations with this one","I absolutely think that this is the most genius thing yet! I am a 80's kid and there is something therapeutic to see a photo pop out of a camera. BTW, There is a mirrored button on the front that I learned was a selfie mirror...duh! Would totally recommend.","This thing rocks. It takes awesome photos, the film isn't too expensive. I love the retro look. The batteries have lasted since I initially charged them, and I've gone through almost three packs of film so far. Using this to make a photo book of memories instead of using social media. Love it!","I bought this camera for one of the guests at my wedding reception to capture random moments and people.  They are so much fun!  We got great pictures of family members and friends.","I absolutely love this camera and i think its the best instax in the market, but since i bought a used one it has some issues, like sometimes it will say error and the lens wont come up, the first time it happened i asumed it was a film error so i took the catridge out and then put it back again and i lost a perfectly good picture, it keeps happening, but whatever, i'll just keep using it, whats a camera without the stuggle? hahaha","Everything I expected. A great camera!","My boyfriend bought this Instax Mini (after falling in love with my Instax Mini +8) and he's obsessed with it. He loves taking pictures of his dog with it to decorate his office. I'm actually a little bit jealous. I think this one is much more beautiful and classic looking than mine (though I still love mine).","I use this camera when i go somewhere special. Well made product","I bought this for my sister who is a photographer and she loves it! The film is easy to load and it's really neat to have an instant print of a photo. It's a lot of fun to take to parties as well.","Love the mini pictures. Camera works great. Still learning how to use all the features but very cool.","By far the best instant camera for people who want a few more technical features.","Great toy to own. You won't regret it.","Thank you!","this one looks nice and has decent quality. i am so happy to have it.","Looks nice and takes good photos for price.  I highly recommend this","Really fun to use. Average Polaroid quality. Mini Polaroid pics - siZe of credit card - not a whole lot of room to write anything. But fun and easy to use. The selfie mirror button isn't quite aligned, so when using selfies, just don't use that mirror circle.","It's a science experiment every time you press the shutter.","I LovE IT","i am so happy to have this one. it looks really nice and make amazing photos.","There are many different modes and feature that the instax mini 90 offers. The battery life lasts for a long time I've taken about 40 shots and it still has full charge. Although there are instructions on how to use each mode it's still hard to get the hang of it. If you don't know how to properly use it the mini8 takes better photos. All my photos are washed out and blurry.","love the different options to make the photo better.","This is wonderful! We took it on a roadtrip and it was my 8 year old nieces camera for the trip. She loved being able to take photos and see them right away. She also would take pictures with people she bought stuff from (went through the Navajo reservation and she bought from roadside artisans) and they seemed to really like having a little photo too. She learned how to use the various functions, with some reminders, and doesn't seem to mind the quality issues inherent in an instant camera in a digital world. She also was really taking her time to line up her shots and try different angles before snapping so she used only 30 of the 40 shots we gave her for the trip. Her classmates were amazed with her photo album when she got back to school.<br /><br />As to the camera. I like it. Its fun to play with. I haven't really used the double exposure or long exposure much myself. I went with this over cheaper versions mostly because of the rechargeable built in battery versus batteries for the others. I figure longer term it will be a better investment. I wish the strap wasn't right above where the film comes out but thats a minor issue and easy to remember when holding it and taking photos (come on a 8 year old figure it out). I kinda wish it had a auto shut off after 5 minutes only because I found my niece with the lens out a few times when she had forgotten it was on while walking around.","I love this camera already. I honestly bought it on a whim. I always wanted one though. I was skeptical at first because I always read the bad reviews before the good ones but I cannot say that I have a complaint or faced the same issues as the other individuals that gave this camera a lower rating. The pictures are amazing. Great color. You can definitely get some great shots with practice and just playing around with the camera. I will say this though, if you're like me and are taking instant photography as a hobby, it is an investment because the film is going to add up fast","love this camera! could be pricey, but overall love it.","I enjoy that it looks more old fashion and hipster compared to the fat colored ones. I carry it everywhere with me for special occasions.","So far, the camera is brilliant. Responsive and arrived with perfect packaging. Great job.","i like it","The camera is adorable! I love the vintage look. Being a photographer, sometimes it's just fun to be able to take some fun and silly instant photos. The camera works great! Highly recommend any of the Fujifilm camera products.","Awesome camera for instant film. Messing with double exposures is a lot of fun and the option to turn off the flash is a great feature.","Was looking for an instant camera for my wife as a birthday gift and came across this. It has some built in camera features along with a rechargeable battery. I was impressed with the features since I didn't really expect any and the rechargeable battery is extremely helpful. Plus, it has an old school look to it. My wife was using it at dinner and it was a big hit with her friends - so much so that her friend bought one using the Amazon app before we even finished dinner.","had a few problems with the display at first","very well?i like this one so mach? the price that i bought was very nice~~~","I love this camera. It works just like the original instax, but has better settings. The double exposure mode is fun to play around with and I love that it has a retro feel.","this one looks really cute in actual. i love the quality and the texture of it. awesome find indeed.","Great camera for instant photos - quality obviously not like a digital camera but my daughter has had a lot of fun with this!","Great Camera!","Ordered this on behalf of someone else and they love it. Easy and fun to use.","Cool retro gadget. At least you have a physical print immediately. Great for parties!!!","Neat little Camera, and my Family had fun seeing pictures develop  right before their eyes.","This camera is awesome! I've been looking for a instax mini and couldn't decide between this and the instax mini 8. I'm so happy with this purchase! The look of this camera is classic and timeless. I'm 31 years old and would fee silly with the instax 8 since it is rather childish looking compared to this one. One of my favorite purchased on Amazon!","I love it! It's so cute and easy to use!","I was so excited to get this Instax because I previously had the instax wide for years. It has a few versatile options such as the double exposure (which is a huge +). If you're hesitant on wether or not to roll the dice on this camera, just do it. You won't regret. It's light weight and easy to carry almost anywhere, and it provides memories that last a lifetime.","Good little camera, but for the money I expected more. Also the instruction are sparse, choppy, unclear and sound like English might have been a third language for the writer.","This is such a fun camera. It's priced right and once you get the hang of it, it's easy!","Such a unique camera! I've been wanting one forever, and I finally got this one and am so happy about it. Takes great photos and has different settings on it. Very excited about it!","I love the vintage feel of this camera.  It's a staple of any party I host and a really fun way to capture memories.  The film may be expensive AF but it's worth it!  I've used this camera to take pictures for a wedding guestbook and every time I take it to an event people love it!","This is an absolutely phenomenal little camera. I love taking it to weddings to give the bride & groom 'instant' photos and taking it on trips as well. It's fun to see the reactions from little kids who weren't alive when Polaroid was popular. They treat it like it's absolute magic.<br /><br />Instax is a LOAD of fun and this camera was very easy to learn. The different ways to hold it makes it even easier to use. The viewfinder is a tad bit small, but that's a minor quibble--it just takes a little longer to find it sometimes if your hand-eye coordination isn't the best.<br /><br />The battery lasts quite a while, too, but I bought an off-brand spare as well. There's quite a lot of juice in it, maybe enough for at least 30 exposures, so it's not essential to bring a spare.<br /><br />It's small enough to pop in a purse or camera bag, or suitcase, without taking up much space. The 'best' way to use it is for autographs. I like taking photos of/with celebrities, musicians, and hockey players (for example!) and having them sign the white bottom in Sharpie. It doesn't leave much space for any personalization or anything (or for long names!), but it's perfect for on-the-spot autographs. The only downside is waiting for the picture to turn out before getting it signed, or risking a blurry mess autographed.<br /><br />Every photographer should have one of these in their gear bags.","My husband got this for me for Christmas. I love it so much. It's much nicer looking than the classic Instax camera, and it has more features and a rechargeable battery. I'll be using this for years to come!","Love this camera. Brings back nestalga feeling. Got this camera in black and a brown case and it looks amazingly retro. Picture quality is good but don't expect perfect pictures.","Awesome camera! I love it! Dope features! Best instax! Good seller, everything as promised. Happy customer! :-) click click","Bigger then I tought but works great","I got this for my boyfriend as anniversary gift. And he absolutely adore it. It works like a charm","LOVED IT!!! I did tons of research before settling on this particular instant camera. The rechargeable battery was the key factor in my deciding on this particular model. The battery was charged right away and still has a full charge, two weeks and 40 pictures later, so it obviously has great battery life.  The look of the camera itself is a classic and timeless design, I didn't want it to look like a toy. The picture quality isn't great but it's the novelty of having instant pictures that makes this camera fun. Excuse the \"derpy\" faces of the children, they were having fun :)","Love it","Bought this as a gift for a friend - so much fun and easy to use!","A little overhyped, but still fun. I honestly think the instax mini 8, which my daughter has, takes a better picture. Settings on this one will need to be tweaked to darken exposure and brightness, as flash is way too powerful.","Got here promptly and the camera works great! I would recommend buying a lot of film, since it doesn't come with a package already. Been using it often and I love it!","Fun. Excellent.","I like the camera, it has a very cute kind of vintage look to it. Pretty easy to use, still working on all of the different modes. I was disappointed to find that there wasn't a black and white photo mode, as that was one of the main reasons I bought it. I read another review where she said she used the black and white mode and also had pics that she added to her review, yet... No black and white option on the camera. But besides that I guess I'm overall satisfied with the camera.","Did the research before I bought it. It arrived just as expected.","Happy to see this product delivered so fast and loved the camera.picture quality is amazing!!!","More features on it. But it is still plastic one. Very fragile tho.","I love this camera! its great for everyone. and has a very nice feel and look","I like the design of the Neo Classic; it doesn't make you look like an amateur photographer.","I've been wanting this camera for the longest. I finally got it and yeeeeeesss! I'm in love","Still on my first pack of film and trying to get just the right pictures.  It is fun, that's for sure.","It's amazing... I bought 2 extra battery packs just because I don't want to be out somewhere for the first time with it and run out of battery! I love this camera! ! just the right size. Looks big but its not really and its cute! I've taken it out to the beach and definitely use the dark mode on sunny bright days. They come out very light if you dont. Just see what u like best. Sometimes I like the lightness it gives it an older look.","This camera is so cool it comes with so many features . The look of the camera is very vintage but modern at the same time I'm happy it came with a U.S outlet .rhe one thing I have to say that sucked about this product was the lack of English in the manual but don't let that stop you from buying it Because they also have very good YouTube videos but over all it's a very good product","I absolutely love this camera. So good for parties","I absolutely love this camera! It has a vintage design that catches the eye, prints photos very clearly, and is extremely portable. This camera prints pictures for me, which makes my life so much easier; I immediately have photos that are ready to en displayed in my home or out in an album. I've also sent a few mini Polaroids to relatives, and everyone absolutely adores these little pieces of art :)<br /><br />Also, the brown rubbery/leather material serves a dual purpose of making the camera look aesthetically pleasing, as well as protecting it from scratches. I however, bought a case just to be safe , since this camera is an investment that I want to take care of.<br /><br />I did a ton of research before purchasing a Polaroid camera, and in my opinion this one is best by far. This camera does print tiny photos(size of a credit card); however, the quality of the photos is outstanding. I have a ton of regular size Polaroids from when I was younger, and the Other us lite of the pictures does not even compare!<br /><br />The two drawbacks are is that the film is a little pricey, and that the pictures do not save in a digital format ( but I think that makes it more fun).","Loved it, has some weight to it","My 15yo daughter loves it!","still getting the hang of it, and trying the different modes.. but I love it","Loved it but the dial does not turn but overall it's awesome!","Fun, sturdily made with a whole lot of options for your photographs. Has a grown up look unlike some of the other new Polaroid cameras. Great for parties. A little pricey, though.","great little camera!  bought in for my kids. They love it.  Film is a bit expensive (even with considering that you don t have to pay for processing) but overall pretty durable, a lot of fun for the kids. haven't had any issues with breakage. Has a lot of options with this model too. I bought this version as some of kids felt the other models were too \"kid-ish\".","I brought it as a gift and he loved it","My girlfriend loved this camera as her bday gift, works great, loved the quality!","It is a nice camera.I really liked it.Thank you very much.","Got this camera for my wife as a gift and it has not disappointed us. I was going to buy a different, cheaper instant camera, but this one feels very sturdy, and has the look of a \"real\" camera versus a plastic toy, so it's easier to pull out and snap a photo without looking ridiculous.  Photos are fine, though as with most instant cameras new and old, images taken from a distance feel very small. One negative is that the double exposure feature often ends up with the image just looking blown-out.  We need to mess with it a bit more to dial that in I guess - but hey, it's sort of amazing that it even has that feature!","Awesome!","I mostly bought this camera because I started to notice something: my family history basically stopped with the popularity of digital cameras. Sure we have digital photos somewhere but nobody wants to dig through old dusty hard drives to find them, worse yet those hard rives might be broken or corrupt!<br /><br />The camera is great! the photo quality is really nice and its an instant physical picture you can pop in the photo album or give to a friend. Some people complain about the cost of film but I think its very reasonable considering you don't have to get your pictures processed/printed (not to mention other instant films like impossible project Polaroid 600 is 25 for 8 shots eeesh).<br /><br />Also, the control of the camera is great! Macro, bulb, flash off and multi exposure being my favorites. (If fuji can just come up with a full manual instax i'll be in heaven but this does the trick for right now).","This camera is AMAZING! My boyfriend and i used it recently for our anniversary and it worked perfectly. We had so many compliments on it. I just love the look of it and it works great too! My favorite feature would have to be the timer for sure.","First ever ordering online so was a little scared to be scammed... However, all i can say is that the camera was properly packed n shipped quite fast! Nothing missing & the camera works perfectly fine! YAY","Amazing camera!!","I honestly love this camera. Very light and worth every penny. I was going to order this off of Urban Outfitters but they sold out so I went to check Amazon instead and I got it for like ten bucks cheaper.","Camera is very easy to use and the picture quality is simply OK. Nothing like the quality you get with a point & shoot for an extra hundred bucks. Just needed for a 50th birthday bash so. A bit disappointed.","Yes! The Fujifilm Instax Mini 90 Neo met my expectations.","Still learning all the cool features, but it takes great photos they develop in about a minute.","Amazing camera and fast delivery, bought it for my fiancé after she fell in love with it. Worth every penny and she love the camera","Seriously, one of my most prized purchases.  I did a lot of side by side comparisons before finally deciding to purchase this one.  The main seller for me aside from the design was the fact that the battery is rechargeable. And honestly, after using it for a year I haven't had to really fully charge it.  Granted, you don't use it all day, it's still a great investment.  It costs a little more but not having to buy and replace batteries is definitely a huge plus.  It works great, and there's even a self timer option.  With the shape of it, it's pretty easy to prop it on something to utilize that function.<br /><br />Definitely recommend to get this one! :)","Works great for the occasional times we've used it, photos definitely turn out nicer than the fuji instax 7s we have.  But nothing like the old Polaroids and the quality pics from those. Film is too expensive so we have to settle for these mini cameras and film. Too bad.","Got it for my gf for Christmas. Very cool gift.","I am a photographer and I bought this camera for my daughter who likes to take pictures also. This camera is great because I still shoot film sometimes and I have the ability to give her an idea of what is going on in my film camera. I find myself wanting to take more pictures with this camera than her.","Cutest thing ever! Very easy to use. Photo quality is awesome.","This thing is so much fun, I particularly like the double exposure setting. Love Love Love!","Came perfectly packaged. Exactly what I wanted!","Others give this camera good reviews.  I will too, although I had to send the camera back due to it being a duplicate gift for my granddaughter.  She had one already, so I sent it back.  I don't know, personally, how good this camera is.  But I don't want to give it a bad review, either.","I love the way it looks! It has a very vintage look to it and there are so many options on what to do. It is like a real digital camera with the options they have. The timing setting really helps me when I want to take family pictures or group pictures. The film for this camera is really cheap so I could take even more pictures.","Great fun camera! Easy to use","What a fun little piece of nostalgia. If not for the cost of film I would be popping photos all day long with this thing. Love the look.","Let me just say I own a few cameras because photography is my hobby, and dear to my heart. I got the one in black, at first I was very skeptical, seeing as I am buying a camera online worth more than $100+, and it didn't help that I looked at the reviews, which by the way didn't help my case because everyone knows the negative feed back stick out the most. So, I thought to myself, let's ignore that bit and buy it. I did! I wanted it for the New year, I received it the day of New Year's Eve which was the day promised! But I couldn't take any pictures with this camera because the film had not arrived which sucked, (they sell film at Walmart but they didn't have any, just my luck man.) I wasn't able to take any pictures with this camera for that day but I did with my Polaroid land camera sx70... Soon the filmed had arrived and I took pictures lots of them the first ten were those of just messing around trying to understand and figure out the camera itself... To say the least I am in awe, I highly recommend! Attached are those pictures of my pit-bulls and of myself without and with the black & white filter. x","Daughters Christmas gift and she loves it. She says it works perfect and had all the photos hung up in her room.<br />One thing I really like about it is how wide the pic may get. I took the same pic from my iphone as she did from this and she was able to capture so much more. Colors turn out great too. Easy to use and easy to replace film. Great for anyone.","It seems we never have any printed out photos anymore, everything is on your phone, tablet or computer.  The photos you take with this camera are a decent quality for an instant printout of a picture.  Great item for kids and adults, easy to use and lots of fun!!","Absolutely love taking photos with this camera. It has a variety of functions from macro to turning off the flash that most other cameras do not have. Just be sure to not insert the film sheets backwards! It took a minute for my fiance to realize he put them in the wrong way, but it was easily corrected. The quality of the photos are great as well. Being a 90's child. I felt a lot of nostalgia the first time I took a photo. I would recommend this to anyone for both the photo quality and the nice luxury feel of the camera.","Found a tiny bug inside the viewfinder. Very tiny and the edge. It's completely inside, doesn't move or anything. It's just really weird your eye that close while taking a pic.","So I'm a hipster, I like to eat vegetables and let everyone know about it, I also like to ride vintage bicycles and have a moustache, my taste in music is way too underground for all of you to even understand. I also make everyone uncomfortable since I don't wear Deodorant. the only thing I was missing was this camera! digital?! 5000 pictures?! naah I like my one dollar pictures that are blurry and vintage looking.<br /><br />This camera is great I'm not really a hipster but always wanted a polaroid camera its a bit expensive but I believe it captures the moment well, and since you know its about a dollar per shot you really become aware of what you are doing through the viewfinder.","I bought this for my 11 yr old daughter. She couldn't be happier.","Loved it","Fun little camera! Works great, looks retro.","good","I absolutely love my new Fujifilm Instax camera! I love how this model has the ability to do multiple exposures so I'll definitely be experimenting with this more int he future.","An amazing product. great build quality and great performance.","BEST INSTANT CAMERA OUT THERE :)","So disappointing that the person I gave it to, gave it back!","amazing camera, is literally BETTER than expected","I love the way my camera looks and the quality of photos is great.","I love my Fujifilm Instax Mini 90!  It's a FUN camera to have at gathering with family and friends. The additional settings that the camera has makes it extra sweet.","Nice camera, this was a Christmas gift. She loved it!","Since digital cameras, still film is dying every where you look. It's rare to find a place that sales and develops film. With that being said places that do sale and develop film is very pricey. Or if it isn't convenient you have to send it out! Another fee! Yikes! 2-3 payments. Very sad.<br /><br />Instant cameras are making a comeback.<br /><br />Recently my step daughter's boyfriend bought her a hello kitty instant camera for Christmas! Gorgeous model and I was elated. I did some searching and found the 90 neo Classic. Photographers dream with all the modes and combination of modes! Loves! I showed my best friend this link and he bought it for me! How amazing is that?<br /><br />I've had this camera for 3 days now. I've used every mode except landscape. It's been cold. My favorite setting for taking photos of people or selfies is on macro mode with the red eye on. Beware of party mode. It is blinding for the subject. Warn them before using party mode. Double exposure is extremely fun. Can't wait to take more of those. And bulb mode for me is by far my fave. Light painting on an instant film! Are you kidding me?! I'll definitely post more photos when I take them. Such a fun camera!<br /><br />This camera is definitely one to have. And a great gift for a budding or professional photographer!<br /><br />To give a background of what I have at hand: canon 5d mark iii, canon 7d, canon t50 (film), canon powershot sx260 hs, Sony dsc t500, GoPro hero 4 black, dji phantom professional, and now 90 neo Classic! I've used a Sony a7s which is brilliant and definitely want for low light! ISO is sick on that camera.","Great look and works great. Was a Christmas gift and he loved it!","I love this camera. I still own an old instant camera this is nice for quick pictures they are way smaller than the old day but still nice. Great pictures nice value.","gift","Good product, photo should be bigger","Great camera! Does the job, small photos but that's because of the small size of the camera!","Awesome","My teenage daughter loves it.","Great product","The Neo Classic is a great update to the regular Instax, not just in function, but also its sturdy vintage-inspired design.","Love it","Just loved it!!!!!","Bought this for my twenty yr old daughter and her fiancé. They love it. These pictures make great keepsakes. Looked at several models and brands. Glad I choose this one. Has more features than most.","Item as expected","Love it!!!","A gift for my girlfriend she loves it and uses it all the time","At first, this seems a little bulky for the size print it spits out, but it's lightweight an sturdy. It's a good trade-off between portability and usefulness. Has all the advanced functions we wanted, so it was worth the slightly higher price. Plus, it has that stylish, retro look. It was a big hit in the East African villages we visited. The little kids loved taking their new portraits back to their huts to show their parents.","My grandaughter loves this camera. She is having a great time taking pics.","An awesome little camera! I love it, the picture quality is excellent, although I haven't played with every available feature. The style of this Instant film camera is what really sold me on it. It has a lot of charming qualities to it.","Got this for my Daughter - She love it.  Great little instant camera and easy to use.  Images are sharp and offers options that other instant cameras don't.","Best Christmas gift ever!!!<br />Everyone loved it.<br />Great design!!","I bought as a christmas gift. we did a test. so far so good. Im excited of the possibilities","Very nice camera, if you like Polaroids this is a great fun camera, works very well and is super easy to use.","The actual camera doesn't seem to center; so you have to kind of view your subject and then move the camera a little.  Otherwise a fun camera.","Everyone loves tho device always getting compliments. Shoots amazing especially with the flash feature","Great camera ","This camera is amazing no problems I love it!!!!!!!! Get it it's worth the money!","Look so cute and I love it very much!!!! Quanlities of pictures is better than old one. And we'll packed xoxo. Lovve this","This was a gift and as far as I know my granddaughter loved it.","Love this camera. The nostalgia of a polaroid but does a lot for the price point. A little bit of a learning curve and film is a bit expensive, but there's something about physical pictures instead of digital.","nice for my college girl who like to take pics at the party:)","Great camera! Mostly a novelty, but still a lot of fun! Easy to use, clear instructions. Film is pricey, so take your pictures carefully. I am the mom in the family and it's my camera, but kids go crazy wanting to take pictures with this camera! I like it because it gets them off their damn iPhone.","Packaged and delivered as expected. Takes wonderful pics! Love it!","This is such a fun and stylish novelty camera. I originally got the Polaroid Snap and was really disappointed in the quality so I returned it and ordered this camera. I am so glad I did. The prints are great quality and the camera feels good in your hands. It's easy to use which we are thankful for since we want guests to use it at our upcoming wedding!<br /><br />Just a heads up:<br />Film is obviously expensive - about $1 per frame in stores, you can get it a little cheaper online.<br />The camera's manual is not in English, but I hear you can find the english version online.","Love it!!","great product awesome little pictures","Absolutely love this camera so much. Expect lots of trial and error when first using it. The extra function buttons are really nice. the camera itself is lightweight and not bad to carry around. The look of it is a lot nicer than the other fujifilm Polaroid cameras.","This camera is absolutely perfect! The pictures are smaller than the old polaroid cameras, but they are exactly what I was looking for yo decorate with!","Works perfectly","Cute camera but pictures too small should have bought bigger one.","I took it to the bar, yea I know what you are thinking, but everyone wanted to have their picture taken.  Of course all of the pictures were given to them, but they were amazed by it and how it worked.  It was pretty cool and they all appreciated the picture.  I wish the film was cheaper, but hey it's pretty cool anyway.  I love the camera.  I still have it and it still works.  No issues with it yet.","For the price should have decent instructions in English. It has great little book that comes with it but in Japanese. Trial and error now to use. Film ain't cheap","Best instant camera ever. It is better than any other instax I had. It doesn't weight much and really easy to use. Would recommend it to everyone","Fun camera! People love when I take their pic and give it to them. Easy to use, nice functions, solid build. Film is pricey but worth the reactions.","It showed up two days before they originally said which was GREAT! Took a few pictures with it and I absolutely love it. Wish it came with better instructions as to how to put the film in and everything but I figured it out. Read about the dreaded E message and I hope it doesn't come to that but will update if I get it","Great product. Works as advertised. The pictures have a timeless, slightly washed out look. Something about that makes people look good! Even crummy old snapshots somehow end up looking like masterpieces. Forget instagram filters; this is the real-deal. This isn't a serious camera for photographers. This is for entertainment and having fun with friends. Towards that end, it is a solid product.","Awesome! My fiancé loves this thing. Great for photo book creation and nice handy thing on the go. Hopefully it won't fade over time.","Got this for my wife, and she LOVES it! Great success! Pics are a little too small IMO but it is still really neat and fun.","THIS is what instant photography was always meant to be! The Instax film is superb and delivers reliable, predictable results that are beautiful and compare to normal film cameras. The mini size is small, but in a jewel-like way. The finished pix are literally small gems that make fantastic keepsakes.<br /><br />The camera has several easy to select modes that will deliver a good picture under all circumstances as long as you choose the right mode. Scenic, portrait, party, babies/dogs, and so on. The colors using flash are excellent. The red-eye reduction mode works well.<br /><br />The style, build quality and ergonomics are superb. This is a thoughtful design with easy to operate controls in both landscape AND portrait mode. The film loading could not be easier. Most people assume by the appearance that it is an expensive film camera. The fake leather looks rather good and feels nice too.<br /><br />Cost of pictures runs about 75 cents each if you buy film carefully on line or on special. It's always available somewhere, and especially at the biggest big box stores. I bought my unit at Amazon for $155. I think it is a good price for getting great pictures in the instances where instant photography shines. At any gathering, people LOVE getting these little photos as a momento of the day. Great fun. I have lots of cameras in both film and digital, and I do advanced photography. I know a good picture when I see it. These Fuji cameras make the old Polaroids feel utterly quaint.<br /><br />If you want instant photography that yields all keepers, and you like the small photo size, you can't go wrong with this camera.","My daughter loves it, I dont like it at all. We have 18Mpx digital one this just a toy for kids,hey if this is it what will make them happy get it...","My Daughter love it","A blast to use; great conversation piece at parties.","Camera has classy look but picture is tiny and color is muted.","I love this camera.  There are quite a few different settings that I have slowly been playing around with to learn what works best for what.  It's still taking some time to figure out, but I guess that's the fun of it all.<br /><br />I'm terrible with going to get photos printed, which is why I love having the ability to instantly capture a moment that you can't delete and retake.  That's what life should really be about!  I definitely think I want to get the larger camera too someday, just to have options as these photos are a bit small.","I bought this as a present for my boyfriend, and he loves it! The features on this camera are amazing, features such as double exposure (two pictures in one). There are more features compared to the regular fujifilm mini 8 camera. The modes are controlled in two ways, by the buttons on the back and turning the dial in the front of the camera. The best thing I love is the rechargeable battery, no more disposable batteries! The only thing I had a bit of a issue with was the position of the camera, you have to turn it by its sideways and it is at sometimes difficult/awkward to push the button on the front of the camera as seen in the picture(Even though there are two shutter buttons). Overall, and I am impress with the performance of this camera and the details it gives off on the film","I love this Instax. It works great in natural light and with the flash. I love the size and vintage look too. If you're looking for a instant type camera, this is a great one. It's a little pricier than the other fujifilm one, but I think it's worth it, with a few more options and more compact size.","I just got this camera and I love it. It's so much fun and you can play with the many settings to get awesome pictures. I was concerned about the size of the pictures but it is actually OK","Easy to use. Great for any age.<br />Only con about this is the charger. It has a 2 prong charger. You need to buy a universal converter.","Looks very cool and nice. I really like having it and i am very satisfied with the quality of the photo it creates. It is so nice to have this one. Great product.","works great!!","Amazing! love the color too!","Everything seems fine except the battery wall adapter isnt for the U.S region.","Coming really fast, but the charger is not working, the light has no response as plug in. The camera is good, coming with a low battery. Just so depress by the uncorking charger. And don't know how to connect with the seller. Wishing they can help to change one, I will be keep updating too.","Best instant camera I've ever used! LOVE IT!","I like the camera, came with everything in the description. However, the Plug Adapter for the charger was for a different region and I could not use the charger in a traditional USA outlet. I was disappointed because I feel the camera should be ready for use and there should've been an online description about the plug adapter, because even in the manual About the Battery it says, \"shape of adapter varies with region of sale\". But it was an easy fix by using a cord from another electronic device, which fit fine. The battery charges now and the camera is working fine so far.","Ordered for my daughter to replace an earlier model.  Love the vintage look of the camera, and it actually gets placed on a shelf with old cameras.  Love the new features with this update!","So easy to use and load!","Super light and stunning quality pictures.","I love this camera so much! The features are easy to use and the camera functions smoothly. A good investment!","everyone should have one!","I've had this for a few months now. As an adult,  I love the look of it. It doesn't make me look like I'm carrying around a kids toy. The camera has many features to it which is why I ended up purchasing it. I have more control over some of the images on how they turn out.  The double exposure feature is nice. Don't expect to wait too long to take the 2nd photo, your film will want to develop. It feels comfortable in my hands, comes with a strap. The front facing button is mirror like,  you can use it to see yourself when taking selfies. So no need to purchase the selfie attachment. You can easily change many different  modes and turn off/on the flash. You can bump up the brightness or dub it down if it's too bright.  Having 2 camera buttons is a huge plus! Shoot landscape or portrait.  Film is inexpensive when comparing to full sized polaroid film.  It's best to buy in bulk for film as it'll be cheaper. I recently bought Rilakkuma film.  I can't wait to use it.","so much better than the cheaper alternative! Pictures are far better quality and the flash actually works!","bought it as a gift and she loves it. the adjustable brightness setting is a huge plus for taking night shots.","In love with this camera! I Love with the vintage design. You will get so many compliments :) I definitely recommend it.","Awesome camera, works amazing. Cant wait to use it after my son is born.","I really like how it has many different settings. love the classic look. the other istax cameras look more juvenile. I had considered buying the other ones but justified the splurge b/c it looks nicer and has more settings. (In my opinion this one is worth the extra $$)<br />my favorite part is the self timer. this is what makes it superior to the other instax cameras.<br />I purchased may of 2014, used it a lot, and then may 2015 it stopped working. it wouldn't turn on. simple, replace/ recharge the battery, I thought. I had lost the charger so I ordered a new one, charged the battery, no luck. ordered a new battery, still no luck. not sure what else to do with it.<br />I should also mention it was pretty sturdy- I dropped it once on hardwood floor. I never had a case for it, I took it to the beach multiple times and I never had an issue with sand in the lens/ scratching lens, etc. maybe if I was a little more careful with it it would have lasted longer :/<br />long story short- had one wonderful year with it then it died.","so old school!  very cool!","Picture was black, camera I got was brown!","Love love love! Classic style with modern shooting options. A little bigger than it looks in the pics but not a real problem. This is my first instant camera and I've already been through 3 film cartridges just playing around!","Nice and easy to work!  The lens could be better though.","Bought this as a present for my sons love of his life. She loves it.  Nuff said. added the square trade plan to cover dropsies and all, great gift for the photo lovers.","I feel that the instax minis are underrated. The first one I bought was the instax mini 7s when I saw it at a department store. I used to love my old polaroid camera as kid, especially the version that had the tiny sticky film, that was my favorite. The instax mini 7s reminded me a lot of my old polaroid and it was fun to play with every now and then. But the instax mini 90 is everything that I wish my old polaroid could do without knowing it. I love that pictures are credit card size and all the different settings on the camera. This is the only way I would ever want to use actual film because it's fast and convenient. I also got 50 exposures for around 30 bucks. So film is pretty affordable. I've seen and heard about impossible film for polaroid, and there is no way I would spend 25 for 8 exposures. It seems like such a waste when the instax is much better and affordable.","More fun than I ever expected. I cool camera but don't expect too much. It's like they use to be. Lights never quite right.","Lots of retro fun","It's not the best but it's good enough in capturing the special moments you have with your family, friends and special someone.","Needed to do some experiments by taking a few pictures with different settings; to figure out when to use flash/brightness/darkness functions; while taking it indoor with minimal lights, outdoor at night at the backyard, etc. After that super easy to figure it out. Quite surprising when took pictures at the backyard at night, it only needed a single flash without an L (for more brightness), it was perfect and not too bright nor too dark. Very unique experience and fun! Glad with rechargeable battery. Very happy with this product.","Amazing Instax camera! I am in love with it. Very good looking. For me def worth the price over the Mini 8. I highly recommend buying with a product protection plan!!! I purchased 2 from another site that both had to be returned due to factory defects. I saw reviews of others having similar issues. With the higher cost of this camera I really felt like the protection plan was a must, esp after having issues with it and reading others experienced the same. I ended up buying from a store that had a good protection plan. Make sure to read the terms and reviews of the plan you go with, no 2 are the same!","Great camera, it had many setting that others don't have and it makes it very useful. I love that you can see the pictures right away, it's a lot of fun for parties. The film isn't too expensive either.","It's the great fujifilm instax mini! This little guy is awesome for those classic rustic photos you want. Much hipster. Much capture. Much moment. Pst... get it here... it's a good price on Amazon.","Gave as a present, really good features","Got this camera as a gift to myself a year ago & it's my first polaroid camera. I've done a lot of research regarding this, and I can say that it's worth every cent and every shot. Definitely a user friendly polaroid camera, esp for beginners and the additional features are very useful on different settings, just read the manual so you can learn how to adjust the lighting, darkness, etc. I've probably used this more than a couple of times, especially on special occasions. I also love the timeless classic look and I've received plenty of compliments on it.<br /><br />The camera came in with a box, a manual, a strap, battery & the charger. I'm not sure if it came with a free film, as I've purchased this over a year ago. But if you want to save a few dollars, get the twin pack & purchase more rather than purchasing individual sets. I'm in love with this camera, though it is a little heavy (just a tad bit, but not more than a regular digital camera) & takes up space in your handbag, it's definitely worth it!<br /><br />The camera looks like it has plenty of scratches, but that's actually the protective case that I bought separately here in amazon. Good purchase too! It makes my polaroid camera safe from scratches and dents.","This camera is so much fun to use!! It's got a gorgeous retro look and it came with a shoulder strap. I think I calculated average cost per picture at around $1.<br /><br />The pictures come out smaller than a Polaroid or most other instant cameras but it works great for my purposes.","wife loves it, haven't explored all the modes yet","I LOVE MY CAMERA! It look sleek and the timer for taking pictures is great. It was a bit expensive but I love it.","Great little camera!  Have captured lots of fun memories!  My only critique is the dynamic range and it has trouble exposing correctly.","old school, super cool","Everyone loves it!  Its extremely fun.  Film is expensive, but it loads easily and works just fine.  Great for parties.","Two thumbs up. Only con is that I KEEP RUNNING OUT OF FILM BECAUSE I USE IT ALL THE TIME...maybe too much but my friends aren't complaining yet.","Great way to take pictures and very fun. Some many features to use. The battery life is great too. Overall just great. Lol","I love it so much!","Bought this camera for my 14 year old she loves it!!!!!! Fast shipping too","My favorite instax camera.  I love the Double Exposure, the macro mode, and the easy of use.  IT is also quite a conversation starter and makes taking photos at parties easier.  I love this camera, and the Instax lineup.  The film is inexpensive compared to polaroid at the moment, and it is reliable on auto exposure.  Keep your memories alive, and get one of these now!  It does have a high price tag, but it is worth it.  I don't even care that it is not digital - It is printed, tangible, and lovely. Forget about your memory storage of forgotten photos on your cell phone and start using one of these today.","I love this new Mini Instax film since it's not too bulky like the previous version plus there are extra shooting modes like bulb mode and double exposure which are fun to experiment with. I also love the retro/ vintage look of the item.","My girlfriend bought this camera just before our trip to Mexico and she has had a blast with it ever since. She very much enjoys the fact that these pictures are hers and hers alone. A rare thing in this digital age.","It's aight","I bought this for my daughter for Christmas (man this review is late!) I decided to buy this one and not the smaller, cuter Polaroid brand one because the reviews were great for picture quality and I have to agree. Someone I know has the smaller Polaroid and even though they are cute the quality is apparent. This one is big but it takes great pictures and even though it looks heavy, it really isn't. My daughter throws it in her purse and still has room for her phone, wallet and baby lips. Overall, great buy.","i love this little camera. i like that it has a timer and different features/modes. film is fairly inexpensive as well, great for fun trips and parties.","Awesome camera! Love the different settings you can use.","In love w it??","gift to teen I thought they'd be into it more but know they can use the small printer and take pics with their phones fix them then print them, as the film is pricey. fun.","Wow Wow!! I am absolutely in love with this camera.","Very nice. My sister loves it:)","Rad. Easy to use and super fun. Would definitely recommend!","Met our expectations, makes nice little pictures for hipsters needs.<br />Thumbs up","i had the instax mini 8 and was fed up with the over or under exposure that happened too much! this one enables much more control on how the photo turns out! love learning all the cool functions and modes!","Got this product for my 12 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!!!! Highly recommend this product!!","This is the best camera ever! I love it so much! I would defiantly recommend getting this Instax camera over the other instant cameras because of all the features it has. There are multiple modes for multiple situations that you might encounter, its not just point and shoot like the others.","I am having a blast with this little camera.  The photos are small but they are tons of fun.  I like the double-exposure feature for creative special effects. (Note-there is trial and error involved in that! But it's fun and works). Great colors in the prints","Really expensive to use, but totally worth it","This product is AMAZEBALLS<br />The camera (when ordered with Amazon prime 2 day shipping) came right on time.<br />I was hesitant to purchase this camera never having owned an instax before but the price was right (beats the $200 you'd spend at Urban Outfitters). And let me tell you this was one of the greatest purchases I've made on Amazon.<br />I will be honest the camera is a little bigger than I expected (about the face size of the iPhone 6 and about an inch and a half thick) but it's is still small enough to fit into a small bag or clutch. It's definitely not as bulky (or as colorful) as the instax mini 8.<br />The film is about the size of a business card but the image comes out really good (crisp, clear, vibrant) for what this camera is.<br />The camera looks (and has proven) to be well built even though it is made of plastic and its design has a vintage feel to it.<br />The shoulder strap is a great addition and is perfect for when I'd rather carry it cross body and not carry a purse around.<br />This camera features several different modes as well like double exposure which is a lot of fun to mess around with. Another plus of this camera when compared to the instax mini 8 is that you can turn the flash off. I absolutely love that this camera comes with a rechargeable battery, it was one of the main reasons I decided to spend the little extra money on this camera versus the fujifulm instax mini 8.<br />I bought this camera mainly so I could document my senior year and all the big events I have coming this year and this past sumner. Everywhere I take this camera I get plenty of ooo's and ahhh's and it is a great conversation starter.  People are so perplexed by the idea of instant cameras lol!!<br />The fact that these cameras only give you one shot to get the right shot is what intrigued me the most and I definitely enjoy the hit or miss (even though the film is a bit pricey). Be prepared to use a pack or two of film when figuring out the settings and lighting!<br />But once you get used to the feel of the camera and its settings, it's instant gratification pretty much every time.<br />10/10 would recommend","So cool and very amazing camera,I love it sososo much and take many beautiful photos to my friends","I have such a great fun with this camera!<br />Everyone just loves it!","Such a conversation starter even if I'm just wearing it.","LOVE this camera.  Definitely a much-used addition to my camera \"arsenal.\"","this camera has exceeded my expectations. good quality  photos, easy to operate. however, it would be better to print an owners manual  in booklet form and  not individual  sheets. also, their is no need to include a booklet in  Japanese as  I am  not proficient in the  language and serves no purpose for north American users.","I love this funky camera. It takes flattering photos of people with its slightly soft focus and vintage tint.","My 17 year old daughter loves the features & smaller size of this camera.  Great gift!","Bought for my sisters birthday/moving away present! She loves it!","grandaughter loves the camera, especially the double exposure...........","Great purchase if you're looking for a Polaroid style camera with a vintage look. I love mine!","Perfect! The camera works great, the pictures come our great. Mirrors can cause cracks in photos with the flash on. I wish the film was a little cheaper (and I went through it slower) but the camera itself is perfect.","Take nice pictures... great camera!","i was so excited for this camera, what a let down. Not worth the extra money, even with the added features it does not compare to even a regular cheap digital camera. I wish I bought the mini 8 instead because for the money you really don't get much more, especially in quality of photo.","SHE LOVES IT.","I bought this on impulse because we had an old Fujifilm just like this. The manual really helped because I was confused otherwise.","Love this instax! Great for nostalgia and so much fun with family and friends! The pics are small, but crisper than than the instax 210. We own both cameras and love them equally! Would suggest to anyone looking for nostalgia & fun!","When you grab it in your hand you understand that it is a THING!","I love the size because it's not bulky at all and lightweight. The double exposure feature is fun as well and the two shutter buttons are convenient. The only problem for me is the size of the film. The battery life is great too.","Love this camera! I stocked up on 7 packs of film and already used them. I recommend purchasing one or two packs to test and get used to the camera and it's settings.","I bought this as a birthday present for my wife and now I want one for myself!  There's something so satisfying about having physical copies, even if they're tiny little credit card sized memories.","Echoing the positive reviews here! I have a mirrorless (compact D-SLR) camera that I love as well.<br /><br />But for parties, special events, weddings, or any place with friends and people you like, this camera creates fun memories that you can take with you, tape to your car dashboard, use washi tape to stick on your bedroom walls, put in your wallet, etc.<br /><br />As others mention, this is basically the most premier instax camera there is. The \"party\" mode is useful in dark rooms to light up the background; you can actually turn off the flash if you want; there are long-exposure and double-exposure modes; instead of AA's you get a rechargerable battery; there is a tripod mount on the bottom of the camera; there are 2 shutter release buttons, so the front silver button doubles as a mirror to take selfies!<br /><br />OH! There is a \"Macro mode\" (flower icon) - but I found that you can use this mode to get some pretty decent bokeh (shallow depth of field)! Here's how: The \"macro\" mode range of focus is actually up to around 3 feet - so you can actually shoot portraits of people and have pretty good bokeh behind them! But for this specific use, it's best if you use a tripod, and are outdoors with lots of light, but not too harsh light. (This camera does worst in very dark light (faces look really bright and washed out, and background is pitch black) and best outdoors. But in extremely bright direct light everything looks almost white as well... oh well its still a ton of fun to play with!)","Fantastic little instant camera and the film is very reliable.","Fun to use, pictures are surprisingly good. Battery lasts 10 film packs, which is great.","I love this camera because it's quirky and unique. It's hard to adjust to though -I've had it for about half a year and I'm still learning its settings and what lighting is best to shoot in and such. I took this on a trip to DC and took outdoor photos on overcast days and many of the photos turned out darker than I would have liked, with the subject (usually landmarks), showing up shadowed. Vibrant colors like greens and plants show up well on this camera as well as blue waters/ skies. The double exposure feature is fun too. The camera and the photos have a nice vintage feel. Personally, I prefer the size of the impossible film from Polaroid but I do think that Fujifilm Instax provides an updated take on instant photos with new technology, allowing for more vibrant photos.<br /><br />Photos below are shown in double exposure, bulb mode, and I think auto with the flash off. I believe the bulb is a 10 second shutter.","This camera is adorable. I get compliments on it wherever I go. Film is expensive, but makes it that much more special. This color, in particular, looks especially stylish with the camera design. I highly suggest taking a few practice pictures before you use it for a big event or something similar, as there is a learning curve with this camera, but nothing too significant.","Such a cool camera. Still learning all of the settings, but it is just so awesome. And everyone is jealous, and wants their picture. Haha.","This camera is great if you know what you are buying. It's old tech, but in a great way. It's basically a smaller polaroid. That is exactly what I wanted. Please read about the pros and cons of polaroid photography before you buy it.","This camera is cheaper then in stores. It brings back memories of not having to develop pictures.","Bought this for my wife's birthday. She loved it! Definitely recommend it.","Perfect for making instant tangible memories. We never get around to printing out pictures from our camera or cell phones so with the instax we just point shoot and get our pictures. It goes into our album and that's that. We have a whole album filled with our little family that include myself, fiancée and our one year old first child. Camera came in perfect condition and on time as well. We've had it since Christmas of 2014 and haven't had any problems with it. The battery lasts a long time as well , probably only charged it 3 times since we've had it .","Best Instax camera I've had out of three of them! Highly recommended. If there was a medium format one I would buy that. The tiny pictures are fun, but with this cameras quality (and the double exposure effects) I would love to see it on a larger format.","Definitely worth every penny. The different modes are easy to use and straight forward. It's easy to load film, the battery it comes with holds a charge for a really long time, and the strap is comfortable. I really enjoy it, not knowing how your picture will come out reminds me of disposable cameras back in the day, but the anticipation is way shorter because the film develops in minutes. The film is about credit card sized, which is really cute and fun. If you want to take a selfie, the power button is reflective and gives a good enough idea on how you look!","Love it","Was a big hit at our Wedding.  The camera was set out with a scrap book for people to take selfies and put them in the scrapbook with comments.","Looooove it","Great instant camera! Bought this for my God Daughter and she loves it! I checked Fujifilm's web site and this retro model has better specs than their other instant cameras that take the same film size. It is well worth the few extra bucks more for this model over the others in my opinion. I might buy one for myself as it reminds me of the old days when I had an instant camera. Also,  it is really COOL looking in brown as it adds to the retro look! Nicely made!  I DID NOT GET THIS PRODUCT FREE OR AT A DISCOUNT IN RETURN FOR A REVIEW","Unfortunately, mine stopped working after a few months, but while I had it it was great to me. I recommend if you're not afraid of a breakdown.","My husband bought this for me as a Christmas gift. I love it! I have never tried the other modes, but just the regular with and without flash shots work fine for me. He likes the retro look of this over the more plastic looking cameras. He also purchased a case to protect the camera.<br /><br />In case you are interested, I bought an album to keep all my Polaroids in. You can see it under my reviews (I highly recommend the album as well)","Love the design of this polaroid so much - all the different functions can be really fun to use. The double exposure feature is definitely something I find myself using a lot!","Great quality built. Great photos. Great camera. Great Price.","Malfunctioned once during an important event but has worked well since.<br />Looks more plastic-y in person.","It has very good features and it works well, but it takes a bit o getting used to. You will probably use a whole pack of film before you can start to take good pictures consistently.","I had just gotten this camera, but was missing some parts. To my shock I was able to talk to a real person to tell them about it.<br />  And the next day I had my new replacement. What a wonderful company.<br />  Thank you so very much  Nikkie Spring","Every time I show this to someone who hasn't seen it before, they think it's the coolest thing they've ever seen! I've been into digital photography for about ten years, but I had always wanted an instant camera. I've had this one for a little over a year and the excitement still hasn't worn off. This is probably one of the best purchases I have ever made! Unlike the 7S, you can actually turn the flash off on this one when necessary. The button on the front also doubles as a mirror to help take photos with your friends (I refuse to use the word \"selfie\"). It just took me a few tries to figure out that if you are going to take a selfie (that didn't last long), it's best to use Macro mode.<br /><br />\"This is so cool!\"  \"You can hold this little print in your hand!\"  \"I haven't seen one of these in a while.\"  \"Most of my photos are stuck in my phone.\"","love it","Very fun little camera.  Not always the best picture quality, but pretty good for an instant camera.","Fun camera! Good pics!!","Great product, and delivered in a timely manner.<br /><br />A friend of mine had this camera (the black version) at her wedding reception for guests to take pictures for the bride and groom. It was a great idea and they ended up with tons of fun pictures.<br /><br />The camera comes with a few settings including double exposure. More than your average instant camera.<br /> I can't wait to start using mine!","I LOVE this little camera.  The film is pricey, but don't use it enough to worry about it.","I had (have) the original white Fuji Instax Mini camera and I loved it. This is like 100,000x better. It's smaller and more compact so I can throw it in my purse (fits in a Michael Kors clutch I'm using for a friend's wedding!) and just go. The features on it are so so so cool. I love the double exposure, it comes out awesome. You just put it on double exposure mode, press the shutter, find your second picture location, press the button again and the picture comes out. SO COOL. The lighter/darker function really helps on cloudy/sunny days as well. Seriously the best purchase I've made in a while. I took like 60 pictures last weekend with a friend while I was showing her NYC. The strap is also awesome, if I ran out of room in my purse I could just sling it over my shoulder/across my body and boom, good to go, I wouldn't put it around my neck though, not safe. Truly a fabulous product. I've been an instant picture fan since I was a kid. I have a multitude of polaroids and polaroid cameras but the film is simply too expensive these days (8 shots for $25, ridiculous), this takes amazing shots and the film is pretty cheap. This is much better than the generic instax mini, if you're debating between the two, get this one, it looks cooler, has more functions, is easier to carry/smaller and is worth the little bit of extra money.","Freakn the coolest thing I've  ever bought. Definitely worth the money and prints out the cutest little prints. Also the double exposure feature is really cool, still figuring it out tho. Great investment.","I love my new mini 90 camera! Great way to capture memories. Old school feel to it. I look over reviews before buying between the mini 8 or 90, and it's definitely worth spending the extra few bucks on the 90 for the additional features it includes. only thing that I have a problem with is,of course it's not a digital camera.... So having to try and choose the \"right\" setting to take a good picture is a little difficult. I still need to learn how to use the camera a little more. But other then that, it's a lot of fun.","I love this little camera! It's the perfect size and very easy to carry around. It has the weight of a regular digital camera, about the same as the instax mini 8, but feels more sturdy and durable. My photos come out a lot clearer compared to the instax mini 8 as well. The strap that comes with the camera is a little stiff though and seems to get in my way when taking a photo. But that is an easy fix by replacing the strap with a different one. Overall, I love this camera and would definitely recommend it to anyone.","Love it! Im now using the second pack of sheets and is working perfectly.<br />Love the photos!","love it..and all the young kids think it's incredible.","Bought for my girlfriend and has been taking \"cute pix\" since.","Absolutely in love with this camera! Super easy to use, takes cool photos, more features than the instax 8. Decent price as well!","Great product.","I need to fix it, it flashes E but I have no Idea who to call","Used it at a wedding in place of a photo-booth, and it was a HIT. Everyone loved taking their pictures. I let them take one to take, and one to put on a photo board. Kids are fascinated by film coming out of a camera and not just being on a screen.","Sometimes tricky to get good pics","AWSOME love this camara takes really nice pictures..","Great camera, the perfect size for an instant camera and it works exactly as it should. Highly recommend","My camera came broken. The flash part was crack. I don't now know if the flash being crack will mess up my photos.  But over all I really and excited to take photos with me new camera.","Amazing! Takes great shots even if there is a lot of sun exposure. It also takes double exposed pictures and light exposures. The film itself is very small, but it is still good for someone with a creative mind who likes to document pictures. This camera is good for anyone! It comes with a strap to carry around the camera, a battery, and charger. The only thing needed is the film. Get the camera!","I love my fujifilm instax mini 90! The only thing is that the film is pretty pricy.","I love this camera!!! It's so much fun! Anyone, young and old can use it. Very easy to operate.","A beautiful, fun, and functional camera that you will love. It takes great pictures and gives the user a good amount of control over settings. Solidly built to last. If you are going to buy an Instax Mini camera (and you should), then spend the extra money to get this one...it's well worth it.","Love my camera!","So far I really love this camera. The only complaint I have is the fact that I was sent the wrong type of charger in the package. I was sent the European type of charger hence I am unable to recharge the battery right away because the charger won't fit the outlet. That was a sad disappointment. But overall it's a great camera and fast delivery.","This was a present for my daughter who traveled to China.<br />She enjoyed using it and it took great pictures.","Super cute. Makes small Polaroid type pix in the quality you would expect. Even when people say its not a real camera, bla bla bla, they are happy to get the real picture.  To date, I've never crossed paths with someone else with this camera, let alone a brown one.<br />Be careful turning it off though--I have some accidental pix of my forehead.","Nice Camera, crisp colors and image...","I love this thing! Get one! It has a lot of features. The only tricky thing is getting used to adjusting the lighting properly and how to aim for a selfie which just took a bit of getting used to. Well worth the $$$. Just get one!","Used this for more than 3 months. No complaints. Great picture. No problems with battery. I will definitely recommend this to my friends.","Nice product, instant pics. Just know this is a bit bigger than the colored models but it comes with a re-chargable battery and lloks quite the professional camera.","Love.","I absolutely love this camera- from the classic look, to all of the different settings it has that a normal Polaroid doesn't have, to even the texture of the black part of the camera (it has a good grip). This Fujifilm version of the classic Polaroid surpasses any Polaroid I've ever used. I've taken so many amazing photos with it because of how diverse the settings are- action shots (for the crazy kids, pets and sports), scenery (it focuses on everything in the frame so you can capture the full beauty of a scene), double exposure (my personal favorite- you take a photo of one thing and then take another photo of something else and it overlaps the two photos! You can get some pretty creative shots with that setting), then there's also the up to 10 second exposures (it works practically just like the double exposure except it's capturing all movement as long as you're holding down the button for up to those ten seconds). There are more settings than the ones I listed, but that’s what they make a description for, right?<br /><br />Aside from how much I love this camera, as a fair warning I just want to say you can only expect so much from the quality. Don't get me wrong, the photos look great! But as far as it goes for things like the 10 second exposures and such- you can't expect to take the camera out on a clear night and get a long exposure of the stars. You might get like one slight dot or so that shows up on your photo.<br /><br />Taking Polaroid photos is an art form and like any art form it takes time and trial/error to master. There will be times where you take a photo and the lighting isn’t right or you use a setting that just is not compatible with the type of photo you’re trying to take and the photo will come out just completely black or white or blurry. When that happens its frustrating (film for these cameras is almost $1 a photo), but you learn from your mistakes and figure out what works and what doesn’t.<br /><br />**So my recommendation is that if you are just buying this camera to take photos with your friends and mess around with once in a while, just don’t. This is one of the best Polaroids money can buy and you don’t need to spend this much to take simple photos like that. If that is the case, look at the cheaper versions that have the original settings. The photos will turn out just as good, just without all the extra settings. The film is already expensive enough as it is, so don’t waste your money on something you’re not going to use.<br /><br />BUT if you are into film, I HIGHLY recommend this camera. I have 5 cameras now, and I have to say this is one of my favorites. It can be an expensive hobby, but it’s definitely an extremely fulfilling one. I haven’t had a single issue with this camera as far as mechanics go and such, and the battery life is great! So if you’re in the market for a Polaroid –style camera, this Fujifilm should be high on your list of considerations.<br />Hope my review was helpful and worth the read! :)","My Daughter is so happy to have it. and it looked very nice too.","Bought it as a gift and she loves it. Many options to choose from I have not used them all yet but its a very good camera. What else can I say. Photo cartridges are a bit expensive.","Fancy Fancy. Love this camera.","This silly little camera is a total blast! I got this for our Christmas party and everyone loves having a souvenir, and the novelty is great.","Perfection!","The best instax by far. So manly unlike the other models. but still films are so expensive","Got it on time and the camera is fun! its a pretty cool gadget","I love it!!! Best instant camera ever!","I love taking quick pictures with this camera. Worth every penny.","Absolutely LOVE this camera! Best instant photos I've seen.","Great pics, fun for parties and a classic gift","The modern scene is rather devoid of instant cameras, which is a little sad - there are few things as fun as generating a photograph within minutes of clicking the shutter, passing it around to friends, and tucking it away with all of those memories intact. Fuji's Instax film came out and offered a lot of that again, but hitherto the cameras it's been offered with have been pretty lackluster. Most of the models Fuji has put out are definitely bottom dollar, and look like toys, giving the impression that instant photography isn't for serious or mature individuals. The Mini 90 busts that image with nice craftsmanship and a good assortment of features. I bought it for my wife, and we both enjoy using it a lot. The body is still plastic, but it has a high quality finish and a nice rubberized wrap. There's a decent feature-set, including macro and double exposure, though with instant film you're not going to be doing a lot of fancy work. It's a fairly forgiving film that is designed for a wide exposure latitude and tuned for automatic exposure cameras. It does struggle a little in very low light, where the flash can give the photo an unnatural color, but this is quite often the case with non-manual films.<br /><br />To be fully enjoyed, you should keep in mind what this camera is, and what it is not. The film is small, business-card-size, so the resulting images will be pleasing, fun, and a great way to store memories, but not fit for digitally scanning or entering into contests (this should be a given). The optical quality of the camera is limited, being designed for the format and definitely not for overkill. Depth of field is fairly deep, so don't expect really strong subject isolation (rumor is Mint Camera is coming out with an honest-to-goodness Instax Mini TLR with a large maximum aperture, so if you want that sort of thing, wait for that). But in spite of all, and price included in account, this is still a blast and highly recommended.","An awesome little camera that is just great fun to \"play\" with.<br /><br />It takes OK shots, they are not super sharp but that adds to the originality of the camera. But the best bit is the look of delight/confusion when you take a photo and out pops a real photo....that develops before the subjects eye...Fantastic!<br /><br />Great for fun and keepsakes photo for your friends wallets and makes for smiles all around.","Bought as a birthday gift for my girlfriend. We took a lot of great photos with it during our trip to California. The Instax Mini 90 looks well made, with a retro feel to it. Haven't have a chance to try the advance features yet, but it's definitely a good instant camera! Recommended!","Oh I love my camera! Best investment ever. Needs some time to get used to it and maybe a few waster polaroids, but its worth it.","I really loved this. Very easy to use and handy for special occations","Shipping was really fast and the camera is excellent. The pictures are the perfect size to keep or give out. watch out on the warranty they try to sell after purchase, I selected yes for a $25 insurance but when I called to check what was covered it was only $30 worth of coverage? Camera is awesome though","I have so much fun with this camera. It had captured so many memories that I can use as gifts to my friends. Def. a good purchase!","I love it! It is more nice than the mini 8 . Also this camera has nice features like double exposures and others settings. You gonna love it","My daughter loved her birthday gift","Good","bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday present and he loved it :) theres a setting where you can take double photos onto one polaroid and its so fun!","The camera feels amazing, i know it's plastic but is really well made. Little tricky for those who are not familiar with cameras and how to properly use the functions, but once you learn how to control them, is super fun to have it around.","I bought this for my brthday and my charger and the bat is not working??? How can i return this back ","My baby. Wish I could find film in stores rather than wait for them to come through the mail, but the camera itself is AMAZING. Bought it about two years ago and still going strong.","Pricy for the quality of photos and the film is expensive. Good for novelty and thats about it","Love the camera! Comes with a strap. the faux brown leather looks cool-- the photos come out beautifully, and all of the different modes are fantastic for experimenting and taking creative shots. I also love that the battery is rechargeable. On my camera, though, could just be on instance, but the mode wheel on the lens in front has no function even though it moves. Also, watch out when shooting in Macro, often the image you see in the view finder doesn't perfectly sync up with what the lens is going to capture!","Fantastic product and very easy/fun to use. I can't wait to bring it along to future weddings.","Love this camera!! Used it on vacation and got some great shots!","been having so much fun with it. Love the camera","All I gotta say is you must buy it & start taking pictures!!! A total MUST BUY!!!!!","Excellent camera. Looks better than the colorful version of the Instax Mini, and you have more control over how you photograph. PLUS, it comes with a rechargeable battery that you charge in an outlet, as well as a strap so that you can hang it around your neck or shoulder. Chic design, maybe even vintage-looking?","Like it but gave it to my niece.","The Instax Mini 90 is a fun camera which elicits smiles from all who see it and have their picture taken. It should not be thought of as a replacement for a digital camera or phone camera. Within the limits of the device, it is great for capturing quick shots of family and friends, taking pictures at parties, and experimenting with double exposure (DE). Yes, the Mini 90 has a function to allow DE. There are also functions  for lighten and darken scenes ( I usually set it to darker as the flash tends to wash out facial features), flash on-off, and other functions.<br /><br />Construction seem sturdy but I haven't had it long enough to comment on how the camera holds up in long-term use<br /><br />I recently used it at a 2-year old's birthday party. All adults were more than willing to pose and when I gave them the picture, they couldn't believe this technology was back. It did not replace the use of phones and digital cameras, but for getting snapshots of kids and parents, it did the trick.<br /><br />Now the issues; pictures are small.  This is a function of the film cartridge and the size of the camera. There is a step up camera which uses larger film but the camera is also larger. I prefer the smaller size. Film is pricey. Check film cost before purchasing the camera. Price for film fluctuates.<br /><br />Bottom Line - use this camera for parties and family/friend get togethers. Use your digital camera (or phone) for other functions.","i love this model. but I think that Mini 50s is also a good buy. Its cheaper with the same photo quality","This is by far the best instant camera going. The double & long exposures give creative people lots of options, yet my friend's children, aged 3 through 9, all could operate the camera and produce excellent images. The included rechargable battery lasts for 15 - 20 PACKS of film which is amazing. And you will go through a large amount of film as you learn how to use, so be prepared. I highly recommend watching some of the tutorials on YouTube so you can be more familiar with the controls before you start shooting $1-a-pop pictures. This is a camera serious enough for experienced photographers who need an instant they can fiddle with, or it can be given to beginners who may want to step up their game someday. The surprise to me is how excited people get about tangible photos, making this an excellent party piece with some social capital.","This camera is great for anyone looking to step away from the digital world and get an actual picture back in their hand. The<br />Fujifilm Instax Mini 90 Neo Classic has a great retro look but there are also other options you are looking for something more sleek and modern. The camera does take small instant pictures just like your old Polaroid. Your only option are the small pictures 46(W) x 62(H) mm but these are great for scrap booking for just to give to friends to remember your experiences. The camera has several different modes and a flash to allow you to enhance and customize the pictures. The quality of the pictures is great and you'll really enjoy this camera. It's a bit bulky to carry around with you as we are all used to the small digital cameras or just using your phone so that is an adjustment. The other disappointing part is the film cassette only holds 10 pictures so you'll have to carry several refills with you if you are planning on taking a lot of pictures.","LOVE. that is all the review you need. If you're even thinking about it, just splurge and buy it. You won't be disappointed. Especially if you have any Fuji instax version created before this one, you will LOVE the upgrades it has come with!","Nice works well","i love this camera. it's a hit at all events and the pictures are really cute and fun","Nostalgia. I HATE STORING PHOTOS IN THE CLOUD. This helps you slow down and think about your shot. Film is about a buck per photo.","I received this camera for Christmas and it was all I ever dreamed of. Takes great pictures and has a lot of features","This camera is SO much fun.  I highly recommend it.  Especially if you are in the market for a unique, kitschy styled camera.  The film is roughly 80 cents per picture, but its so worth it.","This is so much fun!!  It looks antique but puts out amazing and fun photos.","I'm in love with my camera! It said two day shipping but I got it the next day so I'm super happy with everything.","I absolutely love it and cant wait to take it on my crazy adventures :)","This is pretty awesome. Prints those mini instant film pictures. Looks like the polaroids we're all used to. Works perfectly. No gripes. Just pretty cool.","awesome little camera. If you're looking for that retro instant camera this is a good one.","Great Product, amazon was very helpful in making sure it is everything i wanted.","Great camera.. fun for everyone.. made many new friends with it.. used it for our wedding and for vacations post wedding :)","Super cool. Love the size of the pictures. Easy operation.","It's a cute camera... Function is powerful... But the viewfinder is sooooo off that u wont get anything in the pic if you go off the viewfinder... So it's pointless to have that there other than for the look... Overall it's a fun camera to have","I love my camera. It is very easy to use,chic, and fun to take pictures. I get so many compliments on my camera. And I love being able to capture  memories I can truly hold on to!","Bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it! Plays around and uses the double image capability. Not sure the exact name for that...sorry!","fun to use, nice pictures","Gotta be best instant camera out right now.  Not much to say great looking product and pictures come out great along with easy to use.  I can tell you instant photo's are a hit since the bottom line is that you don't see them around that much.","Awesome camera takes great pictures has a timer so you can do group photos and other cool settings has a flash totally love it!","Great camera, easy to use and small","I love my camera!","Gift for my son he loves it. sp far has stood up to the bumps and drops of a toddler.","fast delivery & amazing","Coolest little Polaroid camera I have, it's awesome and portable.","gf loves it","This camera is really amazing. I've owned the Instax Mini 8, but since I've got the Mini 90, I haven't even picked up the Mini 8... It takes great pictures. I've owned this product for almost a year, and I haven't had any problems with daily use. I get many compliments and questions from others when they see me use it. It's definitely worth the money with all the functions it has compared to the other Instaxs. The best part about this camera is... *drum rolls please* the battery is rechargeable so you don't have to buy batteries. The battery lasts pretty long with just one full charge. I just purchased another one for my best friend's birthday since she loves my camera. Great buy for those who are into photography, or looking for a gift.","Great quality camera, perfect for a 12yr old and all her friends!","A great fun little camera to have.  People are shocked when the see it but big smiles abound when they realize it's a polaroid.  Fun to shoot partied and events with.  Also fun to take around the town for a fun night out.  Easy to use, load, and play with!","Perfect, love it, thank you!","This was worth every penny. I use it every single day and will continue to do so for years.","The best camera instax ever!","Lets face it, these cameras are simply a novelty. This one is way overpriced IMO but selection for this sort of thing is limited. The film is expensive and the quality of the photographs is poor especially in lower light settings. Given all the cons my teenage daughter and her friends have had a blast with this decades old technology. Its an expensive toy and I'm sure the novelty will where off quickly but if you know that going in you can still have a little fun with it.","My grandaughter loves it.","I've had my Fuji since last summer and I still love it. I only use it on special occasions really so it's always nice to bring this out and hand out the prints like nice favors. I still have yet to master all the settings but it's a fun learning process.","No complaints","Amazing","Got this for my girlfriend as a christmas present. We both love it. It's so refreshing to get an actual photo to hold after so many years of cell phone pictures.","good","Very good camera! Fun for pictures with friends and landscapes! The film is a bit on the price-e side, but if you will use it enough and have a good time with other people with it, it's worth it! Obviously you can't see what the pictures will look like and sometimes, without the flash on, you will get blurry or dark pictures if you are not careful. Overall 8/10.","I love this camera! It has a lot more features than the Instax Mini 8 and I know this might sound weird, but it's slightly heavier which makes me feel like it's less cheap. Weird, I know.","Amazing camera","Love this camera! The pictures look great, but still trying to learn how to get the best lighting.","This came super fast and safe! I use my Instax for the most random things and I love it! If you can afford this toy I would say get this for yourself. I had at first gotten the one Urban Outfitters sells and I returned it once I found this one. You can recharge your battery, there are different functions to a photo, and the look of this is super cute and retro who wouldn't like that!?","I had the mini 7s before I bought this one and although that one was quite functional, I wanted all the options this one had to offer. I have yet to use it, but I’m very hopeful it’ll be fantastic!","Worked perfectly fine. It has a lot of features that make it the instant camera I was looking for. The double exposure feature makes it very appealing for everyone looking for something new. As long as it is handled with care it shouldn't provide any issues. Taking pictures is easier with the double shooter feature.","Got it for my girlfriend for Christmas. She loves it!","One of my favorite things EVER. I ordered this months ago and I'm still super happy. I also own an Instax Mini 8 and it is a step up. Highly recommend!","Awesome. Better than the cheaper version and better ergonomics. Very fun to shoot with","Came in new, great purchase !","Excellent customer service and product","Took it to the ski trip and so shocked with the quality of the photo we got from the extreme weather!  The shot I took from my kids's piano recital produces the best picture ever taken on them!  Very easy to use different setups.  Light weight yet retro expensive look.  Credit card size photo so cute makes you  treasure every moment you had.  Spontaneous works the best!  Thank you Fujifilm!","Nice camera, solid good feel, like it's a camera with heft. Nice features included. Pictures are clean and clear","I'm still trying to get the hang of it, but so far I love this camera. It's fun to use and the kids in the family loved watching the photos develop.","Great camera with a ton of options.  Instant film?!  It blew my nieces and nephews minds...It was magic to them.","Viewfinder on camera is very small and not easy to frame shot. You will waste some film. Position of the strap handle on bottom of camera is a bad design, it makes the camera very unstable when not in use. I do like the double exposure and long exposure features but overall this camera is just okay.","Great","Just what I expected!","This camera has a lot of features. You can control the flash, and it has a double exposure option that is super cool. A must have for the instant photography lovers.","Ordered this for my daughter for Christmas.  Came quicker than expected!  Very pleased!","GOOD","my daughter loves this camera, i got it for her for xmas","This is a very good camera. I would recommend this product","It was a gift for my sister ans she loves it","I love the design! Unlike the other instant film cameras, this one doesn't look like a child's toy. However, I had to take some time to make mistakes and waste some film in order to learn when to use the different functions. Although it was a little frustrating because of how expensive the film is, it's ultimately really fun to play around with the camera, even to see what happens when it doesn't turn out to be \"that perfect shot.\" That's one of this camera's best charms in a world of instant gratification and picture-perfect portrayals.","I saw this camera online and quickly had a flash back of my early childhood.  I just had to purchase.  I used it for my holiday party and was very very pleased.  Everyone was loving the small pics.  My initial thought was to take pictures of all the guest and give them a picture to go, but they turned out so well, I decided to keep them all and place into photo album....Love it!!!!","This was a Christmas present for my son, and he really loves it.  It's a great little camera and super fun with the instant polaroid film.  I had the original camera when I was a little girl and the photos are similar although half the size (mini).  It's a fun little camera to play around with.  If this is the type of camera you are wanting, then this one does the job well.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with the polaroid mini film then you may want to double check the dimensions.  The film is quite small.","Tighhhhhhhht. Expensive, but tigghhhttt.","Got this for my 19 yo daughter...she loves it. Has separate battery, so the film that you buy is cheaper than the standard Polaroid film that includes battery in film. This also has 10 photos per pack. Has zoom and looks much cuter than the other Fuji Polaroid cameras.","Good","Love the new version for polaroid camerea,  If your use to it , my daughter says the camera is cool, but some of the pictures seem a bit dark, once you take the pictures thats it, there is no delete, and she is awe struck that a minute later it develops.","Excellent retro product that does the job well. Very good price.","Fun way to take pictures! Make sure you have good lighting (flash just doesn't do a proper job) or the picture you are taking will be a waste of expensive film.  Overall, I enjoy the look of the camera and most of the pictures it takes","Product was exactly as described and arrived promptly. Easy to use and great quality. The double exposure feature is unique and cool to use! Definitely the best camera of its kind. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a photographer and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a polaroid camera!","Very cool,  sharp pictures,  nice silver dot for taking selfie pictures, n the colours are good","Great purchase, I bought this for my fiancé after weighting the options I initially wanted something that stored the images digitally and instantly printed them but the options from Polaroid that did this had very poor reviews. After seeing such positive feedback for this one I decided that the foxy gram features weren't worth the extra money and I/she couldn't be any happier.","Bought this as a Christmas present for my 21 year old daughter.  After she took a couple of pictures, she was in love.","My 15-year-old got this for Christmas and loves it! It's prefect for a teenager. Didn't take long for her to get used to working it.","Love it ! Looks really nice ..","I had bought this as a gift for girlfriend and she loves it because the pictures come out instantly. The pictures come clear and bright and it has many settings to use so you always have different pictures depending on the modes. I really like the instax 90 and I will get one myself soon.","I like this camera more than my old polaroid a lot! I can turn the flash off with this one and I like the look of it a lot more. Little bit more money but I like that I can shoot shots outside and not have that flash always going off. It is nice having a photo in my hands and not just digital images on a card.","Love my Neo 90. I plan to take it on trips so I can gift these pictures to local people I meet along the way. Feels a tad flimsy with the plastic but, honestly, it's a tight little unit.","Perfect","Amazing, every picture turns out great. It makes me feel like a professional photographer","Cover broke just by shutting case. Won't click shut :(","This little camera is SO much fun.","I LOVE THIS CAMERA!!! I've been searching this kind of polaroid that doesn't have a toy-like style for a long time! This camera is lighter than I thought it would be, maybe it's because I never hold a polaroid b4 :) Then I took a picture and wait, the color it showed impressed me. And those modes tho! Haven't really tried all of them yet but I think they are going to be awesome :))","Love this so much I bought one for my little sister, she loves it too.","The one which I've been looking for a long time! Fujifilm Instax Mini 90 Neo Classic is a beauty with the beast inside<br /><br />I bought this polaroid camera once it came into the market. I loved the stylish \"Nostalgic\" classic camera look and feel and I didn't think of the output  while buying it. But what came later was really more than satisfying.<br /><br />Build:<br />  As mentioned before, the product is really stylish. You get the camera, the neck strap, battery, charger and the manuals out of the box. The camera is made out of plastic. But not low quality. You'll really feel that the cam sits good in your hand and is really a great feel to hold the solid body. I was surprised that it doesnt come with atleast one pack of polaroid films in the box. You need to buy them separately. Something that still leaves me puzzled. But it is negligible and will say why later.<br /><br />Ergonomics:<br />  It is indeed ergonomic. Lot of thinking has gone behind the design. The cool thing I like about it is the dual shutter button. One on the useal place and one front facing right above the lens. Easy for manuevering between landscape and portrait shooting. Timer works really well. The display is minimalistic and enough for the features available. The battery and the film loaders are overlapped. Loading the battery and the films were easy.<br /><br />Quality:<br />  The image quality is really great and with bright colors! Eventhough this is a mini film which is being used, this is perfect for regular travellers to clip on the images to their travellogue or create a collage of parties and weddings. The timer and the bulb settings which are good addition to the cam. The flash is really good and of great use while shooting at night!<br /><br />Long storey short - \" Great gift for someone who travels a lot and likes having polaroid shots! But the film is a bit on the expensive end considering that they are one time use only.\"","Used this camera at work for a project and knew it would make a fantastic Christmas gift. Recommend for anyone, fun at parties, for scrapbooking, really anything! I purchased the Mini8 for two people on my Xmas list, this camera though I purchased for my father, a photographer of 40+ years. I knew he would enjoy the extra settings, my favorite is the double exposure setting- you can have a lot of fun and make some amazing photos with this little camera!","Just as I wanted! Didn't expect it to be that small. It's so cute and shipping comes right in time! When I opened the package, However, the flap to close the box was open. I was scared at first that some parts would be missing or damaged, but everything is fine! I love it","Really nice and easy to use!","My son loves this camera. It takes a while to learn to take good photos with it, but you really can. Figure you'll go through a pack of film before you get the lighting down. It's a lot of fun to use, and people love getting the photos. There are a number of settings, so you have to play around with it.","It takes practice to get things just right but the experimentation and unpredictability is half the fun! If I want total control over how a shot turns out, and unlimited attempts, I'll just pull out my iPhone - this is something special that makes unique images.","Love this camera!!  W","I have always wanted an instant camera ever since my friend got one! Although many people find it difficult to remember to set the mode when turning the camera on, to me it is very fun. I get to change the settings to however I want to. I want to take note of the battery life, it is amazing. I have the camera for a month now, but still the battery is fully charged since I first charged it. Maybe it's because I rarely use it, but I am amazed. I never had to fear getting a low battery in events or just casual picture takings. The pictures come out beautifully. It has given me the joy of experimenting and exploring! People are always concerned about wasting the films, don't listen to them. Although the film is expensive, it is replaceable, unlike moments you should've taken pictures of! It is easy to change the films, a very straightforward camera! Beautiful design, beautiful texture! It doesn't feel like plastic to me, it feels like a treasure! Definitely worth the money!","This camera is so much fun and you'll be the life of the party with this one! Picture quality is great and its fun to play around with the double exposure!","I love this camera!  Retro and everyone loves the small photos that come from it.","Bought as a gift for my son's HS grad. He used it at his grad party for photo prop pictures. Lots of kids and adults liked it and asked where I bought it.","gave as a gift...lots of fun as an extra camera and a conversation maker","Shipping and delivery was fast. Camera is more solid compared to Instax mini 8 and a little heavier. I love that the battery is rechargeable. The added features for taking photos are great. I love the classic look. I guess the only thing that I kind of don't like is that there isn't much grip handle to the camera unlike the Instax mini 8. That's just me. I love my Mini 8 but this is a lot better for polaroid type camera. Pictures are not the best for clarity but the style and color of photos makes it unique and gives you that old school feeling. Overall, I love the camera and would recommend it to anyone who like the concept of classic type cameras and instant photos printed other than having photos taken from your phone or digital cameras. Films are a little pricey, but hey... Memories printed in a little photo you can keep or share instantly are priceless :) I love my camera.","So much fun! Wanted to get the instant 210 so that the pics would be larger but this camera is the perfect size. & it's not hideous like a lot of the other instants. The prints are smaller but they're so cute & they're still awesome. Very user friendly, comes with a strap & rechargeable battery. I definitely recommend!","Bought this for my girlfriend who is into cameras and was a hit! Used it at a wedding people were going crazy, haven't got to play with it but there are some really cool features , look forward to using it and she is really happy with it !","Many functions and easy to operate. Perfect picture quality. Love it!","The pictures come out great, but they're so tiny! I would definitely buy an instant camera that prints larger pictures if it was still possible to return this one.","Definitely a must have, it takes very clear and colorful pictures, i definitely recommend it.","Bought this after my boyfriend and I's trip to Hawaii, we took his Instax 8 and I loved the novelty and nostalgia of instant photos. This one has added perks and tricks, allowing you to adjust light settings, exposure time, macro, and movement. It takes some getting use to, I probably went through one pack of film trying to get the handle of the settings but I love it now! I like that I can control everything but sometimes it's nice to use the Instax 8 to just point and shoot. We love taking these cameras on our weekend trips, they make for great memories.<br /><br />My only qualm is that the battery is a  lithium-ion battery, which is great because it is rechargeable BUT unless you have a spare battery, it's kind of troublesome that once it's dead, you're done. you can't just pop in 2 AA's and continue on.","I love this thing, it's a lot of fun when hanging out with friends.  Especially the double exposure feature which cheaper ones unfortunately don't have.  Everyone loves to keep them as souvenirs, I rarely get to keep any.","Fun little camera. People find the instant pictures novel. Great for taking pictures you DON'T want on Facebook.<br /><br />One downside, film is kinda pricey.","this camera is totally sweet.  I've had it for 3 months. I love that it has double exposure and bulb settings - that's something you don't see on other camera's like this.  You can also turn on/off the flash and it has a timer setting.  I also like the style and compact-ish size.","Bought this for my teen daughter and she's very happy with it. There are pictures all over the house! We bought film and picture border stickers off ebay. Takes very cute pics as well","Just got this today!  Had first seen the Mini 8 and did some research.  Learned that this model was the most advanced with the most features.  It was considerably more expensive (about double the price of the Mini 8) but I opted for this version anyway for the added features and rechargeable battery.  Since I have only had it a few hours, have only had a chance to take a couple of photos, but I love it!  I am old enough to remember the instant cameras my parents had (they were \"the thing\" in the 1960's) and this really brings back those memories!  So much fun and I anticipate it will be a big hit at family and friend gatherings; a novel item in this day and age of everything digital.  Having an actual photo that people can see immediately and keep as a remembrance of a fun visit or trip is something special.  A couple of cautions:  when you get it, if you want to use it right away, get that battery unpacked and get it charging as soon as you can; it takes a good hour to charge and you can't do anything without it.  Also, the film is not super expensive but at $15.00 for 20 photos, it is more than the kiosks where you can make copies from your digital memory card for 29 cents.  And, if you don't have multiple packs of film on hand, it may be a little hard to find (not positive but my local CVS pharmacy where I purchase digital memory cards don't carry it).  A suggestion or hint for reading the instructions --- they are written in about 6 or 7 different languages and it's sometimes a little challenging to find the English version.  I suggest highlighting all of the English and it is immediately clear where to look for instructions.  As other reviews mentioned (I read many of them before ordering; not much negative about this cute little retro camera!), remember that the photos are SMALL; credit card size.  That said, the are very clear; a retro, fun \"souvenir\"!  I do a lot of amateur photography with a Canon super zoom point and shoot that takes awesome photos, but bought this for the fun of \"instant gratification\" and an in-hand immediate photo (and because I love retro, fun things that remind us of our childhood!)  One reviewer complained because there wasn't a way to \"edit\" the photos or see the photo before you actually take the picture....please remember, this is a retro instant camera; takes some change in mindset when used to everything being digital.  All in all, it is a HIT!  Very pleased.<br />Update to review 11/4/14:  after having this product for a couple of weeks, I must revise my previous review.  While it is a cute, retro camera with some potential as a popular gadget for capturing spontaneous shots and a fun thing to maybe have around at a family gathering, the photos are so small that it really overrides the desire to keep it.  Although I knew the size of the actual photo when I ordered, I wasn't prepared for the tiny, tiny depiction of whatever you are photographing.  I cannot find enough reason to justify the cost, so I will be returning it.","Very good camera! I love setting it out at parties and events for people to take pictures instantly.","Love the look of this. Sturdy and with lots of useful features. Sure the pics are small, but they're good quality and so much fun. Nice to be into 'real' photography again. Very Happy Happy Happy with this camera.","Used this for a photo booth like set up at our wedding. It worked great throughout the entire night and produced a lot of incredible, memorable pictures. There are a lot of options for how you want to set up the shot.","nice. but I haven't try the double expose function yet. I'll update later.","Amazing camera! It really exceeds expectation when it comes to polaroid cameras. I am very happy with it and would definitely recommend","love the camera but kinda hard to let me take the pix my picture keeps going off<br />and the top capture button is kinda hard to hold","cool","Its everything i expected it to be. Worth the money.","The best way to describe this camera is: Fun!<br /><br />I love to see people's reaction when they see the print pop out of the camera a second after the flash. They are so used to digital most ask me: \"Can you send me a copy of that?\" They seem genuinely surprised when I say \"there is only one copy... and this is it!\"<br /><br />Pay attention to the manual when you first get the camera and learn how to use the different settings. It will take you a few shots of practice but if you have even a basic understanding of photography you should have no problem learning how to set it up optimally. Having said that, getting some unexpected results is part of the fun!<br /><br />The film cartridges are a little on the pricey side but other than that, this camera is a blast.","the person I gave it to ... really like this camera. I gave it as a gift.","Cute old-school looking polaroid camera. It's a little bit bulky and unfortunately it's a little awkward to hold if you want the photo to turn out in the right orientation (portrait) but I still really like having this for the instant gratification.","Love it!","Love this camera!<br />If so much fun to use and get instant results :-)","The perfect camera for weddings and parties and for your own creative projects. Very sturdy, easy to use and reliable. I would highly recommend purchasing this Instant Camera.","I have three instax cameras. Of them this one has the greatest range. That is the upside you can get really great pics from this. There are several downsides though. First you have to remember to change the settings every time you turn it off and back on. Second unlike a digital camera if you take a bad picture (which happens a lot because you have to learn how to work the settings and remember to adjust them) you've just wasted costly film.  Third for such a complicated process they shouldn't have made this a mini. Fuji should have made this version to process wide film instead. Still when you get it right it does take pretty great if vintagey pics.","I've had the 7S for a while now and I've used it loads on trips and parties. This time I was going on vacation and the prospect of bringing the huge 7S around was not pleasant. Decided to bite the bullet and go for this, and I'm amazed!<br /><br />Firstly, the size. It is definitely worth upgrading if you want to lessen the bulk. Go to an Urban Outfitters to look at it (as I did) and decide if it is right for you. When I was in a theme park I could fit this, a camera, a phone, money + cards into one of my small crossbody bags. Impressive and clearly impossible for the 7S. I don't think they can shrink it more, given the size of the film is literally 85% of the entire casing...<br /><br />Next, the quality. Frankly, daytime shots appear to be equally clear as the 7S. That is not a bad thing - the 7S is great in daylight. But NIGHT TIME! I could take shots with this that I wouldn't DREAM of with the 7S, just by turning the flash off. Coupled with the modes (the mountain thingy, can't remember what it's called) I took a few night shots at the top of the Empire State Building that I am not embarrassed of. Of course, you need a steady hand. But I had a lot less \"failed\" shots than with the 7S. Lean it against something, use the timer, or fix a tripod to the bottom. Oh, the possibilities!<br /><br />Fancy pants double exposure! You can do a lot of cool things with this, obviously. Like tape over half of your lens to get a doppelganger effect. You can still use macro, light/dark options, the timer and flash with the double exposure mode. Do read a few articles about how to execute one properly - you need an image to be shadowy and then expect the second one to be projected on the dark parts... It's all very profound...<br /><br />I'm also very excited for the kids/pet mode. This shortens the shutter speed and it's good to use in daylight when you just don't want blurry pics.<br /><br />Other kitschy things include being able to twist the lens (a twist-click) to change between the modes. An actual display that tells you how many films you have left. (A blessing for an idiot who always misreads the yellow sign on the 7S as the film count...) It comes with a shoulder strap (but I'm not going to wear this around my neck and have it swing around dangerously) and a rechargeable battery!! It is still working on the same charge after 2 rolls of film, and a lot of tinkering. I'll probably charge it before my next trip and leave the charger at home.","Best instax mini so far. You have to experiment how to take a great shot but you will, and after that what a great shot !!","This is probably my all time favorite purchase!  The pictures are great quality!  Honestly, nobody prints pictures anymore, they stay on your phone or computer.  I love that I have it to hold right then.  My only advice would be to order a lot of film!  You're going to love it and the film isn't easy to find in stores.  I've found some at a couple Best Buys, but a lot don't carry the film.","it's a great instant film camera. the quality of photo produced is so much better than other models.<br />just a bit pricy but i think it worth the price.","This is a great camera! I bought it because I love taking pictures with any kind of camera I can get. I think its a bit pricey for what it is but however with how much I enjoy this camera I found it to be worth the money. I love the pictures and the quality that they come out with. Be careful when having others play with the camera because if you open the back where the film is it will think you are putting in new film and print out a blank picture because a black sheet prints out when you put in new film. The film is also pricey so you should definitely be aware that happens. The camera comes with its own neck strap. I really enjoy this camera, its great fun for parties and little family moments you want to capture. Be careful in slightly dark lighting, if are questioning whether or not to use the flash then I recommend just using the flash.","The camera is really really nice. The only reason why I didn't give a 5 star rating is because; 1) it does not allow you to put in a SD memory card, 2) You cannot see the picture before you print it, 3) You cannot select the pictures you want to print, once you take the picture it automatically prints them out, 4) Because you cannot see the picture after you take them, you cannot do any basic editing on them before printing., and 5) I wish the print out was a little bigger, it's the size of a credit card, which is awesome if you want to carry around in your wallet...<br />Having said that, the camera is a lot of fun and once you get the drill you can take some really nice little pictures....Good job Fuji!","love it! everyone loves it! i got it as a b'day for a friend and had to buy her another after my husband usurped. it's real application is event commemoration. i took it to our office outdoor party and everyone was thrilled to get a picture with a friend. Really, you can't effectively capture more than 3 people in a shot, 2 is best and it's more fun for closeups since the photo is so, well, mini. STill still still, it's great to get an immediate take away. the younger gen is particularly in awe of this since all they know is digital pix. i Wish i had a pic of the face of my friend's 11 year old when i snapped the shot and the little picture came out! \"Woah, that's Awesome! but there's no picture! Oh, Wait, I see it! wow!! Wow!!, I want this camera!\"  And the adults aren't much different! Beware, the pix end up costing about $1 each.","I absolutely love this camera! I've been using it for birthdays and holidays for a few months now, and it never fails to please! Everyone is so excited to see the shots as they develop, and I often give them away as hostess gifts or to the party attendees. This camera has many features, so I suggest watching a couple video tutorials on youtube or the fujifilm website to see how it's done.","A little pricey but putting this up next to my mini 8, there's no question the mini 90 neo classic is a top of the line instant film camera so I feel the price is justified. It's retro but modern and feels solid in the hand. It's almost a perfect counterpart to Fujifilm's X-series cameras even though I've read they are different companies.<br /><br />As far as photo quality goes, the photos are a bit sharper than previous models but what I love most about this camera is the light to dark settings. I love the vintage washed out look so to be able to adjust the settings to add a bit of light is nice.<br /><br />Very cool and fun camera and would be an awesome gift to anyone that loves taking photos.","I love this camera. Perfect for my project to take pics of my shoes to attach to box to organize my closet","LOVE IT!!","Nice goods","Nice camera, bought it for my son and he loves it. Uses it all the time.","Highly recommend lovers of instant film to buy this!! I have an instax wide, old school polaroid, and a land camera and this is by far my favorite. Definitely recommend this over the the mini instax because the different modes, flash control, and macro really make a world of difference! I use to use my instax wide constantly but was always annoyed the the flash being automatic and this solved that problem for me. Love this camera so much","The camera is great, I love it.","A++++++","I love this camera! I am using it for a photo booth birthday party and it works great. I love the \"old-fashioned\" look and the pictures that it takes are really nice and they look soo cute!","Wonderfully fun camera. Used this at my wedding and on our honeymoon to Paris. It captures pictures with surprising quality for being instant and so little. I appreciate the greater control the Mini 90 offers me as far as settings/exposure. The sleek look is a plus as well.","Its perfect! And very very fast!","Super fun! Great lens. Easy to use. I wish my Fuji 210 was this good! Plus a lithium rechargeable battery.","Great little instant camera.  Don't be turned off by the tiny size of the photos.  If you're unsure of whether or not they're \"good enough,\" just bring this camera to a party.  You'll soon hear your friends gasp and shriek about the \"cute,\" \"adorable,\" and \"wonderful\" little \"Polaroids.\"  Women LOVE them, and if you're a guy, nothing better than making a woman smile, right?  Your guy friends with a nerdy inclination will find the photos \"neato.\"  The camera itself draws a lot of attention and people will ask you about it.  They will be shocked to find out that it's brand new and immediately want to know how to get one.  Make sure to bring enough film and take extra photos for yourself if you want to have any to take home with you because your subjects will be so excited that they will run away with your photos, and that's most of the fun.<br /><br />The camera itself couldn't be simpler to use.  I appreciate some of the improvements over the larger Fuji instant cameras, such as the onboard ability to take close-ups without having to install an auxiliary lens.  You just push the button with the icon of the flower and you're all set!  The battery lasts forever on one charge.  I've shot over ten packs of film on the initial charge and the battery indicator still reads full--but I recharged it anyway.<br /><br />Ergonomically, it's very easy to use.  I like the two shutter release buttons for portrait or landscape shooting.  I have not had to use any of the other features, such as lighten and darken, as this camera is able to perfectly expose every shot that I've made, every single time.","I love this little guy. I have the Instax 210 as well and have preferred the wider film, so I was a little hesitant on buying a mini. I decided to try this mini for the purpose of it's double exposure. Turns out, the double exposure isn't the only great thing! The functions of this mini make taking instant photos a breeze. With the 210 wide, it's a hit or miss with exposure -- but this mini really turns out some solid exposures! I really enjoy this model.<br /><br />Compared to the 210 wide, I am more inclined to carry this around because of how small it is. They also sell some pretty rad cases for this and I will most likely buy one as well.<br /><br />I always recommend this camera when on-lookers are in awe that it's an instant camera.","Just received this a couple of days ago & I can already tell the difference between this & the instax mini 8 camera. The pictures come out a lot clearer and the new features such as the double exposure, macro, and the ability to turn OFF the flash is super convenient. I'm seriously in love with this camera- I'd buy backups if I had the money to haha. If you have the Instax mini 8, this is a great upgrade to go too! But beware, you'll have so much fun with this you probably will go through film like nothing!","I bought this item for my girlfriend for our 1 year anniversary. She loves taking pictures and she wants this kind of camera. She loves it. I took her to San Francisco to also celebrate our one year anniversary and she used the camera to take pictures and it turned out awesome! Every time I took a picture of her, I slowly start loving it too. The double picture also makes it fun to take pictures! The only problem is that film is expensive but other than that, this product is great!","I love this camera, I took it with me on my honeymoon and it was a hit with everyone who saw it. It's very light and easy to use. I do wish there were more lighting & zooming options.","A++++++","Very fast delivery . Love it","I love it! Shipping was fast and my camera is so much fun!","Amazing! This camera is more than I ever wanted! I've taken so many pictures with it's the topic of conversations a good amount of the time! I honestly do recommend this camera!","Lots of fun, so many ways you can experiment, it takes a bit of learning curve to get used to the shooting environments/lighting, but that's part of the charm of this camera. It's not that economical what with the film, especially when you have to give some to your friends at parties, but it's well worth it. It's more of a novelty item, but it is so much fun to have around parties.","Be careful because it comes with a non-US plug. Luckily I had the correct cable lying around, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to charge the battery.","Easy to use, has a couple of nifty features including double exposure.  So fun to have a physical picture to hold, not a phone with pictures on it.  Battery is long lived.  It was for my husband, but I think I had even more fun with it.  Wish the pictures were bigger without having a bigger camera.","Thanks! Excellent","I love this polaroid! Yes, the pictures are smaller in size than the other full-size Fujifilm polaroid (I won't even compare it to non Fujifilm polaroid cameras, which are far inferior), but its colors are much more vivid and bright.","Cutest  thing ever","Great camera.  I did have to learn to be more disciplined with taking non-flash photos as the shutter speed is a bit slow in normal lighting conditions.  I just end up using the flash most of the times.  People love it at parties because of the retro look, plus they love souvenirs to take home.","This little camera was a hit for the photo booth at our graduation party.  Took pretty clear pictures and was a lot of fun.","my daughter loves this camera","This camera appears to be of a higher quality than the small, colorful Fuji instant cameras that are common at Urban Outfitters. It is bigger, but feels very sturdy, and the extra features are fun to play around with. The light adjustments are particularly useful. The instant film packs are pretty easy to install (but make sure to buy them from Amazon, or they will be very expensive). My girlfriend has had no complaints, and she's used it fairly often for about a month now.","The camera is a lot of fun - easy to use and watching my grandchildren's faces as the picture slides out of the camera and they can watch it materialize is unforgettable.  The quality of the print is good - not great.  The film is quite pricey so this is not a camera that is useful for everyday.","This is the perfect camera for gatherings of family and friends. Everyone gets a photo in a matter of minutes. Not too Big, Not too small…..just right. Totally cool !","It's a great camera. I usually would forget to use the mode for lightness however the pictures still come out great. Everyone loves my camera when they see it. Definitely something to have!","This camera has become a fixture in my purse and backpack! This camera has the most features and adjustability of any instant camera I've owned. The ease with which you can make double exposures was the biggest draw for me. I like the rechargeable battery because it eliminates AA's and have not had to recharge it for over a month month now with moderate weekly use. I have recommended this camera to many people and am pretty sure one friend is about to buy it. If you have the money and enjoy the experimentation side of instant film this is definitely worth the investment. It is also great for just capturing lifes everyday snapshots. I would definitely buy it again if it was ever lost or broken.","I thought my kids would never learn about the evolution of cameras and film, but this little thing is a great learning tool.  They understand that sometimes, you only get one shot, so make it count.  They are learning that film developing is different than a printer.","I work as a children's photographer and I'll admit, shooting photos out of work had gotten a little stale. I really feel like this made photography fun again! This particular camera can do so much, but even more it's actually rather classy. Friends and strangers love it and I personally love the novelty of having this one little image that only exists once. I'm burning through film....but it's very worth it. My only issue is that the eye piece doesn't really show what you are shooting.... Which leads to a few miss framed shots.... But you get used to it over time.","NICE PRICE -  ...  Delivery before promissed date....excellent price... excellent quality!!... I wonder how como some of theese items, sold on the net can bring a profit!!<br />. I will continue to buy them as long as the quality and reliability is kept at 100%.. Keep the prices down and quality up!!!!!","Got it for my daughter, 19 yo. She uses it everyday and loves it. Looks a little cheesey but in all actuality it made pretty nice.","Grea!!!!! I got all excited when I found out they were bringing my insta-photos back since they discontinued the polaroids... I am still working getting the features right, we all know the viewfinder is not align with the lense... so be aware.<br /><br />Some of my pictures come or too bright or too dark or too blurry. Overall I think I need to spend more money in the film to practice more . .. Man I miss my polaroid and their perfect size.","I had an older poloroid years ago which I donated to Goodwill, boy was I dummy. I was researching photosbooths for my up coming wedding and kept seeing ideas about doing your own with an instant camera. I started searching and came across the Fujifilm instax mini 90 and immediately fell in love. The style and functionality is nothing like anything else on the market. This became my birthday gift and has been a lot of fun using. It's a chemical process for the photos, not a printed, so don't expect super crisp, extremely colorful photos, use as a novelty as it is intended :)","I love it! It looks awesome and it takes awesome pictures. I haven't tried all the features yet but the quality of my pictures so far has been great.","HELP, PLEASE.<br /><br />I just bought this couple months ago and used it once for my trip to NYC. Now I'm heading to Seattle for another trip and found that the camera just doesn't WORK anymore! When I turn on the power button nothing happened. And, I put the battery to charger properly to charge it, the charging light just doesn't show any colors! Please help, I really need this for my trip!!!! Why that'd happen!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Please contact me as soon as you see this. Thank you.","I rated this camera only 4 stars because of the size of the pictures, I wish the pictures were the size of the old<br />instamatics.  However the color and the sharpness is much better than the old instamatics.<br />I've enjoyed taking pictures of my pets and family.  This camera is a lot of fun.","I love this camera, I plan to use it at festivals and over the summer. I've found the best compositions come out of outdoor lighting with this camera, I would say it is pretty true to color and my exposures have been more defined than the usual \"Polaroid.\" There is something so satisfying about holding a picture in your hand after taking and watching it develop that I love, real photography, one copy and one copy only. I decided to go for the neo 90 as opposed to the mini 8 which has far less features. Plus, the look of the camera is so much more pleasing to the eye. I love that I can leave the shutter open and create light trails and double expose photos as well. One of my favorite features that the mini 8 lacks is that the neo 90 comes with a rechargeable battery that is good for 10 packs of film and the mini 8 requires batteries. All in all, I love the cameras and features it has. Very satisfied.","I bought this camera for my wife and she LOVES it!  Probably one of the best gifts I've ever gotten her considering how much she uses it and the enjoyment everyone gets with those instant pics!","I had been looking at this camera on and off for a few months and finally decided to buy it, thanks to all the awesome reviews. I'm so happy I bought this camera. It's fun and very easy to use. The pictures come out really nice!","Bought this because I always wanted my own Polaroid Camera, this one has features that other polaroids don't have, meaning it cost much more.<br /><br />First the camera, it is plastic and feels like a toy. It is a solid piece of plastic though, not sure how well it will handle a drop and I don't feel like testing. It comes with a strap so you don't have to worry about dropping it, worry about it swinging around though if you are putting it over the shoulder and body. Camera itself looks very nice, retro looking with the gray and black. Looks like a toy Fuji X-100.<br /><br />My favorite feature for the camera is the double exposure. Fun to play with because results are instant. Just be careful though because films are expensive, but then again every picture I take with this seem to always come out nice.<br /><br />The problems I had with this camera are holding the camera and the viewfinder. I know I am probably holding it wrong, but I can't seem to find a way to hold it comfortably. Next the viewfinder is small, again maybe because I'm doing it wrong. I can't seem to look through it properly all the time.<br /><br />Overall the camera is fun to play with, great pictures all the time, just need to spend a lot of money because of the film.","I bought this camera as an indulgence for myself.  I have been sorting through all the pictures I've saved over the years.  From the pile of 'keepers' the best seem to be primarily the Polaroids.  There are 100's of pictures taken with my SLR camera. Out of each roll, from which I have hundreds of prints, with the negatives, I have decided to throw away most of them because There are so few quality photos to save. There is ample proof that my amateur photography skills are not honed. Nevertheless, the Polaroids are the ones worth saving.  I have only used this camera a few times.  So far, the quality is good, although the pictures are really too small.  The focus is good but the images are small too.  I think I should have done more research before I bought this camera. Nevertheless, I would not have the hands on practice that will guide my next purchase.  Thank you Amazon for your Amazing 5 star Customer Service!!  Sarah S. Reade, MD  Olympia, WA","Everyone love it. I love it. The people I shoot love it. The reaction I get, as someone that is always taking photos is, oh its him again, then the magic happens and the photo pops out and their faces light up... very enjoyable for nights out at bars or parties.. always, always gets a smile. Camera works well, setting easy to change, photos pretty good if you remember to get in close to your subject. I love it and the price per photo is livable....","It does everything it says it will do, very well.  Pictures aren't going to be digital quality and there is obviously no \"re-do\" button but, that's what makes the pictures more fun.  Easy to use, seems pretty durable, feels good in the hands.  Everybody comments on it and really enjoys it.  I have taken lots of pictures and have only been able to keep a couple.....they all want to keep the picture.  I'd buy again.","This camera is pretty looking, but pretty plastic feeling. It is also awkward to hold since the lens is close to the button which gives you less room to have your fingers wrap around the camera. Otherwise, it's the best out of instax mini  cameras and it's fun to shoot with since it has macro, double exposure and long exposure. If you are familiar with Fuji Instax film, you'll know it's the smaller film and that Fuji is more milky looking than Polaroid film. I am glad I bought this camera.","Light, comfortable, chargeable, awesome quality of pics. This is the best oldschool polaroid camera. Love it! So much fun! Buy it & enjoy :)","I choose this instax camera because it has more manual options.<br />It's my first instax camera and I'm so glad I chose this one.<br />It works perfectly.<br />The only thing I don't like so far is its auto flash setting. I always forgot to turn it off.","OMG i could not have spent my Christmas gift money on anything better! Do not buy this camera in a store unless its cheaper than here. I searched and searched and could not find one cheaper anywhere, so amazon is the best. The camera did take a while in the mail, but it was worth the wait. Dont worry about it coming broken because it was well protected in the boxes it came in.It takes a little practice with taking good photos on it. I have a scrapbook for my instant print photos, my friends love looking at them.","It is a fine and fun camera. The pictures are on the smaller size but I love being able to walk to my local electronic store and buying film.","An amazing camera with great picture quality. I really love the double exposure and also it works perfect with different lights. I will definitely recommend it.","Absolutely love my camera! I researched different instant cameras and this is by far the best. It truly is the best camera","Camera is not officially sold in the U.S. But thanks to this dealer we can have it at a very good price.<br />My daughter loved it. She collects cameras.","Easy Double exposures, light painting with the bulb exposure mode, a kids mode to capture fast moving subjects, macro mode and more.<br /><br />This is the ultimate instant film camera. I have never been so happy with a camera purchase before. I had the instax 7s for awhile and this was well worth the upgrade. My favorite mode is the double exposure mode. It's so easy it's insane. The instax 90 lets you take two captures on one sheet and bam, double exposure.<br /><br />If you are a fan of experimentation as well as the ability to capture subjects flawlessly with easy settings, buy this camera.","I wanted to create magic....as a stupid as that sounds and I have accomplished it. Fun and cool. I'd recommend for anyone needing a bit of fairy dust in their life:)","This is one of the best things to happen to instant cameras, and the fact that they sell the film at urban outfitters makes it very easy to reup","Absolutely wonderful product! The pictures are small but fun and force you to get up and personal with you subjects. The lighting is a bit difficult at first but once I had practiced it came easily. I use these pictures as  Game gifts at Christmas. Kids love to watch the pictures develop! Everyone enjoyed seeing the pictures develop! For the price and the size of pictures, this camera is perfect for older kids, teens and grandmas!","This camera is perfect for what it is. You are limited with the shots you can take, but for the fun of instant film, it does its job. I love this thing.  There are a million different things you can do with the instant pictures.","Wonderful pictures with Polaroid style, nice size, if Fuji do it in other color was better like black, white or pink","This is my fifth instant camera (yes, I collect) and this camera just made say... HE'S THE ONE.<br />This has the macro mode and the double exposure that I was looking for in a camera. I love! <10x this! not to mention the battery used here is rechargeable. I wonder if this model 'fuji mini 90 neo classic' will make a wider version of the film, it will be awesome!","purchased for my 15-year-old daughter, she's been wanting an instant camera for a while now, apparently they're very much in vogue with kids these days, and she absolutely loves it, not cheap, but well worth the smile it put on her face!","Got this model imported into the states before it was released. My only complaint is that now its 40 dollars cheaper but that's what you pay for when buying something new to the market. Imported model's instructions have enough information to properly decipher use, loading film, etc. Overall a great product.","I probably need to spend more time working with the various settings because some of the pictures are true duds.  With that said, this is super fun.  And, when I get better at using it, it could be a great way to make small mementoes for friends and family.","We bought this for our wedding reception - and it was a hit!  The camera has surprisingly accurate focus, a decent flash, and can be dialed to 'lighten' or 'darken' as required by different environments.  Buying the 2-packs of film (20 images) through amazon is also the way to go.<br />Definitely recommend this camera!","I had this camera for 2 days and so far it's a lot of fun! I debated whether I should get an instant camera or a picture printer for any cell phone but I think this is a lot more of a fun experience! I got lots of washi tape, photo markers, stickers to make mini albums. I bought the instax Mini 8 in baby blue for my teenage niece but the case on this one seems more like my style.","I've had the 50s for about a year now and have had fun with it for party/portrait give-away type photos. The biggest drawback with this model IMO is that there is no way to turn off the flash.  I use a small strip of gaffers tape to partially cover the flash minimizing it's intensity (w/o burning the bulb).<br /><br />This 'new' Instax Mini 90 model offers the option of forcing or eliminating the use of a now variable flash, thereby allowing more detail in portrait or macro shots.  A huge plus in my book.  I personally don't use these Instax cameras for landscape photography due to the small print size and lack of finer detail.<br /><br />The Li-ion rechargeable (NP 45A) battery is a slight improvement over having to find/buy two CR2 for the 50s, although, two AA batteries would have been even better as I have a house full of Eneloop rechargeable AA batteries...again, IMO.<br /><br />The new Double exposure and Bulb modes are for creative uses and are a nice option to have.<br /><br />For a simple camera that creates instant gratification credit card size photos with (understandably) limited photographic capabilities, this camera is a lot of fun. All in all a very nice and solid improvement over previous Instax models.<br /><br />(see submitted photo)","I'm an avid photographer and though I'm primarily found shooting with my high-end interchangeable lens camera or the nice point-and-shoot I carry around for casual use, there's something magical about instant cameras.  Perhaps it's that you're shooting on actual film, or maybe it's that every shot you take is a one-of-a-kind physical artifact (which is special in today's world of Instagram and Facebook where photos are a dime a dozen.)  All I know for sure is that they are incredibly fun to use and peoples' eyes light up when you pull one of these out at a party.<br /><br />I've used several other Instax models, from the wide-format 210 to the previous highest-end model, the Mini 50S.  I've got to say that the Mini 90 blows the others away in every regard.  I've never seen shots from an Instax come out so consistently vibrant, crisp and in focus until I tried this model.  I haven't even gotten around to experimenting with the new shooting modes yet and I'm still getting far better results than I got with the 50S, and believe me I've shot a lot of pictures with that model.<br /><br />The Mini 90 is by far the nicest-looking Instax camera and also the nicest instant camera available on the market today.  The body is mostly made of plastic, but it's high-quality and certainly doesn't look cheap (it's rather stylish and retro) and feels good and solid in the hands.  Ergonomically it's much better than the 50S, with the shutter release in a much better place.  The rechargeable battery is a godsend; no strange disc batteries to replace and no heavy AAs to weigh it down.<br /><br />It's definitely on the high-end of price, especially compared to the other models, but given the relatively high cost of instant film, having a camera that consistently gets the shot you want rather than ones you need to retake is worth every penny.  Recommended whole-heartedly, not just to photographers but to anyone who wants to bring a little bit of magic into their lives.","Bought this as a gift for someone - what fun!  Easy to use, and the photos have come out significantly better than expected.","I grew up with Polaroid instant cameras. I now have a Canon 5D MkII and love it - but I decided to get the Instax Mini 90 and I love, love, love it! I forgot how much fun it is to have a print in your hands immediately. The image quality is nice considering it's instant film, the pictures are sharp and have that funky subtle true vintage look that came naturally with instant film - long before iPhone apps and Photoshop and oversaturation. This camera is fun and easy to use. People get a kick out of seeing their pics right away and it gets a lot of attention. Very happy I bought this little camera!","Cool product, it's a little pricey between the $200 camera and $1/photo, but we've had fun with it so far!","Over the years I always have had something with instant photography. I own different Polaroid camera's and still have some original Polaroid film in the fridge. Film for these camera's is now available from \"The Impossible Project\" but is expensive. I'm also a long term user of Instax mini camera's. It all started with the mini 20, after that the mini 30i and later on the mini 50s. The mini pictures are small but the colors are actually better than Polaroids ever were.<br />Now, the Instax min 90 is the top model of the current range. This is not only the best looking Instax mini ever made, but also the best ever, offering the most controls. It is the only model that allows you to switch off the flash. It also features a bulb and double exposure mode. Like the mini 50s it also has a tripod mount. You do not need a close-up lens, the viewfinder changes during the close-up setting. The accuracy of the clear but small optical viewfinder is comparable to the other Instax mini's: there is more on the final picture than what was seen, but after a few shots you can keep this framing in mind so it does not give any problem. It is also the first Instax mini using a rechargeable battery. Additional batteries are easy to find because Fuji uses these types also in digital compacts.<br />The cost of film is acceptable. It is great fun using this camera, I love it. If it was possible I would give it a 6 star rating.","I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas present, and she loves it. I bought it with the cheapest shipping, and it took them 11 days to ship this cam to my address.(including the saturday and sunday) The only thing is it doesn't have any instant film to come with, and lucky I bought an extra 10 sheet x 5 pack, or we will have a cam with no instant film.","this is a good Instax camera. i never really liked the other models...i had a 25 and a wide '120, i think...toys in my opinion. so i now have an old 500af which i really like and the new 90...which i really like. Instax photography if such fun.","Nice design, features, and film is cheap(compared to other Polaroid cameras). Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and although she hasn't fiddled around with it yet, she loves it. Best polaroid camera on the market in my opinion.","I've owned the mini 7s, 210 and the mini 25. I love the instant gratification but was frustrated over the limited capabilities. I just got my Mini 90 and I LOVE it. The features are great, the modes are so helpful, there's a macro setting and the battery is rechargeable (used to be a hassle to run and get new batteries every time). I highly recommend this model If you don't have an instax yet, get this one.","This is my first polaroid cam and I love it. It has more functionality that previous models that is perfect for experimenting effects on photos. I'm referring to exposure modes added to it. Picture quality is perfect, meant to last a lifetime. I might be exaggerating, but I really love this product though a bit pricey.","This is a very nicely made instant camera. It just like the Polaroids of years past and made just like their higher-end products. This camera is made of very high grade materials as opposed to the much cheaper plastic models of this of the mini instax. I believe that Fuji used a higher grade lens as the photos are sharper and the colors are rendered much better to my eye.<br /><br />The instax film is very fast developing with beautiful colors. Both Fuji and Polaroid long ago had perfected this product -  beautiful colors.<br /><br />Kids today are fascinated with these instant developing cameras - my grandson loves his digitals but there is a little bit of magic in the instant photograph!!!<br /><br />I bought mine from a Amz merchant in Japan --shipped quickly and had it in 3 days after shipped<br /><br />Lots of fun!!.<br /><br />The A/C battery charger works perfectly in the USA no adapter needed."]},{"name":"Fujifilm Instax Mini 25 Instant Film Camera","amazon_reviews":["A lot of reviews say this didn't come with the two CR2 batteries required, mine did.<br />I decided to get this instead of the 8 because this has a digital readout of film left as well as better auto focus and automatic shutter modes.<br /><br />My only complaint is that looking through the viewfinder can be a little difficult and you have to get the right angle in order to see through it.<br />Maybe I just need to get used to it.","The camera is great, but i'm really upset because my camera didnt come with a  lens case. A real bummer. They put it in plastic bubble wrap (like i wanna carry that around). The images above have lens cases, dont know why i didnt recive a case.

I took it to a party and the next day almost everyone bought their own. :)","Bought as a gift. She uses it all the time and loves it!","This is by far the best thing I've ever purchased!! I'm an international flight attendant and this lil puppy goes everywhere with me. I've taken it around the world for 3.5years and it's still kicking! I've compared it to the 8 and it seems to be built to last. Not flimsy. I use it constantly and have only had to change the batteries maybe every year and a half.<br />Strongly recommend.<br /><br />P.s. If you ever get to Japan film is around $6-8 a box (10frames)","So fun and easy to use. Make great little photographs for scrapbooking","Bought this camera for my sister and she absolutely loves it. The pricing is not too bad and the quality of the photos are great. This makes a great gift for kids and teens!","Just what I needed","We love it. Our Daughter loves it. Sorry for the late review. I responded but don't know why it never went through!!","good item","Purchased this as a gift for my lady to replace her older Fujifilm polaroid. This is a great camera in all ways, for the price. The lens is good quality and with a steady hand, takes good clear photos. The flash is adjustable, which is a great quality to control for polaroids. The included lenses are a nice touch too. Basically, if you have an older model and are looking to upgrade without breaking the bank I highly recommend this camera.","The automatic light settings make taking photos easier!","I have really enjoyed this camera for occasional use. I use it for my pocket scrapbooking pages. However the instructions were not in English, so I had to figure it out on my own. It wasn't too hard, but that was a downer. This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Also the film is a bit expensive. The pictures are lower quality as you would expect from an instant camera. I find I rarely use it because of the cost of film. I don't recommend this for a regular camera. More for a fun occasional use.","This little camera works great, just as described.","Love the film","Great camera","Great gift for my daughter. She loves it. Film gets expensive.","I love it! Got it as a gift for a friend, couldn't wait so opened it myself. hehe<br />I just ordered a black one for myself!<br /><br />Its amazing!!!<br /><br />4 stars because I had to google its manual.

Quite robust too. Dropped a few times, and it still works. Hardly any scratches.","great picture but image way too small","send flim for free will be great","Very cool Polaroid camera! This takes mini Polaroid pictures. I love the zoom feature and that it is available in many different colors. The only drawback is the price of polaroid film, it's a bit on the pricy side.","My daughter has a lot of fun with this camera. Unfortunately pictures comes out not too good sometimes.","We bought this for my nieces B-Day and she loved it.  But note the film does get expensive.","I love this camera, the only thing that stinks is how expensive the film is, other then that, very happy with my purchase!","fun!","Very fun to play with","Didn't arrive on time, but love it.","among the instax models, this is the best in terms of value for money. it's a bit bulky to bring everywhere but hey, instant prints don't come easy!","Excelente product, my wife love it","Fun camera to take on day trips or vacations. Snaps fun sized instant pictures to share or use for arts & crafts, smash booking, etc. My wife loves it. This one is a good price to performance ratio versus the high end and the lowest tier of these cameras. Recommend","I've had this for almost two years and I love it! I bring it everywhere I go just in case there's a special moment I would like to capture and I always get compliments from random people when I ask for them to take a photo of me. I've taken over a hundred photos and there hasn't been any problems except that my battery died. I don't think there's much of a difference between this and the instax mini 8 except for an additional mirror in the front and different shaped buttons. Pictures are credit card sized. The only flaw is that you can't switch films (I use designed ones sometimes) and if you do, you'll waste one film because the image count resets and the camera thinks that the next film is a throwaway.<br />TIPS that I wish I knew when I first bought this:<br />-!!!DO NOT!!! open and close the film slot because it will reset your film count and the next picture you take will slide right out without producing an image.<br />-Make sure your fingers aren't blocking the flash.<br />-You can set the flash settings, but it doesn't really make a difference. The camera will automatically set the flash setting regardless of what you selected. Ex: when taking a picture at night, the flash will automatically set even if you didn't set that, and with good lighting, the flash will not turn on even if you set the flash on.","Way cute, my daughter loves it!","I love this little thing! If the pictures come out blurry, there's a big chance that it's the user, not the camera. Having digital cameras & cell phones makes you forget to adjust setting for certain pictures. So remember to pay attention to settings and distance & it will be fine!","Super cute, well built and works great!  I love it!  No instructions in English, but it's simple enough to use and there are tutorials on YouTube.  It's a fun camera to have for sharing photos with friends and family.  I'm Happy!","fast shipping item exactly as  described","Great camera","It is a bit tricky to get the pictures JUST right. But well worth it!","Thank you-excellent product","My daughter loves it","Very fragile. This is my third camera. Don't drop it or knock it on anything...","Love having pictures on hand again.

But really need to play with it more to get better pic quality","I was in love with this camera. It is so convenient that I would capture the instant memories with all my beloved people. I had for a year, the color of the photos came out really good and I love the have almost the same function as the regular camera. You can adjust the color of the photos either light or dark. I would recommended it to whom love taking photos and great ways to decorate these photos on little corner of your room.","Was very excited to receive this camera.  Very easy start up and easy usage.  My intention was to use this camera to take photo booth photos at my kids birthday party.  I wound up taking more impromptu photos to give the parents on the spot.  I honestly wasn't too thrilled with the camera.  The actual photo area was very small and colors not true, but works for quick pictures.  If it weren't for the film that was kind of expensive, I would give the camera to my kids to take selfies...","Awesome camera! Overnight shipping, but didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for it! My daughter hasn't put down the camera since receiving it. She cannot wait to take it on vacation!","cute, works well and came with batteries , arrived early as well","I bought this camera for my 17-year-old daughter, who suddenly needed to have it because, in the rush of sentimentality after graduation, she wants to create a photo collage of friends and they MUST be instant-style photos. After briefly researching options, I chose this camera for its features, light weight, and compactness. I ordered the camera on May 29 and kept hoping for the best despite no immediate shipping information being available. I couldn't believe it when the camera arrived June 2. Wow! My daughter loves the camera. I am more than pleased with the promptness of the delivery.

Love it. Who doesn't like instant EVERYthing these days?","compared to mini8 this has less bulk and is smaller. But i personally like the\"body build\" of the mini 8. This is made of diff material somewhat shiny. I cant sayre qualityof photo but you can take selfies. I made a mistake of buying additional selfie attachment which youdont actuallyneed bec this already has one built in.","Love it!","An adorable camera! We bought this for our 10 year old daughter for Christmas, and it was with out a doubt her favorite present! Takes great pictures for such a small camera. We bought her a solid camera case, which is great because she takes this camera to many places. Unfortunately the film is expensive, or she would use it much more. It's a great camera and for a great price! Love, love, love it!","This is a blast at any party!","I am having a lot of fun with this camera. The picture quality is like any instant/Polaroid, but the photo size is about like a credit card. Really great for taking on trips and getting some interesting pictures that won't end up lost on a hard drive. This model has a small mirror on the front for taking selfies.","The camera is great. She loves it and no complains yet","Great","Very awesome","great quality and wonderful delivery time.<br />thank you.","Love it.  Compact and easy to use.  Several people have asked me where I got it.","funny","fast shipping and great product","I love that I now have a way to physically document my boring life. However, this camera is awesome for doing distance photos, but the closer you are to your subject, the harder it is to center it. This is due to the viewfinder and the actual lens being in different places. I think it's off by like 1/4th of an inch or something. But this can easily be fixed by tilting your camera a certain way.","Fun stuff! I have enjoyed taking the little instant photos.","Daughter loves it","I absolutely love this camera! Very fun and people are very intrigued by it and its modern design. Would definitely recommend.","So cute and takes great pics!","smaller than i thought and cute","My daughter loves this camera. I used it and took a few selfies and it is good for a polaroid. Awesome.","The pictures are a little small but, I love it!","this camera is so great and nostalgic!

She's bought over 100 films just for this product.","good one!","is hard to learn how to used it, but is a sweet item to have","much smaller and lighter than it seems, easier to hold than the 8, super duper CUTE!! I'm SO in love with this camera!! the little mirror at the lens is super helpful as well!","in love with my camera","Very fun!","I've been wanting this camera for a while and it was worth the wait! Highly recommend it!","This camera took good pictures. It surprised me for the lense: they can make distance further for you to take a picture for self-shooting.<br />You can hold your camera vertically or horizontally. You can choose if you want your picture to be darker or lighter.<br />Very easy to replace films.<br />The best purchase I could do.","It meet my expectation. I love it.","Great, 10 year old likes it. Will give it as a gift, so we have not tried it out as yet.","Bought for my kids. I can't stand the instant waste concept, but they are enjoying the novelty I didn't care much for in the 70's when it was first popular.","It delivered really fast. And the product is the exact one shown on the picture, we loved it. :)","I LOVE IT!!!","got it for my girl. took it to yellowstone and got some good instant pics like the old days","Of all the instant print cameras I have bought this one is without a doubt the best. Great picture quality, easy to use. I previously had the Polaroid Z2300 and the Fujifilm Instax mini 8. Both were decent but no where near as simple, nostalgic and nice as this camera.","Great instant camera. The selfies were a hit  Used it at my niece's graduation party. I made a scrapbook with the pictures to send to her father who is serving overseas. The camera was well worth it. Now everyone wants one.","BEST CAMERA!!!! I made a photo booth for me wedding using this camera ...HUGE HIT!!!","fast shipping~camera look so cute and works perfect!You must have~!","Excellent gift ! esp for my teenager.","very good camera","Only half of my pictures developed, the others stayed black.","I got this as a gift for my gradndaughter on her birthday. She was wanting one, as a friend had one. She uses her I-pod for taking digital pictures but thought she would like using small pictures from this camara for decorating her wallboad in her bedroom.","My 13 year old daughter loves this so much. She immediately shares the printed pictures to her friends or relatives right after having the pictures with them","very good, i like it!","I bring it everywhere with me~!","Am going to go broke here, purchasing more and more film to use this camera. I LOVE IT! When it arrived, it was not broken, it worked as it should, instructions were clear and not too many and I feel like I am in the 70s although I was nowhere near being born! The picture quality is also much clearer than I expected, if you take the picture using the right settings on the camera and angle. Also the selfie feature is so charming! Definitely going to get a nice cover and other things to complement this camera because it is my new baby.","The best !!!!! Fun, easy and so nice.","Cutest camera ever! Loved it","Nice Camera. It arrived in time. Fast and simple.","Love this! I like how it's a little but smaller than the instax 8. And it was a hit at the wedding! Easy to use!","It's cute. it's nice for selfies but it is only nice for selfies. The group and landscape photos are not clear at all.","really fun, great to use casually. but one thing i quite dislike about this instax model in particular is that there is no option to turn off the flash, which is a tad annoying because the camera will force flash in situations where you would not like an artificial light source. also no self timer and that \"close up\" lens they provide for you isn't quite up to par because you won't be looking into the viewfinder to shoot said shot; really finnicky \"close up lens\"! if i were you, i would save up to purchase the fuji mini 90 neo classic! that's what i call a superb instant camera","this camera is sick, my only gripes with it are that if you open the back the film counter on the camera resets, and you can't turn off the flash, but besides that the photos come out great and everyone really loves it, especially me","go with this model to eliminate the manual adjustment concerns.  Takes great pictures.  Seller meets expectations.","The photos are actually surprisingly impressive quality, and print and develop really quickly!  Easy to use, easy to set up, and easy to show off.  The batteries are an odd size I'll probably have to order from Amazon when they die (whatever, they'll probably last forever since this doesn't have crazy screens and technology in it like other cameras nowadays) but that's totally fine with me!  I know we expect big photos like with Polaroid, but this is not Polaroid.  A really nice product for today's day and age, great for collaging and scrapbooking!","This camera and the pictures it takes is so freakin adorable. The camera has a decent weight to feel solid without being a burden to carry. Every picture it takes is so flattering and the instant gratification of holding that mini pic can't be beat. For ~$100, you can get the camera, a 2-pack of film, and even a protection plan. Just do it.","This is a super fun camera to have on hand.  I've used it at bridal showers, and kids parties so they can take home a souvenir party pic.  Yes, the film is slightly pricey but its FUN!  The colors turn our fairly accurate and it's a great size for stuffing into thank you notes or for a scrapbook. The pictures are more wallet size than the traditional Poloraid square pics.","Just as expected in a short time. Very happy.<br /><br />Take it or leave it, this is our experience with the purchase.","This is a fun camera and takes really great pictures! My teenage sons said it was like having \"trading cards\" to share. They bought this for me for Mother's Day and we had a ball taking goofy photos and watching them develop. For kids of today's digital generation, this little camera is a great way to let them hold a photo in their hands immediately to keep or share. Plus, it is considered \"cool\" in the teen scene.","Got this for my daughter.. She loves it,  easy to load and use, cute little photos. At about 75 cent a pic, she learned to think a bit before taking the shot. When she is with her friends, it's a big hit. She likes putting the pix on her note board.These sort of have the same appeal as the photo booth strips, sort of a nostalgic icon that you tape  or pin to something and look at for years, reminding you of a good day, can't be duplicated on a digital screen.","Great little fun camera.  Purchased 2 for fun wedding pictures taken from guests.  Everyone was able to use it, very easy to set up, use and the little pictures were great.  Would recommend for fun events.  Much less than a photo booth...","I bought this as a gift for someone who likes instant pictures. She loves the look and feel of this camera.","Very easy to use and set up.  I also reviewed a tutorial on line.  this is one cute camera and you'll love it if you were a kid in the late 60's/70's with polaroids.  New funky fresh take on the polaroid type camera.  Love that it has a little mirror on the front for selfies!  Has a window which shows how much film is left and you can pick your exposure light to dark.  Pictures are about the size of a credit card and come out pretty nice.  Don't expect the quality of a SLR or digital type camera.  This is meant to be what it is - a fun camera.  Comes with a strap to attach and 2 CR batteries.  The film isn't cheap, but it's a novelty type camera and you expect that.  I do wish it at least came with a 10 pack of film.","I gave this to my 13 year old sister for Christmas. It has held up quite nicely, and it takes great photos.<br />Kids these days don't really know how precious physical photographs can be, and I'm glad my sister is getting to realize that.<br /><br />It's a fun toy for younger kids","This really makes parties a lot of fun.  Everyone wants a photo, and its so novel in the digital age.","I got this and took it to Burning Man to gift people pictures of themselves. It is very durable and takes awesome little pictures. I am very happy with this product!","This camera is so amazing and I do not regret buying it; It was a big hit in school and everyone wanted to take a picture. The only down side is that the film for it is so expensive! It's almost a dollar for each picture. Nonetheless, I love this camera and I'm glad I bought it!","Great little toy.  I love this thing because I love the fact that it takes photos that are like the ones in the past.  So small and so easy to use.  Just a bit pricey for the refills.","I love the camera! so fun and convenient to get instant photos. Perfect for scrapbooking. Just have to make sure you use the right settings.","It is a gift for my friend~My friend loves it so much~it looks cute! I think my friend will take a lot of beautiful pictures~","I'm so happy I purchased this. Taking pictures and the quality of this camera is very nice. I was surprised at how easy it was to use this and to refill on new photos.","Perfect little camara for some fun pics! This one is nice bc my daughter can take pictures of herself with the added mirror  for \"selfies\"! The basic version does not have that.","I bought 4 of these cameras for Christmas for my daughters and I.  Age range 8-16.  We all love them, and will be using them continuously.","bought this for my bf for valentines day and he loves it! we've used it a couple times and totally loving the selfie mirror function in the front ;P i've always wanted a polaroid for myself so why not get one for le boyfriend and i can just \"borrow\" it when i need it. hehe","LOVE this thing!  I had not had a polaroid for some time and thought this would be cute.  Its fun for little parties or outings with the family.","I love it. Although the outcome is not that \"HD\" quality. Its okay for souvenir photos. I will recommend it.","Birthday present for 13 year old girl - she loves it!! Makes great pictures for her pin board. Film costs abit high, but the quality of the prints are fabulous and she's had a lot of fun with it. Did a lot of research on the different models and agree that the quality of these shots is very good for the cost.","pictures are small but come out super cute! If you carry a small bag, might be hard to carry around. I like bigger bags, so i take it with me everywhere.","I love it! The only problem is that film can be very pricey for a college student. Still I enjoy it and the investment in the film pays off.","Oh what a fun camera! Works pretty good. Pictures are clear. I like the way the camera lens closes itself up when you turn if off. I recommend the Fujifilm neoprene camera case that was made for this camera.","My niece loves her camera and I have to say, I covet it.","I like this product:)<br />It is pretty as that picture shown.<br />Thank you for providing this product in cheaper price.","I bought this instant camera for my bestfriend in her birthday, she loved it, and the price is very good too.","I bought this camera for my girlfriend on valentine's day and I gotta say, best investment ever. This camera is really compact and is really simple to use. I never used the lighten or darken effects but the regular pictures turn it quite well regardless if it was light or dark. However, the one time I did use the lighten and darken effects, I got a picture of a COMPLETELY black and white film. I suppose it was a film defect but overall, this product is amazing and recommended","This was a birthday present for my five year old. I am not sure who loves it more! The whole family enjoys this thing, and we get questions and compliments everywhere we go. It is incredible fun! This review is strictly for the camera. The drawback is the film. It is expensive, and occasionally a pack is faulty. If I were rating the film, I would give it 3 stars. Back to the camera, I highly recommend this, especially for children.","I bought it for my gf. She loves it so much. And the price is fair. A good gift for anyone.","Wish that the pixels for the pictures were higher as I cannot enlarge them when I scan them to my computer for use in other media.","I purchased this as a prop to add whimsy to some of my business presentations as I am an Event Planner. Every time, I use this people are so impressed and like the old-school idea made new! I also purchased the carrying case and it is so great to have in my bag of tricks to keep everyone engaged.","Great instant camera. I absolutely love it. Brought this camera to my high school reunion, and I got a lot of good comments from my friends.","I thought it was going to break in the mail as described from the other viewers but its amazing !!","The camera is awesome. I've never used any other ones so I can't really compare. But this one works great for me and my girlfriend loved it. We take pictures during events, very useful!","It is actually perfect for anyone wanting images right then and there.  We purchased as a gift for our teenage daughter and she loves it.  You can buy film with different borders and in different colors, which makes it fun.  It is easy to use and within minutes of taking it out of the box, she was snapping photos.  And remember, you don't have to wave the film to get the image!","Cells phones were not allowed at the 8th grade dance (which to my picture snapping niece was the end of the world) so I got her this Fujifilm Instax MINI.  And it was the HIT OF THE DANCE.  The kids were amazed and fascinated,  The adults were nostalgic because it brought back fond memories of Polaroids.<br /><br />As for the camera itself, it is sturdy but still light, and once you decipher the Japanese \"instruction\" icons, loading the film into the camera is easy and stress free.  Picture quality isn't the greatest, but good enough for kids.  The film can get expensive, especially if you buy the novelty film with rainbow colors, stars, and smiley faces, but it is worth it to see the dumbfounded look on the kid's faces when a hard-copy print pops out of the camera.","Maybe I didn't read the product description that carefully, so I got a nice surprise when I opened the package and found a detachable macro lens.","Gave this as sort of a desperation Christmas gift.  It turned out to be a big hit.  It was a lot of fun and we had some good laughs.","My daughter had been debating which of the instax mini to get and after much research, both online and in store, this was the chosen one. Very compact and economical. We saved up to 40% purchasing online which meant we could also purchase the carry case and additional film packs.","Got this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. I can be used for a variety of occasions ie. family gatherings, kids parties, selfies. Only annoyance is that it is rather larger and clunky in the hand and may be hard to move around but good thing there is a wrist strap to prevent it from hitting the floor.","We are having so much fun with this camera.  I originally bought this to use for a kids Christmas get-together.  The kids were making photo ornaments and thought it would be great to take their pictures as part of the experience.  It was lots of fun and the kids were amazed that they got the pictures instantly.  They are so used to this digital era, they never even heard of a Polaroid.<br /><br />It has been a hit at several more adult get-togethers!  Everyone loves the instant photo in their hand!  The film is a little expensive but it is definitely worth it.... But we have been able to pick up film a dollar or less per photo.  We are very happy with this purchase.","This is the one!!!<br />I really wanted to get Mini 8 since it comes with multiple color choices- but everything else, Mini 25 is far better than Mini 8.<br />i am completely satisfied with this purchase!","I like the camera, but the automatic flash is a hassle. Even when the place is well lit, the flash goes on. Sometimes it ruins the picture.","I've been wanting this camera for awhile and I finally decided to buy it. The shipping was extremely slow, past the estimated shipping date. I've only had it for one day and I already have scratches on it. I'm not sure if it already was on there or not. I haven't even been able to use to properly yet and it has scratches. I love it but the downside is that it's prone to scratches.","I bought the polaroid version of this for my wedding, which was more expensive, ugly, and didn't have a digital reader.  this is better and cuter","I love the 25s camera and i also have a 7 too. They are both cool and i recommended to someone who love instant camera","Be the life of the party with this camera!  It's a great fun way to capture the memories of now, for later!  I love how there's two shutter buttons, one for horizontal shooting and one for vertical shooting.  It's very easy to use and even comes with a close up mini macro lens for closer up shots.  Worth the money!","Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present after trying real hard to determine which of the models to get.  This was a stunning winner.  Its a bit smaller than the other models and has a bunch of other features.  The construction is the same as the other, but its a bit lighter too.  Only drawback is it doesnt appear to come in as many colors as the other models.  I had to get white because there was no pink but I still rate it as a 5 star product.  And Amazon's product delivery was timely and amazing!","This worked perfectly at our wedding and our guests loved it.  Everyone was able to figure it out quickly and even take selfies. There were no wasted bad photos. Every photo turned out great even in low light conditions.  I would highly recommend this instant camera!","Bought this on a whim. As a photographer, I have thousands of photos, but in this digital age, manage to make very few prints for fun. This bad boy is a fun cure to that. Easy to use. When paired with fujifilm Instax, skin is smooth, beautifully colored, and ultimately flawless. And it's just so fun watching the end result develop in my hand.<br /><br />Great at parties, great on trips, great at bars, but my favorite time to use it is in front of young teens and kids who've never seen a film camera, let alone an INSTANT film camera, in person. Guaranteed to be the life of the party, be ready because this camera does turns heads. And the very best part is finally having enough physical photos to bring back the art of photo albuming.","It has been a good way to show my photos and also a way to show with people who I am.","Bought this camera for my son for Christmas.  He loves it and so do I.  He is constantly taking pictures with it.","I bought this camera as a birthday gift for my 14 year-old daughter.  She LOVES it!  She takes it with her on trips, to events (concerts, the fair, etc.) and loves taking photos with it.  She's always getting questions about it and everyone always wants their picture taken with it.  I think in this age of digital photos, people forgot how great having a one-of-a-kind photograph is such a treasure.  Definitely buy a camera case for this (we bought the International Supplies Mini Zippered Camera Case for the FUJIFILM INSTAX....enough room for the camera, special lens and package of extra film).  The film and camera are expensive, but it's been a special experience owning such a fun, unique item.","So I love the idea of the throw back Polaroid cameras. I got this one and was super stoked I pulled it out of the box and started snapping away. My friends and I took it to a party and everyone had a great time with it. However the film gets jammed, so I sent it back (thinking it was faulty) get my new camera and the same thing! Jammed film at picture number 6 or 7. So basically I waste so much money on film on this camera it's a bummer.","My daughter loved the look of this camera & the pictures, although small, come out very cute. She & her friends are having a lot of fun with it.","This was my 16 year old daughter's favorite christmas gift.  It's fun and takes amazing little pictures.  She especially likes the little mirror on the front so she can see herself and her friends before the shot is taken.","I ordered this camera to be able to take quick photos with friends and family, or of my kids at school. The camera is easy to use and so much fun! You have to take into account that this camera is really only good for well-lit areas. It comes with a close-up lens that attaches to the lens on the camera but I have not used it yet. I ordered my camera in white and have carried it in my purse without a case and so far it is still a bright, clean white and is scratch free. The quality of the pictures is relatively good though again, you should take pictures in well-lit areas. I really enjoy this camera! Great way to quickly document special moments. :)","fun to share with friends, wish i bought a carrying case to go with it!  film is also pretty expensive, but cheaper on amazon than other places","It was a Christmas present for my wife, and she absolutely loves it. It's a very nice camera and the photos look great. I highly recommend it.","Great size, attractive camera, lots of fun with polaroids and takes great shots. Handy little mirror on the front for taking photographs with friends. Comes with detachable lens.","Its perfect ! Wish it could contain more film on the camera and didn't use weird batteries but I still love it!","This is really fun for my 11 year old. She had no idea what an instant film camera was but she was super surprised when she saw how the picture comes out right away. I also bought one for my 14 year old- she said, 'how did you know I wanted this!' Make sure you have the flash on during dim lighting otherwise the picture won't develop and you'll waste your film. Speaking of the film, the camera doesn't come with film so make sure you get some (and extra) because the kids are going to be taking a lot of fun pictures!","Fuji Instax MINI is so fun. I really enjoy using this camera for taking creative, well thought out shots for a project I'm working on. Sturdy and fun too","It is exactly like the picture and it came on time! The camera worked just fine and quality is on point","This is the best camera ever!!! it came in a well protected package, and everything is working just perfectly. Photos come out in a great quality! Its just perfect.","If you are deciding between the mini and the wide, I have both and the mini is MUCH lighter and more portable (although it is still way less portable than a digital camera). The pictures are credit card-sized and are really cute.","Very easy to use. This one also has a little mirror in the front which is good for people who like to take the picture by themselves. Classic Instax as always. It's convenient to carry around and snap quick shots that will be available right away!","LOVE THE CAMERA! CANNOT TELL ENOUGH HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS BABY! it's light weight and cute and the photos are just amazing. there is no other place i can find this kind of price. Thank you!","We used these to make a \"Guest Book\" at our wedding and really enjoyed having them-- vintage and fun.  Film did get expensive (cheaper than Polaroid would have been, though), but we intend to use them in the future for other parties and other shenanigans.","The camera itself is very nice and sturdy. The design is quite adorable and I've had people try it and want one for themselves. It's a good alternative to using a digital camera. The only downside is that it gets to be quite expensive, depending on how often you use it (film).","I love my instax mini, the only thing I wish I could change is the price of the film refills. The picture quality in the photos is very clear and colorful though.","My wife is a professional photographer, and she loves the way this camera takes pictures.  It fits nicley in the hand and feels real solid.  Film can get quite pricey so you have to watch what you photograph, which is the only negative I can see.","Thank you. Product it is what it described.<br />Fast delivery. I love mini instant film camera.<br />thank you very much!","great product! i can put it in my little bag and bring it with me to anywhere i want!! I have nothing to complain.","When the camera arrived the box was damaged, which is why I gave it 4 stars, but other than that it's perfect! The shipping was fast and the package came a day earlier. Remember to buy film along with the camera. It's pretty self-explanatory and easy to use. The design is very simple and anyone can learn how to use it within minutes. It's 10 times better than taking pictures with a digital camera!","I like it and it is very easy to use. Very fast and high quality. I will recommend to others.","chose this for my daughters wedding.  Had my nephew take pictures of each couple as they arrived.  there was a table with sharpee markers for the couples to put messages on cards that come with a Becky higgins small mini album.  every couple gave a message of love on the cards, put their name on the bottom of the picture and this became her guest list book.  what a gift!  check out becky higgins project life- these pictures fit perfectly in the sleeves.  Make sure you take the pictures so that they are the long way not the wide way.  you can take pictures with this camera either way.  quality of pictures is pretty good for an instant camera.  easy way to capture the moment.  my daughter and husband loved the album.  I got it in white- very sassy .","I love this Instax camera. It's small and portable and has a neat self-camera in the front so you can try to make sure you don't cut off your head when you take the photo. There's a variety of features to use and it comes with batteries and a string to attach to the camera. It didn't come with film so I had to order those separately which sucks because I couldn't use it right away when the camera came. I love the look of it because it's simple and cute. I'm going to add stickers to it later to personalize it.","There are too many people to say nice. I always wanna get one. Finally, I got it. That is so good.","A total hit at my wedding. Such a great little camera. Easy to use right out of the package. Be sure to have batteries.","I purchased this one cause my friend has a similar one (but the one she has is Hello Kitty which I hate the most).<br />This camera works perfect! they took beautiful picture even without make up! I always use this one to take picture in any special day.","i Like this thing, like the Products said, and very easy to use, it should be genuine. We recommend everyone to use it.","This is the ultimate party trick. I've brought it to concerts, on nights out with my friends, and just about everywhere. Everyone is absolutely amazed and fascinated. It's just so much fun. The camera is small enough to throw in my satchel and light enough so it doesn't weigh me down during the night. The pictures turn out credit card size. It's amazing to use during the daytime and it captures the right amount of light. I've dropped it a few times and it still works good as new. I would definitely buy it as a gift as well.","LOVE IT! this was a hit at a BBQ party we threw a few weeks ago. so fun, and instant gratification. I recommend this model if you're looking to get a instant camera, the settings are great, the flash is great. every picture turns out!","Bought it as a gift to my wife, even though she doesnt really use it anymore she still has fun with it when she does","I love this camera, my twin girls enjoy it so much on their birthday! we gave the pictures to the guests and everyone was asking where I got it. the only bad thing is that the film is about $1 each picture :(","I got this on the amazon deals. which at that point of time was selling for less than $70. I have the old MINI 7, which has pretty basic features and couldn't even turn off the flash.<br /><br />With this I can, in my opinion that is a very  important features, because films are costly so you wouldn't want to have one that is over or under exposed. And is much lighter too. It has a slightly slimmer profile compared to the 7. And the only issue is that it doesn't run on the regular AA or AAA batteries, you have to get those special short and tiny ones (not too sure if that is a propriety special battery but I do know that there are cheaper alternatives that work just as fine.","Love this camera, helped me recorded so many good memories, only thing is if only it can preview the result then print out the film, then some bad pics won't waste the film. Also this battery can't be charged, although batteries last a long time.","Cool camera with great colours. easy to use.<br />Cool to instant print your favourite pictures.<br />Nothing more to say. Simply Great.","Great deal! you should definitely order this, haven't had a problem with it, they're amazing.<br />I'm in love with this product. people seem to love it.","Good instant camera the same as Polaroid, one thing is that images are really small but I already knew that","I reaceived this camera earlier than what is the expected date. It is a gift to my sister for her birthday and she loves it!","I have been use it for over half year. It is good to use. Of cause, it need some skills to make good picture. The battery is great. so far I still use the original battery.","Perfect camera for fun and to make memories with. It got dropped and bounced on concrete and no longer works. very sad. Also sometimes the flash doesnt go off and the film comes out pitch black and i just wasted a dollar on that film.","The camera is portable, lightweight and easy to use. It has great features. I recommend this to all my friends!","It is rather expensive with the film but we bought this for our wedding (each couple took a photo upon arrival to replace the spot where their seating assignment was) and it was a great hit!  Not to mention my 7 year old loves it too....easy to use and lots of fun for everyone!","Fast shipping.<br />Well packaged. Had battery, macro lens, and a strap.<br />Had no problems so far. It looks more nice than the older version of the camera.","Absolutely fascinated by this little beauty. Wanted a Polaroid-type of camera for quite some time now and was deciding between 25s and the 210, but went with the mini because regardless of the small credit card size pictures (which is kind of cute) the camera met all of my expectations. It's the perfect camera for a beginner photographer who wants to experience the beauty of instax photos, it's much easier to use than the 210. It's also much smaller and can fit into any bag which is handy for a traveller like me. In others words, I recommend :)","I love this camera!!! It takes awesome photos and everybody loves it! I can't wait to take photos in the weeding that I have coming up!","compared to the mini7's, this is much smaller and lighter. It is also very easy to use and I really liked the extra button it has allowing me to shoot in landscape mode a lot easier. It has two settings, one to take photos in lighter, or darker areas, and the rest is automatic. Its a good camera and best instafilm camera for its price.","This camera is fun!  It was a big hit at my wedding.  It is compact, easy to use, and just really really fun!","I used this little instant camera and created my own photo booth at my Grandduaghter birthday party, what a hit it was.","I really like this camera. The pictures come out really nicely and it's definitely more unique than using an iphone camera or something else. The downside is that the film is pretty expensive, but it's worth the purchase for the one-of-a-kind experience","I bought this camera for my fiance and I to use in Brazil. She loved it! It was great to make nostalgic memories. I read reviews on amazon and a few other places about the Instax line of cameras and the MINI 25 stood out to me as the best. The reviews were right! If you are looking for your first instant film camera for personal use this one is it!","Lovely 'new style' of Polaroid camera! Will work perfectly for the party we're going to have. Instant photos all around!","i love this camera! I take it every where I go. the only downside is NEVER drop it without a case. it will break and make funny noises.<br /><br />other than that its great.","This is a really fun camera to use. Getting little 'Polaroid-type' pictures that pop right out of the camera is really novel and cool. The picture quality is ok, though nowhere near as clear as pictures taken with digital cameras, but that's to be expected. My wife uses this camera for special occasions. It is too big to fit in your pocket but it's not unwieldy in your hands.","It's super nostalgic, works well, and puts a smile on everyone's face (no pun...no, really, no pun).  So much fun.","If you, like me, grew up with polaroid cameras, this phone is totally worth it. There's something pure about taking a picture and getting what you get. Digital images give us too much power to alter or ever delete. This camera show things be what they are, and, in my eyes, it captures the moment in a more pure form.","This is my favorite camera! The expense of the film kind of bites, but I love the product so much I just use it sparingly to conserve my money. It's great for scrapbooking and Project Life. I love that I can instantly stick the pictures in my books.","I wanna it for a long time! haha  It works very well.I will keep using it! I really love it","Easy to use, no particular flaw.<br />Just that the color is not as dramatic as I thought. And you can't turn off the flash -- that's kind of bothering.","it looks clean and sleek. i was amazed how tiny it was. it is not that heavy. it is really easy to carry around.","This camera is perfect for trips, parties, and really any thing that you would love to have a portable memory of. The pictures are credit card sized and are actually pretty cool because you can fit them into your wallet, but just as easily combine them for a collage or scrapbook or something. Every single place I've brought this thing, it's been a hit, and people love taking instant pictures that they can carry around with them everywhere. Almost like a portable photo booth, but B.Y.O.P. (Bring Your Own Props). The only downside to this camera is that if you use it a whole lot, the film packs can get pretty expensive, and they sort of fluctuate on pricing from time to time. But hey, if a picture is worth a thousand words, then the memories made from the pictures are absolutely priceless!","I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because her brother had one and she wanted one. She was not disappointed, she loved it and uses it often.","Bought this for my wife and she has had a ton of fun with it. The prints are too light outdoors but I guess that is where the \"Dark\" button comes in handy, When using that \"D\" option the outdoors prints are good. Also the viewfinder crops a good bit from the top of the frame upon printing. Once you get used to it you learn to account for it. Still a wonderful camera and still worthy of 4 stars because you would not expect a fun camera like this to be perfect.","It's fun to play with and it can print out the pics instantly. But the speed is a little bit slow.","I like the scrapbook so I got this as a cute idea to add to my scrapbook. MY FAV part is the mirror on the front! I use this camera to take pics of me and my Fiancee so majority of the time were taking it of ourselves. The mirror helps so much with letting us know if were cutting anyone off. Which is great since once you click it prints! People love to see the old polaroid style camera back. I get tons of compliments","This is a wonderful camera! We have so much fun with it and are happy to have the pictures instantly!","Perfect for my trip. I would recommend this item to anyone! People all comment on how cute the size of the pictures are (credit card sized). The camera is not compact, but the pictures are so perfect, I didnt mind carrying it around in my bag during my vacation in Tokyo. I will never travel anywhere again with out this, perfect for scrap booking and catching instant memories.","Got just what I needed - can't complain when it is just what you are looking for!  We used this at our wedding to have fun photos of all the guests... we loved it so much we took it on our honeymoon and can't wait to get more film for the random moments we want to capture in the day-to-day!","I am so stupid and opened the film box and wasted all my rest films. It works pretty well, not heavy, i brought to my graduation ceremony! oh, one more thing, the battery is very easy to jump out from the box. be aware!","cute camera and cute picture even self shooting. a lot of fun. wish the film and flash could be cheaper then i may bring it everyday everywhere.","It's big if compare with the digital camera but it's kind of art when you see the photo.<br />I love it. Just the film that is pricey.","We used the camera at my daughter's baby shower.  The camera was easy to use.  Although the pics were not super crisp, it was fun to get an instant photo.","People complain about the picture size, but there is an instant camera with the wider photo output. I love this camera, and I take it everywhere to take quick, fun, instant photos. I can decorate them with permanent marker and put them anywhere. (Beware of leaving the camera in the car with heat-- the photos will turn out messed up.","The package I got is just as it showed.  There isn't any problem about the camera.  Perfect item 5 stars","a present for my 8yo but so fun I use it more than anyone else!  The only drawback, I've seen the price of film steadily go up after I bought this camera. Coincidence or...","The camera is really cute, but more big than i expected... but that's ok. I recommend fujifilm instax if you like instant pictures too.","I love this camera. You should be smart about its limitations before purchasing, though. This isn't going to produce super sharp, high-quality pictures. It can produce really nice photos, but it's kind of a gamble every time you take a picture. I've taken some super cool pictures with this thing, some pretty OK ones, and others that I've had to throw away. That's kind of a bummer when the film is so expensive, but that's the deal with this kind of basic technology. I think the uncertainty is kind of fun overall, part of the analog experience. This camera is super fun to use at parties (I had it at a wedding, and it was definitely a conversation starter) because people love being able to watch the pictures develop. There's something really exciting and fun about it.<br /><br />I'd advise reading the entire manual and committing to wasting a pack or two of film when you first get it so you can figure it out. I'm still learning the best way to use this camera, but I think of that as being part of the fun.","And so expensive. But hey, it's the price you pay for nostalgia. It's also a big hit at parties. I take this with me every time I travel too. Can't have enough polaroids.","Just purchased this camera and loving it!  If you miss your original Polaroid, this camera will help fill that void.  Sure the film is smaller but it doesn't look like it will be discontinued anytime soon.  Its easy to use and film is decently priced (buy in bulk from amazon).<br /><br />I have a DSLR and iphone with 1000's of pictures.  I just have not gotten around to printing them out, like many of us.  The film is more expensive but I get prints immediately and don't have to run to a Walgreens or order prints online.  Saves me time and money.  So go buy one!!","It is what it is from the appearance and the description. Nothing appears surprised. Good condition. Easy to operate. It would be better if price goes lower :>","this camera is very good for party, people will love it.<br />dont open the film box before you use all of the films becaues u cannot take a photo after open.","I've always wanted one ever since I saw my friend with it. It kept dragging until this year, I decided to ask my siblings to chip in for it for my birthday. I've only taken pictures indoors with it but so far so good. I  can't wait to bring this on vacation with me in April and take tons of pictures with my boyfriend!","This is what i wanted for long time, and it's really good. it actually makes people more carefully when taking picture, not just randomly shot. photos are also memorable as gifts for people in it.","I was looking at al my options for the Instax and decided upon this one due to the Flash, portrait or landscape option, size, cost, and weight. You can even adjust the contrast. It is one of my favorite purchases. We initially bought it for our wedding and now it has become a treasured prize with our toddler daughter who loves to use it as well.","I love it! Great for generating lovely credit size pictures to keep! Great especially for couples! Easy to handle too! But take note though, there is no way you can switch off the flash so your pictures will probably come off too bright. But then again, who's taking professional photos with this? The pictures are good enough and I just take it as an added effect. =)","I purchased this Polaroid camera for my Disney trip because it's smaller/lighter and more portable compared with the 7S.<br /><br />This camera use intax Mini film. A fair warning, the picture is not big. It's mini size. I like it.<br /><br />Some Pro and Cons that I experienced in this Diney Trip. We took total 64 pictures. Most are good. A few are bad due to my skill and camera's limitation.<br /><br />Pro<br /><br />1. This camera took good pictures. It came with a small lens. The lens can make distance further for you to take a picture for self-shooting. ( You take a picture of yourself or whoever is in<br /><br />front of camera while you are holding camera). It has a very small mirror on the camera, so you can see yourself. This is a great feather.<br /><br />2. You can hold your camera both vertically or horizontally without worry about where the shoot button is. There are TWO shoot button. One for you to click when you holding the camera<br /><br />vertically, and another for you to click when you are holding horizontally.<br /><br />3.Films are very easy to replaced and install. I don't even know how to say it..It's just too easy that I can't write a step by step instruction here...<br /><br />4. You can choose if you want your picture to be darker or lighter. you can choose these two mode before you shoot a picture.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />1. Lack of a few extra functionality. For example, you can't turn off the flash. You can either choose automatically fire up or fire up.<br /><br />2. You can not zoom your lens. You can only move forward to your objects. You can't zoom your lens to get a closer shot.<br /><br />3. I have no idea how to use the camera to shoot a far away object at \"night\". The picture come out very very dark. ( I try lighter mode too). I don't think this camera is for you to shoot<br /><br />any landscape...you won't get a decent picture...I try to shoot the Cinderalla's castle and the giant ball in Epcot..Pictures are not great.<br /><br />Overall I really recommend this camera, but you need some practice. some tips below<br /><br />1. Never stand too far away from your objects...or you won't get a very clear and detailed picture.<br /><br />2. Only use the lens when you try to do self-shooting or need some distance from the object. The lens can help you create more distance without standing further away.<br /><br />3. It's just not for landscape shooting.<br /><br />Overall, I love it =]","I like this item very much, and there has a good little case inside, I like this experience very much","I really like the design and it works great but I wish there was a self timer. It's simple and easy to use. Other functions would be nice too though. I know the model 50 has a self timer but the design of the camera doesn't look as great as this one.","Great product! I have used it and I love it. Very easy to use.pictures print instantly.<br /><br />Bottom line- good buy","2-7-13 -- This camera is fun to take to get-togethers with friends, and they are always pleasantly surprised that instant cameras like this are still being made since Polaroid discontinued theirs.  The resolution is not as high as a regular digital camera, so the pictures don't enlarge well, but the color is quite good.  You can scan the 2 x 3-inch pictures to send people copies from your computer.  The film and C2 batteries are readily available. The camera is light and easy to use, and is the perfect party camera to give people an instant souvenir.  It seems a bit overpriced at $83, but that's my only complaint.","My husband got me this for Christmas, the pictures are priceless, I can't wait to use it at the birth of my new baby.","I always loved the Polaroid cameras when I was a kid, and this is the closest camera I have seen to what I remember. I decided to spent a little extra to get the Instax Mini 25 because I had read that it was slightly smaller and an overall better camera. The battery pack is small and I have not had to replace the batteries yet after going through 8 packs of film. The pictures also come out crystal clear. Although the pictures are a bit small, they are the perfect wallet size. Overall I am very satisfied with this camera and expect to have it for a long time.","Like it very much, easy to use. The photos is not quite big, but enough. Exactly what I expected. perfect","It is cute and Easy to use, and I like it very much. I used my mini 25 taking many lovely pics...","This was a gift to my daughter who seems to like it a lot. It is a lot of fun and initially appears to be of reasonable quality. Amazon shipping was great as always.","I really love my new camera. It came in a really good condition and I didn't have to wait too long for it to arrive with just standard shipping. I can't help bringing it everywhere and I wan to use it all the time.","this is my dream i alway wanted to buy one of these and now i had it i am really love it sooooooo much!!!!!","I bought this camera because I was looking for an easy, fun instant camera that I could share with kids.  I also wanted to be able to take some miniature shots of landscapes and street scenes.  I am an instant film enthusiast and visual artist who wishes that Polaroid film was still available.<br />I am quite happy with this camera-- it is a lot of fun and easy for kids to use.  The price is really attractive.  The mini format is amazingly cute.  Reliable film is available for it, at a price a lot lower than the new Impossible Project films for Polaroid sx-70, 600 series and Spectra... although I would be willing to pay for the Impossible Films if the quality was as high as Fuji's film quality.  The instax mini film produces images in good contrast, develops quickly (around a minute), with no special shielding or treatment needed.  The colors are a lot cooler than the old Polaroid film-- they tend towards the blues/purples and not the oranges and yellows.  The film is simple to load.  The lens does get a slightly different perspective than the viewfinder, so sometimes what you frame in the shot is not exactly what you see in the finished photo, but of course this is not a single lens reflex camera, so that is to be expected.  One other thing about the lens-- and I know there is probably some camera term for this, but I'm not sure what it is-- when you want to take a head and shoulders portrait of someone or otherwise get close up to your subject, you need to get really close to them, like 15 inches away from their face.  The viewfinder/lens otherwise frames a lot of the periphery, as if you were standing back farther than you really are.  This is really different from my SLR, but I am getting used to it.  Oh, and the camera did come with a 'close up' lens that fits over top of the camera lens.  I do find the automatic flash 'blows out' the colors and contrast of the image a bit more than I would like (I don't usually like the look of flash), but I have tried putting a piece of tape over the flash and using natural light with good results.  Last of all, I love the 'landscape' mode which focuses to infinity.  I would highly recommend to artists/photographers that you experiment with this super cute format and enjoy shooting instant film again.  If you want to get a good idea of what this camera can do, I suggest you take a look at the Fuji Instax Mini photo pool on Flickr.","My nephew loved this gift, and camera impressed me. It's sleek, cool, and fun. Make sure you buy batteries though!","It's sooo cute! And very easy to take pictures for myself! Great choice! Just hope the film will get cheaper...","I love this little camera. I have had it for a few months now and it's been working wonderfully. I would even say that if it ever broke, I would definitely buy another. I love the nostalgia of taking these cute little pictures. It's fun to use with friends and family. Takes a little bit to get good at using and capturing nice pictures (since we've all become used to digital cameras...haha). The film is much more affordable than the Polaroid Mini (I spent lots of time debating between the two). I personally think the Polaroid Mini is cuter looking but basically just a brand. This camera has exceeded my expectations and more. I am very happy I chose this one over the other and do not regret my purchase. Arrived quickly and as described. =)","We bought this for our 13 and 14 year old girls. They are having a good time taking pictures with it.","its easy to use !! all of my friends love it !! Perfect for party , the only complain is the film is expensive","dont expect SLR photos, expect yummy fun that feels good and gets a photo for your wallet :)  My wife loves it.","PERFECT, PERFECT PERFECT! The films are extremely expensive so I like to use them on special occasions but this camera is easy to use and it doesn't cost too much and it's super cute. I like it very much!","For those who are looking for a little change ;). It's super cute and will be using at a friend's event for the DIY Photo Booth.","I bought a Polaroid 600 camera and looked on amazon for film when I came across this little camera...after reading reviews and more research,I decided against getting film for the Polaroid and give this little guy a go...I am absolutely in love with it!This camera is so much fun.The pictures turn out wonderful every time.If you are a Polaroid fan,this is a must have.","This was a gift for my wife, she saw someone that had it, and I surprised her with it. She loves it. And every time we take it out, people ewww and ahhh over it.<br /><br />It is a little big, but fun, and the quality and size is a fun size... def. a good purchase. But not to be used as your only camera as the paper is expensive.","this camara is amazing it takes instant pictures and comes right out! if u have kids i recomend this camera for all people especially when you have kids you can capture all moments with them and save it you can even make a collage.","I just got one battery in the box but it supposed to be two....huh...but that's OK...so I cannot try it until I get one more battery. Maybe I will buy it tomorrow and hopefully it works well.","???????!I like it so much! Definitely recommend it. The photo size is half of the regular ones but is really cute and good quality.","I love this little instant camera! It will be a great hit at my wedding reception, and I'm excited to see it in action. It's also a reasonable price and will continuously bring me joy!","LOVE this little camera! Very light as the other reviewer's have stated. Fits perfectly in my small purse! So fun to pull it out and snap photos of friends and family and share them right on the spot! I remember my Grandmother had one of the old polaroid instant cameras 27 years ago- so I have a sentimental feeling when I use this camera as well.<br />Perfect Christmas gift!","Great modern iteration of the Polaroid camera. Prints fun smaller pictures. Film is a tad expensive, but two-packs are very reasonable online.","This camera is much better than I expected it would be, I'd been looking around for one for a while, and was going to get the 7S but definitely am happy with my choice of the 25. The photos that come out are great quality, and the camera is a reasonable size, I actually thought it would be bigger but now I'll be able to take it places. I had a few concerns about whether the film would work based on rumour, but it works fine and it was a good price as well. Overall extremely happy with this! Definitely buy from amazon, struggled to find a cheaper price and it came in 4 days!","This camera is great to take with you everywhere. Who knows when you'll see a great shot. It transforms you back to the days when you could have a tangible photo in your pocket, rather than a image on a computer screen, in a folder that you haven't opened in years. The pictures look great, and they're fun to write on and decorate. I've spent about 80 cents per picture, which is worth it for me, but whether it's worth it to you is the real question. I buy the film in bulk, so I'm free to snap away without thinking of preservation of my stock. Buy this camera if you love catching candid moments and love photography!","Great camera! Love the fact that you get instant pictures! Still experimenting to get the lighting correct for the pictures. Some of the indoor  pictures are still a little overexposed. But the camera is easy to operate. Pictures are kind of small but they are easy to carry in my purse or to send in the mail. I still have my Instamtic Polaroid camera & I miss using it! I still have old pictures from the 70's-the 90's from my old Polaroid & they still look good. They did not fade so I'm hoping these pictures last as long! Ready to buy & try the Instax 210 for larger pictures but this little camera is doing a great job!","Although this camera is a bit bulky in the hands, it's really cute. It's simple to put the film and batteries in, too. I was able to take it out, put the film and batteries in, & take a test picture in under 5mins. The test picture came out great! It looks really clear and adjust to the lighting well. So far, so good. It's the first day and I'm really happy with it, but, I plan on putting it through some abuse at my wedding so I will update how well it handles it then.","Bought this camera as a gift. It takes decent photos and develops pretty quickly. This is great for creative photo projects.","good camera i like it so much, they Delievered it very fast. Worth to buy this company's stuff. Five stars!","good price and perfect product!! its much cheaper than in the store!<br />I love the color and the size of this camera.","This camera is a showstopper--the life of the party and a crowd pleaser. Who doesn't like instant film? Break this camera out and you've got an instant party. Plus, the pictures are a great pocket/business card size, and are perfect for giving away at gatherings after photos have been snapped. The pictures have a really interesting and unique vintage quality to them, which makes them even more special and fun for photo albums and fridge magnets. I haven't quite figured out how to use the two (total) features on the camera yet, so am missing both night and long-distance shots. Either way, this has already paid for itself in smiles and memories; I am so glad I purchased it!","The camera is very cute, that it suprised me at the time I opened the box, and the size is very suitable that you can<br />take it everywhere, I used to hesitate from choosing Polarid or Mini 25, I think I made a good decision. However, I recommend this camera for someone who wants to buy an instant camera.","The Fujifilm MINI 25 is a good replacement product for the now defunct Polaroids.  The pic size is about half that of the old Polaroid pictures, a little bigger than the standard passport photos.  The camera is very popular at parties since the instant gratification of seeing pics on prints is hard to beat even in the digital age.  Price per photo may turn off some people but I highly recommend it for the fun factor!","I bought this just recently and OMG I received it within 2 days!!<br /><br />this was the quickest order i have ever received!!!<br /><br />The camera is awesome, and the packaging is good too! compared to a lot of other prices, this would be the best price that i have found.<br /><br />I can't wait to take pictures with it.","I love this camera, picture quality is fantastic! it is pretty bulky and you have to be wise with the film but certainly a keeper!","If you're confused between buying the mini 25 or 7s, you should totally buy the 25! it's much lighter and slimmer. not to mention that the shape is cuter too. picture result is great and it's a fun camera to use!","this cool baby camera has so much fun and memories when in use. every shot makes a difference. this is an awesome toy for lomographers and beginners too","It is a nice camera. but i feel a little expensive. it's good to use. you can try it if like.","Love my new Fuji Instax 25.  The camera is simplistic and extremely easy to use.  The photos come out sharp and clear.  The size is perfect for scrapbooking mini-books.  Love the fact that they are instant!  Nice product.","We started taking photos within minutes of the film and camera arriving.  What a fun way to reconnect with this type of photography!  This is certainly not the film to use if you want the clearest, sharpest images.  But for it's great for capturing spotaneous moments or adding instant photos to a journal.  I'm glad I got this, particularly as it was a gift for my wife.  She loves it, and I find myself drawn to it, too.","I gave this to my daughter (age 15) for Christmas and it was/is a hit.  She has taped the photos up on her bedroom walls.","The camera is stylish, sleek and functional for what it is -- a device that can produce instance photos in a few minutes, so you have to expect a little bulk. But it is still quite portable and small for an instance camera. Quality of photos is very good, sharp and vivid colors. The features are good -- landscape mode and portrait mode (you flip the camera sideways and there is a button to press in this orientation and another button to press in portrait mode; flash settings, light, dark and normal modes for lighting needs; a small mirror in front to take photos of yourself; a magnifying lens to attach to the camera for close up shots. It is a blast to take photos with and give out the credit card sized photos....way fun. Snap snap snap.","This camera is fun because it is immediate and the ability to give them away almost immediately is very nice.  The format is small, but that's OK!  I like the squarish design---very different.","I love this Camera! I've wanted a polaroid camera forever, and when I got this for Christmas I was so excited! The pictures are super cute! They have a vintage quality about them, they are small but very charming. I have no complaints about this camera I used it straight out of the box, it was super easy to use.  Buyers should know it's not a small camera it's kinda bulky, but it is a conversation starters, people always comment on it and tell me how cool it is! The point is that I love it and you will too!!!!","When I get the camera, I use it almost every day to catch my colorful life, and it works pretty good!!My boyfriend and I both love it!","I'm a new buyer to Amazon, and I was a bit nervous when I decided that my first Amazon purchase was to be this camera. I've wanted this camera for a very long time, and I had finally found it with a reasonable price. So, as a result, I added it to my shopping cart and checked it out. Amazon's shipping and delivery made me extremely happy, because it came before the estimated delivery time! Once my camera was delivered, I was so excited! It was everything that I had expected. It's small, light, and very easy to work the controls! Unfortunately though, the flash is automatic and cannot be turned off. Other than that, I was extremely satisfied! The photos are great quality, and I love the special landscape shot feature! It's an extremely fun, adorable, and convenient camera that should satisfy anyone's instant photography needs. :)","This is my very first instant camera. And I was just worried about the size of the picture and I found it decent at little bigger than credit cards. The first pic I took and when photo started to show up after say 15 sec, it was so much fun. Initially I thought the pictures didnt capture much of color details, like different shades of same color specifically white. But I needed to wait. The final result was good.. very good, infact excellent. Though the picture doesnt come well in evenings even with flash but who cares, you dont buy this camera to shoot at night. Go out in sun click smiling faces, flowers or some nothings. Its a treat!!! So much fun.","I had originally discovered the Instax Mini 7S this past fall on a geeky little blog that I follow, loved the idea, and sent it to my husband as an idea for me for Christmas.  He, ever the details guy, did me one better by doing all the appropriate research and found out that the Instax Mini 25 is a smaller, has more features, and is a higher quality version of the same camera -- the ONLY downside being that it didn't come in the chocolate brown that I really wanted like the 7S did. ;)<br />I LOVE this camera - while the film is a bit on the pricey side (I found two-packs for $15 online - 20 shots total at about $.75 each), the point is not to treat it like a digital camera, but to go old-school and actually take some time deciding what you want to take pictures of (my favorite part is no retakes - if you're blinking in the shot, that's part of the charm!).  We had an amazing time with it at our New Year's party this year, and created a display board to show off the evening and all my friends loved it.<br />My husband also got me a bag for it (SO cute! Fujifilm 2011 Bowler Bag for Camera - White ) and, as another reviewer indicated, it's intended for the bigger 7S, but I can fit the Mini 25 and about six extra packs of film, which is convenient.  And he (rightly) decided I needed a protective (clear plastic) case, which I like having, as I feel like it's definitely protecting my camera from little bumps and drops.<br />I'm still learning its ins and outs, and haven't used it outside yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to continuing to play with it.  Highly recommend!","This camera is user friendly and easy to carry. I love the size.<br />Although it takes sometime to figure out the best mode for flash light.","I had used a polaroid camera for years and was desperate to find the film for it-but finally could not.  I did not realize there were newer models.  I\"m not sure why they discontinued the old type.  I used this new one-the Fujifilm Instax MINI 25 in white) for a sign in book for my son's Bar Mitzvah.  Guests took photos of themselves, placed it in the scrapbook, and wrote notes next to the photo.  Everyone thought the camera was cool-it is futuristic looking.  The photos come out fine-just like the old polaroid cameras-not great-but the colors are good and it captures the moment instantly.<br /><br /> We make ornaments each year (for our Sukah on Sukkot, a Jewish holiday-but I imagine it would be good for Christmas ornaments and other holidays). When people come to visit for the holiday, we take a polaroid and then laminate it with laminating paper, then hang it up with ribbon.  Each year for that holiday, we take out all the photos from years gone by to see who celebrated with us in the past and how we all have grown up.","Really appreciated the video that showed you how to operate the cameria.  It's sleek, easy to use and I was plaeased with the pictures.  Of course, they are not as sharp (in direct sunlight) as your expensive regular cameria but I love the size and look.  I would buy this cameria again.","Got this camera and the Instax 210 for wedding photo guestbook and this little camera was such fun to use that we have decided to keep the Mini after the wedding.  Call me old-fashioned but there is something about a printed photo a digital screen can't replace.  Both Fuji Instax 210 and mini were easy to use and a great conversation starter and ice-breaker. The Instax 210 gave bigger picture, which was better for the photo guestbook.  However, the Instax 210 is bulky and not something you can sip into your handbag.<br /><br />Do bear in mind that the Instax Mini uses the smaller format films.  The photos are small (the actual photo area is smaller than iphone4 screen).","I was pleasantly surprised to receive the light package!<br />Not only was it not as bulky as the 7s, it looks classier too!<br />Price is so much cheaper (even after shipping to Malaysia) than purchasing it locally.<br />One of my concern is that the film is quite pricey.<br />But because I wanted this to be sorta like a substitute to my lomo cameras, I think it equals out.<br />And the anticipation of seeing the film turning into an image is PRICELESS.<br />Quality is surprisingly GREAT too!<br />My other concern is that the flas cannot be switched off. It's either on auto or on.<br />So it's quite irritating sometimes when you want it off as it could make pictures look tacky.<br />As for photo albums, there are hundreds of different types of credit card size albums around.<br />There are even some nice ones from Daiso!<br />All in all I'm really happy with the purchase!","I was originally going to buy a Polaroid camera that I could use to take funky little photos when I was out or at parties. After reviewing this camera, there was a link to a review on something similar by Fuji. After reading through, I decided on the Fujifilm Instax 25. My package arrived on the promised date without any hassles and the camera is just what I wanted. It is easy to use and had a detailed instruction manual if needed. While the film is expensive, I have found buying in bulk to be the best option, as the cost of each film drops. There are also great accessories to buy such as the colour filter lenses and a wide lens to fit more into your shot. Will definitely be enjoying this for a long time!","This camera is the HIT of the party! People are amazed when I get it out and start taking pictures! Everyone wants one..and I tell them all about the site! It is fun, and easy! I love it!!!!!!!!!! And the price was fantastic!","Easy to handle, business card size photos are suitable for scrapbooking, travel and cooking diaries..good quality instant photos means that you can update your diaries instantly..! worth every penny..","I knew this camera by watching a Korean movie, then kept researching about it. I decided to order it and waited for 1 week. I was so excited when I received it. This is an amazing camera: tiny, cute, light, etc. Everything seems great. The quality of the pictures are pretty awesome. I love the vintage. This is absolutely a right camera for girls. I also love the credit card size of the image. Everyone who needs the Fuji mini film, I suggest go to Adorama website and buy the films. It is cheaper than others, free tax, and low shipping price.","I first saw this adorable lil camera at a friends wedding.  I hadn't seen or used a poloroid camera in years.  I'm going on vaction and thought this to be a fabulous way to have those instant shoots and they fit write inside your wallet!  It's simple to use and light weight to carry around.","This camera is so amazing and I do not regret buying it; It was a big hit in school and everyone wanted to take a picture. The only down side is that the film for it is so expensive! It's almost a dollar for each picture. Nonetheless, I love this camera and I'm glad I bought it!","I purchased this camera for a birthday celebration at Disneyland.  All my children and grandchildren loved the pictures and how much fun it was to use.  They have requested their own Fugifilm Instax Mini for birthdays or Christmas.","I was never into Polaroids when I was younger.  Now that I'm a college student with a disposable income, I wanted to invest in a camera.  I tried using digital cameras, even DSLR photography.  I never got completely into it.  It wasn't something that you could really share or interact with people, especially in person, unless they were photograph buffs.  The new instant line from Fujifilm made it possible to bridge a gap and make photography, once again, a group engagement for people with little or no skill to those endowed with photographical prowess.<br /><br />First off, I'd like to point on the simplicity of it's design.  Appearance wise, it looks beautiful.  It really goes off of the minimalist look and only has what is really necessary for the product to really function.  Typically, I hate curvy products or artwork (I prefer jagged corners or straight edges) but this camera's aesthetics appeals to all.  As for size, I'd compare it to the size of a baseball.  It's ergonomics make it easy to handle and rather difficult to drop.<br /><br />Construction of quality is, overall, great! I really recommend you buy an anti-shock bag or pouch for your Instax Mini 25.  I left it once in my messenger bag, but I think a jolt caused it to reset its counter, wasting the next available film to remove what it had just assumed was the exposure guard of a new cartridge of film.  It also suffered from a nasty fall, and kept giving me an E error on the lcd screen.  I took it apart, and found a part had come loose that wouldn't allow the motorized lens to collapse or expand properly (I was able to fix it however.  Nothing actually broke).  You could easily avoid this with a neoprene bag or some other padded accessory to protect your device.<br /><br />It's quite easy to use.  There are two shutter buttons which make it comfortable to take pictures in landscape or portrait.  It has a tiny (very tiny, think like a 1/4 of a penny) lcd screen which shows the number of shots left in the cartridge currently inside the camera.  It also has a interface which shows the shot mode.  you can lighten or darken the next shot, shoot in landscape, and turn on flash.  It has a view finder, and a self-shot mirror on the front.  You can attach a hand strap (or a cellphone charm) to your camera.<br /><br />Accessories are rare.  Branded accessories from Fujifilm are non-existant, aside from specialty film.  I found a studio which specialized in accesories, photoalbum, stickers, and the sort for the Instax.  It's called 2NUL design.  For most part, I've had to order these accessories over the internet, but the niche fans have made specialty cases and even lenses for the camera.  They are, however, on the pricier side.<br /><br />Last, cost effectiveness.  You can print a standard photo at a local drugstore now-a-days for a bout five cents a print.  In comparison, the film cartridges Fujifilm INSTAX MINI Twin Pack Instant Film fluctuates around $15.00.  20 shots for around 15 dollars leaves each shot from the Instax $.75.  That's pretty steep price difference, however, remember these are instantaneous.  I also like to compare these to the picture booths which are becoming popular, especially in small Asian communities.  Sometimes, a session at the booth can cost from five to eighteen dollars.  I like to bring around a sharpie to draw and date each photo or write some sort of memorabilia.","I am an owner of the one 600 ultra polaroid camera. I loved it because it took pictures with real polaroid films that gave pictures a classy, vintage, antique, and nostalgic look all mixed together.<br /><br />These new polaroid cameras are more directed to the female population. The pictures are tiny (credit card size) and virtually serve no nostalgic purpose. Good thing that the camera wasn't for me and it was for a girl friend of mine. Whew.","I love using this camera for \"red carpet\" glam portraits at night. Black backgrounds develop pretty true (instead of looking brown or muddy).<br /><br />I like the self-portrait mirror on the front; it seems accurate enough. The quality of portraits when using the macro lens is better than expected, but figuring out how the frame crops might mean a few not-so-cheap mess ups.<br /><br />There are a few choices of instant films for this camera with novelty character borders which ups the cuteness factor. You can even get rid of the white border entirely and achieve an edgy art house look by using online video tutorials on \"How to peel Fuji Instax Mini photos.\"","This is a great camera, so don't hesitate in buying one, the only problem is the film. The one that's listed doesn't fit. Make sure, if you're picking up film for this camera, that you only choose the MINI film. The one listed doesn't fit!","it came VERY FAST! less than a week! It looked as cute as i expected it to be! Its easy to use, the pictures are pretty clear, and its super cute! Im just very careful with it because i love it so much that i dont want to have anything bad happen to it. haha :) Overall, i recommend buying this product on amazon because  its probably the best price you can find for this camera!","I live in Singapore and this product was shipped to me in just 4 days! To top it off, the camera was in excellent condition. Am very pleased with this purchase :)","I lalalalalalalove this camera! Seriously i use it a lot in<br />Shoots as i am a photographer and i enjoy using film<br />I love everything about this camera its really fun and<br />The models love to pose and of course i use it for myself as well<br />If you dont have one get it fer realz you wont regret stg just buy it.","Love this little camera and love the pictures it takes.  Reminds me of ones from my childhood.","I had wanted this camera for a long time, finally bought it (everywhere else has this for $150 or more, so amazon has the best price). I could not be happier.  The quality is great and we have been snapping pictures all day, just wish the film was cheaper.","This is my newest toy. I used it to document our road trip in a travel log. It's a lot of fun to use. The camera is bulky but the wrist strap is handy. My biggest issue is not really knowing how to use the magnifying lens--I was always off-focus when I tried to take a photo with that lens on. All of the other photos turned out great. The Mini size film is perfect and cool-quirky for my project.","This camera has been tons of fun, we used it all summer long for various projects and birthdays etc.  The film is expensive so you can't really just blast off film without a plan but that is what digital is for.  I love that you really don't know quite what you are going to get until the picture develops, but having said that the picture quality is amazingly good.","I've never own one instant camera before, and was searching for some polaroid. But after much searching, I gave up of owning a polaroid, cause the films of a polaroid are really expensive! Then, I went considering Instax mini 7 and Instax Mini 25. And with comparison with Instax Mini 7 and Instax Mini 25, Instax Mini 25 is definitely smaller, lighter and of a very cute and pretty appearance!! :D I really love my Instax Mini 25 alot! It's really easy to use, and there's also another button at the side for you to take photos horizontally! (: The photos printed out are also of very high and clear quality! :D<br /><br />I got it for less than 2days, and people around me were asking me where did I get it, and they seem very interested to buy one too! :D<br /><br />Overall: 5STARS! :D","Easy to use, good picture quality.  Film is expensive but for novelty shots, well worth it.","I bought my Instax Mini 25 from Amazon, and i love it! it is the cutest little camera i owe. the size is nice, i am able to put it in my purse to carry around. It's just a lot of fun to use and to take pictures with, as you watch the develop. The photo quality is pretty good for an instant camera, nice colors and sharp images when you get the focus right. For me, there is more thrill in instant photography than digital. the other review covered all the specs. i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a fun little japanese camera!!","Initially I had purchased the instax mini 7s from amazon and I really liked it, but the size and weight of the camera had always bothered me.  Because this camera, the instax 25, uses 2 cr2 batteries instead of 4 AA batteries like the instax 7s its much smaller and lighter.  I'm able to fit this camera in the instax bags you find on ebay with 2 extra packs of film whereas with the 7s i could only fit the camera due to its size.<br /><br />Also when the 25 is used outside, the flash does not fire which is a definite plus when you dont want washed out photos.  This camera also comes with a closeup lens which enables you to take close pictures without having to get too close.  This camera also comes with an extra shutter button on the side of the camera in case you want to take pictures horizontally instead of vertically.  The camera also comes with a feature that lets you either take lighter or darker photos.  You can also control the flash somewhat by choosing whether you want the flash to be strong and highlight the background of the photo or you can switch it to landscape mode where i think it doesnt flash at all(not exactly sure because ive only used this option outside in bright light and the flash doesnt go off).<br /><br />In order to really enjoy and appreciate these instant cameras you have to take a step back and appreciate them for what they are.  Of course you can take a thousand pictures with a digital camera and print out 4x6 photos for 5 cents each, whereas each picture you take with the instax minis cost around 75 cents each, but its the appeal of having a photo seconds after you take it, and with these cameras each picture you take is one of a kind."]},{"name":"Fujifilm Instax 210 Instant Photo Camera","amazon_reviews":["I was unsure of which camera I should get. If you are stuck between the 210 and the newer model the 300. The 300 has a tri pod mount and  accurate view finder and you spin the lens to switch to macro mode. The real difference is not in these features but in the sleeker design. The 300 is considerably smaller. I love the fact that the camera is huge. I also love that it prints clear pictures. Both cameras take the same kind of film. If you don't need a tri pod mount  or a small-ish camera, the 210 is a great camera. The 210  does come with a macro lens. However it is not a permanent fixture on the camera. The macro lens attaches to the camera lens. I was so happy with my purchase.","Absolutely in love with my camera. I got it for Christmas 2016 and have used it on about a half dozen trips / special events. Everyone loves the unique, fun photos it takes and I love sharing them with my friends. Definitely recommend if you're thinking about getting one of these!","Fantastic camera, but only one problem. I can't turn the flash OFF! No matter what the indicator says, it's always on. Does anyone have and answer to this????","I have been using the camera in my picture for around five years and I love it. I have taken 450 photos with it and I must say that it takes a little getting used to. For people who remember what it was like to take pictures with older cameras, either polaroid or the wind up film cameras, it should be no problem. The main thing is not letting pictures get washed out by the flash. The lighten/normal/darken setting is best used outdoors when the flash is mostly ignorable. Indoors is best to keep on normal and not get too close to the subject. You can also manipulate the flash with your free hand.<br /><br />The viewfinder is only a guide and I always remember that the lens is centered, while the viewfinder is offhand. I have dropped the thing multiple times, the worst being when the strap broke while on vacation. But somehow it always survives. Reliable and durable.

It, has good clarity. i love it!","Nice product","I bought this for my college-age granddaughter for Christmas, and she loves it.","I love this camera. I would recommend this for portraits","I was so excited when I bought this camera. It was inexpensive and gave me the size of picture that I wanted. However, a few months after my purchase the camera stopped pushing the film out. Everything else worked.

It's perfect","This camera is BIG. I started laughing when I saw how big it was but it works great and the whole family loves it and uses it all the time. The pictures have the nostalgic look and makes you look good no matter what","Gave this as a present and she loved it. Took a picture right away and came out well. The camera itself is bulkier than the instax mini but that's expected. We like the wide polaroid way better, gives it a more vintage look. Great investment and I suggest buying more films to go with it.","works great, but the aim is not too accurate","Love the camera but he film is kind of expensive.","I'm in love. I have been wanting a Polaroid camera for years. It's great to bring on trips and family or friend events. I like the mini's but I'd rather have a full sized Polaroid to really make things feel like a memory and not some cute fad. It is pretty big though (which can never be helped), that's only if you don't mind hauling it around. I myself don't mind that. Normally have it in a backpack so it's no worries.<br /><br />In the package are the camera, close-up attachment, 4 AA batteries and camera strap. Sadly there's no film that comes with it. You're gonna have to buy that separately. The film to buy hat's widely used is the Fujifilm Instax Wide Instant Film Twin Pack film. Also, it's been almost 2 years since I've had mind and have not changed the batteries so that good it last a loooong time. It's always a hassle having to constantly buy batteries.<br /><br />Some issues I have is the flash is always on. There's no way of turning it off unless you put tape or something to cover it. The film cartridges are only in packs of 10 so you go through film fast, especially if it doesn't come out right the first few times (sigh).<br /><br />All in all I'm quite happy with it. It's alays nice to have tangible photos instead of just on your phone or having to go to a store to print them out. I have gotten a few friends to buy it and they love it too. Fuji keep up the good work. Bringing back old school.","I LOVE this camera.  MUCH better than the tiny instamatics.  I run craft classes and kids camps and use the photos repeatedly in class. Can take pics of the kids that each child can use in their own craft. Takes a great shot and they love seeing their photo results so quickly.  It always makes for the best impact in class, they get really excited!  The quality is good and my cameras have taken a beating and still work.","In love with it","this is a great Polaroid camera if you dont want the mini, have had it for a year now and still works great :)","I've had this camera since the beginning of the year, and I absolutely love it!  I didn't like the mini instax because the pictures are way too small.  Really easy to use and just perfect to capture memories.","Works great. Had one before...don't drop it under any circumstances...tie the lanyard knots tight on each end.","I got this camera for my 80 yr. old mom for her birthday. She has always loved the instant cameras. The size is perfect for her arthritic hands. I searched the reviews for an instant camera that would be easy to use, larger (fuji makes a smaller instant camera) camera so she could see everything and easy for her fingers to grasp. She uses it constantly. Easy to use and load film.","This was great until the camera stopped printing the photos. I had to take it to the shop to get it fixed and it broke down on me even before a year hit.","Great camera. Good price.","i love this thing, only con is that it's pretty huge","Works as it should. Takes lovely pictures ;)","I like the camera. Takes nice pictures as long as it doesn't get too dark or as long as your not going around taking pictures of really small things lol. But it does take great pictures of a people that's on film instantly which I cant get from a digital camera so that's why I need a camera like this and its hard to find film or instant film cameras these days. This camera creates memories.","I bought the fujifilm camera and everything was ok but the batteries, two of the four were sulfatated.. pretty gross but more importantly, very dangerous.<br />How can't you check the components before spending the product?","Good Camera","excellent and accurate, quick delivery thanks","Love it for the wider pictures and near/far light/dark settings. Its is HUGE, which is it's only con to me, but I can deal with that :)","this is my second fuji camera purpose from amazon.  this camera is definitely fun!  everyone loves the photos and you will find it pretty hard to take a bad photo.<br /><br />it's a plastic camera though, so don't be too rough on it","I own this camera for about 3 years now, I love it, but there's one downside: you can't turn off the flash, which is annoying sometimes and may end up ruining your photo... please, make a new model with the possibility of turning the flash off (I still don't understand why you didn't introduce this feature in the Instax 300) and also with AF","Used this camera for our wedding guest book! It was very easy to use and guests were able to easily figure out how to reload the film cartridges themselves. It does have a little bit of bulk to it and you have to use both hands when operating. We have used it for parties/get togethers since then and continue to enjoy using this camera.","This Fuji Film camera, I've had for several years now, and I bust it out for every event I go to so that I can gift the photo's to the bride/groom, birthday girl/boy, etc.","The first time I ordered the camera, when I opened the package, the contents of the box that the camera was held in spilled out. It seemed like it had been opened/used before. When I put in a new pack of film and tried to take a picture, you can hear the camera working but the pictures wouldn't come out and the pack of film got jammed inside of the camera. I ruined a pack of film and had to return the camera and was very unhappy. I really wanted to give it another try so I bought the camera again from a different seller, M Z Photos and this time the camera came perfectly packaged. It worked perfectly and the pictures are awesome. So I'm giving the product five stars because when it worked, it worked great and the pictures are crisp and beautifully colored. Just be careful of which seller you buy from.","The new version of the instax camera for you instant film lovers.","10/10 seriously in love with this camera.","I literally love this camera so much. I previously have owned the instax mini 8 and this is so much better. Although it can be a handful size-wise compared to other models it's definitely worth it to me. The size is nostalgic!  The pictures that come out are so good, and I love that you can choose whether or not to use flash, which annoyed me on the mini 8 because it always washed pictures out. I haven't gotten to play around much with the lightening and darkening buttons or the distance buttons but I'm excited to see. The resulting pictures all look so good and so much more cool and unique than all the other people's credit card sized little pictures. After getting this I rarely use my Instax mini 8 anymore and the film isn't even more expensive, it's a no-brainer.","I love this camera! Reminds me of a real old fashioned Polaroid!! My only complaint is that it's quite large but it does take full size Polaroid snapshots. Definitely buy it!","me and my girlfriend love using this thing.","It's a pretty swell camera. Reminds me of the original (the size of the film). My biggest quip, this is not an indoor camera especially when you're team melanin. Indoor lighting even with flash is very unflattering, I've tried all angles, it doesn't work well. However, take this bad boy outside on a sunny day, WOW, the pictures come out crisp. I forgot and fanned the photo whilst it was developing so the picture broke, as in there were black blotches in the picture so don't do that. Don't fan your photo, hide it from the sun and give it the needed 30 seconds or so. I would have given this 5 stars but the camera feels super plastic and flimsy. I'm terrified to drop it.","I used this for my guest book at my wedding. It took excellent quality photos that will last a lifetime.","We had ours for 3 years BUT we only used it on three occasions for a total of about 20 pictures.  We used it to take pictures of artists and have them autograph the picture.  However, the internal lens cap broke and the camera would no longer push the pictures out either.  I sent it in for repair and the estimate with shipping was $52, plus the $10 shipping to send it in.  Not worth it considering the price of the camera.","Works great even though it's a model older than the new one, not a big deal still takes photos! I'm satisfied.","I get so many compliments on this lovely thing. I love it. I like it since its wider than the other camera from Fujifilm. It's simple to use and the film isn't that bad either.Then again I hardly use it except for special occasions. It's a great investment and gift for anyone. And im not that big into photography.<br /><br />I just wished it came with cooler accessories like its smaller one. I'm talking like cases, cool frames to put your pictures...maybe different colors. It's all good though.","Nice camera its pretty big and scratches easily, it takes a while to get the hang of it because the manual comes in Japanese.","cheaper than the film ..lots of fun for the kids!","This is a big camera but it does make excellent photos and it's hard to lose cause it's got a big was perfect for a graduation party we had the kids just thought it was great it was a hit!","Tangable, Real color and nice size have used for birthday parties to give memory not real cell phone photo fan (everyone not share)","Love my Polaroid","My Polaroids come out so nicely. I would recommend to anyone. Only down side is the camera is really big.","I loved my camera until my boyfrkend accidentally knocked it down from a chair onto the floor :,( it no longer works now but for the short while I had it, I was in love","This was for my grandson and he and his whole family enjoy it. New in box. Fast delivery. Easy to use,","Love this camera. Film is too expensive.","just need a case for it...any ideas?","Great camera, satisfied my girlfriend","I have used all the older polaroid type instant cameras made from 1970 on, I recently sold my Land 420 and 440 because fuji killed off the old pack film and the price shot up to 35$ a pack!<br />I have also used polaroid 600 series cameras with Impossible project film, I am also a photogropher that still uses medium format film to DSLR's.<br />That said this camera, does a better job than all of my older instant cameras. The film develops very quickly compared to impossible film and is more than half the price. No it doest take photos that look like the 1970's but they are nice, clear, low grain very similar to the FP100c pack film Fuji assassinated. The camera itself is light, plastic, would bust if you drop it, like other cameras so don't drop it! Also the Fuji film doest leak chemicals out onto the rollers that you have to clean.<br />I won't go into details on operation because its super easy to use, I would like to say that indoors, try setting it to a darker setting because the flash will wash out some details, also in daylight, turn on the flash if your subject is in any shade, it needs the fill flash out to the high F stop coupled with high speed film. Great little wedding, birthday camera. Some call it huge, but they must of never used a real camera, they are not small little crappy point and shoots, my fuji GW690 is larger, my 500cm weighs more and it bigger, my Nikon F4 and D3 is also bigger with the lens attached, so don't let the size bother you. 4 out of 5 due to the fact that I was blackmailed into buying it by fuji killing off fp3000b and fp100c films. I think that was their plan all along.","The battery cover came loose. Other than that is what everything i expected.","Got this 3 years ago, came with 4 packs of film for about 80 bucks, best investment of $80 ever","This camera is amazing.  My husband bought it for me as a birthday gift and I have been snapping pictures ever since.  I had been so tired of taking all these wonderful pictures on my phone and digital camera and then having to take them some where to be printed and losing quality along the way.  This camera is fantastic, it gives me the ability to have instant photos that I can use to scrapbook and frame immediately.  No more trips to Walgreens!","After buying the instax mini i became hooked on polaroids! This camera offers a bigger picture and I could not be happier! Its so cheap and high quality, nothing can beat this.","I did a lot of research before purchasing for a gift for my daughter. I wanted a larger one because the idea of the mini films just didn't seem appealing since they are so small. I'm so happy with this camera. My 11-year old loves it, but I am enjoying it even more than her! It takes beautiful pictures indoors and outdoors! The size of the film is similar to the older Polaroid photos. The only drawback is I haven't been able to find the film in stores, only online. So you just have to prepare ahead of time. The camera is large, not something you'd want to carry around your neck for very long.","love it. great pictures, good size","this one looks awesome and photos that are taken are awesome as well. great find!","I like this unusual looking camera.","Best Investment ever! perfect for summer adventures / music festivals","Cool camera love it","One of my favorite cameras ever bought!","Love it!!!!","This is an alias, but I'm a very famous woman who enjoys spending her free time taking naughty selfies. But they always end up on the Internet, oopsies! ;) I was chatting with my stepdad and she said that it's like, SO hard for hackers to hack into Polaroid pictures. The only issue I have is that the film is sooo thick (not that there's anything wrong with that) and we're running out of closet space storing my husbands failed fashion line. 4 stars.","I love the photos this produces. The wide size is perfect, the mini is a bit too small. But of course this means the camera is bigger and chunkier. Don't expect anything that'll fit your cute cross body purse but I throw it in my backpack for hikes and it's nothing heavy.<br />I do suggest mainly day time pictures else make sure you adjust to the \"dark\" mode when you take in anything less than sunny lighting. Otherwise I've found it's great!","I really looked forward to this camera but was bummed when all my pictures came out blurry :/ I played with it different times so maybe it's a hit or miss.","my fave camera. so lucky to have this one. great find!","Huge! This things is huge which is totally fine. I just wasn't imagining it to be so big. Works great. Instructions came only in Japanese but I figured it just fine with the pictures they give you.","Product is as what was advertised. Still using it.","I purchased this camera for my dad's birthday & he was thrilled with it!! He's not a \"techy\" person & very happy with this instamatic camera!!","I bought this as a gift for my wife for Christmas.  We don't use social media and we wanted a way to keep our memories forever.  We recently bought our first house and this has been a great way to immortalize the memories that we are making.  I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting to capture their life or just looking for the nostalgia aspect.  It is a bit bulky and you have to be careful when using it.  It will probably break if you drop it, so be really careful and maybe invest in a case.","love!","I received the camera on time but all of the pictures I've taken are pitch black. It's not due to my settings, it's due to the camera iris not opening. I'm very disappointed because I was so excited to use this. I haven't been able to contact the seller, and would really like an exchange for a proper working camera. So as of right now it looks like I wasted over $100 on the camera and film that I've wasted.<br /><br />EDITING REVIEW TO SAY IT WAS NOT THE CAMERA THAT WAS DYSFUNCTIONAL IT WAS THE FILM! I absolutely love documenting my growing son with polaroids and hanging them all over the house.","Love this camera<br /> Quality of the photos is beautiful<br />The camera is bulky but it's a really good camera<br />Really enjoy this camera I get a lot of compliments from my friends and it's a cool conversation starter or just a nice camera if you want instant prints<br />In the photo you will see the prints<br />The brand of Film I use<br /><br />Camera is plastic but doesn't feel cheap!","So I wrote a big long review and my phone deleted it while I was trying to find pictures so here goes the second draft with much less detail and effort- sorry!<br /><br />I'd first like to say that I've had this camera for over two years now and I've had some great experiences with it and some awful ones so now I'm writing to let you know about it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Relatively cheap, about the same picture quality as the mini camera but a bigger picture, leaves you with some great memories, the low quality lends to a vintage/indie look for all you cool kids.<br /><br />Cons: a very chunky/unattractive camera, film is expensive, picture quality is by no means spectacular, the flash will go off if the camera feels it's necessary and there's nothing you can do to stop it and that is very frustrating, good luck figuring out how the lighting is going to work out I still haven't after two years (you just sort of hope and pray) so it is very unpredictable, the viewfinder is off on mine and sometimes it's okay and sometimes it's ridiculously misplaced and there is no compensating for it. The flash, the lighting, and the viewfinder problem have led to many instances where I've been left with useless, awful pictures and that can be extremely frustrating because 1. Film costs add up and 2. You're not always in a situation where you can sit around and wait for the picture to develop to see how it turns out so you can't take another and the moment is lost. This is definitely a byproduct of the cheapness of the product. You have to be willing to throw away some film.<br /><br />All that being said, I love my clunky camera. For two plus years I've gathered many beautiful moments and cute photos and is just a super fun thing for me to have. I do get super frustrated with it but in the end the pictures that do turn out are worth it for me and that's something for you to decide!","The good- clear beautiful photos.<br />The bad- bulky design<br />The ugly- well, the disappointing. Literally a month after the warranty elapsed, my camera wouldn't dispense the photos.","Amazing camera. Make sure you buy the right size film but the nostalgia factor here is amazing and people always ask about the camera!","Love the quality of pictures as well as the price point of the camera.  Pictures look just like old polaroids.  Used this at our wedding (for guests to take fun pics) & have lots of entertaining quality pictures","Photos come out well and so far works well","AMAZING camera!!!! Price is awesome. I have the smaller Polaroid, and I upgraded to this one. The size of the photos is great. Do yourself a favor and purchase this camera!","The reviews of the camera breaking so easy really scares me but I've had my camera a few days now and we'll so far so good i Love The big size of the camera and quality of the pictures everything seems to work fine the only thing that sucks is that the instructions are in another language","Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it.","This is a very large camera. However, this is common with instant cameras. This camera takes photos that are very similar size to original Polaroid photos. One very cool feature is the ability to attached the included selfie mirror to the end of the camera. This makes it very easy to take selfies with the camera.","BIG!!!!<br />When got this, I knew it would be big.  Some say looks like a pretend toy it's so big.  True.<br /><br />I bought it b/c the picture size is bigger than the other instant camera I was looking at.  The pics aren't always clear.  I wish I bought the other one...","Item performs as expected. Great gift!","My daughter wanted an old school \"Polaroid\" camera so badly, but the film is prohibitively expensive and buying lots of old, expired film just seems like too much of a crap shoot, so she ended up buying this camera. She loves it! The pictures are very similar to the old instant film style with a very similar border and she thinks it's groovy. :)","In a digital world where all pictures are stored on a chip. I almost forgot what it was like to hold a real photo. No cropping, touch ups. Just a frozen memory. My family loves using this.<br />You are going to need some practice with using the flash but it's worth it.","Absolutely love it! A couple scuffs but knew about it beforehand and I don't mind it all. Functions wonderfully :) Thank you!","This camera is awesome! We use it at our hunting cabin to capture our wild game.  It's much larger than I anticipated but for what we use it for, that wasn't an issue. It's not getting used on the go.  The camera is very user friendly.  We also purchased the Fujifilm Instax Wide Film Twin Pack and they work perfectly together.  It's just like your old fashioned polaroid camera! Instant pictures.  There are a few settings that can be adjusted depending on your surroundings but that was easy to manage. Small button on the side of the camera. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to have something able to take instant pictures and isn't concerned about being able to lug it around.","Not as good as the 1970’s Polaroid SX-70, but a fun camera.","Great product","This camera is so much fun! I'm a sucker for bringing things back from the past, and Polaroids were awesome! I really love that the film is affordable...if it were any more expensive, I may have passed on buying this camera. I love the unique, vintage look of the pictures.","love this camera works great! fun to take instant pics with! only thing is its large camera but works awesome!","Great camera...get the warranty. We had to buy another one because my son dropped it and it cracked easily. We got the warranty this time!","Amazing","Huge in size but super fun for my 7 year old. The film is difficult to find locally, but have been able to buy online.","This camera is awesome.  I bought this for my S/O as a Christmas gift since the film for his old Polaroid (that he loved) had become prohibitively expensive.  I considered this option and the INSTAX Mini for a while since I know very satisfied owners of the Mini, but decided on this since the size of the pictures it takes is roughly doubled.<br /><br />The camera itself is A LOT bigger than the Mini, which I didn't anticipate (I knew it'd be larger, but it really is very big), but overall I've found this to be worth it for the larger sized photos.  The Mini is very fun to play with but we've come to prefer the wide model a bit more.  The film is slightly more expensive when bought from 3rd parties (like ebay sellers) but almost negligible.  The quality of the photos is very good, and we love the variety of settings this camera has, since they are a big upgrade over the classic camera we used to use.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this for a little shot of nostalgia or just something different!  We used this at our New Year's party and everyone loved how fun it was getting physical prints since that's so rare anymore.  We'll definitely continue to use this, and the camera build feels very solid so we expect it to hold up for some time.<br /><br />While I haven't used more expensive models of similar products (Lomography, for example) I can't imagine that those models provide enough additional value to justify the price tag.  This camera will do everything you want it to do (and a little bit more) to capture that old Polaroid spirit.","Works great, just remember your not taking HD pictures. Perfect for a scrap book or just saving memories","Purchased it as a gift to myself, and to end my obsession with vintage polaroids.<br />I love the Impossible Project but the hit or miss quality was killing me and my bank account.<br />Fujifilm is VERY consistent and the Wide format with the Instax 210 is very nice in the HD, 16:9, widescreen world that we live in.<br />Sharpness and contrast may vary depending on your lighting and distance situation, but the camera is very good, and has a few options<br />as far as distance and output to help you out. It also includes a selfie attachment, which I rarely use unless a model grabs it.<br />Taken it with me on several trips and has survived the airport.<br />Strong black plastic, a few easy to use options, and great consistent instant photos.","Bought this for my grand daughter. She loves it!!!!!!!","Welcome back Poloroid but with a different name. Lots of fun and excellent<br />pictures","I was deciding which instax wide to get because I saw that there was the 300 version. After researching, I found that they're basically the same, with the same features and quality of the pictures. The only difference is that the 300 has a newer, more modern look, and has that tripod socket. I decided to get the 200 because of the price and I don't regret it at all. I think it's a great and fun camera to have.","Bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it. I chose the 210 model as it was much cheaper than the 310 and didn't seem to be missing any features. The only downside to this decision seems to be a lack of case options for the 210. There are several for the 310 including a nice leather one but none for the 210. The camera works as described and the instant prints have better color and clarity than the old Polaroids on yesteryear. I am a professional photographer and shoot lots of landscape work and was very impressed with the results of this camera. On a recent trip to the coast my wife took some photos of the area we were in as I was using black and white film and it was nice to have the print in hand within a few minutes with beautiful vibrant colors. The film is not that expensive either coming in at less than a dollar per photo when you buy in bulk packs. Two things to note are the sheer size of the camera is quite large and the camera strap is a bit lacking so you may want to go ahead to buy a better strap up front.","This is my second Polaroid I had the Fuji 300 mini but wanted bigger pictures it does its designated job just be cautious it doesn't take good pictures in the dark even with the proper settings adjusted . but amazing Polaroid overall","looks very nice and i love the size of the photo it creates. i am very satisfied with the delivery and the product itself. great product indeed","Camera worked great the day it was opened.  Started having problems that night.  Thought it was the film, so we changed the cartridge even though we didn't go through all of the pictures.  Next, the cover to hold the batteries broke off.  Finally it started to click excessively whenever we turned it on or off.  Lens popped out and still won't go back in.  Will be returning this product, and trying again.","One of my favourite possesion. This camera very simple to use and photos process quickly on film. It is roughly the size of an actual camera, and despite the camera needing four D batteries, it is relatively light and extremely easy to maneuver. This camera is just amazing and I enjoyed it so much I bought a second.","In love.","OMG haven't had so much fun with a camera in YEARS. Bought it for my dad's 90th birthday party and it was a blast getting the pictures immediately. When it arrives it looks fake, but it is wonderful. I had to watch the Fuji boys on U-Tube to learn how to use it as all directions were in japanese.","Most fun thing ever.  Pictures are superb and consistent.  Great colors","I bought this after owning a Instax mini which I love but I wanted bigger photos so I purchased this for my work party....people thought it was really fun to see actual instant photos not just look at someone's cell phone screen. Loved this product. I've only taken 30 photos so far but I've ordered more film to be ready for the holidays.","Love this. Wish it were not so bulky. That's my only complaint.","It is definitively a nice gift to give.","This has been my first ever film camera and i really love having it. It looks and it is kind of bulky but all is fine to me. I love the photos that it creates and it is very easy to use.","i got this camera back in February of 2014 and i'm still absolutely in love with it. i take it with me pretty much everywhere and i agree with the other reviews; it's definitely a conversation starter. at school people come up to me and say 'that's a really cool camera' or something along those lines. it's so great. the way it goes is they ask me where i got it and how much and almost always when i pull it out someone asks me for a picture. but like everything else, it does have its pros and cons<br /><br />PROS:<br />-super fun especially at get togethers, trips, and the holidays<br />-the size of the picture itself is pretty big, definitely much bigger than the minis or even polaroids<br />-the batteries that it came with last a really long time, i haven't changed the batteries at all since i bought it<br />-film is much cheaper than impossible project film (but still pricey which is also a con)<br />-the colors when the picture fully develops are (in my opinion) stunning. outside the colors are so vibrant and crisp it looks like it's out of a vintage movie<br /><br />CONS:<br />-super bulky; when i take it to school or just anywhere in public i have to carry it on my shoulder because it looks absolutely ridiculous on my neck which actually leads to my next point<br />-it comes with the worst strap (i cant believe after more than a year i havent bought a new one). the strap is thin and short so when worn around the neck it digs in and hangs at a very awkward length<br />-the strap is also not very secure. this past tuesday i was walking down the hall at my school and all of a sudden the strap comes loose on one side and the camera almost falls to the ground. i almost screamed but i did catch it and the camera is fine but im definitely investing in a better strap<br />-this doesn't bug me that much but the camera feels really fake like completely plastic almost like a toy. again this doesnt bother me as much but i think this might be a deal breaker for some people<br />-its incredibly unpredictable. the viewfinder doesnt actually line up with lens so theres a lot of estimating before you snap a picture. for me, im used to using a canon eos rebel 2000 so not really being able to know if it's focused or not is really stressful. with the film being almost a dollar per picture, messing up can get pretty annoying. indoor pictures also come out dark most of the time but again im still playing with settings.<br /><br />with all that said, i know there are a lot more cons for me than pros but i look past that because i really do love this camera. i know that once it stops working, like all electronics do at some point, i will definitely buy again. if not this model then definitely the new one because (in my opinion) they cleaned the look up really well. overall super satisfied with this purchase!","Great camera. I've had two of these, the first one finally died after being taken to the desert for a second year. The dust/dirt was too much for it.<br /><br />However, they work really well and are super fun. Really great to run around a festival, taking photos of folks and give them the pics.<br /><br /> I bought one of them for my Mom who's in assisted living, so she can take photos with everyone that comes over. It's a nice way to create instant mementos for her. At 88, she's not going to take digital photos and print them and she can't get film developed, so this was the perfect solution.","Being a fan of old Polaroid cameras... This is the next best thing. I love this camera so much. There's a learning curve with adjusting it to get proper exposure etc. but once you get past that it's amazing.","Great","arrived right on time. perfect condition. couldn't be happier with the purchase and i use it all the time!<br /><br />only complaint is the \"camera strap\" that barely fits, falls loose, and is essentially useless. i keep the camera in a bag and just pull it out to use, so this isn't an issue for me. if you plan to carry it alone though i recommend investing in a better strap.","Beautiful camera, and at that price it's a steal. Thank you so much to the seller for sending it early in a priority mail.  Best experience on amazon","This was a gift for my grandfather and he loves it!","Great camera but only use when in bright sunlight.  Overcast light or anything less than will result in dull and dark photos, even with the flash on.","Such a fun and easy camera to use! I love setting this out at parties with a fun backdrop and film for my guests.","Loved it!! The camera was a big hit at our event. We put up a backdrop and had a ball. No regrets!","Perfect for Wedding Reception Memory Book!  Best gift of the evening! And, for anniversaries to come.","Great camera","Love it","ok","Came as promised.  The kids had so much fun with this camera to see how I used to have instant photo.  We are using it for my daughters sign in table to take photos of guest and attaching them immediately to a scrap boom where they will sign their names and put a message to the bride and groom.<br /><br />Had to buy another one for my son in law for his birthday they he loved it so much!","I love this camera but I don't know if it was the film that was causing it to malfunction? For instance, it would tell me there was 10 photos but it would only take 7 and then I would open it to look at the film only to see the cartridge was empty. Maybe it was my camera? Maybe it was the film... if someone could provide an answer for that then that would be great. Other than that, this camera is amazing and makes everyone look photogenic.","The little cover for the batteries broke when I tried to remove it. So I had to tape it on, but other then that it has been working fine.","brilliant!!!!","I actually love this","It is great! Always a conversation starter.  It works best indoors.","Love my camera! Great for instant pics!","I ordered this for my sister..  she's a scrapbook fanatic.  This product arrived quickly and made my sister so happy.  Thank you!","This was a hit with our wedding guests. We asked our guests to take their own pictures and put them along with a message in our guest book. They loved the Polaroid concept and many took extra pictures for themselves because they were having so much fun!","This camera was bought for a seven-year-old birthday. He is a little boy who is very mechanically inclined and loves to work machines. He loves this camera and we have been through about 30 pictures so far. It is so fun at this day and age to be able to have an actual pictures that you can hold in your hands. I did have to learn how to focus the camera correctly The viewfinder is on the side but there is a small bubble in the center of the window so you have to turn it slightly to get a perfect picture and get everyone that you want in to The viewfinder is on the side but there is a small bubble in the center of the window so you have to turn it slightly to get a perfect score picture and get everyone that you want into it.  The highlight of the birthday party was when we handed it to the teenager at the bowling alley and he looked at me with a questionable face and said how do you work this camera? Great products so much fun would recommend to a friend","portable and not fussy to use for average pictures","Awesome product!!!","Love this camera! Used for my wedding guest book. It's bulky but no different that of the old Polaroid camera.","Perfect product!","Product and shipping excellent instructions were in Chinese","Love this camera. Kind of big but the pics come out great!","Love this thing... but don't drop it! Luckily I bought the accidental protection plan so I'll be contacting them soon to get it fixed.","As described.","CHEAP CONSTRUCTION BUT NO OTHER OPTIONS IN THIS FORMAT","So much fun! I love these cameras. I used them for my wedding guest book and people loved it so much that I lent them to others for their weddings. Please note: they do not to well in very dimly lit places. I use them in well-lit indoors places and they work great though. I love the comically huge size; it makes them that much more fun.","I love my Polaroid, the pictures are a great size and come out surprisingly clear. Everyone always wants a picture and it draws a lot of attention. The only thing is, it's so BIG. It's extremely bulky and because of that I don't use it often since it's hard to carry around. It looks like a giant toy camera. I really wish we could get these full size pictures on the mini fujifilm polaroid, but unfortunately those pictures are half the size. I would get it again, just because it's not THAT expensive, and the pictures I get from it are definitely worthwhile.","LOVE IT! Definitely recommend buying it if you can. will not regret","A fun camera. The only draw back is all the instructions where in Japanese. Luckily the camera is very easy to use and... well, Google.<br /><br />Super fun.","My wife and I bought this for our wedding, and everyone had a blast using it! WE have a ton of unique pics to remember our wedding night. It's kind of refreshing to use non-digital.","Love this Polaroid camera! Definetly a good purchase!","I love my camera. The pictures are so perfect that you will really not think that it is from an instant camera!","This is a very fun camera, I appreciate Fuji for picking up the mantle after Polaroid, but it is seems a little oversized. In fact it is HUGE.","great camera, lots of fun to get the instant pictures!  camera itself is rather large but overall it is a fun camera to use!","I love this camera. Takes good pics and is very user friendly, not a ton of confusing buttons. It's kind of bulky and it's hard to find a case that fits it, but I would say that's the only con.","My pride and joy!","I saw on Pinterest many people used this products at their weddings and then couples would write a memory below there picture. It's quick and simple to use and brings you back to the good old days.","This was perfect for a grad party photo booth!","This camera works exactly as advertised, if not better. You get what you expect; high quality, instantly printed images. The camera build is a bit bulky, but that makes it easier to grip and gives the camera a sturdier feel. I recommend buying a pouch to carry the camera in because the strap that comes standard with the camera is pretty thin, and I wouldn't trust it carrying this relatively expensive camera. The camera also comes equip with a \"selfie\" tool that works well with the camera's reduced zoom feature. And when you're not taking a selfie the camera's normal zoom shoots exactly what you see in the viewfinder. Film for the camera also comes relatively cheap, which is great! I can take a ton of photos and create a ton of memories without having to worry about bleed myself dry like when I use my original polaroid camera.This camera isn't very cheap, but it doesn't feel cheap or take cheap photos, though I do wish it had a countdown timer. But still, even lacking the feature, it's worth every penny with the memories that I've preserved with it.","Just received the camera.  Took just a couple of pictures and I am very pleased.  At first I found it a little hard to center the pictures but I think I am getting the hang of it now.<br />Bonnie","My gf loves it! Get this one beczuase it has bigger films = bigger picture! :D yay!","I really love this camera. I am the kind who never has the time to get my prints at the local store so I looked at many instant cameras. I am glad I choose this one. I recommend everyone should get one. Plus it is easy to get school projects done fast!","I like this camera a lot. It's daytime photos are amazing and it's a great deal for the price. So much more fun than digital. The only annoying thing about this camera is its automatic flash in certain lighting. I try to take photos of the city just after sunset and the stupid flash goes off no matter what!!! Darkening my photos to a literally almost black image.  Do not expect to take good long lens photos after sunset or during any dimmer lighting than daylight. This was a disappointment. If the flash could be turned off there would be many more possibilities. Automatic should not exist.","LOVE THIS!! It's super great! I bought it for my wedding and used it as a guest book. I really have nothing bad to say! The film was awesome and all the photos came out amazing. The battery cover did become unattached but I have contacted Fujifilm about this and am hoping they get back to me!","Great camera except there is a small plastic tab on the rear door that easily breaks off and can render the camera with no ability to turn power on or off.","Awesome camera and works very well.  Only thing is, it's freakin HUGE! haha.","the instructions were all in foreign language","Wow this thing is HUUUUGE. It gets the job done.","Works great","I ordered 2 of these... One box came with everything... The batteries the straps instructions(in Chinese) ...was all good... Then I open the other one and I got s***ted.... I only got 2 of the batteries... While I don't really care about the batteries.... I do care about the other item I didn't get....THE STRAP....the camera is HUGE!!!!! So you REALLY NEED THE STRAP AND I DONT HAVE ONE!!! Uugghhh I'm so aggravated!!!!!...Know it seems small and petty but I paid for it and need it and want it!....and probably won't ever get it... SO BEWARE IF U ORDER YOU MAY NOT GET ALL YOU PAY FOR....OH AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE A WAIST OF TIME SO SOME ADVICE....JUST LOOK AT THE PICTURES!!!","Great Camera!","I'm so happy with this purchase - the photos turn out *great* and it's always a conversation starter when I pull it out of my purse.<br /><br />But I have to agree with the other commenters - the quality of the camera (and the strap especially) are a little below expectations. Like so many other people who own this camera, I've already had the strap slip its way out of the buckle and send the camera crashing to the floor (causing the battery backing and the camera itself to come apart). Luckily, we were able to put it back together and it seems to still be working fine.<br /><br />I recommend this camera to anyone wanting an instant camera, but for anyone looking to buy it, I would highly recommend buying the Amazon damage protection or investing in a new strap.","This is a giant baby!! I thought for long time then decided to purchase this one instead of mini. I don't know how mini works but this one for me is pretty good.But I cannot always take what I exactly want on the photo. Still practicing. Light piece, easy to carry.","It is what it is. A \"Polaroid\" type camera. Do not expect nice quality photographs.","purchased as gift for my daughter and she loves this camera","Everything my husband wanted! He loves it!","Just as described, thanks! :)","This camera is so fun. I absolutely love it, and I love the wide format. I recommend everyone should get one. Plus it is easy to get school projects done fast!","We gave this as a gift, the recipient has had so much fun with it!","I purchased this camera for my sons graduation party and created a photo booth area. I wanted to create some instant photos for his friends and our family. I purchased this camera based on the many positive reviews on amazon and the price. I also liked it because the photos appeared to be similar to the original Polaroid cameras most of us are familiar with.<br /><br />The camera was a little bigger then I expected and is slightly heavy, but it isn't anything you cant handle. I'm just used to my small, lightweight digital camera. The camera arrived with instructions however they are in Korean- I believe? But it was pretty easy to figure out with the picture illustrations and without the instructions in English.  Loading the cartridge film was also easy and painless.<br /><br />I used it all evening for the party and the camera was a hit! The photo quality is good and I feel it was what should be expected from a Polaroid type camera. Everyone loved it especially the teens at the party. My sister also enjoyed it and is going to buy one for her upcoming wedding so her guests can have some fun and take silly pics for her to include in her wedding album.<br /><br />I have some pics and will add them to my review once I scan them.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this camera. The price and quality are great and I got what I expected.","Love the pictures, and the way it comes out, but the quality of the camera does suck! Very cheaply made, and the part where the battery goes wont close keeps falling off i had to tape it together. The strap to put it around your neck is not well made neither. The camera fell off my neck twice. It sucks because I love the pictures it's awesome. Wish it was  better quality specially for the money you're paying for it.","I love this camera so much, I got it not to long ago and took 8 pictures the first day! I also love how much bigger the pictures are than the mini.","pro:<br />great images,<br />cheaper film that impossible project<br /><br />con:<br />viewfinder takes time to master.<br />looks like a toy<br />really big!","Lots of fun. You have to practice learning<br />how the brightness of light will affect how nice the photo looks. My photos of flowers didn't look good in bright light.","This is the best instant camera ever!! The pics come out really great and of good quality.  The camera is somewhat big but it has to be to hold the larger size film.  If you want the picture to be larger, you have to get the bigger camera.  There are smaller instant cameras out there but they produce smaller pictures. I recommend getting yourself a better strap as mine didn't support the bulk of the camera well.  The camera does not fit into a small purse. I am very happy with my purchase and everyone LOVES the instant pictures!! The outdoor shots are really the best and can produce a vintage look depending on the lighting.","Just what it's supposed to do. It feels good to have that \"Polaroid\" kind of fun again.","Great product! Fast delivery","I loved my Fujifilm?","I LOVE this camera! The picture quality is amazing. It is so much fun to take pictures with. Only down fall is that the film only holds 10 photos, so I use this for special occasions only. Great buy!!","Great camera!! Love the pictures it takes!!","I love this camera! It's a great alternative to the original polaroid and much cheaper now that most polaroid cameras can sell up to $300 or more on ebay. I took it with me when I visited family during the holidays and everyone loved it! I think it makes the pictures more worthwhile as we took the time to pose and make sure to make each photograph worth it--especially since we can't preview it on a digital screen and delete it if it didn't live up to our standards. Each feature is easily distinguishable, such as the flash, power button, etc. I also particularly like how each photography is wider than usual. It makes decorating and gift giving more fun!","i love this camera.","Just as pictured","my daughter loves her camara","Instant imaging is so well established, that a product review on technical capabilities is somewhat ridiculous - it's like reviewing a pencil (\"it writes with a clean, dark line, and when sharpened, allows the user to further refine their writing technique\").<br /><br />My review will be on the aesthetics of the device and the emotional response it elicits from both users and viewers. If you have never owned an Instant Camera, I strongly recommend you purchase this camera, especially if you have / know children. There's something magical in watching an image slowly emerge from a blank, black background.  My own kids were entranced.<br /><br />In fact, owning an Instant Photo Camera is like holding a photo booth in your hands. Instant photography lets you share or leave an image - right from the camera. No developing or downloading and printing is required. In places where computer access is either limited or not widely embraced, instant photography provides engagement through accessibility.<br /><br />I loved Polaroid, and despite not being able to purchase film, still have several of the cameras including Spectra (my favorite), the 600, and the ProPack. The Spectra's slim profile and pop-up design was an advantage for portability. This Fuji is far bulkier (see side-by-side pictures of the two cameras) due to the 1 - 3 meter extending lens and the AA 4-battery compartment case (Polaroid film powered the camera - brilliant). Still, it's an elegant and ergonomic design.<br /><br />With the Instax 210, you're not just buying a camera - you're buying a unique experience and a engineering /chemical marvel.<br /><br />Say \"cheese!\"","This camera makes really great pictures and kids love it.","Love my new camera.  It came all the way from Japan, complete with a personal thank-you note!","Modern day polaroid. This camera has all the options you could ask for and never gives me any problems. I dropped it once too and it still works like nothing happened.","I can not really rate this camera yet as I just received it in the mail minutes ago(but I can not post unless I rate) I opened the package and went to read the instructions and they are 100% written in Chinese. I know it shouldn't be hard to figure out but it would be nice to have proper reading instructions.","Love the camera, hope I wont have problems getting more film as I haven t seen it in stores","I bought this for my granddaughter's birthday so she could get her pictures instantly.  She loves it and takes pictures with this camera all of the time.  Great camera, she is so happy.<br /><br />Thanks!!!","Love having a polaroid camera again, and I LOVE the wide print. However, the camera itself is very poorly made. Broke into a million pieces after taking only 2 pictures (literally). I'm super bummed! If you're looking for a durable camera that you can hold onto for a long time, this is NOT it. That said, it's super fun while it lasts!","Far better price and usability than any currently available Polaroid product currently available.","Very easy to use. I'd recommend this to any novice photographers who wants a good polaroid camera to have for trips and such.","This camera is so much fun! I have the instax mini and was looking for something a little bigger to capture pictures of my two munchkins.  After playing around with the settings I was able to capture some great pics. The only thing I would have liked is different color options and maybe a sleeker design.  Other than that highly recommend.","Very fun to use.","I really like my camera and have been taking tons of pictures with it! I did notice that when taking pictures indoor it's best to have the flash on while outdoor isn't necessary unless it's super dark or near sunset. I also would recommend taking closer shots since far distance shorts are not really clear. Anyways its a pretty good camera and does a great job at saving and capturing moments!","Bought this for my twelve year old daughter - she LOVES it.","Awesome even though it's a tad bulky. Minus one star because the battery compartment keeps coming loose. I see duct tape in the near future, otherwise great for the price.","Takes great pictures.  Very clear!","This was a lot of fun at a party but film is expensive. Does work great though.","This is exactly what I thought it would be! It's large and you probably won't want to carry it around without a case, but the pictures were great and had an older feel to them. Just don't try and snap an important picture with a new role.. There is a practice slide, and you WILL have to reenact your New Year's kiss.","I scored Best Mom Ever when I gave this to my son for Christmas!  The polaroid camera is back baby and better than ever!!  LOVE IT!!","I love my fijufilm camera. Product came in a timely manner & in its original package. I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the complicated directions. I am by no means a pro with digital cameras so buyer beware, if you are not familiar with instant film cameras the directions for handling the product are not as thorough as I'd hoped they'd be. I've heard film can be expensive but I purchased a double pack of ten films for $15 through Amazon (20 film per box set) which I've been told is reasonable. A+ for shipping and packaging, B- for quality of instructions. Overall satisfied with my purchase!","Great camera!","Perfect","I love it! It literally arrived within days of me purchasing it was great!","Awesome","We have had it for two months and for some reason it won't open.  We keep it in it's case all the time unless in use.  Trying to find someone who can fix it.","This camera was great! It seems to always flash whether it's on or off. But inside or outside it takes great pictures! The camera shipping was incorrect but I called amazon customer service and they cancelled the order and replaced it and waived the shipping fee to get it to me on time. Great product! Recommend to everyone. The camera is a kind of big but lightweight.","Perfect","My 10 year old Grandaughter loves this camera. She was so excited to see the picture soon after she took it.","Excellent use at sweet sixteen photo booth","This camera is amazing but is extremely fragile. Currently have a broken battery lid so I have duck tape holding it down :/","This camera is Amazing. It prints out beautiful pictures and I love it!<br />This would be perfect if the film was less expensive. :/<br />But its definitely worth the price.","I love this","Friend said she loved it!","The larger image size is really satisfying. It's big but not too big to take anywhere, and its size gets a laugh.","I'm obsessed with my camera!","take pics perfectly and easily. A lot bigger/bulkier than it looks in picture online. Kinda tricky for small hands but love the quality of pics.","I like the bigger size of the photos you get, but the size of the camera is ridiculously huge and toy-like. I feel silly taking it out for pictures, but I like the pictures you get =)","At first I thought, omg it's just big and ugly but when I started taking it with me for pictures it draws a lot of attention in a good kind of funny way. It's definitely a camera on steroids but is a lot of fun. I love that it has a selfie lens attachment with even a little mirror to see yourself. The quality is good if you understand the lighting. You can lighten and darken the image somewhat but the flash always goes off. I've only had it for 2 months and have taken about 100 photos and haven't changed the batteries yet. It's half the price of a Polaroid and just as good!","I literally love this camera and everything about it. Would recommend","This camera is so fun!  It's big but not heavy at all, and the photos are adorable.  Just mess around with some practice shots to adjust the settings so your pics aren't overexposed (my first one was too bright on the regular setting, so I switched to \"dark\" and the photos came out perfect!).  And order the right film for it--I accidentally for the Instax MINI film on my first order and had to exchange it. The packages look very similar online, so just double check.","I loved this camera. It does not come with it's own film which sucks. I attempted to take a night picture and the flash didn't work... I believe that it was from user error :-)","Love it but like other reviewers mentioned, it is much larger than I expected.","The photo quality is good.... it fell (a light fall) all the buttons were damaged and it stopped working.. has a very poor exterior.","Girlfriend got this from me for 6 year anniversary and she loves it. Harder to decide what to use the film on.","needs better directions","I like this camera...a lot. I had bought the Instax Mini 8 & I enjoy the accessibility, color and cuteness factor. But althought this Instax 210 camera is bigger, it is badder (: lol. I love the extra controls and the size of the photo.","OMG I am so obsessed with this. As soon as I got it, which took 8 days, I started to use it and play around with it. It takes a while for you to get used to and to know the right settings for the day/night time. So you have to play around with it. The pictures come out so clear. Although the film is expensive, it is totally worth it! This product is great!","Perfect gift, it's almost magic to see the pictures develop before your eyes.","Fujifilm INSTAX 210 Instant Photo Camera<br />Old time camera and paper photo in second, it was gift for friend he is were satisfied.","It's a beautiful gift! At first it's a little hard to use especially because you are used to your phone and digital cameras but it's great fun and even selfies are really nice.","Love this camera, pictures have a dreamy tone!","Very good ","Lots of fun and pictures are good depending on the lighting.  Flash is not always helpful.  Sometimes they look too vintage (bleh) and others look crisp and new, with an old school border.  Most people smile wide seeing the camera.","LOVE this camera. It's so much fun and all of my friends love it too. So many people are complaining about the size, but you have to keep in mind that a literal full sized picture comes out of it. It's so large because it has to hold large film. If you want a smaller camera get the instax mini.<br />Also, the film is a decent price. It's a lot cheaper than the Polaroid film from The Impossible Project.<br />It takes a little getting used to lining the shot up correctly since the view finder is on the side of the camera, therefore what you are seeing is not the same thing the lens is picking up.<br />All in all, it's an excellent camera and I definitely recommend it!","This camera is so fun. I absolutely love it, and I love the wide format. The only complaint I have is that you can't disable the flash, it's always on or on auto, so it's difficult to get creative with this camera in lower lighting. Still loads of fun though! (Also, it was much bigger than I was expecting).","Worked great ! Perfect for our boating memories.","daughter loves camera","This camera is freaking cool. It has a lot more settings than it's mini counterpart. The only downside that I find is that it's HUGE. If you set it on it's back, it's just a pinch smaller than a DVD case.","Great product it does everything it says and I loved it, it takes great pictures on any environment","A little pricey, but worth it. Good quality.","Fun Camera!  Take pics in a way that has been lost in time!","Grey condition but focus lense missing","camera worked great and the pictures came out perfect.","As with the Instax film and my review on that, this camera does not seem to deliver much in the way of photography even at the minimal level of snap shot quality. Clearly, something is missing. Memories of Polaroid pix were of decent images, but I've yet to get much from this camera. Again, it could well be that the \"user,\" in this case is at fault not the equipment! Still, no point in giving up quite yet. I like the idea of instant gratification... print wise, and am a definite Fujifilm fan, having owned countless Fine Pix cameras from this manufacturer. It is gratifying to see instant film on the market again and that the trend to improving the Instax camera is not flagging since Fuji just brought out the Instax Wide 300 mode and equivalent film. If your expectations are not high and this is just for fun and conversation, get the camera and definitely stock up on film because you will go through those packs in a heart beat.","Love this camera!","Have a polaroid format camera too, and this one beats if for film availability, cost, and clarity.","I have used this camera during my trips and it takes amazing photos. It is a bit too big, but other than that it is great.","Got this as a Christmas gift for m bestfriend and she adored it. Be aware it is rather large in person.","I have used it as gifts for my friend's birthdays and weddings. Best thing to bring alone with extra 100 film or so to an event! Everyone wants one! Best gift to give to people!","A little big but super fun!!! I love taking it out when I'm with a group of my friends.always a conversation piece.","EVERYONE IS JEALOUS!! everyone wants my camera, they really love how old school the pictures look! Recommended to the fullest :)","This camera really is the best option out there for instant film. The new Polaroid film is pricey, and from what I hear the results can be unreliable. The mini Instax cameras are undesirable to me because of the film's size. Then of course there is also peel apart instant films, but the cameras are a bit more difficult to come by in good working condition<br /><br />This camera is affordable, the film is affordable, and the results are spectacular. I've heard people complain about the lack of controls on the 210, I've heard it put down as a cheap toy, but time and time again I get amazing photos with the 210. I'm convinced that if you aren't getting great results too you just haven't taken the time to really get to know this camera. And it's worth the time.<br /><br />Since getting this camera I often find my expensive Canon 7D sitting around.","Did not work when batteries inserted","This camera was cheap and takes reasonably good instant shots, although not as good as the old Polaroids did.  It is however too large to take with you easily.  That's important because the primary place you want an instant camera ix in parts of the world where you can give people what might be their only photo of themselves or their loved ones.  The smaller Fuji instant camera series, which also take smaller pictures, makes more sense, but I haven't tried one of those.  If somebody makes a very small color photo printer for a regular iPhone or digital camera that would probably better than any of this old film-based technology.","It is kind of big to handle. Sometimes the quality of the picture is not the best","nice good pic","Purchased for daughter. She loves it!","very fragile need to be very careful handling it","Excellent replacement for an old Polaroid camera. Picture quality varies depending on level of light, movement of the subject... but it has the same look and feel as vintage shots.<br />Make a great wedding gift!!","This was purchased for my twelve-year-old son, but I have enjoyed using it more than he has.  It is simple to use and the photos are decent.  It is much like the cameras used in the 1970's where the photo appears after a minute of two.  The quality of the photo is not high definition but it is fun to watch it appear.  If you need a hard copy of a photo immediately, this is what you need.","I absolutely love the instax line. The Wide 210 produces beautiful photos, highly recommend!","So much fun and so easy to use!","I gave it as a gift and my friend loves it.  I think I'm going to have to get one for myself.  I prefer without the flash, but I think that's a personal preference.","Great!","I bought this instant photo camera for my 16 year old brother who went absolutely crazy for it!  While he is definitely of the \"selfie\" generation, I think he loves the novelty of having a physical printout of his photos immediately in the same way we had polaroids when I was his age!  He sent me a photo (on his phone, of course!) of how his locker is now lined with these photos and how much he is loving it.  I recommend you pick up a few packs of the Instax Wide Instant Film packs too to keep the photography juices going for the teen in your life!  This was a fun and interactive gift that keeps on giving!  It has held up well to daily use since before Christmas and shows no signs of issues - so fun!","Every photographer needs an instant camera. When I first got it, I wanted to do some personal projects with it and just mess around, but what I came to realize is that this camera is really a social camera at heart. However, it beats social media any day. I don't really use it for just general shooting like I thought I would. I use it with my friends and with my kids. It's always draws attention at parties and even strangers will open up to you and ask you about your \"Polaroid.\" The film is kinda expensive but no where near as bad as the Impossible Project 600 films. if you have kids or friends you like to photograph, you will all have a lot of fun using this camera together and there is really nothing like having that moment to hold in your hand.<br /><br />One technical thing I want to point out is that it defaults to focusing at .9 - 3 meters when you turn it on, so if you're going to photograph anything farther than about 9 feet away, always remember to switch the focusing mode. It would be more intuitive if it automatically focused at infinity and you had to manually switch it to move closer. Even at about f/14, your shots will be noticeably out of focus if you don't pay attention.","Quite big but works perfect photos come out really well","I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!!","I've had Polaroid for years. Impossible film is more for an artful experience. This camera is different, because, it's dependable. You're going to get a sharp, clear and super colorful picture when taken correctly. Great flash is a +","so much fun. my daughter has been useing it like crazy and loves it.","Yes, it's huge (not so heavy though) and the flash shoots kinda whenever he wants but, other than that, it's an incredible camera. The film size it's just peeeerfect, colors are really vibrant and clear, it's super easy to use, the price it's super affordable and it also works as a conversation starter ('cause it's just too funny when you take it out)... what else can you ask for?","cool camera","Easy and fun to use! Got a lot of comments along the lines of \"I didn't even know they made Polaroids anymore!\" Worked great straight out of the box, no fuss, easy assembly (just install batteries and film), point and shoot. The aim takes a little practice, but it was perfect for the event I was shooting.","Great little camera!  This was a gift and it was a hit.  Pictures resemble the old polaroid pics.  Not your iPhone quality, but fun retro look.","I love it except recieveing the film was kinda a problem","Love that the Polaroid camera is making a comeback so bought this for my 13 year old for Christmas and she can't use it yet because it did not come with film. So another order thru Amazon for film and hopefully next week she'll be able to take pics. Recommend they put at least a few pages of film","bigger than i thought it would be but my daughter loves this camera.  I think the pictures are better than the polaroid instamatic plus it is less expensive and so is the film!  completely happy so far with this christmas gift!","My daughter wanted this camera.  She thinks it is great.  Very simple to use and a good size.  I gave it a four though because the film is really expensive.","all ok","Love this guy.","I was surprised with this gift not long ago after wanting an Instax for so long. I was super excited and definitely had reason to be.<br />I didn't expect the 210 to be as big as it is (think smallish dslr, or, as big as a teenage girl's face. Yes, I am serious.) But a big camera means bigger images and that's what I wanted. The images that come out are at least the size of two Instax mini photos, plus maybe half an inch? It's worth it in my opinion. You an fit much more on the film that with a Mini.<br />So far I have shot indoors at night, indoors at sunrise, and outdoors near noon.<br />The flash has gone off three out of six times because of a little button you can use to turn off flash. (See image) Many people say you cannot turn the flash off, which is somewhat true in some cases. You press the flash button to turn it on officially and you don't turn it on to get no flash. If your camera feels that there is enough light, it will not fire the flash. If if feels it is too dark, it will fire. So just make sure that you have enough light and it won't fire off.<br />It has a lighten, darken, and normal button that you press for more customized options. (See image) I've used the lighten and normal options. The lightened image had very vibrant coloring and turned out pretty great with minimal wash out (I used flash on that one and it as my first image).<br />Some things I want to point out:<br />The Battery Compartment<br />The camera's battery compartment was set up strange. All coils were on one side, yet you were supposed to alternate ends, like + - + -. I don't know if they are all like this but mine was. It didn't turn on when I pushed the lower button so it does matter how the batteries are put in.<br />The closure for the battery compartment is kind of cheap and can't seem to lock in like most battery covers do. So I taped it shut with electrical tape and it works fine.<br />The film purchased with the camera was easy to put in once you looked at the directions on the foil packaging.<br />The coloring can be tricky but I have only had it one day so I do have stuff to learn. Most of my images have turned out great.<br />I recommend checking your camera strap every few minutes as the one that came with the box can slide down and become loose. (Which possibly equals a broken camera if you are on some hard surface like concrete)<br />This camera is not very heavy while holding on its own but can feel heavy on your neck.<br />The lighting settings, distance settings, and flash icon can be found on the small oval screen on the side (see image).<br />I think I covered everything...","Lots of fun and easy to use. Pictures are good, too.","Superb Camera and Photos come out great on regular size paper, not like the midgets fropm Poloroid.","LOVE.","I bought one for my niece which worked perfectly, this one doesn't develop the whole picture. We are thinking about returning it.","Works great and I didn't have an issue with the rollers being dusty like I did with an instax 210 I purchased, brand new, from a different company. Thank you!","Got this for Christmas and I can't stop taking photos! Love love love.","awesomeness :)","Liked by 15 year old granddaughter.","IT IS A LARGE CAMERA; TAKES GOOD PICTURES, THOUGH.","Works very good! But sometimes while taking a selfie I can't take off the flash so it kinda looks funny","Gave this as a gift, and the recipient loved it!","Fantastic!  So glad there is something current to take instant photos.  The price is reasonable and it's a really fun little gift!","I bought this as a gift for my sister, and I have never seen someone's face light up so much! The camera is bigger than I imagined, but comes with a strap and four AA batteries. I bought three twin packs of film for her to use when she opened it. She absolutely loves taking pictures with it, and getting to watch them develop. I would highly recommend this to anyone for themselves or for a gift to someone else.","Arrived as expected. A gift.",":)","It came pretty fast and looked to have everything it needed (even came with 8 batteries) but it is a Christmas gift for my daughter so for now 5 Stars and if it is as it should be it will stay 5 (I will update after using w the quality etc.) if not then I will drop the 5. BUT SO FAR SO GOOD.","It is big and bulky and the film not cheap but it is fun.","Liked it a lot, worked well for my son's birthday party photo booth!","Had lot of fun taking pictures at my party last night. Everybody likes it.","Got this as a gift for my girlfriend.  She loves it.  It takes bigger photos than the smaller versions which makes it more versatile.  All of her friends think its great too and it is definitely a conversation starter.","Bought this for my Mom for Christmas along with 4 packs of film. She had been snapping many great photos. Great for seniors who want an easy and fast use camera with no gadgets.","It's so fun and easy to use, and the pictures come out great! The only problem I have is that sometimes the film gets stuck and I'm not sure if it's the camera, or the pack of film that is faulty. The first time one of the films got stuck (it wouldn't roll out at all, but you can hear the camera trying to push it out) I thought my camera was broken! I took that pack of film and had to reinsert a new pack, so I wasted about $10. I didn't have a problem with the newly inserted film. A couple uses later and the film got stuck again so I googled the problem. This time, I shut off the lights in my room so it was pitch black, and took the film pack out and just put it back in. It fixed the issue and only had to waste one piece of film instead of the whole pack by doing this method. I've had this camera for almost a year now and have only taken about 60 pictures, and this problem has only happened twice.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great camera. The instax 210 is a bit big and bulky, but I have gotten used to it. It does fit in a regular sized tote bag but takes up a lot of space, I use a backpack (small sized backpack, not one you would use for school) to carry this camera around instead. I've dropped the camera once (about 3 feet) onto hardwood floor and it didn't break, only the batteries came out. The size of the film is perfect, it's 2x bigger than the mini film. I recommend this to anyone who loves taking pictures!","Great little camera, I mostly use it for parties or events. It can be really fun to take pictures of your guests and have the images pop right out of the camera. The image quality is also great, good color and decently sharp. The camera is a little cheaply made and I've banged mine around a few times and now the images have trouble coming out the top. So if you buy the camera try to treat it delicately and you shouldn't have any problems","Very big camera. Totally old school. Takes amazing pics but selfies are near impossible.  Would buy again and again.","Works great! Just be sure and follow the distance recommendations. My husband kept taking super close ups (not recommended) and we were like, \"The view finder is not right.\" I read the instructions and it says .9meters as the least amount of distance. After that, everything turned out great. Fun camera!","I like it, but after all the hassle of researching and wondering whether or not I should get it, I actually don't use it all that much. People warned me that once you get used to digital it's hard to go back to one time shots... the film is to expensive to just throw it away if you mess up so this made me freak out a lot when taking pictures. Also, I wanted to use it for traveling but didn't realize the x ray machines mess up the film and all that... way too much stress. But do not let my personal experience deter you from getting a chance to own one of these. All I'm saying is that it's not all that convenient and ends up costing you with all the film. But it can still be fun if you're not worried about perfect photos and if you are willing to pay for the film. Also, the camera is BIG... really big... and that can be a turn off as well... I wish they had a smaller one with larger film.... to me it wasn't worth getting the small film... it's your decision and you will have fun with it either way. Just letting you know the things I went through with it so at least you have a realistic idea of what it's like owning this. There was nothing that was going to stop me from getting this camera, but typical of me I have to learn the hard way :)<br /><br />***Since writing this review, I accidentally put two unopened film boxes through an x-ray machine without realizing they were in the bag. When I went to use it, there was a barely milky white thing in my picture which was very unnoticeable which I was grateful because I was so upset for having forgotten to take it out. This is what I meant by a little stressful lol But thank God, the film was OK... I have also since this review bought more film and just have to make sure to remember to bring it with me because it really is nice. If you decide to purchase, pay attention to the film which EXPIRES at a certain date. Film is expensive so just letting you know ;)","Fun camera! Bought with the Fuji wide film for my wedding. Everything was as expected.","Love love it!!!!","dont love it BUT it serves purpose","purchased as a gift","great to use for a wedding album","I've wanted a Instant Camera for so long. It arrived very quickly and was exactly what I hoped for. My mom has a booked filled with instant photos from when I was a kid and now I get to make one for my kids.","Great","Awesome. They break easily though (my 2nd one), but I do want to clarify that it was because I was horse back riding so I'm pretty sure that it was my negligence ... In any case, they're made out of plastic so, don't do anything too intense, unlike me and I think you'll be fine.","Amazing!","Good price, quality.","Everything was excellent.  Much better price than in a Camera Shop!!!","Great camera. Very fun taking pictures. Best price on the market. Excellent shipping and handling.","I love this camera! Only complaint is that the viewfinder doesn't show through the lens so it can sometimes be difficult to line up a photo and even though there is a button for it, you can't actually controll if the flash goes off, but other than those small complaints I LOVE this camera!!","Well, first of all, it's very easy & fun to use, I love watching the pictures develop.<br />-1 star because this camera takes quite dark shots when it's cloudy outside even if I try to lighten them by selecting the ''Light'' option.<br />It is sad to have really dark shots in my album.<br />Also, I have had an issue with this camera while I was on my 1st or the 2nd film pack - the pictures would get stuck inside on the way out and would come out damaged or poorly developed.  I never figure out what cause that problem because when I tried to use it after a year, this never happened again.<br />At this moment I am having another problem - white spots on each picture that I take. I just ordered another pack of film to see if it's the current film or the camera. Hope, it's not the latter because it was my husband's present and at that time, Instax 210 was around 85$...<br /><br />Update: The white spots are caused by some camera issue. I found it out by getting and using a bran new pack of film.","I've had mine for about six months now and it still works fine. A great conversation starter as well. I've taken about 125-150 Polaroidss so far, I use it all the time.","So far it works great!<br /><br />We thought it had died out of the box, however upon further inspection (and looking at reviews) we found out you need to be careful with the batteries as they rotate if the positive or negative section touches the coil!","Wonderful Camera! Surprisingly cheaper than a instax mini and in my opinion better!","This is a really fun camera. It is a pretty large camera but I've used the instax mini cameras and it's definitely worth carrying a larger camera....the print sizes are substantial in comparison to the mini.","I absolutely love this camera! The size of the camera is a little shocking at first, but it's rather lightweight and the quality of photos more than makes up for the size...plus it make for quite the conversation starter! It's very easy to load film and so fun to use.<br /><br />It's so much exciting watching your photos develop in front of your eyes - brings you back to the days of old polaroid photos...which is exactly why I purchased this! We had so much fun using this at a party that two people said they were going to order the same camera as soon as they got home.","Perfect Polaroid camera. Works great. Love this thing. Used it for the wedding and got so many great shots and the \"vintage\" feel made it even cooler.","Great to use, but absolutely not the best in terms of durability: I've gone through three of these - the last after it fell a scant foot and a half. That aside, it's a super fun camera to use as long as you understand and accept its limitations. These are:<br /><br />1. Incredible parallax error under a metre.<br />2. Slow flash recycle time<br />3. Middling close-focus attachment<br /><br />If you're willing to live with these, it's a great addition to your photography arsenal and destined to make you popular at parties :) Hand the prints out as party favors - people love 'em!","It really is awesome how this camera can take you back. The body is big and bulky, but what do you expect? It's still a better choice than polaroid bc the film is cheaper and it comes with an add on for closeups!","This is the perfect camera that I have been wanted. It has the wider film which I think is more practical and useful that the mini series. It has great quality! Love this so much","This is a fabulous camera. It's quite large, but pretty lightweight and is worth the extra size because the size of the pictures are perfect. The pictures are very close in size to the ones from my old Polaroid. There are a lot of cool settings on this camera that help focus the light, and it has a flash, so it takes great pictures both inside and out.<br /><br />I second the reviewer though who says you have to be very careful with this camera. I dropped mine on the beach and despite having no outer physical damage, it did quite working, so I am about to order my second one.<br /><br />Just be really careful in handling, and you'll have a great instant camera experience.","This camera is a lot of fun, and the prints are great.<br /><br />This camera feels good in the hand, and I like the Fujifilm Instax film a lot.  The color saturation is pleasing, and I like the way skin tones are represented. The included macro lens attachment is useful, I have taken many photos with it.<br /><br />There is something about the experience of taking a photograph that comes out of the camera instantly and develops right then that is satisfying in a way that digital cannot duplicate. A well captured instant photograph feels like an acheivement. This new generation of instant photography brings that magic back. This camera is a great way to check it out.","Good camera, but you can't force the flash OFF. you can force it ON, but otherwise it does a \"smart flash\" which is obnoxious enough to take away 2 stars. Other than that, its super easy to use, the film is affordable, and the pictures are large and of good quality.","It will work great for our Wedding open house.","Love the pictures that come out and the wide print. Offers additional distance settings and on/off flash. Provides count on number of remaining film. Challenging to take selfies, but does come with a simplistic \"mirror\" lens attachment to assist.<br /><br />Cons: Too too too heavy to carry around! And the cost of film obviously adds up.","The camera is larger than I expected but that did not make it hard to use in any way. It doesn't weigh a lot and the settings are fairly easy to use. I recommend using the flash all the time indoors. Battery life is very good, I took 100 pictures in one afternoon without having to change batteries.","Not many choices when it comes to instant cameras so if that's what you need, this is OK. Not many features...very bare bones. You will blow through a lot of film before you figure out the best exposures to use.","Digital this camera will never compete with. I bought it for instant gratification. Quality of photos is far from what others claimed them to be. Maybe I just wasn't meant to enjoy the instant thing?","none","This is s really fun camera.  I bought it for my teenage daughter and now her big sister wants one too.  It is very large, but no one seems to care.  This camera is the life of the party.  Everyone wants to try it out, then everyone wants to keep the cute pictures.","We've had a blast with this camera. Honestly, it's the best thing we've bought for our family.  There's nothing like being able to hand your kids the camera and not having a heart attack if it gets bumped- like our 600 dollar SLR digital one, and to instantly have those memories right there...it's like being a kid again.  Everywhere we go with it, folks smile because everyone remembers those great old poloroid photos.  I love the options and I'm glad we got the wide format, even though it is bulky, it's no bigger than my Canon Rebel SLR with the lenses and extra battery and junk, and I still haven't downloaded my photos off that SD card.  If you have kids, get it, you won't regret it.  Let them snap photos of you, have something tangible today because you just never know.","Excellent","Neck strap clips are cheaply made and snap off easily. Otherwise cool little camera.","My camera did not come black and so it came as a dark blue and grey colored camera which I did not mind later on as I used it. Perfect condition.","Just got it and can't stop taking pictures! It is so much fun ..super easy to use and load. Takes a good quality picture. Reasonably priced camera and film and does not need special batteries ...just AA's that most of us have handy.","Great camera!<br />I have bought 2 of them to create a garden photo booth at my wedding and it worked perfectly. Not only the quality of the photos were great for \"polaroid type camera\", but the size of the photos was way bigger than regular Polaroid.<br />The camera itself looks a bit plasticy, but worked fabulously not only on the wedding, but also on honeymoon.","If you think this is some average sized camera.. You're wrong its freaking huge. Its awesome cause you wont lose it but its so big lol.. I need a case for it haha.","Love love love love it!!!","Great camera.","Camera came quickly and in time for us to use for our couple's wedding shower. The flash is very bright and takes great wide shots. It's a little bulky but that's to fit the film..it is a Polaroid camera after all. Only down side is the film....it's pricey. Hopefully I can find a place to order in bulk.","An awesome camera!!!! It is bulky and it is a large camera. Don't expect it to be small cause it won't be! But it is a great camera and I love it!","It's awesome and I use it daily :D","Love this - super easy and fun to use and arrived right on time! Forget about urban outfitters for double the price!!","I've always wanted instant camera and happy with Fujifilm 210 ..pictures quality are ok, However after taking photos some of the photos come with small white Dots which annoyed me little .. but Maybe its because of the film not the camera, well .. Hopefully !","Really cool. Works well but its a brick. We were the envy of everyone everywhere we went. People would stop and point and say \"renga\". We have great foto tho","Not a many options when using this.  Looking theu the viewfinder, you can see the lens, meaning you're not accurately seeing while composing.  Also, the flash goes off no even when it's turned off, and sometimes with the auto exposure, it won't fire, resulting in wasted shots/silhouettes.","The picture itself comes out nicely but the camera isn't the best quality. The capture button stopped working on the second photo the day it came so I'm replacing it with another one. I didn't drop it or misuse it at all... Hopefully the next camera isn't like that.","Used at our wedding - worked great!","The kids think this is a cool retro way to take pictures. It generally works well, but our last pack of film had a couple jam ups (picture did not eject properly). Could be a bad pack of film.","it's easy for the internals to break/shift out of place. my film gets stuck quite often. could be less bulky :(. but I love the concept of it, this size beats the mini camera","This is a fun camera. Its big, bulky, and very simple to use. It's mostly made of plastic, but the plastic feels smooth and durable in the hand. There are some buttons on the side to adjust the settings, a silver shutter release on the grip, a flash, and a plastic viewfinder. And that is it! You also get a macro lens adapter in the box. Anyone who picks up this camera can quickly learn to shoot in 10 shots (one exposure pack). After I learned how to load film in, I had a lot of fun taking pictures and watching them develop in front of my eyes. Very cool!<br /><br />Here are some things to be aware of. 1) The flash always fires. There's no way to turn it off. You'll just have to get used to seeing washed out, colorless faces in your photos sometimes. 2) Its really big so don't expect any candid shots. 3) Its surprisingly lightweight. 4) The shutter release button can be a little tricky to push since it doesn't bulge out like a normal button.<br /><br />For the price, I recommend this camera if you're just curious about taking instant photos.","very cute, pretty hard to use, but once get it, could be really cool. and this camera takes lots of battery  T  T","Love it! So much fun and super easy to use.","Although the plastic body looks fragile, I have found it to be durable. I dropped my camera about two feet from the ground onto concrete and got away with just a few scratches and a broken battery cover. Other than that the camera still works perfectly. I love the wide format of the photos opposed to the smaller instax films.","Super fast shipping, camera is exactly as described. Thanks!","My favorite of my three Fujifilm instax cameras. Simple, and takes surprisingly great pictures. Must adjust the functions but they're easy. The wide, rather than mini, is awesome.","film is costly","I'd had my heart set on an instant film camera for quite some time. I'm a photographer and can admittedly be a total camera snob--I was all about getting an original Polaroid camera. However, since they are often overpriced and the film is near impossible to find without spending an obscene amount, I reluctantly turned to Fujifilm. Let me just say, I love this camera. Well priced and obtaining the film is a breeze (FujiFilm Instax Wide Picture Format Instant Film). Instant Film is just incredibly fun to play around with and the interface on this camera makes it perfect for beginners. I highly recommend!","Just as I expected.","Fun Polaroid camera! Love it!!","Product works great and is fun to use.","Pretty awesome! It's HUGE. The photos quality surprised me way too much, it's more good than I thought! Full colors and very well contrast! Worth the buy.","I aboustly love this camera , its a bit big and fragile . but after yoy get over those two things its a great product, cheep film and great photos . i already broke one but im coming back for a another because i love the product","excellent","Love it, I recommend buyer.","I bought this to use as a photo booth for my wedding and it was a HUGE HIT! I wish the film wasn't so expensive. But incredibly awesome to have. Instant film is always fun.","I am not a photographer but enjoyed my fuji instax mini 7 yet the film size was too small so got this one through ebay.  I didnt know this would be like a size of ipad but a lot thicker and heavier. Definitely not portable but you want a bigger pic so i guess dont really have an option. Couldnt find the film in bestbuy offline so getting film should be through online and in bulk since takin 200 pics is very easy when u especially have a kid and take a photo and show him.","bought for my gf. she loves it but there has been a few times where it jams from the photos.","Works well. Looks nice. The lighting was a bit dim, but you can adjust that if you are aware of shadows/flash etc. It's kind of big but who cares, it's lots of fun. :)  The first image I took means the world to me... I am glad I had it instantly and we were both able to look at it together. ^_^","Too bad your eyes were closed! :) Much more fun, pictures feel more in the moment without the countless re-takes. I like it!","Good price for a nice camera.","Cool Camera.","It is very large, but I knew that purchasing it. It's simple to use, anyone can figure it out. It takes great photos. I love it. I use my instax mini 90 more of course because of the size, it's more convenient. But the 210 it's great, I have nothing negative to say about it. I love it.","This camera is lots of fun! I had to return the first one I purchased because the pictures were underexposing big time, even outdoor in sunny conditions. After doing a google search, apparently these cameras have light meters built in that may be faulty on shipment. Amazon was nice enough to exchange it for me no questions asked. Problem solved, works great. I love this thing. Night saturated tones and colors. Rather sharp for such a cheap instant camera. It is pretty BIG, so be prepared to get some laughs. Everyone says WHOA when i bring it out of my backpack lol. It's light and not a burden to carry though. Just need a bag or backpack big enough to carry it in. Family and friends love when i snap a picture and hand it to them to keep. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants an instant camera.<br /><br />1 Con I suppose, film is rather expensive. Coming in at about 85 cents a print, i can make cheaper prints on my little canon photo printer but it still does not come close to the experience of shooting with this awesome camera. I wish Fuji would sell these film just a liitttle bit cheaper. But no big deal, pick your shots wisely!","love it, it's easy to use and the size is perfect. would recommend it to anyone who likes vintage photography. the only bad this is the size of this camera but it has a strap so it's easy to carry!","This camera is awesome!...I was thinking about purchasing the Fujifilm Instax mini 8, but I wanted a bigger picture, so I ended up buying this instead! This camera takes such clear, good quality pictures. I am obsessed with it!","Love love love this camera. The pictures come out with surprisingly clear details and the colors are wonderful. I bought this for my niece's graduation party and it was a hit. Everyone exclaimed about the size, but after the first picture was taken everyone wanted one and I had to keep refilling the film. Went through a box of 10 very quickly. It's well worth the cost.","This is a very fun instamatic camera that I bought for my dad for his birthday.  The camera on the large size but its size allows for nice sized  prints.  The pictures come out bright and colorful and look better to me than those produced by Polaroid's instant 600 film.  I'm so glad someone still makes instant cameras and film.  There's nothing like snapping instant pictures at a get together then being able to hand them out INSTANTLY.  I highly recommend this camera.","Came on time, a lot bigger than I expected but it is overall a great product for a great price. The pictures are clear and the perfect size. There is also a detachable mirror lens in case you want to take a selfie. Definitely worth the investing","Almost like the original!","i absolutely love it i haven't had any problems and i just LOVE it. The pictures are very clear and i got it as a birthday present and I've taken so many pictures. the only downside is how the film is expensive but other than that its a great camera i recommend to anyone.","Great camera","Honestly this Fuji-film camera is a wonder! I have never seen such good quality from a Polaroid before. batteries last very long also. the quality of every picture is great, though since the looking hole isn't connected to the lens it may have a slight drawback, and photos may come out not as you expected, slightly lower than what you saw through the looking hole. but still a great camera overall! i have had this camera for a year now and it is still showing great pics, totally meets my expectations. a great buy.","If you can handle it breaking within the first three months you bought it, it's actually quite a fun toy. I have bought three of them as gifts for friends. I have also bought three and all three have broke. But it's fun for the cheap price to have a polaroid camera again","My daughter loves her camera! She's very selective about the pictures she takes with this camera since the film is expensive and has to be ordered. Also, the battery door broke. :(","Easy to use, love the wider format of the film.","Though I love the quality if the photo, it's very hard to get the frame you are looking for. What you see in the lens is not what you are going to get. It take a while to figure out where you actually need to place the camera versus what you are seeing in the window.","Great camera, recommend it to anybody that shoots.","Great price and fast shipping!","We bought this camera to take on a trip around the world. What often happens is that tourists ask to take pictures of people but never leave any pictures because they are taken with digital cameras. We wanted to be able to leave some pictures, especially where children were involved. So we always asked permission to take pictures with our digital cameras and then took an extra one with this camera to leave with the people involved. They were usually thrilled--especially the children. So if you are travelling around the world and plan to take pictures in places where you might not be able to get pictures back to the people, or where the people don't often have pictures of themselves, then this is ideal. Mostly the children were thrilled to have the pictures but that's OK because it pleased the adults around them to see their children being pleased. Makes for good relations.","It is a good instant camera but breaks too easily.","This is the second one I  have bought.  The first one was such a hit at my wedding, I ended up giving it to my niece as she loved it.  I then had to buy this one for my baby shower, where my younger niece loved it and used it all day, but this time I held on to it.  It is such a fun camera for events.","Works pretty well. Just remember to take the batteries out when not in use.","Takes some getting used to when finding the right angles and darkness or lightness but very user friendly and creates great pictures ,as well the classic Polaroid look.","Great camera great quality doing exactly what i wanted from this camera. I buying a second one soon. No joke!!!!","I bought this for my wife and she loves it.<br /><br />In the age of digital pictures and instagram filters, it's nice to have a picture you can hold in your hand and that has such a classic look. It's really weird holding a picture and knowing how singular it is, that it's the only copy of it out there and that it could be easily lost. It's a nice feeling that I haven't felt in a while. It feels like holding a moment in your hand.<br /><br />If you're trying to recreate the classic photos of the 80's, this won't work. The colors seem better than I remember the classic cameras having. Personally, I like the improved colors. Also, the photos are not in the classic square shape; they're rectangular, similar to the way tv's went from square to rectangle.<br /><br />Also, this sucker is HUGE! Almost comically so. They make smaller instant cameras, but if you want a decent size photo then you've gotta get a big camera. At least it's a conversation piece. You'll have to wear the strap or have a large purse/backpack to carry it.","If youre looking for instant photographs on the larger scale, this is perfect.<br /><br />Be sure to handle with care since it isn't built for the rugged.<br />Con: Flash cannot be turned off<br />Pro: Good quality film and great colors","As a novice photographer, I found this camera to be fun, easy to carry around (despite its large size, it is very light), and straight foward to just point and shoot. People are thrilled to get instant pictures as gifts for a party and people fawn over to browse through pictures taken. Really, really fun. However, it is difficult to take flattering pictures of light skinned people, especially in the Sun! Even after darkening the picture, very light skinned people's faces look washed out or blurred. Still cool, just not as easy to shoot in the sun as I imagined. Recommend for parties and for get togethers when you need to add a little spice or fun activity.","My work with this fuji instax has become such a crucial part of my creative process. The color rendition of the film is superior to the impossible project film for the poloaroids. The build quality is really good on this camera and it is also really easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone who is in the market to buy an instant camera. It is leaps and bounds cooler than a polaroid and looks a  lot cooler too.","The pictures are a great size, and I suppose the camera has to be large to accommodate them. It's surprisingly easy to grow accustomed to the bulk, and the camera is nice and light, compared to how big it is.<br />Some of my pictures needed better lighting, despite using the flash, but I'm still completely satisfied with my purchase.","I used this camera as an instant camera for a picture guest book at my wedding. The camera was actually bigger than I expected it to be (actually, kind of comically big!), but it was just perfect for what we needed! Our guests had so much fun taking photos - it was a big hit! Instead of a guest book that no one signs, we have a ton of great, funny photos to remember our day!","Love it! It's kind of big but pretty good quality and lets you put on different settings! I brought it to Italy and got some great pics :)","I absolutely love this camera! The size of the film is awesome, the material is great, and the lighting adjustments are an added bonus compared to the instax mini. It was also neat getting the self portrait clip with mini mirror in the package since that was definitely unexpected. Would love to see more color choices, though.","Used this camera for a retro party and this camera produced high quality photos for an instant camera. The film is the larger,wide version of the Instax brand, so be warned.","Yes, it's big, but hey you'll never lose it!!  It's so easy to operate,  just pop in the batteries and film!  I was taking pictures in 3 minutes.  And the pictures are gorgeous,  sharp and clear and a great size for albums or framing.  VERY HAPPY  WITH THIS PURCHASE!!","What a refreshing camera to have and use . You get it out and people are confused it's large and exaggerated almost anime like and yet it's light weight . The camera feels solid and well constructed and when you click the shutter people's eyes light up with surprise as the rises from the top. What great print size and quality . The color saturation rivals 35 mm prints, quality of definition and clarity of image are excellent. You would swear the photo was taken by a high end dslr camera. Hard to believe well I am happly in shock as well. I have owned a Fuji slr camera and the optical quality is on the same level of excellence as Fuji is know for . Thank goodness Fuji never abandoned instant photography and brought it back to us here in the USA . What Polaroid ?","this is a great little camera and a lot of fun at parties. The pictures are what you would expect for an instant camera but it is easy to use even for the \"photo challenged\" like myself.","Good camera, a little large, but it has to be since it is an \"instant camera\". I bought it to use in my Sunday School class, (I teach 3-5 year olds)  and they love seeing themselves. So it is perfect for this use. It does take a good picture.","Pros:<br />- The size of the print is wide enough to be an elegant little gift<br />- The colors are rich and the sharpness is surprisingly good, still retaining the look of a the traditional polaroids<br />- The film is about 70 cents and in boxes of 10 which still beats carrying a printer around and there is just something magic about 'instant'<br />- The camera is very easy to use<br /><br />Cons:<br />Maybe the feel of so much plastic in your hands, but it's $60 so not sure to expect anything else. So far it has held up very well with months of living on the road through several countries, but we're also very careful not to drop it.","My son was dying to have an instant camera - this one was perfect for him.  He did eventually stop using it, but it was a good size and the photos are a good size.  Picked this one for the larger photos instead of the smaller ones.","We bought this camera for my grandson's 1st birthday party.  Before the guests left we took a picture of them<br />with the birthday boy as an extra party favor.  It was a big hit.  We were surprised how big the camera<br />was when we opened the box.  It is much larger than the picture shows in the advertisements.  It takes great<br />pictures, very clear and colorful.","I was a bit uncertain about purchasing this camera as it seemed to be really big and heavy.  I was debating between this one and the Mini INSTAX.  The Mini's prints are about credit card size and the prints for this camera a about twice as that.  I am so glad I bought it!<br />Yes, it is on the bigger side but it comes with a strap that can go around your neck to carry the camera around.  It is a lot of fun to take a picture and immediately get the print, I really missed that.  The only problem is that everyone wants their picture taken and the film is about 85 cents to a $1.  Amazon has good prices.<br />I used to have a Polaroid camera, but since they stopped producing the film could no longer get the instant print and they got super expensive.  I am glad I made this purchase and hope that Fujifilm continues to make the film!  I recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for an instant camera.","I've been waiting to get my hands on one for awhile and this was a steal, considering it's new. I debated on getting this one or the Fujifilm Instax Mini and the bigger film won me over. The effects are great and the pictures comes out perfect. It's so much fun to use on dates and going out. It makes everything look nice. Film is a bit pricey but I just try not to waste film.<br />It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be and flash occasionally goes off. It would be nice if there were other colors like the Fujifilm Instax Mini.<br /><br />My only problem with this was that when I first got it, one of the metal conductor for the batteries was missing. I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it and getting a new one so I made a makeshift paperclip conductor. It works amazingly.","It didn't start working again after I dropped it. The day after receiving this I put it around my neck (after attaching the strap) and it slipped right out and fell and shattered into about 4 pieces that I managed to fit back together. I lost about 4 exposures of film because it was getting jammed and wouldn't come up after that. But, I didn't freak out. I remained patient. I took the jammed prints out, re-entered the cartridge and tried and tried again. The camera works perfectly now but I don't ever trust the strap (even though I've adjusted it and it's more secure now). I wish I had a nice bag for it--there are such nice carrying cases for the instax mini, all the ones for this are so plain.<br /><br />Overall though--amazing camera. I am so glad i bought it. It is not made with the best materials and it is very fragile, but if you take it for what it is, and you're careful with it--you'll be well rewarded.","This thing is the greatest idea ever.<br />Every body keeps asking me how I got it and is amazed by the low price.<br />Takes nice pics, really.","Love taking polaroids with friends and family always great to look back on, never messes up always does what its supposed to do, LOVE IT","I knew that an instant camera is obviously going to be much larger than any other normal camera, but this was surprising. It was incredibly bulky. Honestly, it is the size of my face. It isn't heavy, like other reviews have said, but I just can't carry this with me without an equally bulky camera bag. When the lens is out, it is even bigger (again, obviously) and it was just a huge surprise.<br /><br />The settings are great and the quality of the pictures is good, which is what saved this from being 3 stars.<br /><br />Overall, the price of a 35mm film camera and an instant film camera come pretty close to breaking even, so it is up to you whether or not you want to deal with the size.<br /><br />I'm on the fence on whether or not I want to keep it. The size! Gah!","Took 180 pictures of grade school children with the Easter Bunny and 25 pictures of the seniors.<br />Easy to use.","Large camera but makes it seem more professional. Works fairly well much of the time. Wish I had better control of flash. But great for the price.","I did not think it possible to actually make great instant photos, but after reading the many positive reviews I decided to give this camera a try!  I am so glad I purchased this camera with extra film!  It does not disappoint, but delivers good, clear photos!  Photos are not digital quality, but great color for an instant camera!","it is a large unit which is a down side but understandable due to the size of the picture and the lack of self timer. besides these two things its a good camera that takes clear great pictures. Worth the purchase","It's a rather large contraption, but it does its job well. On the side it has a counter where you can see how many pictures you have left on your film; the flash works well; the pictures are clear. Overall, I love it! It's fun and I can't wait to use it for my wedding!","I purchased this Fujifilm INSTAX 210 camera to create artistic images. As a photographer, I like to experiment with different mediums to create art. This camera is lightweight and durable. It is larger than other instant film cameras in the market. However, I like the bulkiness and feel of the camera.","Bought this for our wedding \"photo booth\".  This camera is awkward and large which makes you feel really goofy while taking photos, but it's so worth it.  The photos came out great.","I will be attending a music festival in Tampa from May 2nd to May 4th. I bought this camera to be able to use during the festival for meet and greets. I'm hoping they do have the meet and greets, because as of right now all they've said is that they're working on them. But if they do happen, I'll be able to have my photos signed!<br />This is my first polaroid. I fell in love with it the minute I took it out of the box. It's a lot bigger than I'd hoped but it works like a charm. Only downside is that film is so expensive :((( but oh well.<br />Great product.","I love this camera! Don't let the pictures fool ya, it's HUGE! You will get a lot of stares wearing this camera around your neck, but it's because people are so amazed that these cameras still exist. No matter the technology out there these days, people still love to think about the old days when things were simple, especially with these cameras. And everyone always wants to wait and see how the picture turns out... it's just so much fun! Can't say enough good things about the camera! And it is pretty cheap!... only the film is expensive. But, it's not a camera you use everyday anyway. :)","Bought this for a party and all of the guests loved it! The flash is too bright indoors but the fun element overrides any lack of quality. Doesn't take the best photos but is fun to use and great to have if you only want it for the fun factor.","Polaroids are always fun, but getting it to take a decent picture is difficult. This one doesn't capture the image you see thru the viewfinder,","Worked great, have allowed three friends borrow for their weddings...I should be charging a fee lol. Pics turned out nice","Fuji never stopped making instant cameras and film. They still make the professional version of the Polaroid Peal apart film which is just stunning.<br /><br />This is all plastic with a very simple lens - it is just nice to have some instant photography.<br /><br />If you show it to youngster they are intrigued and pleased.<br /><br />A forgotten pleasure Thanks FUJI!","Great camera, works really well. Its a bit big but for the price i can deal with it..Bought it for my medispa for before and afters.works well for that.Glad i bought it the quality of pictures are good as well.","this camera does what suppose to do and does it nice. if you need some instant camera that is affordable but give you good quality this is the one.","I purchased this camera to take on a vacation so we could record the trip as it went along. Camera and film worked as expeted and was such a big hit with the local Jamaican people that they were requesting that I take a photo of them to leave with them. I gave away almost as many photos as I brought back, but would not have had it any other way.","I love using this and all my friends and family love it as well. It adds a cute flair to my outfits as well, and you never know when you need to snap a picture.","Received the package yesterday, and tried it last night-- i still have to learn how to use all the settings, but so far i'm happy. It only came with batteries, but i can find something to use as a strap. I love the size of the photos, which is why i didn't go with a smaller version of the fujifilm cameras, they're larger than the other fujifilm photos.  Pictures look vintage, which i like, and its fun to use.  This is my first instant photo camera in life, and I'm excited to use it for my daugther's upcoming birthday, and just for whatever reason after that. lol. Thanks for the cameraaa!","I absolutely love this camera. I have gone through 20+ packs of film and absolutely ADORE using it. It's a great conversation starter too! I have 50+ pictures on my bedroom wall and I constantly get compliments on them!<br /><br />The only con I really have on this camera, and it isn't truly a con, is the size. Its a great camera, just not definitely the most travel friendly camera! If you use good batteries, you won't have to replace them for a long time. Overall, awesome camera!","I really like the camera and the photos that it takes. it just pretty heavy and bulky to carry around.","My dad loved it. Suited the whole family, made us remember the Polaroid days of old. The youngster loved it, seemed magical to him.","I have shot several pack of film with this camera.  Pictures always come out of camera well and developing of picture is fast.  (Wish the Impossible Project for Polaroid will use these same chemicals in their film for the 600 series.)  I love this camera!  The bad thing.... people get excited when they see the picture and then they want a picture of themselves.  I have no complaints about the camera.  It works great!  I feel like I have sold a few of these camera's for Fuji as people ask me, \"Where can I get one?\"  I wish Wal-mart or Target stocked the film for this camera but they only stock film for the Mini Series.  I would rather have the 210 than a mini camera.","This camera does amazing photos.  I bought it for a Valentine Party photo booth.  Though it is about $1.00 per photo, nothing can beat the joy the kids get from getting to take the picture home with them.  Fun camera for special use, like a birthday party, or last day of school.","I love this camera!  I loved my Polaroids but film is  now too expensive. This film is still excessively pricey at over a dollar a shot and the camera doesn't come with any.  The camera always has a flash which can be a bummer but the pictures always turn out great.  The camera is also really unattractive but I don't mind at all. I love that I finally have actual pictures again instead of a million digital unprinted ones.  My daughter likes putting them in her photo album.","Don't know if family member has used her Christmas gift she selected.  I assume she likes it. If see her will ask if she has used camera yet.","We take pictures of our young patients and put them o;n a bulletin board. The staff love seeing the instant gratification on the kids faces. Before they couldn't see it till the following appointment.","This was the\"big\" present for Christmas and it did not disappoint.  My daughter loved her gift! The price was good,  so Santa liked that,  and as always. . Santa delivered with great timing!","Started taking pictures like never before.. I bought this camera mainly to keep memories with me (and not digital memories), so this was perfect, works well, and yes a bit bulky but I was carrying it around everywhere I went.<br />I preferred this size over the mini ones, and I am glad I did, this is perfect! Won't comment much about the quality of the pictures, I guess its alright.","Bought it for my teenage sister and she brings it everywhere she goes. She loves it and her walls are filled with instant pictures.","This is my second one. Love the camera but quality is meh (expectable at that price). My first one just stoped working after a year. Buy the extended warranty.","I also have an instax 90 mini, and as it has become my favorite camera I decided to try this one out. I love it! It is very large, as I had read about on various blogs, but I LOVE the large wide format photo.","I really have nothing negative about this camera (well, except for the fact that the films are pricey). This thing is so much fun to take pictures with, and it's a huge hit every time I bring it to a party :)","I bought this as a gift for my roommate along with the film. I did some research into the different types of Polaroid cameras and after much consideration I decided to get this because of the bigger size of the film, excellent reviews and the fact that the film is still being made popularly. It came in the mail yesterday along with batteries. I expected it to be large because of the size of the film as well as the fact that it is a Polaroid camera. Although it's bulky, it is not very heavy at all.<br /><br />The camera comes with a strap and what I call a \"selfie mirror\" which is a little add on to the lens that allows the subject to see themselves. Loading the film was perhaps the easiest thing I've done with technology. It was so simple that I doubted it and looked up a video just to confirm that it was simply \"slide in\".<br /><br />The only thing to keep in mind is that the viewfinder is to one side of the camera and you need to adjust for it, in order to center the subject. The darken and lighten features are fairly useful too, although most photos look perfect with normal settings. The flash is automatic and I don't think it can be turned off. However you can work around it by using the darken and lighten settings.<br /><br />The quality of Image is EXCELLENT. The clarity is great and the photo is crisp. All the colors are vibrant and because of the wide size, you can actually see the photo well. It takes about 5 minutes for the film to develop completely. The photos have a nice retro-modern look.<br /><br />My roommate loves the gift and so do I. I might purchase one for myself too! Highly recommended.","This is a great camera for the price.  GET IT!  IT IS REALLY COOL TO HAVE!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS!","I just got back in to instant cameras and have been using polaroid 600 cameras using impossible project film but it is so expensive at about 28 dollars for a box of eight pictures and you don't no if they will turn out or not.i bought a polaroid SX 70 camera the elite of all polaroid cameras and took it to the camera shop to get film well turns out it was broke so I told him I will take 600 film he stops me and asked if I have tried the fuji 210 I said no.after talking to him and finding out the film is about 60 percent less and I get a new camera I decided to try it.this camera is amazing no waiting a half hour for the picture to turn out no shielding 100 percent better looking pictures.don't by old cameras and expensive film save money and by a new camera cheaper and better film and better quality pictures.","Everyone just loves the idea of polaroids because of the quality and type of pictures it produces. You cannot find a better price than this!!!","I love this camera. Like, really love it. I love the instant satisfaction and the overall appeal of this camera.<br /><br />Yes, the film can be considered \"pricey\" -- but this camera prints out a pictures instantly, so I think it is well worth the cost of film. Plus, the aesthetic is great for the vintage/old school look. The film has really great colors and it's a fun factor to never know what you're really going to get. I personally love the wide photos compared to the business card size photos of the mini.<br /><br />I have seen other reviews talking about how \"big\" this camera is, but again, IT PRINTS A PICTURE. Do you really expect it to be the size of a point and shoot that fits in a clutch? This camera isn't about convenience, it's about the aesthetic of the photos.<br /><br />As a professional photographer, I find it extremely important that photos get printed. With this camera, I can give my clients something on the spot. They love it! There is something so awesome about the fact that the photos taken with this camera are one in a million. Unlike DSLRs, where you can take multiple shots of one moment, the Instax captures ONE photo which cannot be duplicated - so to speak.<br /><br />I also love documenting my personal adventures with it. The photos make create for creating albums or wall art! All in all, this is a great camera!<br /><br />The only con I can think of is that the flash is sensitive. It will fire when light is available, which is outrageously annoying because it ruins the picture (in my opinion). The flash could be great for cool night photos, but it flattens and blows out the image otherwise. I have solved this issue (if you consider it to be one) by covering the flash with black electrical tape.","This camera is so much fun at parties. Especially with older people that don't know how to deal with digital cameras.","Purchased this for my sister as her Christmas present and it is a great camera. If you've never had a instant film camera before, this one is super user friendly. You might go through a roll of film initially just to get used to how it takes in light or how close/far you have to be to your subject (day or night). But it produces great snaps :) a definite must have!","Just buy it. Camera is freaking awesome! First camera I ever purchase. It's amazing. love it. The photos are great.","I bought this for my hubby's 30th and he was SO excited. He'd had a polaroid at one point but since they stopped makin' 'em he always missed that camera. So he loves this one, and we use it sparingly since the film's expensive, but it's so great when you go to hang out with pals--everyone has a souvenir by the end of the night.","Couldn't ask for a more fun retro type camera. The pictures can out just as they taken. It is a bit big, but so was the original Polaroid.","works well, bought it as a christmas present. cute and could take when she begins to travel. it is just what she wanted.","pics worked for what we wanted but the camera is huge!  film is very expensive.  i'm buying the smaller white version for my wedding.","I have always wanted a polaroid camera and this one is perfect. Make sure you read the instructions on how to adjust the camera to take photos in particular settings. And don't be afraid to not use flash especially when you are outside. Great buy. I am so happy.","I adore my camera, I have pictures hanging all over my room. Super easy instructions. Takes a little practice, a few mess ups at first but its worth it!","This Polaroid camera is unique as it is built to be modern and vintage.<br />It works just as it is intended, I am able to capture golden moments within seconds. It's in good quality, there is a flash button, and it shows how much film there is in the camera which can be very helpful at times.<br />It is a shame that the film for the camera is very expensive so I am not able to use my camera all the time, as I'd like to.<br />But it's still a beauty!","My daughter had been asking for a Polaroid, but due to the cost of film vs the size of the print, I knew there had to be a better option. This was definitely it! The pictures come out almost as big as the old instant cameras, but in a widescreen format. Do be aware that in order to house the film, this is much bigger than a modern digital camera, so  I recommend getting a case to keep it safe if you don't already have a bag to put it in.","We have not yet had the chance to play with all the settings but out of the box, film in and shoot..Nice Pics..Good for the Photo Album Archive. Hope to update after we check out the settings, looks like it can do much more..to be cont....","THOUGH IT IS BULKY AND HOPING THAT A NEWER VERSION WOULD BE PRODUCED WITH MORE SLEEK DESIGN, NONETHELESS IT IS STILL A GREAT CAMERA ADDED TO MY COLLECTIONS OF CLASSIC ITEMS. RECOMMENDED TO ALL INSTANT PHOTO ENTHUSIAST.","Ordered for a gift for a friend, they loved it! The camera is a little big but it's smaller than the old school polaroids.","This camera takes great wider polaroids compared to the other instant cameras.  But I didn't realize the camera itself would be HUGE!  It's like holding a box of girl scout cookies when taking a photo!  If only the camera were much smaller then I would give it a better rating.","The film is a little pricy, but the camera is very cool. It is bigger than I expected witch my daughter loves, kind of an attention getter.","This was a Christmas present for my father in law.  He is a keen photographer and this got him very excited.  It was easy to use and setup for first use.  We were all mildly surprised at how quickly the instax photos developed.  We are all looking forward to some great snaps over the next few months.","I bought this because I missed the Polaroids and I love this camera. It's a little bulky but to me that makes it fell sturdier. The quality and size of the photos is very good.","Since Polaroid practically went under, Fujifilm has recreated their filming flexibility in an interesting way.  The camera looks and feels like a cartoon version of a regular 35mm point and shoot but it delivers immediately developed pictures of good to better quality.  As an adjunct to my regular digital SLR and my smart phone camera, this is a novel way to capture the moment and immediately share the experience.  Shop around for the best price, Amazon delivered on this one.","since this item was a gift I have no idea of it's capabilities. Having to use a set number of words to describe a rating is not very applicable in this case","I purchased the Fijifilm Camera for my husband and he Loves it. It's even better than the instant camera from the 1980's. Bigger picture, better quality picture, easy to use, well made camera.","its so awesome sauce got it for a special friend for xmas he looooves it devolps in like 3 min super nice colors its got that look!<br />the only bummer is that it doesnt come with film so must order that one too or go to urban outfitters they have film.","The camera itself is huge!  I had no idea it would be so big, but it's pretty awesome and the recipient of it couldn't be more happy.  Takes great pics!","This camera takes wonderful photos. The film can be a little expensive but it is worth it. Photos are taken quickly and develop right in front of your eyes. There is space to write a caption below each photo, and the photos are great for displaying on cork boards, stuck on walls, on clotheslines, or in a photo album if you'd like to be a little more private. The photos come out wider and shorted than traditional polaroids, and are a bit more than twice the length of INSTAX mini photos.<br />Be warned, however, that the camera itself if quite large and clunky, and is made of fairly cheap plastic. In addition I've had the strap that comes with it come undone while using it a few times. That aside, I really appreciate this camera and my friends and I love taking photos with it.","easy to use camera and great adjustments! you can make it lighter or darker and it even comes with a selfie mirror to attach to the lens","Purchased camera for grandson before he went on vacation.  Pictures come out clear and sharp.  Time will tell if they fade like the old polaroid pictures did.  He loves it.","I haven't received my camera yet but I'm just wondering if it will come with a safety strap for around the neck. I sure hope so but otherwise I'm very excited !!","The camera itself is pretty huge, but I didn't want to spend $200 to get a compact instant camera. It's user friendly and the film is easy to load. I bought this as a gift for my 10-year-old nephew and he loves it. The film isn't too expensive if you watch for a good price. The pictures come out well and it's great for making some memories!","This is a very large camera - could not fit it in a pocket , you would definitely need to bring its own bag if you were to take it anywhere - very cool photos though - instantly retro","I have had my camera for a day.  I love this thing already.  I recommend reading the directions because you do have to press a button to switch between two focal distances.  The default is for three to ten feet shots.  As soon as my first picture printed out I remembered how great it was having instant film as a kid.  It also became my three year old daughters favorite camera immediately because she can watch the picture develop in front of her.  This is an experience that cannot be matched with digital pics.  I also feel that instant pics are valued more because it is not throw away like half the digital shots you take.<br /><br />The camera itself does what it says.  It is large but it is comfortable to hold and not too heavy.  I have not had any issues lining up shots even though the viewfinder is off centered.  I am glad I opted for the 210 instead of one of the mini cameras because the larger pictures are a perfect size for me.<br /><br />If I find anything negative I'll update the review but so far so good<br /><br />Update: I have found that the pictures typically show more on them than what appears in the view finder.  This isn't a big deal just need to be sure subjects fill most of the view finder and expect to get a little extra surroundings on the actual picture.  I like getting extra surroundings because it gives a good context to the time period the picure was taken when you look at them years later.<br /><br />Also I read a review that says the strap doesn't hold.  I can assure you that the strap works great if you follow the directions.  It attaches the same way as my lumix G5 does, so it is a proven design.<br /><br />Still loving the camera and so does everyone that is with me when I use it.  Pictures actually get looked at and passed around which never happens with digital pics.","Awesome product!! Got this because I had a son and wanted physical pictures of him for an album works great!","this was a gift for my daughter, great colorful pictures, kinda bulky for a camera today but it is so fun,","I gave it to my grandma and she has no problem using it. Very user friendly. It's a little big but works just like an old Polaroid","The camera worked for what I wanted it for to get pictures of kids for Christmas ornaments at a party. It worked for that, but also took a few tries to get the settings and distance right.I wouldn't say that you get high-quality images, but for something instant, it works well enough.","A couple things about the Instax 210:<br />The wide film is bigger and the colors are vibrant. However because the camera is instant, bigger film means a bigger camera. Yeah, it is quite bulky, but it is not very heavy. Cosmetic factors shouldn't really matter if the whole point of having an instant camera is the pictures- that is unless you need something something portable. For my needs, this camera gets the job done. The film loads easy and it's cheap too. Definitely fun to use, I love the whole process of using the side controls to cater to your picture (easy to use) and then finally pressing the button and watching the magic unfold. The viewfinder is not 100% accurate either. Still, this camera suits my needs because the slight inaccuracy doesn't bother me. Prior to buying this camera, my search was narrowed to the Instax Mini 8 and the Instax 210. In the end, the picture was really more important to me. I found the pastel colored baby cameras (Instax Mini 8) to be more of a novelty. What's the point in having a pretty camera if the pictures are so tiny? This was the deciding factor for me when buying the Instax 210. To date, I have not experienced any damage on the camera, however I handle it delicately & with care.<br />Bottom Line:  It's quite ugly and large, but produces beautiful & big pictures.","I would def recommend this product!! My 13 year old daughter loves it and always gets ooohhhh and aaahhhh wherever she goes. People always ask where I bought the camera and I do not hesitate to tell them!!! We really do love the bigger photos and it is just great!!!","Should come with better instructions (to tell not to let film overexpose, etc) but this product is generally pretty self explanatory, easy to use, and GREAT!","The camera is beautiful and I'm so happy I purchased it! I've been lusting after it for well over a year now and I finally made the decision purchase it. I couldn't be happier. The image quality is gorgeous. The only complaint I have is where the \"viewfinder\" is placed. As you can see in the picture, it's off to the upper left, so you have to frame your shots accordingly. In the manual, though, it gives you a little example of how to properly frame your images if you plan on using your viewfinder. It's very easy to get used to, though, so it's not a big deal.","This camera was a gift for my nine year old daughters birthday. She loved it and had so much fun tKing pics of all of her friends. The pics come out clear with a little bit of a vintage look, which I think us kind of cool. The film can get speedy, but the camera and memories are definitely worth it. Like others have said, the camera is quite large, but that's actually a good thing for a tween as it won't get lost easily.","Worked really well. But, just a word of caution...it is HUGE.<br /><br />I mean, I know, I read the description. I read the reviews. But when it arrived, and I took it out of the box, and my husband laughed. It is really big. Stubbornly, I slipped it into the matching carrying case that I had bought for it and lugged it around for the weekend. May be a good option if you plan on using it for a party and leaving it on the table all night. But, definitely not a great \"take it with you\" option.","Just Like Polaroid and the photos are a really good size.  Used this in an area where there was no power for long periods of time and this was perfect","This was a fun, novelty Christmas gift for my brother.  It takes nice pictures, and it's pretty satisfying to immediately have your prints in hand.  A tad bit pricy, but it's a niche item and expected.","We purchased this product for a model casting and had been wanting a product like this for a while. We are so glad we purchased this camera. Not only is it very convenient, since the photos are ready in seconds, but alsovery cool to have. Many of our clients love seeing the old style polaroids. It has a cool feel to it!<br />Great Camera :)","My daughter loves her new camera. It goes everywhere with her. she love that she has the picture in hand in minutes","It was a little bit bulky by once you get passed that it's a great camera. Price was great and quality of picture was very reasonable. Would highly recommend it.","Love the quality of the photos and the sharpness this camera produces.<br /><br />The flash always fires, but you can find an alternative to that fix which doesn't bother me much as i shoot outside mostly.<br /><br />I do however have a problem with the design; it creates a disproportionate view finder which can make or break your shots after they come out. It would make more sense to be in the center than off to the side.","Camera works better than my old Polaroid 600 camera did.  It has options for lightening or darkening up a shot, and there are options for taking pictures at different distances.  My only issue is that the flash never shuts off.  I got in trouble for taking a picture in a museum, thinking it was off.","My old Polaroid still works but film is hard to find and (even the new remade film) is super expensive.  This camera has the same hand-held instant gratification that Polaroids offered but the film is (relatively) more affordable.  My husband and I had a destination wedding and we wanted a photo booth but the location didn't have ample options like here in the US.  This was our substitute and we have a fun and personal guest album as a result.  We've since used it for other parties and it's always a hit.  It looks like a regular size camera in the picture but it's actually comically oversized (so that the film cartridges can fit).  It works well and we are really happy with it! Just hope they don't stop making the film and would be even better of the film prices went down :)","It has always been my dream to own an instant film camera.  This doesn't disappoint.  The camera is on the large side.  I do feel goofy taking it out sometimes, but that's only because it provides a decent side photo.  Plus once everyone sees a photo come out, they get all excited to see it develop and totally understand why I have it.  It takes 4 AA batteries.  I would recommend buying a case for it, especially one that is made for it.","My wife is very happy with this camera, and we got it much sooner than we thought we would. Thanks again!!!","I bought this after buying various Polaroid cameras and having no luck in finding reasonably-priced film (I'm looking at you, Impossible Project)<br /><br />The first time I used this I brought it to an outdoor music festival.  Let's just say, I had my luck in taking some incredible shots. That being said, this is an incredibly chunky camera. At first I was a little apprehensive about hauling this around, but now I wear it like a fashion statement and it certainly gets the conversation going.<br /><br />Now whenever I go to live music shows, I keep this baby in my car and bring it out after the show to meet with artists. Then I usually just have them sign the picture right there. Super convenient.<br /><br />I recommend this to all of my friends. Fujifilm should start paying me, because I've already swayed four of my friends into buying this camera.<br /><br />NOTE: Don't take pictures of indoor shows with this camera... I have plenty of pictures of the back of peoples' heads.","Excellent!  This is a fun camera.  It does not try to do what the digitals today can do.  It has a very unique way of taking pictures and is especially fun at gatherings where you can give out the photos immediately.  Seems like everyone likes them.  They are good for scenery but bear in mind you will not get the details that multi-megapixal shots can give but these are unique and capture good memories.  I actually got this one and I have also gotten a Fujifilm Mini which are fun too!","It takes a little practice to use this camera, but I love it. The photos are bigger than the other instax cameras. :)","The product was exactly as described, very affordable price. i had searched and this was the lowest price, recieved it on time. Great product, works awesome!","the camera is good if you're outside taking pictures or in a room with plenty of light.  if you're in a room where the light is low, people faces in the picture will come out dark.  you cannot see their faces. the images looks like dark shadows.  i was so disappointed.  at my alumni reunion, I had to stop using the instant camera and use the camera on my cell phone to take pictures.  i do not recommend any instant camera unless you plan to use it outside.","if you can suck up your pride (or just hide this thing in your camera bag) and carry this around with you, you're going to be rewarded with a lot of fun pictures. there's always going to be a certain charm about instant photography and this is a cheap way to play with it. load up a pack of film, and find 10 awesome things to take pictures of. let them develop, pass 'em around, laugh, enjoy, repeat.<br /><br />no, seriously... it's the ugliest electronic device currently on the market.. well, i think there's a Hello Kitty version that might be worse. but again, who cares, the instant pictures are awesome.","I really love this camera. Its so fun to use despite its bulky size but I guess thats not much of an option since it dispense film. It is very easy to handle. The photo quality is great. Definitely sharp clear images.<br /><br />So far I've no problem using the camera but one thing I was not satisfied enough is that the battery cover wont close properly after inserting the bateries. But it wasnt that bad anyway. Also, there is no option to disable the flash.. Overall the camera is great and I had so much fun with it.","Fast shipping. Good condition and packaging. A worthy purchase for those looking for this polaroid camera. A good deal at the price i bought it too.","I took a chance on ordering this camera and it is truly fantastic. Very user friendly and the photos look great.","i had a polaroid in the past<br /> but this one is much better , and cheaper my girl love using it.","What a blast!  We used this camera at our daughter's recent wedding reception as a \"photo guest book!\"  It was a huge success which means it was easy and fun to use, because we didn't supervise other than printing out summarized instructions.  One minor incident of inserting the film pack backward (user error), but that was easy enough to correct.<br />There is something so fun about having a photo in one's hand immediately.  Yes, you need this!","The picture quality is great, very easy to take pictures. Very well and my kids love this.  Features are easy to use and very happy with this purchase.","I had been wanting a Polaroid for a while and the actual Polaroid brand was too expensive to keep buying film for. This camera works great. Of course you might find a few pictures that don't come out the way you want because of the sun or because you are learning how to work it. Overall its a great camera and any picture you take with a Polaroid is awesome.","This camera is a mush-have for those who enjoy instant photo.<br />I wish it was a little smaller but since it takes large photos, I can't complain!<br />The strap that comes with the camera is annoying because it won't stay secured...so i bought one of my own.<br /><br />battery-life on instax 210 is great. it's just like the mini where you dont walk around with your camera on, it's a use-as-needed thing.<br /><br />i own the mini 8 and the instax 210 and i must say, these cameras are great.","it works perfect, i am very happy the pictures come out great but for sure get a case because the camera seems like it can be damages easy if i tgets dropped","This camera is always the hit of the party. Even people that don't really like to take photos will be more inclined with this camera. Once you figure out the easy to learn settings on this camera, it's easy to get cool looking photos. I wish the film was a bit less expensive, but since it is what it is, I usually only use this for occasions/parties.","Ok, yes, it's a rather large and in charge camera. I still can't get enough!! Oh how I've missed thee film photography, we have been separated for far too long!! FUJI has done it, they've brought back the art of capturing a moment. Pull this baby out of your bag and watch the jaws drop, minds will explode! Seriously, they had me sold at FUJIFILM, FUJI is known for the quality, the colors are beautiful. If you do journaling this a great buy for you. If you are a hairstylist(like MEE) this is great for before and after photos, your clients will love it and it makes it easier to build your portfolio... Nothing better than being able to get a great print at a push of a button. Also, if you are a PARTY-ANIMAL, you'll love being the life of the party with your own personal photo booth! Effing buy this camera, because it WILL make you that much cooler! Ooooooh let us not forget, HIPSTERS will LOVE this camera.. If you have a hipster in your life, this is the perfect gift, it's the best way to keep them busy. I hope this review helped(screw you, if you find my grammar to be unbearable) LOL<br />THE END!","Its all I thought it would be. A plastic polaroid camera. It works great, the photos are fun. Dont expect it to shoot like a Leica but its a great camera and the instant film is a blast to use. The most tech isnt always the best and these photos are fun to have around. Helps make photo fun again from time to time. I am still keeping the Leica too of course.","I LOVE my instax 210. It is a great camera! Pictures print instantly and develop in just a few minutes. Features are easy to use. Well worth the price! Very happy with this purchase.","I love this camera!!!! It takes gorgeous pictures that are full of color and clarity!!! I Will definitely take this camera on roadtrips. The camera is big and cool to carry around . I also got the case as a gift which makes it easier to carry around. The pictures come out great and very colorful.","This is the most fun camera, its perfect for kids and the picstures turn out great. So glad I bought this. And highlly reccomend it.","The pictures this camera produces are beautiful. The film is dependable, unlike other Polaroid films (which I is why I upgraded & switched to Fujifilm). The only problems I have with this camera is that one, it's huge. But I guess this is easily resolved with the camera strap so you don't have to hold it in your hands all the time. My biggest concern is that I already returned this camera once because of the battery compartment cover-it's extremely lose & falls off all the time. It also looks really cheap & flimsy. Otherwise, what really matters in the end are the pictures that come out of it.","I gave this as a gift and she absolutely loved it!It works amazingly!We ended up using all the film I bought that night!Thinking about getting it for myself!","great camera nostalgia at its finest.<br />pro  instant pics. just like the old days.<br />con. its a big camera compared to everything today and film is kinda pricey considering printing digital pictures nowadays but still worth it","Fun camera!  Provides instant entertainment but too expensive to buy film continuously!!I<br />Its BIGGER than what we wanted and expected","I love this camera! I shoot with impossible project film and I found this!  A lot cheaper and easier to use! Pictures come out nice and wide, and camera seems pretty good quality wise.","The pictures are better quality than the Polaroids. I love the look of the camera and how the picture pops up from the top. Only drawback is the weight of the camera and the position of the button when taking the picture. I can see how it could be easy to accidentally push the button while holding it.","Used on a trip to Hawaii. Although it was a bit bulky for travel, the joy of instant photos is immeasurable. I was able to share right away. Others were jealous.","This camera was even better than I expected! To anyone who wants instant photos with great clarity and nice size, you must have this! I had an old original Polorioid but it was so often breaking and needed fixing and it's film was so expensive. Save your money and get this-cheeper film, better (by actually 1000%) photos, easy to use. At first I was a little turned off by the size of it, but I soon grew to love it.","I LOVE this camera. I had wanted it for about a year before I finally bought it..and I am so glad that I decided to buy. The camera is fairly reasonably priced (not so much is said for the film). The pictures turn out wonderful if taken outside. Inside photos are okay, but can occasionally make faces look sheet white if using the flash and/or \"lighten\" setting. The size is very large  but this has been no problem for me. Word of advice, be careful taking pictures where the subject is under a cover, tent, umbrella, or shade source. In my case the subjects were to dark to see. I have no regrets buying this, I am addicted!","This is a great product. I love purchasing through Amazon. The prices are fair and right on target.. You should really order this product for it really works..","I bought this camera to snap pics of wedding guests as they entered the door.  Then, the pics were placed in a photo guest book for everyone to sign.  The end result was a fabulous memorable photo guestbook.  The camera itself is much larger than anticipated which added to everyone's amusement.  When the camera was pointing at the guest, all the guest could do was smile.  It is definitely not your small sleek smartphone.  The camera itself was a focal point and many guests left wanting one.  The quality of the picture was better than I anticipated.  This is a fun, instant camera.  If you are looking for digital quality, this is not the camera for you.","I bought this as a wedding gift and I brought it to the wedding and took lots of pictures.  A lot of people liked it, but you will get made fun of for the size of it.  This thing is huge.  Also, if you hand someone a photo, they will instinctively shake it even if they've never held one before, it's weird.  I found I had to aim lower than the view finder showed to get the picture.","I was really excited to get this camera to make smaller scrapbooks. I thought taking instant pictures of only the \"best things\" would be a fun idea, plus its a little wacky! The camera is BIG, bigger than my Nikon DSLR. But its very lightweight. I was able to fit the Instax, the DSLR and an extra lens in my camera bag. Plus the outer pockets we the perfect size for extra film and the developed photos.<br /><br />The quality is much better in natural light than with a flash, and it takes some getting used to. Give the camera time to focus in too, if you snap quickly you will end up with blur. I used this for the first time in New Orleans and I got lots of \"OH WOW--thats cool!\" Plus its easy for someone else to use to take pictures for you (of you).<br /><br />Overall, it was a fun purchase. I think I will get the mini as well for the portability.","Fun for friends and family.  Brings back old times when a polaroid!  The wide photo can fit a few people in it easily.","This camera is exactly what I expected. For the price, you can't beat it. Polaroid cameras are so fun. I can't imagine not having one.","i bought this and i was so nervous it wouldnt be what i expected. And it wasn't, IT WAS BETTER! the photo comes out so clear and colorful! and the film does not wear off easily like other polaroid films.<br />the only con about this product is the size, BUT it is to hold the wide film. If you want it to be a smaller camera, get the one that holds the mini films","Very cool, retro instant camera. In the days when Polaroid no long manufactures instant film, I turned to Fujifilm to get the job done. I needed it as a prop in a video, and it served well. Now, apparently, Fuji has discontinued all film as well. Disappointment.","I like Doris Day as much as much as the next person I suppose, but I'm not going to a Doris Day film festival.  C'mon.","I have used this camera now on and off for a few years by borrowing from friends. Finally decided I had to have one of my own.<br /><br />The extra features, although not much, do actually help. Only downside is it looks as though sometimes the flash does go off even when you ask it not to.<br /><br />Certainly takes the highest quality instant photos around. Film is around $1 per picture, which isn't that bad and it is easy to find even in town.","I really enjoy the instax 210. It's films have a nice dimension and it's nice a big for you to hold.<br /><br />It has it's cons though. The camera works best at a certain time of the day (when there is daylight). You can still use them at night and such, but it's not the best polaroid quality you'll find. The camera has a pretty light built (compared to cameras today) so you will have to be very careful with them. I've already broken one of these camera before.<br /><br />But with that being said, I always come back to this camera because it's the best/most affordable one out currently. I'll probably buy one again if my current one breaks. But as soon as a better camera comes out, I'll probably move over to the new one.","When Polaroid is cutting down their products, this Fujifilm INSTAX camera becomes popular in our market. I try this one to replace my old Polaroid, it comes out very good.","I really love this camera. I am the kind who never has the time to get my prints at the local store so I looked at many instant cameras. I am glad I choose this one. I recommend everyone should get one. Plus it is easy to get school projects done fast!","The camera works awesome, has everything in the packaging, the cheapest I could find the film was about 80 cents per print.","HAD CAMERA AROUND A MONTH. BOUGHT PACKAGE DEAL OF CAMERA FILM AND CASE ON AMAZON.VERY GOOD DEAL.I WOULD OF LIKED PICTURES A LITTLE BIT BIGGER ,BUT GOOD REPLACEMENT FOR MY OLD SPECTRA. SLIGHT LEARNING CURVE REQUIRED FOR BUTTONS ON CAMERA. ONLY KID ON THE BLOCK WITH ONE. JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS.","Let the guests pass it around, and we had polaroid photos all over that night.  It was great.  Easy enough to use for someone to pick up and shoot, and pass it around.  Battery lasted all night, went through 6-8 cartridges of film.","Product was as described.  It was for my daughter and the camera is pretty big but it is what is out there.  My daughter and her friends have a lot of fun taking random shots.  Good use in day and night.","I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 18 year old. She LOVES it. To my knowledge it works like the old polaroid cameras I grew up around. She says she would buy it again. The film, though, is expensive....","I have always loved physically holding my pictures because browsing through them on a computer is just not the same. This is an excellent product, it will not dissapoint.","The new camera is big and slightly heavy when loaded with film.  But it has a nice side grip, and unlike in the past, now you can set it for close-ups or far away, as well as lighter or darker than a normal exposure.  It's not a lot more range, but it's nice.  I love this camera.  I highly recommend it.","Says everything it does on the box, takes great Polaroid type photos, the instax wide film is much more difficult to get hold of however, in Australia anyway","I actually like taking pictures on this camera. Good quality pictures for this type of camera. But one thing is this camera is pretty big which is a downfall..","This camera works great! I've had it for over 2 years and its still awesome! It also has a flash so it works god at night too! It is a camera i'd definitely recommend. I prefer this one over the smaller version","I bought the Instax 210, along with a case and film about 3 weeks ago and it said on my receipt that the order would arrive march 13 2013; however it got to me earlier! Apparently it came in the 11th of march, so it had been sitting in the box office waiting for me.<br />The camera was in good shape, I had no difficulties putting in the film or taking pictures and it's very easy to figure out how to use! I definitely recommend that you by a case so that your camera won't scratch or brake etc. I should also point out that the camera is big, but if you're not bothered you'll love it anyways!<br />BUY IT, hopefully you won't regret it! I most certainly don't!","Had this for about 2 years now and I love it. It takes cool pictures, fun pictures plus walking around with it makes people stare a lot because it's a rare thing in a sense. Everyone uses their iPhones or digital cameras and you're here using an instant camera which is pretty cool in my opinion. Everyone who loves taking pictures should own one. It has it's own \"magic\" you can say..","I love this camera. I use it everywhere I go, the only downside is that the film can get expensive but in my opinion it is worth it.","This camera yes unmistakely large (the reviews weren't joking), at some points my husband had to hold the camera since my hands were too small to hold the body in one hand AND press the shutter button.<br /><br />But I cant be choosy, I love documenting life in a scrapbook, whether it was of myself, my family, my wedding, my engagement, etc.....I wish I had this camera to document some moments to get the pictures immediately.<br /><br />The film are a little pricey yes , so don't be wasteful, unless of course you can afford it.<br /><br />Excellent buy will definetly recommend.","Great camera, my daughter loves it. It has lots of features and it comes with lens kit. My only issue with it is that it seems like its made of cheap plastic and fragile. The first one we received was non functioning and we got a replacement within a few days thanks for Amazon's wonderful policy.","This enormous instant camera will definitely turn some heads! Easy to use even for someone used to digital cameras. Has a few useful settings that enable you to lighten/darken the picture as well as change the focus distance. Try yaping some coloured gels to the flash to get a splash of colour in your shots!","So even though the camera itself is HUGE, bulky and hideous, the actual pictures came out really clear and it was fun to watch them develop right before my eyes! The colors are surprisingly vibrant, and the picture quality is high. I love it and it's a great addition to any camera collection, and the film is relatively affordable.","This is my new \"Thing\" to do. I love taking pictures with this camera cause it makes for great times:) I should Warn you; film can be a bit pricey. Remember though, you can't put a price on memories:)","The photos are really small and they are WAY too expensive. I used it for my business and everyone loved the pics tho.","BUY THIS!!!<br /><br />I'M NOT KIDDING BUY THIS WITH ALOT OF FILM!<br />I HAVEN'T STOPED USING THIS & I BOUGHT IT ALMOST 2 YEARS AGO!","Purchased this camera in December, never took it out of the box. In early January I had a death in the family. When I took it out of the box to use it at the funeral, the batteries were dead. It was bad time to find that out.Fujifilm INSTAX 210 Instant Photo Camera","Brings back wonderful memories of my childhood. Absolutely will recommend this to anyone looking<br />for an instant camera. This has be ome obsolete. My grand children abolutely loved this camera.","I have a Fujifilm Instax Mini, but the pictures were just too small for me and they were always a little blurry or out of focus.<br />I LOVE the Instax Wide! If you are choosing between the two, I highly recommend the Instax Wide.<br />The only thing is that when you look through the viewfinder, you aren't looking through the lens (like most professional cameras) so your pictures will be a little off if you judge based solely on the viewfinder.<br /><br />Still worth it.<br />Super fun to bring along and take pictures with my boyfriend!","The camera is bulky, but I guess it has to be in order to print wide size pictures. It is lightweight, almost to the point where I thought it wasn't going to work. I wish it made a sound when I changed settings, but, it works like a charm, I love it.","My son is into photography and this is a great choice instead of trying to find a vintage polaroid and the film.  The Fuji film is great.  Your pictures have a retro feel to them and the price is right!","This camera is great for the fun factor, never for the quality of the pictures or ease to make good shots.<br />If you are looking for a professional camera to make the greatest shots, look elsewhere. This camera is intended for fun, vacation, making souvenirs, fooling around with family and friends, etc.<br />I can tell you I am impressed with the quality of the pictures, since I was expecting more washed out colours and blurryness. I was surprised how well the pictures come out.<br />One downside is, when taking close up pictures (about 3 or 4 feet away) you may get an off center picture, and you may have to learn to adjust manually for this. Only practice will help. This is due to the viewfinder being in the side (upper left) corner of the camera. This is a known issue with any instant camera and you can't avoid it, so I guess it's part of the glamour of an instant shot to be out of center, giving it a little more of fun factor.<br />The camera is made mostly of plastic, but it feels well built, and so far it survived a big vacation and a long road trip. No flaws so far.<br />It has few settings to adjust, making it easy to use for the average entry level photographer.<br />The camera is definitely bigger than it looks in the picture, so be aware of this, but it is also part of the fun factor / toy-look of the camera.<br />Hope this review helps give you a better insight of the camera. Happy instant shooting!","I thought this would be a fun camera to take to gatherings to share, however it is so large I really can't see me hauling it around. I will be returning it to Amazon.","Just like an old Polaroid, this camera fills the void. Same film type we all remember. Kids think it's magic.<br /><br />Really Easy to use<br />Huge size so make it fun<br />You'll be the Old school hero!","My mom has dementia. She was obsessed with wanting a camera to take pictures, but digital is useless for her as by the time it is printed she has forgotten all about it. In spite of her limitations, she figured out how to use this pretty quickly- it is very much like ones her dad use to have \"back in the day\". It is big by today's standards, but that is actually helpful for arthritic hands. The power button is red, good for her fading vision. The button to take the photo is a good size and logically placed, but I wish it were textured or stuck up a bit so she could feel it more easily. the countdown of how many photos are left is smaller than I would like, but in reality she will just take pictures till it won't work any more and come to me anyway... all in all, I can see this as a great option for anyone who is physically, mentally or technologically challenged, but still wants to take pictures. Thank you, Fuji!!!","i bought this for my daughter, she seen it on another site and it was 20$ more..overall great product, film was bought too","Pros<br />Everyone thinks you're awesome<br />A new way of taking photos<br />Cool mementos<br />Looks pretty cool in its own way<br />Easy to use<br />High quality photos<br />Works as it is supposed to<br /><br />Cons<br />Expensive film<br />Fairly fragile<br />Bulky<br />Somewhat difficult to take photos from correct distance","I really like Fujifilm INSTAX, and this is my second one.<br />Very happy for my purchase.<br />A \"must-take\" for going on vacation.","Great product does exactly what it is supposed to do! I have no complaints, pictures are great, and its something fun for you and a friend or boyfriend to play with!","This camera is really fun.  It would be nice if it had a timer on it but my biggest complaint is the positioning of the viewfinder.  It's so far off to the side that if you use it to line up your shots they will be well off.  Big hit at parties though both because of the instant prints and the comically huge size of the camera!","Although this is a fairly big camera, it is very easy to use and the instant gratification of a printed picture is priceless, especially for my six year old! The only aspect that I am not crazy about is that the flash is always on, so the pictures come out better when the environment is a little dark. You can change the settings from lighter-normal-darker and sometimes that can be a bit of a guessing game, but overall this camera is so much fun. I use it for my son's SMASH book (scrap-booking). The picture size is also a bonus compared to other instant cameras. The 'wide' film is worth the price. And the price of this camera was phenomenal! The nostalgic factor can't be beat - I love it!","I love this camera so much. it's really a lot of fun. the images it takes are great. film is reasonably priced. it rules. seller was rad too. best price, fast shipment and everything arrived as described.","I got this as a baby shower gift and the new parents are stoked! I liked this model better because the polaroid's are closer to the original size. Love it!","I bought this camera for a DIY photo booth/ guest book at my wedding and it was one of the best investments I made. The camera is HUGE, but not heavy. I had someone take pictures of guests and then put them in our guest book. Later, we brought out props and everyone had a blast posing. They were also able to take a photo home and loved that. I think the size of the camera and the fact that it is an instant camera makes people smile/laugh more than they do in digital camera/phone pictures. The price of the camera is cheap and you can get some great film deals on amazon. Will be using it for the holidays for sure. Go for it.","Recently I went to a concert and took this camera with me.  Everybody at the concert kept on asking me about the camera and marveling that \"they still make these\".  It was really fun taking pics and getting instant gratification with an instant print.  The camera takes surprisingly good pictures!<br /><br />While it is bulky to carry around, when you compare to the old polaroid cameras this is compact!","Yes, it's plastic, but the pictures are good! The film price compares Very Favorably with the old prices I paid for years for instant film for those other cameras.<br />You must, though, respect the limitations of the system. The exposure latitude of the film (the film's ability to create usable images over a broad range of light levels) is limited. This has always been true of Instant films. The flash will over-illuminate objects in the foreground, and objects in the background will be dim. The way to correct this is to take flash pictures where all the objects are approximately equal distance from the camera. But wait! If you line up a group of people behind a table, you will be beyond the usable range of the flash and everyone will appear equally dim (not a comment on you subjects' personalities).<br />But, overall, I like it.<br />The form factor is fun.<br />I wish I could buy the film locally, although the Internet deals are quite good, often with free shipping.","I absolutely LOVE this camera!! It's so much fun to use and see your picture develop right there, and I love the vintagey feel you get with it. Definitely an awesome buy!","I do agree that the plastic feels cheap so be careful when handling it. This is very simple to use and its quite fun to take instant photos. I havent been able to properly test the close up lens. Also the flash is very bright and most indoors pictures you have to use it. I find that I have to switch the setting onto \"lighten\" fairly often but that isn't a problem for me.","This is the first instant camera I've bought. I gave it to my girlfriend for Christmas, and she loved it. Pictures come out great, and they have that vintage look that everybody seems to love nowadays. The flash is nothing fancy or sophisticated, but does the job. Finally, it includes a strap, self portrait accessory, and the digital screen tells you how many shots you have left.<br /><br />Despite all this, the camera feels cheap. It's made of plastic, but not the sturdiest one. When we traveled for Christmas, the camera didn't work after taking it out of the bag. I had to shake it a bit and replace the batteries for it to come back again. Furthermore,  the camera is *really* big. I was expecting it to be that way because of the specified measurements, but it's definitively a factor to consider when buying it.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would recommend this camera to anybody looking to play with instantaneous photography and get a feeling of vintage photography. There are some other options out there, including a digital Polaroid with a ton of extra features, but they're either the same thing or much more expensive. Overall, this camera does the job. Just don't expect it to be top notch.","if you are a photographer and you want the nostalgic sized Polaroids, this is the one but you`ll have to suffer the chunkiness of the camera. It takes a little time to understand its features but a good buy.","I love this camera. It is magical for adults and children to play with film again and watch it develop before their eyes. I love having tangible photos around and knowing that each is an original with no touch ups.","I got this camera for my best friend's bridal shower.  We took pictures of the guests and used the photos to make a scrapbook page. Everybody loved the idea and had fun writing their wishes for the bride-to-be.  It is an easy and fun camera to use. Everybody had fun taking turns taking the photos. The pictures came out great. This camera even has a built in flash. Great for taking pictures indoors.","This camera arrived very fast, it was surprisingly very big.  I love the size, I will be using it for my wedding photo booth.  It may be a little too big for someone else using it for another purpose. Keep this in mind.","I really wanted to do something special at my wedding, so I decided to have an area where guests could take pictures with a polaroid type camera. Since Polaroid are no longer made and extremeley difficult and expensive to find, when I came across this camera I was skeptical. I had an area at the wedding (nautical themed) with a big fish net covered with shells, starfish, etc. I had a bunch of clothespins put up so when people took their picture with a prop (sailor hat, captains hat, paddles, etc) they could clip the picture to the fish net and wait for it to develop. By the end of the night I had an awesome collage of instant photos clipped to fishnet and I could not of been happier. In the end this camera more that surpassed my expectations. If you are looking for an instant camera, look no further!","I am a preschool director and sometimes need quick pictures and this helped me out!  Reminds me of my teen years and the kids just have a great time watching their pictures appear.  Neat!@","Love this camera! Kinda big, but oh well. Pictures come out a good size. I love the nostalgia of film photographs. I highly recommend this for the price of the camera, and also for the price of the film!","Pros: Beautiful colors, crisp resolution, wide-angle format<br />Cons: FRAGILE, viewfinder is to the left<br /><br />I bought this camera to replace my Polaroid. I was discouraged at first because of the size - it's a BRICK. But the fact that the images are wide-angle makes it totally worth it. Eventually you get used to the size. The neck strap on this camera is awful, it slips out of my camera constantly. I'd recommend getting a new neck strap, or at least securing this one - if the camera drops, it will break. Loading the film wrong once caused it to stop working, and I had to replace it.<br />Despite it's finickiness, this is a really great camera. The colors are BEAUTIFUL. I've found that my images come out best in natural light/outside. They're most crisp when standing further away from your subject - photos taken up close tend to be a little blurry in the foreground. Be careful when composing your image - the viewfinder is positioned to the left, so you need to compensate for that. I usually just look directly over the lens.<br /><br />Overall great camera, just treat it carefully and you will reap the benefits.","This camera is a blast of retro fun.  It does exactly what you think it would and the huge size is almost comical.","I've been shooting Impossible film on some older Polaroid cameras for quite some time. They yield excellent results, but they're insanely expensive.<br />I had been looking for a more affordable way to shoot family pictures - I'm a wedding photographer and really don't like to deal with post-processing and storing family snap-shots. The Instax 210 is EXACTLY what I had been looking for. The pictures are great, the handling is great. The image quality is really good - I don't know how Fujifilm managed to come up with instant film that produces pictures like that. Even when Polaroid still made film, the image quality was never that good. I also use a Polaroid 340z, which produces the same quality on Zink paper that the Polaroid film used to (which is very nice in its own way, no doubt about it). The Instax 210 produces more modern-looking pictures (of course, the form factor of the pictures will still appeal to those looking for a nostalgic experience).<br /><br />Yes, the camera is bulky - but who cares. I even started using it for my wedding business and the clients absolutely love getting some pictures without having to wait for post-processing. I even have clients who specifically ask for the camera (I'm not kidding). They saw me use it during one of my assignments.<br /><br />I hope Fujifilm will continue to make the camera and the film - now would be a very bad time to stop producing it. Instant film is making a huge comeback (and rightfully so).","i love this camera, pictures come out great and properly exposed for the most part. i love the look it creates and also that fun effect of not knowing right away how your pictures will come out.<br /><br />i simply give it a 4 because i found that it was pointless to put a lighter and darker setting when the camera works great with just normal function. also, even though you compromise with the size of the camera body due to the film size, i wished that the form factor of the camera could be a little bit smaller or foldable like the older polaroid cameras.<br /><br />overall this camera is amazing, and im glad i got this over the instax mini 25","My daughter received this camera as a gift and she thinks it is wonderful.  The quality of the pictures is great.  The camera is very easy to use.","My wife has always been a big fan of the old Polaroid film cameras but since the film costs an arm and a leg these days she has gone without for many, many years. I came across this camera while researching instant cameras to see if anyone has produced something comparable to the old Polaroid. The reviews for this camera were overwhelmingly positive and for 60 dollars I thought the price was fantastic so I decided to give it a try. I gave the camera to my wife this Christmas and she LOVES IT!<br /><br />The camera is VERY large. It looks like a big toy camera but the build quality is actually quite good. I did expect it to be big as all the processing is done in the camera but I was still surprised at just how big it was. This is not a camera that you can easily slip into your purse or pocket so keep that in mind when making your purchase.<br /><br />The film prices are quite reasonable and it comes out to be about 70 cents per picture. You only get 10 pics per cartridge of film so you want to make each pic count. This has actually made us take better pictures as we are consciously thinking about each pic instead of just clicking away with a digital camera.<br /><br />The quality of the pictures is actually quite good. I wasn't expecting too much to be honest but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. The camera has 3 picture modes which are lighten, normal and darken. It also has flash control but I am not quite sure what that does because whether you turn it on or off the flash ALWAYS goes off. Many people have stated the same thing so it looks like this is how it is supposed to be but always having a flash on can make indoor pictures look a little washed out. I found that for us the best setting for indoor pictures with normal room lighting is to set the picture to darken and turn on the flash. This seems to give is the best results and the pictures don't look washed out at all. In fact the color saturation and detail is quite amazing.<br /><br />We are very satisfied with the camera and recommend it to anyone looking for an instant film camera.","I bought this to replace my Polaroid Spectra and 600 cameras and it did just that!  The camera body is bigger than the 600 and about the size of the Spectra.  It appears to be made of plastic that will crack when dropped like some have written in their reviews.  It is simple to use as long as you remember this...push the button to take it out of macro mode or else your pictures will be off center.  It always defaults to macro when you turn it off and then back on.  It does take four AA batteries unlike the Polaroid which had the battery built into the film.  You can usually get a two pack of 10 exposure film for less than $18 shipped via Amazon.com Prime.  The wide Instax film is wider than the Spectra film and a about 3/16\" shorter in height.  If you miss your Polaroid instant pictures than get this as a perfect replacement!","I can't wait to give this to my girlfriend for Christmas.  I haven't tested it yet, but it's an instant camera. Haven't used these in years!","The photo taken with this instant camera gives sort of a lo-fied feel which I initially was not used to. But now, I am starting to appreciate that uniqueness of the photo this camera produces. Overall, I am loving this product.","Pull this thing out at a party and you'll have new friends in no time. Be sure to pay attention to the light/focus settings, and it will crank out pretty good pictures.","I must admit I miss the old polaroid cameras, or at least the old polaroid film ! ( I still have all the cameras.)  This camera with the wide film works<br />just as good and the pictures are suprisingly clear and sharp. It's kinda of a funny looking camera and people will stare at you, but once you get past that it's<br />a lot of fun and the grandkids love it ! Great fun camera.","I purchased this camera to replace my Instax 200 - which I foolishly didn't supervise my toddler with. This camera is identical to the 200 model, other than the color change and the closeup attachment.<br /><br />For anyone who loves instant film, this camera is a no-brainer. Yes, it is large - especially in comparison to the Instax Mini (which I also own) - but the resulting image is worth the size. The addition of the closeup lens narrows the gap of inconvenience between the two sized models even more.<br /><br />The only downside to this camera (and the Instax Mini) is the inability to turn off the flash. Sure, you can change the brightness (it has a lighter, normal and dark setting) but I find very little change between the images when using this setting. I do however always notice the washout.<br /><br />If you're even slightly considering buying this camera - just do it. Great party favorite. Great one-of-a-kind memory printer. Great companion.","Fun camera takes some getting used to getting things in focus the film cost a bunch but worth it it uses 4 aa","I love this camera and it came quickly and without a scratch! I defianatlt would recpmend it to anyone that likes the \"old school\" polaroid cameras!","I purchased this camera for a photo guestbook at my wedding and I can't tell you what a huge hit it was!!!  The wide film was perfect for closeups!  The camera is big and almost looks fake but does the job with ease! Easy to operate and loading the film was pretty self explainatory. The only reason I don't give it a five star rating is the bulk of the camera but understand that it needs to be that large to produce the wide photo.  Affordable, great for scrapbooking or if you just like the old school feel of polaroids!!","I have had very limited use of the camera but it performed very well. Easy to operate including loading the film.","I was surprised at the quality of these pictures! the colors are gorgeous, and it actually captures motion quite well. BUT, i was really disappointed with the macro lens! I followed all of the instructions in the manual.. but it still didnt focus at all! it was a waste of my film, which is frustrating considering how expensive the film is. Also, there is a really annoying autoflash. I find this really weird, because the camera actually has an on/off switch for the flash. Why make a switch, if the camera doesnt even follow it! Even when you set the camera to 'darken' mode, it continues to fire!<br /><br />It may seem like I am more displeased with the camera than pleased, but that isnt true. Over all it is a great instant film camera- and extremly cheap! I am happy with it despite its minor annoyances.","The camera is rather large and weird looking. It's unique appearance is definitely a conversation starter. I have yet to purchase film for the camera but I still like to carry it around because I think it makes for a whacky accessory.","I'm a part time Photojournalist and also do photography part time, I use this camera as part of my business, where it really pays off for me indirectly is when I talk to clients or vendors I wish to work with is taking a photo of them and then write the event,date and my phone number and email on the photo and give it to them, good for repeat business.<br /><br />As for the product itself, it works, the flash sometimes washes out the shot but this is a simple to use point and shoot device. I don't expect it to perform at the level of my Nikon DSLRs.<br /><br />The controls, film loading is all very easy, the instructions are simple and easy, I did watch a video on youtube by the Fuji guys and it covers everything you need to know about the camera [...]<br /><br />I find it easy to use and carry around, but then I'm used to wearing a backpack of photo gear and carrying two camera bodies on me, yes it is big but it is not heavy.<br /><br />I do get a few questions about it and people are amazed they make a instant camera like this.<br />I do laugh when older people wave the print around while it is developing(not necessary) and young people who missed out on the fun of Polaroids think it is \"cool\" when I brought it to a kids party once and they took home a nice mommento.<br /><br />I find the close up lens- self portrait mirror device more of gimmick, it sits in my bag and the mirror fell out, but it just snaps back into place.<br /><br />In these days when every has a camera and video recorder in their pocket or purse people are used to instant photos and videos it is nice to see that there is still a place for hands on photographs.","This is great a camera....rather bulky, but not heavy. Those who weren't familiar with \"instant photo\" got a chance and enjoyed seeing the instant developement of the pictures and thought they came out prety good and vintage like. Have not have a chance to fool around with the settings, but the picture turned out great [considereing not digital] and the colors were vibrant as well.","I love this camera.  Other reviews warned that this camera is big; I agree, you definately can`t be nonchalant when holding this camera. It feels huge.  But I love the size of the pictures and how they are wide.  Can`t wait to use it for my wedding. I bought the corresponding photo guest book to insert pictures directly into the guest book. I'm so excited.","I just got my package an hour ago and I couldn't wait to open it. I was pretty worried about there was no close up lens (The 1 star review). But it does have a close up lens and the string together! I follow the instruction and took a shot. When I saw the picture I was like what happened?? how come that it totally white??? And I took it again it happened the same. (haha=,= if you are the person like me never use it before and i just wanna remind you the picture will show it later... I was a little bit stupid that time.)<br />Any way, I love it so much! It is the coolest camera ever! (the camera is much bigger than I thought before)<br /><br />I think I will need to find a camera bag for it and keep it nicely :D<br /><br />Good Luck everyone!","In a day and age where all our pictures are digital, it's nice to use a camera that gives you something tangible, instantly!  It's not something to use for all the pictures you take, but to have a few keepsakes to add to photo albums of memories to last a lifetime!","Amazon not only gave such a good price for the camera, but they also gave free shipping! My package shipped out on Thursday, and arrived the next day! I got exactly what i wanted.<br />The camera is really nice, just what i wanted. I must say it's really bulky/big, though. But I already knew that before I bought it. It's worth it. It reminds me so much of the Polaroid cameras except wider images!<br />great product.","This camera is amazing.  We have the Fujifilm Instax Mini which has been a lot of fun and takes great instant photos, but this thing?  The photos are awesome!  The films are a wide format giving you a wider span to capture the entire scene.  It also comes with an adapter which allows you to take macro shots from like a foot away and the photos come out sharp. But don't let the stock picture fool you this is not point and shoot camera that fits in your pocket. However, it is about as sleek as you can get for an instant film camera. Polaroid has shot themselves in the foot by discontinuing and then refusing to rerelease their instant film line.  Fujifilm is doing it and doing it better.  Get this camera! You will not be disappointed!","If you're looking for an old-school instant camera for the novelty of it, then look no further. It's well built, feels great in hand, and stylish.<br /><br />If you're looking for an everyday shooter, then reconsider because the film is quite expensive.<br /><br />I bought this camera for my girlfriend as a christmas present. The photos are great, they definitely have that old look. I definitely would recommend the larger format this camera shoots as opposed to the instax mini -- the pictures would just be too small.<br /><br />The film comes in \"magazines\" and it very easy to load. The exposure controls are straightforward and easy to use.<br /><br />Some people think this camera is large, and it is, but it seems appropriately large for what it is -- after all it holds a pack of instant film inside the body which is a much larger format than 35mm or the tiny sensors in point and shoots.<br /><br />And kudos to Amazon -- this same camera at Urban Outfitters is over 200 dollars. I got mine on Amazon for $65. I would recommend buying the film online, too.","This is a big instant camera, but not heavy at all. And I think it looks good.<br />Notice: It acquires instax 210 wide films; not the mini film.  I brought a 20-film package at $18<br />The quality of the picture is very nice, highly recommend!!","Yup, this thing is huge. But its an instant camera. Its supposed to be big. Its simple to use. Pictures come out as good as you would expect from an instant camera. obviously its not the camera you wanna take on vacation, but for snapshots around the house, parties, or outdoors, its perfect. Great product. Just dont drop it. It doesnt seem like it could handle a fall.","I received the camera in excellent condition.<br /><br />I used the product just last week and it is work just the way I expected it function.<br /><br />As for now, I have absolutely no problems with this camera.","This camera and film are awesome!  After doing quite a bit of research I decided to buy this camera and film rather than pay an outrageous price for Polaroid film for my 600 camera.  At first I wished the Fuji picture was the classic square shape but the wide format is actually really nice.  The Instax 210 looks a lot better in all black rather than the blue of the previous 200 model.  The camera feels like higher quality than my Polaroid camera.  There are more setting options, the lens zooms in and out and the digital display on the side gives it a more professional look and feel.  I also like the design and comfort of holding the camera when taking a picture.  So far the picture quality is great indoor and outdoor.  I bought a Lowepro case that my camera, close-up attachment and extra film pack all fit in and it is perfect for carrying around.  The size is definately larger than the small digital cameras but it isn't too big, it's cool.  I do NOT recommend the mini Instax or mini Polaroid.  Business card size pictures?  Everyone that has seen this camera loves it and talks about how great instant film is!<br /><br />NOTE: I do not think I will buy anything by Polaroid in the future after experiencing their customer service and learning what they have done with their iconic instant brand.  It's a real shame...","I generally like the instax as a polaroid replacement. The image quality is very similar to Polaroid 600 film... The camera is bulky and simple with simple controls... My biggest issue by far is that you can't force the flash off. I'm a photographer and know what I often don't want the flash to fire.<br /><br />If fuji wanted to improve the instax they would 1) allow us to shut off the flash completely 2) allow for longer exposures 3) give us slightly better aperture control.","(This review is excerpted from my blog where it is laced with photographic examples).The 210 is a ridiculously oversized modern classic. It is only slightly smaller than my Land Camera 320, but fashioned like the 'black jelly bean' point-and-shoot 35mm cameras from the 1990's that your grandma still uses. I absolutely love it.<br /><br />Every shot turned out. It's light, but not too light, and feels great in your hand. The shutter feels plasticky (it is) and there's somewhat of a delay. It's kind of a soft push and is reminiscent of the Hipstamatic iphone application in that 'letting go' is the shutter actuation. But not exactly. The lens appears to be plastic, but the images are much better than my Polaroid 320. This is noteworthy, because that camera shoots with modern Fuji film (FP-100c), so I think this demonstrates the difference is the camera. The film has a great aspect ratio and no-peel 'wait for it' developing. Over half of my peel film shots failed mechanically in the 320.<br /><br />One *must* use the few buttons on the Instax 210. On power down, it defaults to 0.9-3m focus. I shoot mostly past this range and forgot to reset focus twice. The viewfinder is off a good deal. So far, I've only confirmed the bottom margin; I cut about 10% off the a shot that I was using that lower 10% for the story. I got a different picture.<br /><br />I just read about Ansel Adams' \"The Black Sun\" image, and was pleased that the Instax shares an 'overexposed to black' thing when shooting at the sun. It was unexpected. I've seen this happen with flash reflections, too. It is called a solarization, and in \"Examples\", Mr. Adams indicates that thick emulsion-films capable of it were a dying breed. (p.126). In response, I've been holding a filter on the lens, by way of a step up filter adapter. I will likely glue the adapter ring to the lens. I imagine turning the exposure to \"lighter\" and using a stronger polarizing filter will help. There is certainly much near-forgotten knowledge about shooting on instant film to be found. Instax prints are puffy. I experimented with slicing down to uniform edges. The emulsion layers do not seem to peel apart to lift the image out. The trimming did reduce the puffiness some.<br /><br />There is no doubt that instant film is expensive. There is little doubt how much fun it is, too. People shoot shoot shoot (me too) with digital cameras and I wonder what do they have? A mess of disorganized computer files? The Instax 210 is great for having pictures about. The film comes in twin packs containing 20 shots total, a nice move on Fuji's part. The per shot cost is about 82¢ if you include shipping. I had to stop myself today, because I blew through 19 shots in 45 minutes. $15, ka-ching! This camera will raise some eyebrows and start conversations. I look forward to those! This is unsponsored, spontaneous review of a camera I was a dubious about. I've heard this thing is kind of fragile, so I'll try to be careful. And order more film!","This camera is a lot of fun and if you are interested in photography and like the idea of taking a quick print snapshot then I suggest buying this....I was surprised however how big the camera was, it almost looks like a toy, but it is a fun camera.","Purchased to replace an old Polaroid that we couldn't get film for anymore...<br />Very impressed with the features of the camera....the ease of loading the film<br />and the size and quality of the photos....<br />Would recommend this to anyone....<br />Very easy to use.","this is a great camera! fun to play around with and explore the options! i love having instant pictures!<br />it's pretty big, so be aware of that, not like a little digital camera to tote around. and it weighs about 2 pounds i think so it's hefty, but fun!","This is the newer version of the model we previously used.  The previous model had some performance issues.  We have only had this model for a short time but have not had any problems.  It's easy to use and replaces the Polaroid model that was discontinued because the film was discontinued several years ago.","Too big? what do you expect, a picture comes out of it.works great. close up lense is fun, especially when turned backwards. If mine breaks, Ill buy another, love it!","I looooooove this!! Absolutely love it !! Good images, great size, camera rocks! Big and easy to hold and lightweight. I wish they made black and white and in a lower ISO setting. If u want to shoot some analog images.. get this now! Also, compared to the impossible project they are a great value!","Bought this specifically to take pictures at my daughter's baby shower so we could make a \"real time\" advice book - it worked great and the pictures are beautiful!!!  I will bring it to many events now to take pictures and give to people as a momento. My  boyfriend is going to also bring it on job sites (he is a part-time handyman) to take pictures of certain repairs to use as reference at hardware/home improvement store.  Love the simplicity, too.","The Good:<br />* Affordable and available film<br />* Great looking pictures and nice amount of shooting options<br />* Button configuration is well placed<br />* Good weight<br />* Easy to load and use<br /><br />The Bad:<br />* LARGE camera, about the size of a hardbound novel. Not for small hands<br />* Shooting accuracy is funky. You really need to be lined up level with the camera to get a good shot.<br />* Only available in black<br />* Not overly pleasing aesthetics-wise<br /><br />I rated this camera a 3/5 because I am not impressed with the accuracy when shooting and looking through the view. It seems off and when you are using instant film you want every shot to count. I have read that it feels cheap and flimsy but in my opinion it is no different than a lot of electronics out there for better or worse. The film looks great and its nice to know it is widely available for purchase. This camera is not for kids, it is quite large and takes adult hands to manage but for the kid in adults it is a lot of fun. It is not Polaroid, but it is nice to have a replacement.","I have really enjoyed the instant pictures I can take. It is a great product when you want to see your picture instantly. The camera itself is big, but if you just want it for that instant shot, it is really nice and clear.","Was hunting an instant camera and was looking at Polaroid when I read reviews about the Fuji INSTAX camera. Reviewers thought it better than the Polaroid so on their reviews I purchased this camera.  It is everything they said it was. Great pictures, easy to use, price right and delivery in shorter than expected time!","Fun camera for instant photos!  Good quality pictures, but the camera is a little bulky.","We bought this for our wedding and I'm glad to have it around.<br />Good pictures when used right.","When this came in the mail I was so so excited!  It takes Polaroid like photos, and is so fun to use.  It has several settings on the side that the original Polaroids didn't have, such as the darker/normal/lighter options, and the wide and close options.  I usually just keep it on the \"normal\" settings and go from there.  The photos are slightly smaller then a Polaroid, but seeing as they don't make the Polaroid film anymore, this is a fantastic option.  The film is fairly cheap, even compared to what Polaroid film was years and years ago.  Buy in bulk and it's much cheaper.  I'm more then a little bit in love actually.<br /><br />There are a few small drawbacks though.  One is that for the closer option, there is an attachable viewfinder.  It has a tiny slim part that comes off the side and is extremely fragile.  Since it's detachable there isn't a great way to take it with you without the serious fear of breaking it.  The other is it's size.  It's HUGE!  Not a one hand camera by any means.  It's actually pretty streamlined considering its size, and it's just too fun to pass up.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone missing their Polaroids!","I own a ice cream shoppe, and give free ice cream for bithdays.  I always take the birthday persons picture to display on our bulletin board.  When I couldn't find the film for my polaroid camera I was upset. But I like the Fugi camera and the pictures it takes.  They are a little smaller, but I like the size.  The camera is a little bulky but it serves it's purpose and seems to be built stong and will last.  I only with the film were more readily available.  I order it on-line and get it fairly quickly, I just need to stay ahead of the game so I don't run short.  I really like this item and the delivery was fast and efficeint.","I love my Fuji Instax.  The integral film is less expensive than Polaroid was, and the camera, though a bit large and lighweight, is easy to use, sharp outdoors, and functions rather well.<br /><br />The flash always fires, which is a bit of an annoyance sometimes, but mostly it doesn't matter.  The colors from the Instax film are superb - beautiful blues, pinks and a nice gray scale too, with decent sharpness, all at a fairly low price.  One can only wish that Fuji or some other manufacturers would produce a film back to take this excellent film over to other cameras same as Lomo did with the mini-Instax.  Perhaps they will. In the meantime, this is such an easy camera to use, produces excellent outdoor images, OK inside shots at parties and the like, and everybody just loves to see that picture come up, like magic!<br /><br />Fuji has taken film to a new level. Let's hope it continues, as analog film aficionados in the US are just now discovering this resource, which apparently has been around for a while in Japan and elsewhere, but not in the US.<br /><br />Pros: Good colors, sharpness, fast film speed (800) and decent image size. Lower film price, and instant results!<br />Cons: Indoors you always have to use the flash, the camera is a bit big and lightweight, but so what, the cool factor when you show up with this thing is well worth it.  This camera is much better outdoors than indoors.","There was just something wonderful about the 90's. The Instax is all \"modern\" in a way, yet still low tech. It's huge, and bulky, and it screams 90's even though it's a fairly new product. Love it, the color in the pics is pretty good as well. I think it's pretty fun. Not a fan of range-finders because it means you don't really  know what your getting, but it kind of makes it interesting...","I love  Fuji products and their quality has been past on to the instant industry. What I like about this product: I like the lighting adjustment feature and the distant and the close up attachment.  These are new features for  instant cameras ( way to go Fuji).  Fuji didn't let us down concerning the quality in their films either.  The clarity,sharpness and the color tones are beautiful and perfect.  I'm sorry that Polaroid got out of the instant film business and I'm glad that Fuji was brave enough to take it on.  The only draw back is the camera body, online the camera body looks small and cute and yet it's large and cute.  This is a must have for every photographer.","This camera is much bigger than you'd think, but it is going to work perfectly for what I need.  I took a picture with it and it does pretty much exactly what you think it will; makes a noise and prints a picture.  The picture takes a few minutes to develop but the kids I was babysitting got a huge kick out of it : )","This is one of my favorite new instant cameras. I love the frame size and the quality of prints, but the actual camera body is very fragile. It is plastic, and I have had it break for myself and three of my friends. If you even slightly knock or bump it, it could shut off and stop functioning. I have had to replace two already. I love it so much, so i keep coming back. But, just know, you will have to be way more careful with this camera than any other camera I have ever tried using.","This was a present I bought for my fiancee, and she loves it.  She can't stop using it and snapping pictures of everything.  We both are amazed by the quality of the pictures.","The 210 seems to be the same as the instax 200 but is a different color (black) and the 210 comes with a close up lens (which I have not been able to get anything in focus to come out of). I just received it and have put one pack of film through it. I have experience with all sorts of Polaroid cameras. The photo quality is similar to the 600 film with a little better color saturation. The main problem is you can't turn off the flash. I am trying to decide if I should return it or not. It seems capable of taking pretty good photos but the flash is washing things out. I'm experimenting with covering the flash with three fingers of my right hand while pressing the shutter button with my little finger... If it was $19.95 I would be happy with it but I am not sure the annoyance is worth almost $100. Hopefully the Impossible Project people will get that Polaroid film factory running again and Instax will become unnecessary."]},{"name":"Fujifilm Instax Mini 50S Instant Film Camera","amazon_reviews":["As described.

Also, some film comes out blank after taking a picture (but im sure that occasionally happens with any polaroid).<br /><br />BUT great quality and super cute. I suggest watching tutorial videos or reading directions thoroughly and buying a lot of film to take practice shots with different lighting, settings, etc.","Camera is nice and fun. Pictures are clear but color quality isn't the best","I've been using my Instax 50s for just under 2 months. I'm completely in love with it.<br /><br />IMAGE:<br />- Photo quality is great: small grain, saturated colors. Run a search on instax images to see the results in different lighting conditions.<br />- This will not produce the vintage atmosphere of Polaroid images without some effort. The Instax colors are more true to life and the grain is finer. However, you can achieve all sorts of results if you play with lighting & other effects; the camera ends up being quite flexible.<br />- Surprisingly great in lower light conditions, interior shots, once you master the flash.<br />- The actual image area is smaller than a credit card, roughly 2.5 x 1.75 inches. Of course, if you scan your image to digital, you'll then have a much larger imageso in the end the tiny size is just an idiosyncrasy like any format.<br /><br />FLASH:<br />- The flash can be tricky to get used to, as it's automatic & has variable intensity.<br />- Well-lit shots come out as expected.<br />- In low light, the f...

You have to learn how to use it for sure but it takes really nice pics.","I spent the last year working abroad in very rural areas. Many of the kids I met had never even seen a picture of themselves let alone had one, so I was sooo happy that I had this with me. Forget the candy and crayons, nothing made them as happy as having a picture of themselves. They seriously thought it was magic, especially the one who told the village elders I was a witch.<br /><br />But I digress. This is a great camera. It's beautiful and well-built. I was worried its extended stay in an unbelievably hot climate would affect its function, but I had no problems. I got my first instant camera when I was a little kid and I was absolutely obsessed with it. It was eventually overshadowed by camera phones, but after buying this Fuji I remembered why instant cameras are so much cooler than camera phones.","I never regret buying this. Great product by a great company which I have known since I was about 4 or 5 years old (in 1995 I guess)","This is my favorite 2x3 instant camera, only surpassed by the Fuji Instax 300 for the picture size.","Great","no close up lens included","Instant camera is my dream since I was a kid.<br />Got it around January 2015, Xmas gift for myself and I love it.<br />As of July 2015, already took around 50 pictures!<br />Everyone loves it.

I have some fun time over this product even though I didn't use it a lot since I get it in 2003. However, I just feel that the color quality is not that strong as it is easy to get people in a light color on the photo and sometimes I feel the photo is easy to be whitening. It goes with the flash forever and the photo is just too light and cannot show some color clearly. I tend to use it in a darker mode whenever possible.

The pictures are fun to watch develop, the camera is easy to use, battery lasted us through at least 6 packs (10 pictures each) and is still going. The pictures themselves were what we wanted - they have character. Everything exposed fine on the sunny day that we were testing it. Perfect for collecting memories.","Good quality photos.. batteries are challenging to find... but the camera itself it's really good!","love it!","I liked this camera, but i did not love it. I used it for my wedding, and it really was a hit. The quality is okay, really not worth the price, but there really isn't anything cheaper ( when considering the price of instant film). This camera hada timer too, which was important to me.","Love this camera! So fun to use. Have bought several for gifts as well. Highly recommend!","it is so good","We first saw a camera like this in China and thought it was very cool, so when we got back, I researched cameras for my daughter and Fujifilm won! We are having a blast with it!!","Grand daughter loves it. It takes pretty good picture, though the pics are small. Adds lots of fun to a party.","Got this little thing for my girlfriend and she love it. If you are looking for a fun little polaroid this is the one!","Just what I expected. Perfect.","Very nice Cam","This camera takes beautiful Polaroid pictures, has a high quality feel, works great, is easy to use, is a fun/ fantastic buy and a great gift!","Awesome!","My wife loves it! The photo comes out of it doesn't have nice quality as normal digital camera.<br />However, the skin of people in photo looks good, my wife and her friends all like it.","IT'S GOOD MINI 50S, IT IS VERY WORK.","I bought this because I love photography and I was nostalgic for the days when photos were tangible. Sure, you can print out your digital photos, but it takes time and money, and the results often aren't anything to write home about.  My dad and grandfather both had Polaroid cameras when I was growing up, so when I saw this, I was happy.<br /><br />The colors of these little photos are rich. The pictures are sharp. You do need to figure out the optimal distance and lighting but that's part of photography. This camera makes you think of the photo you are taking. I get happy like a little kid when the picture is coming out of the camera,lol.","I'm completely head over heels for my new polaroid! I LOVE vintage like items and this is just perfect! Its so small and compack it fits in any ppurse, and takes high quality pictures. Other brands have way to many dials and settings but these have fewer easier to understand setting. I love it so much!","I bought this camera for my girlfriend! I must say I opened it up and took some pictures with it before giving it to her and it was amazing! The pictures turn out great and the camera is excellent quality! My girlfriend loves it and uses it all the time!<br /><br />P.s this camera DOESN'T come with film so you have to buy it separate.","Beautiful!","My daughter and her friends have a great time with this camera!  To have the picture in their hand right away is a great treat as opposed to having it on an electronic device all the time.  The only thing is no mirror on the front to make sure you are capturing your image properly when taking \"selfies\".  The kids love this and the grown ups have a great time with it too!","I got this camera for my cousin's bachelorette camping party and she had the mini 8 version. Originally I researched a lot of websites that did a side-by-side comparison and read lengthy reviews between the Mini 8, 50S and 90.<br />According to a lot of sites, they recommended 50S because of the color and ease and mid-price range.<br />However, my cousin's Mini 8 had different settings for light (day vs night) and the color quality overall was far richer than my Mini 50S. I still really like the Mini 50S but feel it would have been so much better if it had similar color quality for the prints and options to change light source settings.","Very cute! The camera works exactly as cited, the photos take a little longer to come in than I thought they would but the clarity is pretty good.  My grandkids love it!  The close up lens is useless, didn't even know it came with it when I bought i t so it's irrelevant.  Great styling, worth the price.  Wish the film were less expensive...","This camera is great. The picture quality was better than any other instax mini and the different orientations to take the photo was a plus. The added lens was great when taking a selfie :) I use it all the time. The down side would be the batteries used for it because I can't seem to find them in stores and have to buy them online. Besides that it's great and I love the picture quality. Definitely buy","I am very happy I bought this one. Everything is awesome but I am still getting use to using that flash button. The pictures come out very nice and this camera is very easy to use! If you want to see how it works before you buy it, there is a very nice youtube video with the two guys from Fujifilm explaining the basic information about this camera. If you're interested in purchasing it, go check it out!","I bought this to have on hand for snapshots of my son for all of his summer adventures. We love the \"Polaroid Effect\"--everyone gathers around to watch the picture develop. Then we can write a title on it and pop it into the little album designed specifically for this size photo [business card size]. So far all of the shots we've taken have turned out--full outdoor sunlight and indoor with flash, no problem.<br /><br />The only drawback is the lousy instructions. I had to go to You Tube to find a How To video to be able to take advantage of all of this camera's features, luckily there were two very useful vidoes put out there by amateurs that covered all the things you can do.","We drove across the country and kept a travel journal, this was a great way to put pictures in it since everything is digital now and we never print pictures.","This camera is awesome! Dont take the film out after using it and not done with whole roll because it will ruin it!","Full disclosure, I have a small obsession with film cameras. That being said, the Fujifilm Instax Mini 50S is an exceptional camera that fills a necessary niche. I just love the look and feel of the camera! Instax mini? Instant pictures?! INSTANT GRATIFICATION!  The picture quality will never be as good as DSLR but that’s part of the appeal of the Instax Mini line. It’s supposed to be reminiscent of the polaroids of our youth. They’re designed to be spontaneous photos that capture the moment, not a technically perfect studio portrait. In my opinion, the quality of the photos is just one of the perks of getting this camera. It’s perfect for a bbq or a day out at the beach. If it’s super bright outside, just use the darken function. Just a word of advice though, don’t use it in low light. Even the flash and lighten function won’t help there. In any case, this was a great buy and I would definitely purchase it again.","I absolutely love this little polaroid. However, it's a bit complicated to use and the different settings make things difficult at times. Also, some film comes out blank after taking a picture (but im sure that occasionally happens with any polaroid).<br /><br />BUT great quality and super cute. I suggest watching tutorial videos or reading directions thoroughly and buying a lot of film to take practice shots with different lighting, settings, etc.","Lots of fun at a wedding or a party.  A crowd pleaser!  People pose for this camera and light up when you hand them the picture.","This Instax camera from Fujifilm performs admirably, with reasonable exposure and a decent flash, but the price is higher than it should be considering you can buy a working used Polaroid at a camera shop that sells used gear. I bought this camera from Amazon at a steep discount during Black Friday promotions; I wouldn't recommend paying full price. Also, if I had it to do over again, I would go with the wider format Instax.","I love this Fujifilm Instax Mini camera!  The instant photos are always a big hit parties.  It's like the good old days!!  My 3 yr old and 5 yr old daughters love having their pictures taken and then watching themselves instantly appear in the photos.  It's like magic to them ;-)","Love love love. Tons of compliments and very easy to use and reload. Pictures come out clear. Printing is instant and the pictures come in quickly.","Love it ^_^ its was more that I expected. I will really recommens it to all to purchased this. Youwill be satisfied.","Great snap and go polaroids. Easy to use and take great pictures to give yall that vintage old school look from when ya look at your grandmother old photo books with a modern spin to it.<br /><br />Pros: Great price, easy to use, not to big so it can fit in ya purse or man bag with ease. Picture are a nice small card side photos to keep with ya in an wallet or clutch.<br /><br />Cons: Piano black is nice with an glossy finish, but finger prints show up real easy. So lots of shammie cloth cleaning if ya a clean freak. 2nd think I kinda found annoying the view finder is so small that I have to be a smurf to see though that thing. Have to get the angle right and really focus on that tiny smurf viewfinder.<br /><br />Over all good price, easy to use with the downsize of noticeable finger print smudges and an smurf viewfinder. :3","It's a very fun camera to use. Not the best photos but you shouldn't expect that from an instant camera anyway.","The camera looks just as what was described, including the little scratch marks (which were barely noticeable by the way)","I have dropped it like 20 times and it is just fine! still takes okay quality pictures. Definitely not something to buy if you are looking for high quality pictures though.","Perfect for my homemade wedding booth. The camera was half the price as the kodak one I was going to get. It is super simple to use and I loved the multi functions.","I can't say enough about this camera. Got it for my daughter for Christmas. She went nuts for it. Whole family had fun with it. Now other family members want one. My daughter takes it with her all the time. She has had it almost 3 months and the novelty still has not worn off. Love it.","I'm off to Africa very soon and had to have something to immediately bond with the people I'll be working with; something I can carry easily, use immediately and not \"think\" too much in the process. I'm NOT a techie by any means!  This beautiful little thing arrived, I followed the illustrated instructions and within 5 minutes I was running around the house taking pictures.  It's easy, quick, light, and it's going to do the job.  Can't say enough good about it.","This is not a bad camera. The feel to it can seem somewhat cheap due to the plastic structure, but the quality is up to par. The quality of images is exactly as you would expect, has the retro but non grainy look of a polaroid. This is a fun and cool camera, but beware, the photos are literally wallet sized. They are about the size of a library card. If you are looking for a camera that is going to replace a full polaroid or a digital camera, do not buy this. However, if you are looking for a fun camera that can take retro looking instant photos, this is definitely worth it.","I am completly obsessed with this camera!  It's super easy to use and tons of fun.  Great for all special events!","I really love this camera.  The quality of the photos it takes are incredible, and while some people may argue that it's more of a novelty, I find it to be a great tool for capturing memories with my daughters and instantly producing a real piece of film that can be held and admired much easier than a digital picture hidden way on a memory card.  Plus, with Amazon Prime the film is affordable and delivered in 2 days (or next day for only $3.99 extra, which is still cheaper than the nearest box store)!","Bought this for my sister for Christmas. FUN! We used up all the film I bought her within the evening. So cute and fun!","Nice for handling. It's a good product. Pictures aren't as brilliant and focused as expected. Take care, over-exposition when the sun light strikes directly to anything.","I love having this camera on hand. Some of my favorite photos have been taken with this it. The photos make for great instant keepsakes at gatherings and events. They are clear and vivid when taken with natural sunlight, but can easily blur when using the flash in low/no light settings if you aren't steady.","I've had this camera a while now and have had no issues. It takes great photos with very little effort on my part. And although it's about the size of a large adult hand, it's still very easy to handle. I've been stocking up on flim so I will be able to use whenever and not worry about running out.","Extremely handy and versatile. Nice quality pictures. Memories preserved instantly. Highly recommended, not pricey and serves the purpose well.  Really nice.","While I wanted to love my polaroid camera it isn't perfect. Here's what I think:<br />The good<br />-portable and lightweight<br />- easy to load film<br />- has flash toggle buttons and viewfinder<br />- cute<br /><br />the bad<br />- hard to adjust light (photos often come out really dark)<br />- flash doesn't always stay off (almost got me kicked out of the Met)<br />- the viewfinder isn't completely accurate.<br /><br />It's a fun little camera but hard to get a great image from","Perfect for snapping fun sessions with friends or as capturing moments at wedding tables this is a fun and simple camera to use. A great gift idea for mixed media artists, camera collectors, or people who love to post physical shots of their lives. Decent optics and just plain fun.","I like the black color, very cool and it has many function which other cameras do not have.<br />I like it. and have already taken many beautiful pictures!","Fun for making memories and scrap booking and such. A really great buy! And great gift for anyone who's interested in cameras","Love this! This focuses sooo much better than the regular fujifilm instax cameras. This was totally work the extra $30 or so dollars for the more focused images. I love this camera and just about everything about it. If you are asking yourself if the cooler looking fujifilm instax mini camera might be more appealing because of all the style/color variations, I guarantee this one is worth the price difference for the focus feature.<br /><br />I warn don't take any photos up super close to someone's face because the view isn't the exact same as the lens' view.","great price, fun instant camera. I read the reviews online and chose this camera for my daughter. Nice to have spontaneous photos that arent the product of the many retakes possible with a digital camera, and nice to have a printed photo for a change.","I ordered this a day or two before my birthday, and arrived in the mail a day after! Finding the package made my day. The included strap and close-up lens are very useful, and the camera arrived safe in secure wrapping. The small pictures make for vintage-looking and beautiful photos and i love them so much :D","What a nice surprise to have a camera that instantly produces photos! The photos are the size of a credit card and instantly be taken away to be stored in a wallet for future reminiscing.<br />A nice book to pair with this is Instant Love by Susannah Conway, Amanda Gilligan and Jenifer Altman available here on Amazon. It helps navigate those unfamiliar with instant photography.<br /><br />The printed item box included the camera, an extra lens in its own case, instruction and owner manuals, and a camera strap.<br /><br />After reading most of the reviews, I figured before I went on my vacation that I'd blow a roll of film or two getting acquainted with it. Sure, it's an expensive venture but better to do that now than to be all upset at the time of vacation and waste photos. I'm glad I did. I played with the various adjustments (lighten, darken, normal, with red-eye reduction, without red-eye reduction, etc) with various light situations (ambient light, some room lights on, darkened room, etc), using my pets and family as subjects and then writing what I did on the photo (e.g. ambient light, red-eye). Don't forget to play with the included close-up lens if yours came with one. The one that came with mine wasn't the same color as the camera, was hard to put on, and broke easily while I was trying to do so! I bought one that was black and designated specifically for the 50s model off Ebay. It's the one with a little mirror for self shots but works for close-ups. This one was easy to put on with little effort and works fabulous.<br /><br />The good: It is versatile, relatively easy to use, and compact. Finding accessories like a fitted camera case, colored lenses, container bags, and novelty straps are easy to obtain. Film is widely available online and in some retail stores. I've seen film at WalMart, but have bought Instax film online for the better pricing. You can find pdf versions of the owners manual and instruction book on the Fujifilm website as well as helpful hints and photo ideas from other Instax enthusiasts' personal sites by merely doing searches.<br />This also has a self-timer with several second intervals to choose from, and an embedded groove to use with a tripod. If you think you'll be taking pictures in areas where you'll need more stability get a tripod.<br />This is the *nicest* of Minis. It has more versatility over the other models because of available adjustments. You can read about this on Wikipedia under the heading Instax, which has an overview of all the different Minis (7, 7s, 8, 10, 20, 25 and so on).<br /><br />Here is what Wikipedia has written for the 50s model:<br />Mini 50S<br />Released: 2011<br />Lens: 60mm f/12.7 lens<br />Shutter speed: 1/3 - 1/400s<br />Exposure: automatic<br />Exposure compensation: W/+/-2/3<br />Flash: smart flash<br /><br />The bad: This can be awkward to use when trying different shots, specifically a wide shot by merely flipping the camera on its side. The photo button becomes harder to reach and you can get your finger(s) in your shot or block the flash if you're not careful. It also doesn't stand on its own when you have it on its side so you will either have to use a tripod or stabilize it if you use the self-timer.<br />You can easily waste a lot of shots if you're not careful. If I didn't get the shot I wanted, I'd try again (after a setting adjustment) and if that didn't work out I'd use either my camera phone or my digital camera. I know that's not really the point (nor the joy) of instant photography but if you *really* want that shot--there's your alternative.<br />By the way, if your phone has a camera and a micro SD slot don't scrimp on SD memory. Get the most you feel you'll most likely use. I have my phone camera settings on the highest quality for impromptu occasions.<br />Because snapping shots is so easy on the Instax 50s (and fun) you can go through film quickly so plan ahead; figure out how many pictures you'll want to bring back (or give away), allot for a couple of bad photos, and have one pack extra for just in case.<br />This model is also available in white, but at present is more expensive.<br /><br />For peace of mind I picked up a two year warranty with the available Square-Trade in the event of any accidents.","It's such a Nice and fun camera.<br />Pro: not too big fit comfortable in your hands.<br />Con: type of battery","This is so much fun and makes me so happy.  I just wish the film didn't cost so damn much! And the piano black is shiny so your greasy face or hands will show up quickly.  Make sure to carry a nice soft cloth to wipe it after use.","This camera produces excellent vintage pictures. The only downside is the cost of the exposures. However, I'd still recommend this product overall!","SO CUTE!!<br />one thing i dont like is the fingerprints you leave :P but other than that takes great memory shots :)","I bought this over the mini 25 because the shape is more sophisticated, loooks less like a toy etc. plus black is sexier than the white. One thing you have to know before buying it is, DONT OPEN THEBACK (where you put the film in) Unless you're putting in NEW film or your taking it out (when it's empty) theres a reason why the films have that black sheet in the beginning. After that sheets gone, the film when exposed to light itll make your pictures white or really blurry with white blotches.<br />ALSO<br />dont turn it on and off continuously, at least for mine, everytime i turn it on ineeda take a pictuer cause if i dont, the count (of how many films i have left) resets and one of your films will be wasted on making a black picture. but besides that, this cameras easy to use, and it's auto adjust for best quality pictures ^_^","As a gadget geek, I can really appreciate when something different with personality comes along.<br /><br />Design:<br />This camera is one of the smallest and most compact instant cameras that you can buy. It is also the smallest Fujifilm Instax model that is offered (to my knowledge). Of course it is still sort of chunky by today's compact camera standards, but if you have some experience with instant cameras in the past, this camera is a huge improvement in form and size.<br />I am able to hold and operate the camera with one hand, taking pictures easily both vertically and horizontally. The battery compartment protrudes slightly from the body creating a nice area for you to firmly grip the camera. Small nubby grips strategically located all over the back further assist you with gripping. There are two shutter buttons, one on front and one on side/top. Great for small hands or self-portraits. An LCD keeps track of how many photos are left as well as flash/timer status. Additional buttons for flash, timer, and lightening/darkening of photos are located on side.<br /><br />Picture Quality:<br />Pictures come out about as expected for instant photos. A picture with good lighting come out the nicest - sharper and more vivid. The camera performs well outdoors in sunny weather however, I agree with other reviewers and have also noticed a tendency for overexposure - particularly when it's overcast. I also don't know if the camera has any sort of auto white balance but it's not very good.<br /><br />Indoor photos a Flash is a must - I have found that indoors even with good lighting the picture will come out underexposed. Always use the flash and use the light/dark setting to fine tune your picture. The depth of field is mediocre at best. Not that it matters since this isn't being used for anything important...but it is worth noting that it is very difficult to get anything beyond my subject to appear clearly in the background sometimes. Hard to explain but it's not bokeh, it's just so washed out that it's non-existent. I took a picture of my car outdoors in cloudy daylight and none of the houses or even the street behind my car really showed up in the picture - it was very faint and \"ghostlike\"...though my subject was just fine. This was less of a problem indoors. As long as there was good lighting, indoor photos showed up clearly from the front of the room to the back. I'm not an expert and don't want to speculate what the issue may be, but I can say that if your background is more than, say, 10- 15ft from your subject it's probably not going to show up in your picture well (though your subject will still come out nicely). It's not very surprising to me as I have had similar difficulties in the past with other instant cameras. Perhaps it could be corrected with additional lighting if available or repositioning somehow, but it's not usually feasible since you don't get a lot of shots to a cartridge to reshoot every photo...not to mention the cost.<br /><br />One more thing worth mentioning is camera shake...To be honest I am so used to shooting spur of the moment digital photography with all kinds of \"assists\" and vibration reduction that it's been some time since I've shot an \"unassisted\" camera...I had to re-learn to hold this camera still (and breathe out as I engaged shutter) like the old days. Another reviewer mentioned \"fuzzy pictures\", well, I can almost tell you for certain that it was because of vibration. Is this a good camera for young children? Probably not. Nor is it great for catching action shots..unless of course you want the blurred effect! I know it sounds like there are a lot of negatives about this camera but it's not unusual for an instant camera to have these issues in my experience. The quality of instant photos look about the same as they did 30 years ago and I don't know if manufacturers never bothered to improve the technology or if it's just inherent to it. Nevertheless instant photos with all of their flaws are the distinguishing characteristics that make them special from its gazillion megapixeled counterparts. There is always going to be a sentimental feeling behind every instant photo...something you just don't get from viewing the thousands of digital photos we all have that no longer seem....well...interesting. With anyone and everyone armed with a cell phone taking professional looking, yet homogeneous, photos nowadays I happily welcome any change.<br /><br />This camera comes with a 60mm fixed focus lens with a minimum distance of 0.6m. Mine came with a macro lens attachment that clips onto the front of the camera lens. I have yet to experiment with it since film is not exactly cheap - averaging about $1.00 per photo. Speaking of costs, I'm not happy that it uses 2 CR2 batteries but they seem to last a while. I'm sure like many these aren't the type of batteries we keep around the house like AA and AAA.<br /><br />With that said I still highly recommend this camera. For the price range, this camera exceeds my expectations for value. I took this out the other day and it was a hit. It's rare to see someone shooting something other than a digital/mobile phone/ipad camera and even rarer to see an instant camera. Plenty of people have never seen one before and many haven't seen one in years. In a way an instant camera provides the same \"instant gratification\" as a digital camera only you get to have a one of a kind keepsake (or gift) in the end. And the excitement of watching the picture develop before your eyes is priceless.","Wife seems to love it, Pricey but worth the quick Photo booth memories. The film is quite pricey as well. Always good to go back to the 80's style photos. Be prepared to spend a pretty penny if you plan to use this camera on a regular basis.","Its really fun to take pictures and see them right away, just like the old times. The fact that the pictures are credit card sized is also perfect. I made a little album of all the pictures I've taken since I bought it. Something about having a physical picture vs a digital makes me happier.","So much fun using this thing!  but few things to consider<br /><br />- it will cost you roughly $1/picture!<br />- not good for shots of more than 2 people<br />- really meant to be a \"selfie\" kind of camera<br />- works great at night too (but again, only for close up self shots)<br />- small and compact<br /><br />Considering buying the larger model now too!","Brought this for my kids to take pictures on our adventure to India. Somewhat fun as I thought they could put the pictures in a journal and write about their adventure of the day with picture in hand ( a parent's view) .They instead, would take pictures of the kids and hand the pictures out, which was a wonderful experience for they were able to interact with the local kids despite the language gap. The pictures were fuzzy and small and showed very little except for the close-up , the old instamatic were much better ; too bad we cannot really find cheap film.","I am absolutely obsessed with this!  I love seeing people's faces when they see the film coming out of the camera right there on the spot.  They either love it or hate it...depending on how their picture turned out.  Nothing brings honest imagery out like instant film.  The credit card sized film is something not many people have seen, so it's fun.","Picture quality is fine even in dark environment.  Films are a bit expensive though.  Look a lot nicer than the older model.","I've been using my Instax 50s for just under 2 months. I'm completely in love with it.<br /><br />IMAGE:<br />- Photo quality is great: small grain, saturated colors. Run a search on instax images to see the results in different lighting conditions.<br />- This will not produce the vintage atmosphere of Polaroid images without some effort. The Instax colors are more true to life and the grain is finer. However, you can achieve all sorts of results if you play with lighting & other effects; the camera ends up being quite flexible.<br />- Surprisingly great in lower light conditions, interior shots, once you master the flash.<br />- The actual image area is smaller than a credit card, roughly 2.5 x 1.75 inches. Of course, if you scan your image to digital, you'll then have a much larger image...so in the end the tiny size is just an idiosyncrasy like any format.<br /><br />FLASH:<br />- The flash can be tricky to get used to, as it's automatic & has variable intensity.<br />- Well-lit shots come out as expected.<br />- In low light, the flash produces the same ugly effect as any camera. I recommend more light ha ha<br />- In moderate light, which is what I prefer for grainier, moody shots, I compensate for the flash either with distance or by filtering it (I've used a lens from my sunglasses and also semi-transparent tape, placed directly on the flash not the camera lens)<br /><br />PERKS:<br />- The timer allows up to 2 exposures, great for self-portraits.<br />- Most instant cameras are very bulky but the 50s is small enough to carry in one hand and it'll fit in a medium handbag.<br />- 2 months & over 200 exposures later, I still haven't needed to replace the batteries, and I'm the type that leaves the camera on & idle for some time.<br /><br />FILM:<br />- I'd plan on burning through at least one pack of film just getting used to the flash & the lens. Unlike digital cameras, the viewfinder isn't linked to the lens; the lens is about 2 inches down & to the left of the port you're looking through. So, you'll need to learn how to compensate for the difference between what you're looking at and the actual boundaries of the photo.<br />- Buy packs in sets. Much cheaper.<br /><br />Have fun :)","I call this Instant success becaue I wanted a camera that would produce an immediate picture when a printer option was not available. This camera provided this option. I used this camera in Zambia, Africa when taking pictures of children who had never seen their picture and I wanted to leave them with a picture for rememberance. I would have liked a larger picture but the larger camera was too bulky so opted for this one.","I've always wanted a polaroid/instant camera to take physical pictures with. I went with this because the film is much cheaper. Some people complain about the size, and although they are fairly small, i still LOVE them and all their cuteness.<br /><br />Every time i take a picture, people are always giving compliments to the camera because it's RAD. Anyways, I've made many memories with this camera already, the only bad thing is that (to me) it is difficult to determine when to use all the different features to get the best looking pictures. All it'll take is a good eye and experience though.","Very cool and easy to use, I like the color! Piano paint effect! And the flasher it's really really useful! And lighter, thiner. Much better than 7s!","My daughter requested this for Christmas, and was just thrilled to receive it. she is enjoying her new camera. Seems to be well-crafted and durable.","Perfect for a 10 year old who didnt even know what film was! So much fun to use at parties.","I love how this camera is a lot smaller compared to other instant film cameras. The only flaw it has is even though you put the setting to darken, if there is too much sunlight the picture comes out too bright. Overall though this camera is a great buy, especially for the price. I take it everywhere I go.","I can get great memory with my friends by using this ! Party or traveling is great!however the paper for photo is to expensive, save it!","i love this camera!  owned the previous model and when it finally died after four years of abuse, i quickly ordered this newer model.  pictures are great and framing is so much better than other models.","Really nice...went beyond my expectations<br />Great pictures. I loved it.<br />Buy it if you want something diffrent for a change.","I love this Camera, the film is a bit expensive but I love the old skool cam, people eyes light up when the film comes out,<br />The camera is a big hit","This camera is a real gem, I like it a lot! The shipping was delayed but I didn't mind too much. It takes really good photos.. but the batteries are pretty weird I'd like normal AA batteries..","Of all the instant film (real film not digital print instant) cameras out there this is the best in terms of price per photo.<br /><br />I bought this camera to replace my polaroid mio after the flash on it died. Have had it for at least 6-8 months. Definitely an improvement in electronics for exposures and it is smaller then the Mio. I also like the 2 shutter bottons. The Shots with a Mio are a touch darker and warmer which i preferred, but since they don't make the Mio anymore i figured i would try a real instax camera to fit the instax film. So all in all i would recommend it. and i think anyone considering buying a camera for instax mini film this is the one to get, unless you want to try your luck with a used Polaroid Mio.<br />Personally those are the only Instax mini cameras i would buy.<br /><br />Pros- small camera, has 2 bottons for vertical or horizontal shots. best auto exposure settings in a instant instax camera i have found. and considering it is not an slr the viewfinder is pretty accurate.<br />cons- photos too small for much more then portraits, (but i think anyone looking to buy one of these cameras already knows that) and i find the color white balance is really white in the photos.<br /><br />The only reason i am removing one star is for the white balance, but one gets used to it. happy shooting.","I like this Instax alot!! takes great pics.<br />it adjust exposure automatically so you wont have to worried about be over exposed, or too little lights<br />100% satisfied","We used this camera at our wedding to create a \"photo booth\" guest book area.We put it on a tripod and let guests take their own pictures. We originally got this model because it had a self timer, but in the end I don't think anyone used it. The pictures were great, and the camera was a huge hit. I highly recommend it for anyone in a similar situation.<br /><br />The photos did come out dark when we started moving the camera around, but if you have good light and a stable location, or don't plan on shooting against a very sunny backdrop, you should have no problem.","I am a professional photographer for 10 years, this is not a camera for professional users but is a cool camera to enjoy the old instant way of phogography. Imagine you in a little party with your friends and family, the camera is great for that. You can take pics and give the photo to your friend/family to the person keep the memory on the wallet.<br /><br />The camera has a good build quality and is small and beautiful.<br /><br />Buy the camera and have fun!","First of all,<br />I was really amazed how fast it shipped. I ordered this camera and shipped and came within two days and it was free shipping.<br />I was very satisfied with that.<br /><br />As of this camera, the picture came out really clear and specific. The flash was amazing.<br />I was debating whether I should get this mini 50s or mini 25 white one then I compared the size between these two. Mini 50s was little bit smaller than mini 25.<br />I bought mini 25 for my friend's bday gift and I thought that was very small and compatible instant camera but this mini 50s was smaller than mini 25.<br />And the color of the photo was just amazing.<br /><br />Like everybody know, the price of the film is expensive but IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH OF HAVING.<br />Each picture you take will be the only one that will have for the rest of your life. This isn't like digital camera so once you press the button and take the picture, you can't delete that, and I think that's the most memorable moment.<br />My friend who has mini 25 told me that after you take these pictures it's more fun to look at the films one by one and never get tired of looking at them.<br /><br />The timer to take double pictures is really great because you can take two same pictures and give it to someone you love.<br />I hesitated a lot whether I should purchase mini 25 or mini 50s.<br />Then I thought, by spending little bit more than the price of mini 25, you can get newer version of instax camera.<br />I agree that mini 25 is a great camera also, but mini 50s is newer and smaller.<br />So now I'm really really glad that I made a right choice for myself and got this mini 50s because it's obviously newer than mini 25 and is smaller than mini 25.<br /><br />I personally like small sizes so that I can bring around everywhere and can put in my purse.<br />The picture of camera on amazon came out big but I was really surprised how small it was when it shipped.<br /><br />If anyone purchase this or thinking of buying instax camera from fujifilm, I think this camera is definitely a great choice for you or for somebody else.","This camera is awesome! What does this mean? It's the design. It is really slick. The piano black color and lines of this polaroid are drastic aesthetic improvements from the boxlike designs of years past. The smaller size of the film is nice as well. They are perfect sized for your wallet as well as tacking up on a board or on your refrigerator. That being said, it is still polaroid film. You will not have Digital SLR beauty in these. However you will have that white framed nostalgic feel everytime you snap a shot. There is no image preview screen like a digital camera, and it will not store an image for later use or download. What you see through the viewfinder is what you get. Live in the moment!<br /><br />A nice touch to this camera is the timer function. Seems basic, but it is nice to have. Battery life is good.I'm still using the original battery.<br /><br />I received this as a Christmas gift and am not sure where it came from. Looking at the Amazon price, I would definitely buy one here if I didn't have one already. I have purchased the instax film on Amazon and am pleased with the price and shipping. Each polaroid may seem a little pricey, but I think it has been good bang for the buck for anyone with extra spending money.<br /><br />Makes a great gift. Fun at parties and events. Enjoy!","I got the Instax Mini 50s because I thought that the pull-out lens of the 7s was a little random, and I heard that the flash of the 25 was not too smart.  So I held out, and now...I have a 50s.  I used to have some Polaroid cameras in grade school (both the color polariod and the B&W polaroid where you have to put an emulsion on the print so that it develops), so I have something for reference.<br /><br />There are some good things about the new Fuji system:<br />  (1)  It has a nice clear, picture with fine grain (especially considering that it's 800 ASA film)!<br />  (2)  The camera is big, but not as big as it used to be with the polaroids.<br /><br />The drawbacks:<br />  (1)  The images take a while to come up.  By a while, think like a minute to see something resembling the final photo, and at least 10 minutes (I'm guessing, I checked again after an hour) to see full color saturation.  The initial image looked a bit grey and washed out and low contrast, but the final image was sharp, saturated, and had clearly defined colors.<br />  (2)  The Instax mini film is pretty high contrast, even for 800 ASA.  Suppose you have a diffuse light source in the room -- when you take a photo with a subject 1/2 in the light, the light gradient won't be as diffuse as it looks IRL.  It will be much more marked, almost like a line.  So you've been warned!<br />  (3)  The print is REALLY small.  Now, it says credit card sized.  That's kind of like the size of the film.  There's a substantial border around the image, so it's actually smaller than a credit card.  Perhaps 2/3 of the size of a credit card.<br />  (4)  You can't turn off the flash, even in landscape mode.<br />  (5)  Prints are something like...$0.70 each if you buy the twin pack (2 x 10 exposures).<br /><br />I got this camera in place of a photobooth for an event -- it should work, and even with the cost of the film, it will come out to be less than a photobooth."]},{"name":"Holga 120N Medium Format Plastic Camera","amazon_reviews":["These little cameras are awesome and so much fun :)","Quick and easy!

The film was pretty expensive, and I was only able to get two rolls processed before the place that process that type of film closed down in my area. If I broke this camera out now, and found the old rolls of film I had for it, I bet it would still work, being that it's mostly plastic, but I don't know where I'd go to process the film, and it would be expensive as hell even if I found a place.<br /><br />I think cameras like this definitely have their purpose though, and it was a really fun thing to play around with while I used it for that short time.<br /><br />It's sad to say, but at this point, considering cost and use-type, you may be better off with Instagram.","The holga is an incredible medium format camera. Its picture quality rivals that of the Leica M series (astounding quality and sharpness, but with the larger film size you can enlarge it about 4 times more than the Leica so it is in fact a superior camera). The included lens could be compared to that of zeiss glass. This camera is PERFECT for landscape and micro photography. This camera is also very durable. I feel that the build quality is superb and rivals the durability and ruggedness of the Pentax 6x7! I've dropped it off the roof of my house when I was taking some landscape shots and it actually worked better than before.","camo holga, is there more to be said?","Really cool find, came in brand new with the box, and shipping was fast! :-)","This is a cute little toy camera for a fraction of what you'd spend on a Diana. However, if you've got a DSLR, and you're looking for only the effect, and not the body along with it, you can get a Holga lens for about five dollars less. Still, this wouldn't be a bad conversation piece to or a bad addition to a camera collection.","Awesome concept! A \"toy\" camera with a campy following.<br /><br />I love this medium format camera because of its inherent cheapness. The photos produced with this camera are fun surprises, and experimenting with it is great fun for me (an amateur \"photographer\" and enthusiast with no formal training other than YouTube).<br /><br />Though the 120 film and developing can get a bit expensive, the quality is great and the creative possibilities are endless.","Nice camera to use.","overall it was a decent purchase. comes with great instructions on using this type of camera. love that you can double exposure and change speeds.  i used it for a creative photography class and had a great time learning about film with this. I attached one of the images i used for a final. nothing special, but creative and fun.","The Holga cameras have been around for years and have always been used for lomography photography. The main objectives of the Holga camera is that it takes pictures in which you will most likely not know how it is going to come out. At a price of $25 this is a must have for photo enthusiasts and professionals who want a different experience behind the camera. The lens and body of the camera is made entirely of plastic except for the two metal bars on the side in which allow the user to open and load film.<br /><br /> Included in package:<br />-hold camera with plastic lens attached<br />-lens cap/cover<br />-neck strap<br />-instruction manual<br /><br />Pros:<br />-cheap<br />-new experience with photography<br />-you never know what you are going to get<br />-comes with the camera body, lens attached to body and a neck strap<br />-can easily use 35mm (instructions are included in manual in how to adjust this) or 120mm (medium format film)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-feels cheap<br />-plastic lens distorts image so you never know how it is going to come out unless you get the film developed<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Buy it. It is well-worth the $25 to experiment with.","At the time that I bought my Holgawood (gold) Holga it was the cheapest color of the selection. Plus it was snazzy. Now it seems to be the most expensive of the colors. Who knows, it may become the cheapest again. Still, it stands out in the sea of black Holgas that all my friends have - so it's fun.<br /><br />The color, of course, is minor compared with its Holga-osity. It is just SO much fun. Yes, you have to tape up the edges each time you load film into it so the light doesn't leak in. You get so you can do that in two minutes flat. I had this with me on a cruise to Key West and Cozumel. Where others were carrying fancy digital cameras, I would whip this thing out, covered in its tape, and they'd all stare at it as if it had come from another dimension. Which then started fun conversations.<br /><br />Yes, it takes film. And not \"normal\" 35mm film, either. So you'll have to track down 120 film to load into it and then a place to develop it.<br /><br />But wait! You actually can jury-rig it so it takes 35mm film and then it'll shoot the entire film - **including the sprockets**. Talk about fun film effects!<br /><br />Plus you can double or triple expose a single frame of film, shoot squares, shoot rectangles, overlap frames, you name it. Just so much fun.<br /><br />So sure, digital cameras are fun. They're easy. But this Holga is a cheap reminder of just why film still holds the attention of many of us.<br /><br />Take the plunge. Buy a Holga!<br /><br />UPDATE: I added a few photos of what the ORIGINAL Holga box looked like. This was solid blue cardboard without any flimsy plastic inserts. So when you get a Holga with this blue box you know you've got a real collector's item :). The more modern versions came in thinner cardboard boxes with a super-thin plastic window over the front so you could see the camera inside. Good for marketing, less good for camera protection.","Fun camera.  If you're not into film and all that it implies you might want to skip this one.  If you love film go for it, you'll love it.","This was my favorite camera used in college. Its only an insanely affordable medium format camera, it also is sought out for its imperfections. These Holgas are riddled with light leaks which make for interesting photographs.","Light leaks. Love it.","Satisfied","It's a good looking camera and I can't wait to use it. The only thing that kind of bothered me was that the pink paint had chipped on some parts of the camera, mostly on the corners. They weren't big chips but still. Other than that, I love it.","Exactly as expected. I love using this Holga and especially love the purple color.","I loved it!","For a cheap, holga camera I can't complain. But the metal parts that keep that back of the camera attached are pretty weak and I'm worried that the back might slip off and expose my film. That's the risk with holga though I guess.","I love Holga cameras, this is my second one.  I have already run several rolls of film and the images are fantastic!  It's very easy to use as long as you follow the guidelines for photographing with it.  The wonderful thing about this camera is that it can take beautiful fine art images with a price that is good enough to allow giving this camera as a gift to a child to teach them how to use a film camera.","Awesome little camera!","Cool camera, but it should came with more instructions","I do most of my photography in medium format with either a Rollei 6003 or a Pentax 67 but I get a real buzz from the simple fun of occasionally using a Holga . Love it's unpredictability but mostly manage to nail down exposure inconsistencies using FP4+ and semi-stand developing in Rodinal for a hour . A very liberating camera !!!!","Holga's are awesome.  Less finicky than Diana's, great image quality if you like that sort of look.  A lot more user intensive than instagram, but more rewarding too.","i love it","I expected this to just arrive without anything. The camera in its own new box and came with a manual. Also a strap with a lens cap and another frame. This is a fun camera and works great. I would highly recommend it!","It's different and a blast from the past... but takes nice pictures.  Sure you have wait for them to be developed.. but 120 format kicks butt!  Try black and whites for fun.  Lomography is the word.","I like the the idea that it uses a medium format film only because I am a first time user of of medium format film","I own several cameras including digital, and this little baby is for sure my favorite! Great price for a great camera","The foam that holds tension on the film came off after less than five rolls of film.  I have wedged a piece of folded paper between the film spool and the camera to maintain some tension on the spool.  The clamps holding the back on are easily removed allowing the film to become exposed.  However the price for the camera was very cheap.","A Christmas gift and already well used.  The grandchildren have been experimenting with the camera and have turned out so different pictures.","Gave it to my girl as a gift. She can't stop taking pictures and is very please with the Camara.","I bought this camera for a photo class. If unpredictability, light leaks, and multiple exposures is what you are looking for then this is the camera for you! I could not stand using this camera when I first got it. Why would I want to use something where I could not completely control the outcome? But I have learned that that is half the fun of using this camera!","I love this little camera. I have a roll of film in it and am using it sparingly.<br />The main issue is that I dropped it and the back came off so easily.<br />I have been told I should tape the back anyway, to prevent leaking.<br />But that's part of the fun of the camera.  It's exactly what it's supposed to be!","this is the go to for junk plastic cameras....i've been a pro since mid 80's..i worked a frame shop and a collage student brought in a print which i loved!!  it was taken with this baby...i was blown away...no nothing perfect, but thats why its such a beautiful machine..try it and youll love it...little hard to load the film but well worth it...esp if your a artist\"  buy one get some film and enjoy","Turned out to work great! Many people comment on how good my Holga is in my B&W film photography class based on the results.","I'm giving it a 4 star rating, But that doesn't mean that it performs like a Nikon. It just performs like a HOLGA. That's what I wanted when I bought it.","I collect and use Lomos, but the Casablanco is by far my favourite!!!  It ticks all the boxes for coolness factor, because it evokes mod-coolness and stands on its own as a work of art.  I also own the same model in black, along with a few others (and the Diana+ Dreamer).  I have captured some insanely cool shots and it is perfect for travel, because it is super light weight and compact enough to fit in my handbag.  NOTE:  If you are not familiar with limos, I suggest you do your research and look for tips, bc lomos expose film to light \"by accident\" (which is what makes them cool and experimental), I always have black photo tape on hand to cover the back of my cameras, but this also blocks the frame counter, so you have to get use to winding your film \"in the dark\" so to speak, lol.","I definitely love this camera. I used to do film photography for years and so I got this as a knockaround camera to start doing it again. The only issue I have with this camera is that the film I bought (35mm) did not fit and I had to buy the adapter kit to make the film useable. Really sick looking and I am excited to develop my first role,","It's a gift for my frd and she loves it!! it is a cute camera with a reasonable price :)","I was intrigued with this Holgawood, that sells for $5 than the basic N model. It's exactly the same, plus the different look helps a ton when you have a full flotilla of Holgas--it's an easy way to distinguish it in the bag","Cool looking plastic, toy camera. Photos are wonderfully imperfect, just as they should be with a plastic lens & body... Fun, inexpensive way to get into medium format photography and free up your artistic expression... Get one NOW!","For me the question wasn't \"should I get a Holga?\", but \"which Holga should I get\".<br /><br />There's a bunch of options but I decided on this one based on the reviews and price.  The only thing really missing is a flash, But I already had a Holga flash I bought previously for my other Lomo cameras.<br /><br />For the price, this is a great toy.  It's easy to load/use, and takes great shots.  In my opinion, you really can't get duplicate Holga shots with a camera phone and filter application.<br /><br />If you're interested in Lomography, I'd highly recommended starting with this camera.  It's so simple to use.","What can you say.  It's a Holga.  Forces you to stop thinking about your gear and settings, and forces you to think about your composition.  Also, because you're shooting film, every click counts.  So, you can just shoot burst mode, until you find a shot you like.  Forces you to slow down.","I love my Holga!  It has quickly become the favorite toy camera my collection, and not just because of the groovy color.  Why, you ask?  Beautiful photos, light enough to carry anywhere, fits well in the hand, easy controls.","I have shot many rolls through this plastic wonder-machine. It was my first \"Toy-Camera\", not counting the 110 cameras I have owned since the 70's (and still with them).  I was intrigued by the whole idea of simple.  I bought mine when they were just $15.  At twice the price, they are a great deal. I read all the reviews, read the \"tricks\".  I use heavy duty rubber bands to tighten the back, keep light leaks out and to prevent the back from falling off during shoots.  I have never experienced a light leak.  I load the film in the shade, have not had any problems.  I did add some felt (self-sticking) to the bottom of the supply chamber to make the roll taught during film advance.  My results have been fantastic.  I just shot a roll of color 120 of my grandson at the park; the pics are almost Pro-quality--vivid.  The colors really pop (and I was using a decade-old 120 color Kodak film, but kept it frozen).  These are fantastic cameras to learn the basics of photography.  Part of the fun of taking photos (in years prior to digital) is to properly compose your shot, being aware of all lighting situations.  This camera will teach that to anyone, young and old.  I understand the convenience of digital, but there is no joy in it.  Too easy.  Analog photography puts joy into a photo shoot.  This camera is a classic.  I hope film manufacturers will indulge us a while longer.  Get it.","I love my Holga, or Holgas as I have 2. I fell in love with one of these babies many years ago when I learned one of my favorite photo prints from an art show was taken with a Holga! I will admit I don't use it that much, perhaps most likely due to the fact that there aren't any labs around anymore and I usually shoot more 35mm than 120. However, when I do use it, I love it!<br /><br />Likes: Lightweight, easy to use, all you need is film and some tape (to block out any lightleaks if desired). I LOVE the vignetting, the softness in certain areas, the way it feels so vintage with the ability to create a beautiful work of art. I've used the 16 exposure mode but prefer the square images so I normally shoot only 12 exposures. I love being able to capture decent indoor portraits when I added a simple inexpensive \"Holga flash\" it's tiny and lightweight but it can produce enough light to create a great image. I like that this camera forces me to think alot more than I would if I were simply shooting digital. I only take a photo when I'm sure it's exactly what I want. There have been mistakes here and there but hey, it's how we learn what works for each individual type of toy camera.<br /><br />Dislikes: I honestly have none except it's sad so many good labs are no longer around. Most ppl who shoot film nowadays either spend alot on pro labs or in shipping it elsewhere to a good lab in another state. This is my only dislike which has nothing to do with the holga but with processing film.<br /><br />I recommend the holga to anyone getting their feet wet with lomography and toy cams. It probably won't be your last purchase!<br /><br />**Update 9/26/15**<br />After owning the Holga for some time I realized something. It has become my FAVORITE plastic camera. I've gotten to know it really well so now it's almost 2nd nature for me. I've used slide film and BW and color and it does fantastic with all. It's fun to shoot long exposures with B mode or multiple exposures. Overall I find it pretty easy but realized it was a bit daunting at first because I didn't really \"understand\" my Holga yet. I actually bought the Holga 35mm BC version so I can shoot 35mm film and it's just as lovely actually. But I love squares the most! Also, I have found 2 labs that do great work & are reasonable. Dwayne's Photo & Thedarkroom.com I am sharing these because it's been the hardest venture trying to find a decent place to do processing of 120 with prints and/or digital scans that offers quality work at a decent price. It's nice to support a business that keeps film lovers happy.","This camera was a gift and the person was really happy with it, that's why I'm giving it 5 stars. I haven't really used it myself but if the person that got it likes it, that's enough for me.","perfect camera for pinhole. get 35mm adapter kit and cable release and record everything. once you get exposure time down, nice images will follow.","I love the Holga.  I got another one from Amazon before - the color flash one, and I love it.  My son wanted one, so I decided to go $10 cheaper and get this for him.  Both of us love it - the camera itself and the results.","a toy camera that will introduce you to the world of old school photography.. does not need a battery. and i bought a cheap flash and it works on this camera! really fun","I am new to film photography in general and am pleasantly surprised by some of my photos. Since Holga is made for 120 mm film, keep in mind modifying some parts of the camera is expected to fit a regular 35mm film inside. My Holga came with a really creative guide book that described (with pictures) how to insert different films, how to modify the camera, where to put tape for less color leaks, and fun facts about the Holga that helped me take better photos. You can stick it in your pocket and pull it out when you get confused. Color leaks and image flaws make the Holga special. Some of my photos turned out very artistic and dreamy.<br /><br />One last thing, if you do not have soft foam to put inside your camera to fit a 35mm film, cut up a sanding block nail buffer and make sure every side has a soft surface. They are extremely inexpensive and effective.<br /><br />Hope this helped! :)","Or Mary.  Or Elvis.<br /><br />Yes, I'm giving five stars to this seriously cheap camera.  First, it takes medium format film, which gives you so much more detail and richness than 35 mm.  Then, it captures the picture through a plastic lens that fails to fill the complete area of the film, giving the enlarged picture a retro, vignetted look.  Light leaks past the back door frame and exposure window will add strange bright patterns to the exposure, and if you don't want strange ghosts floating through your pictures, simply line the frame and window with some electrical tape.<br /><br />But the ghosts are sometimes cool and add a little artistic flare to things like landscape shots.<br /><br />Other artistic shots are possible like double exposure--you just don't advance the film.<br /><br />This is a fun, cool little gadget that is customizable, upgradable, modifiable, and affordable.","Yes, it's suppose to be a crappy camera and take crappy pictures; and it does. First thing I did was to tape it together!  I got it in order to make me take my time and look at things in a different way. Still working on that one. Enjoying the process.","I bought this to use in my photography class since we're starting to learn about film. It's a great camera to use if you aren't used to 120 film, and I've enjoyed it so far.","This plastic Holga Cam is a great toy camera. It's fun to use and has made a great addition to my toy camera collection.","As far as basic cameras go, this is about as basic as you can get besides pin-hole cameras. It is cheap plastic but is light weight and gets the job done. Great for film beginners.","This product is amazing if your just looking to have a good time with photography. this camera is not accurate or predictable in snapping shots.The key with this product is to expect the unexpected with your photographs and if you embrace that mentality then you will never be disappointed.","Holgas are known for being toy cameras and that's what it is. a Toy Camera. Don't expect clarity and sharp images. Its going to be foggy, a little out of focus with heavy vignetting. It's fun with lighting in the sun. i use a wireless trigger to set off the flash and i love it. It does double exposure. I wouldn't even bother trying to focus with it its fin wide open. Its a conversation starter and customization. I've added Velcro to hold it shut and a 52mm lens on front to use filters.","stylish fun camera, its a blast to add to the collection too! great to have adds a cool classic holga effect to all of your pictures!","This thing really got me back into photography.  I've been working as a professional photographer for the last few years in the world of digital, which has become quite routine and often boring.  I picked up this toy camera as a way of getting into film photography for the first time and to my surprise, it totally shifted the way I took pictures and reminded me of what I loved about photography in the first place.  Often times you get images that look more like paintings than photographs.  I also began developing my own film and printing in the darkroom, opening up a whole new world.  I really enjoy the imperfect pictures that it takes and b/c the aperture and shutter are fixed, you have to find new ways to make the picture interesting.  No more relying on fancy lens' with zooms, forget about focusing, all you've got is a pastic box with a hole in the middle, now make it happen!  You'll be surprised at what turns up in the dark!","Nothing but a great product, totally recommended...do no think twice before buying this product since you will not regret it.","I guess I am just used to SLR's but I have had really crappy luck with this camera.  First time I left it on the bulb setting somehow, second time the lens cap was left on!!! I know I'm the idiot who did these things but I have already ruined two rolls of film with this thing.  We'll see how number three turns out.","This is not a camera for everyone.<br />At this day and age this camera is basically for those with their own darkrooms or those teenagers<br />fortunate enough to be enrolled into a photography course in school.<br />This is a plastic camera with its own little flaws that actually become perks in their own.<br />The reason this isn't for everyone is because it uses 120 size film, which 95% of places do not<br />develop anymore. Which doesn't mean you can't send it off to a lab, but in my eyes that's just not<br />cost efficient. Plus there's a certain joy myself and other photographers take in developing film by hand.<br /><br />Some of the flaws/perks:<br />This camera allows light to leak through to the film, which actually has a desirable effect. Film isn't<br />ruined but the corners of all the pictures are darkened. Instagram probably wouldn't be as fun without this<br />camera along with the Diana Plastic Camera. Shoot Instagram might not even exist!<br />The lens is made of plastic, so pictures won't be extremely sharp.<br /><br />In all, I would recommend this camera for anyone that does photography as a hobby and has access to a darkroom.","I'm a photo student. I'm studying everything about photography. I'm not an urban hipster. I don't look like an urban hipster. I have absolutely no inherent \"lo-fi\" photography bias due to some sort of artsy hipster social background. It's just something that I'm messing with because I'm sleeping, eating, and breathing all sorts of photography 24-7.<br /><br />I bought this because it's the prototypical \"crappy toy camera\" and I wanted to see what I could do with it's limited capabilities. It's part of an optional assignment and I'm playing with film right now, so why not.<br /><br />The first thing that everyone should know is that this is not really a toy or an inexpensive alternative camera, but rather a modern \"remake\" of a primitive camera intended to allow those who understand, or are learning to understand, the photographic process in detail to reproduce certain \"vintage\" photographic styles and push the limits of what can be done with primitive technology.<br /><br />The Holga 120N has the following features for \"advanced\" photographers:<br /><br />- They use medium format 120 roll film. This is film that is a little more than 6cm wide... it is NOT 35mm. Normally this film is used in expensive Hasselblad or Mamiya cameras and is thus not usually sold at drug stores and gas stations. Not every photo lab will process it.<br /><br />- There IS a \"bulb\" exposure mode, which means that you can keep the shutter open as long as you keep holding down the shutter button. You have to know what you're doing with this or all you'll do is waste a shot of film.<br /><br />- Whether \"bulb\" mode is turned on or off, there's nothing stopping you from exposing the film multiple times without advancing the roll. There's also nothing stopping you from advancing the film too far, too little, or never advancing it at all. Other than the little window on the back, and perhaps counting the clicks of the film winder, there's nothing to tell you how far to turn the thing to get to the next unexposed frame. There's absolutely nothing to tell you if the current frame has already been exposed.<br /><br />These are all things that can be exploited by advanced photographers to create interesting effects, but for anyone else they're just annoying hazards.<br /><br />Limitations of the camera that can only be overcome by a somewhat knowledgeable photographer in most situations:<br /><br />- There are only two aperture settings. To make things worse, the f-numbers that these supposedly correspond to (supposedly f/8 for \"sunny\" and f/11  for \"cloudy\" or whatever that icon is supposed to be) are reportedly bogus. They may not be accurate from camera to camera, depending on when it was made. Reportedly all you ever get is f/13, though supposedly on some newer ones the switch actually does do something or the other.<br />- There's only one shutter speed not counting \"bulb\" mode: 1/100s<br />- There's no way to focus visually with the viewfinder and with apertures like f/8 or f/11 the focus ring has to be set somewhat intelligently to have any chance of getting a subject within the in-focus depth of field.<br />- Aside from using bulb mode or multiple exposures in some situations, you have practically no control of the exposure aside from film ISO and push/pull processing.<br /><br />If you don't know what I'm talking about, but do want to learn then great! If you don't know and don't care then you probably don't want to buy this camera.<br /><br />The charming lo-fi features of the camera:<br /><br />- It has a simplistic high-dispersion plastic lens that softens focus the way transparent plastic does and does little or nothing to correct for the various optical distortions caused by simple spherical single-element lenses. If you're not trying to intentionally take photos with these properties then for the same money you can get a camera with a more modern design that at least has a lens made of glass.<br />- There's little or nothing in the design to prevent light from reflecting off of slick surfaces inside the camera, contaminating the film with random reflections.<br />- The gaps between parts (like the back and the rest of the camera) aren't sealed particularly well, so light leaks through and reflects off of surfaces, contaminating the film with stray light.<br /><br />Some tips for those using these for the first time:<br /><br />- Tape down the sliding things that lock the back on after loading the camera. The back will come open way too easily if you don't. Light leaks may be hipster cool but having the back come off just results in totally ruined film.<br />- Light will leak through the little frame number view window (red plastic) in the back and contaminate regular panchromatic film (which responds to red light). How bad this is depends on how bright the ambient light is, and whether or not you're using one of the included (6x6 or 6x4.5) film masks. You can either ignore than and get the hipster light leaks, or you can cover the red window with tape. If you cover it then you can either open it up briefly under subdued light to see when you've advanced the film one frame, or you can figure out how many \"clicks\" of the winder need to go by before one frame has advanced and count those when winding.<br />- You may want to write \"1/100s\" and \"f/8 - f/11\" on the camera to remind you of what the aperture settings and shutter speed are if you actually believe what the manual says they are.<br />- You may want to write the approximate focus distances corresponding to each of the icons on the focus ring. I wrote my own focusing scale on the thing using a silver paint marker.<br />- Use the light meter in a manual mode camera to give you an idea of what sort of lighting conditions are going to work with f/8 and 1/100s with the ISO of film you have in the thing. There's probably no point in walking around metering for every shot, but you should at least get some idea if your film is going to require direct sunlight, shade on a sunny day, work ok with overcast sky, or work inside in rooms with lots of of windows on sunny days. Even at ISO 3200, bright artificial office lighting probably won't be enough for indoor conditions.<br />- If possible, try to shoot a whole roll of film in approximately the same lighting conditions so you can push/pull process the film to compensate for over/underexposure. For example, if you know that bright office lighting won't quite be enough but you want to try it anyway, shoot the whole roll under that lighting so you can push process the film (to get a higher effective ISO out of it).<br /><br />Overall I'd say, not bad for $30 if you want to be able to do some of the things that the lack of \"idiot proofing\" features allow and you want to recreate some lo-fi effects, but don't waste your money on the camera, film, and processing if you don't know what you're getting into. These things are also great for making your own modifications since the worst you can do is destroy the thing, losing $30.","The holga is a pretty cool way to experiment with 120mm film, also a significantly less expensive way. That being said the pictures are obviously not going to be super high quality. I like it because i do my own printing and it's fun to play with the images. If you're looking for a camera that takes excellent pictures, this isn't the camera. Also if you do not do your own printing and developing, 120 film can be very expensive to have developed and printed if you can even find a place that will do it. Any good photo lab will do it for you, however i don't think any 1 hour photo places will. Overall, it's a fun camera and for 30 bucks there's not much to complain about, sometimes you even get a pretty cool shot, but don't expect pro quality.","I grew up with 35 mm, but I was still so little that I didn't fuss with cameras much until the late 90's.  By then it was all about digital.  I always wanted a Polaroid.  Probably the only camera I was interested in when I was 10.  I never got one so this baby is my stand in.  While it's very different from a Polaroid, I really like the Holga.  I think what attracts me the most is that it is so different from digital pictures, very old school feel and you never know what to expect.  Unless you're a pro, I suspect.<br />Not every Holga picture comes out like I hope or expect, but on the upside, the surprise of how well some of them come out makes me feel awesome.  Definitely a play camera.  I recommend a tripod if you're shaky.  I don't have a steady hand, so I have to really concentrate before I click otherwise my pictures come out blurred.<br />I was proud of my very first roll.  I had some pictures that didn't come out due to bad lighting, and I expected that.  But I had some surefire winners!  I'll have to post some on here.<br />For development I use Walmart (who sends the film out to Fuji).  Price for color film developed and with prints runs around $2.50 and B&W runs about $10 -here in Houston, TX.  I would prefer to use a local professional, but I really can't afford those prices.  They would have to be for special occasions only.  An extra tidbit if you decide to use Walmart is that the print size is the cutest, most perfect size for scrapbooking.","I was made to order a Holga film Camera for my photography class, and I nearly flipped when I found this one.  It uses wide film which is easier to develop and the detail in the photos it takes is amazing for such an inexpensive camera.  Its four aperture settings make focusing easy and fairly precise, and its lighting options make it perfect for making pictures anywhere.  I definitely feel like this was a great investment and look forward to continuing experimenting with this camera even after my photography class is finished.","I purchased this camera for a course in photography but it's something that will last me a long time. Very simple to use, very cute (although you should be prepared for people to ask if it's a toy...), and worth the money. I would recommend purchasing it with Kodak ISO 400 tri-x film. I've found that to be the best!","I love this camera...It's cheap and it takes some pretty cool old-school style photos...Great Lomo camera...Very happy with my purchase!","After reading everything I could get my hands on about the 120 medium format film 'plastic' Holga cameras and the advantages of the newer 120N model (since 2009) improvements,  I thought this \"Holgawood\" would include the two 'distinct' aperture settings.  Well, it doesn't.  Contrary to what the enclosed manual would indicate, the aperture settings should be roughly f/11 for sunny and f/8 for cloudy conditions.  Sun and Cloud settings are exactly the same in my camera, (the utterly useless swinging arm for the sunny aperture is a rectangular shaped window that is larger than the stationary aperture for cloudy).  What's with that???.  The other improvements are a centered tripod mount socket on the lens housing (not camera body) and a wider shutter arm, both of which are present with my camera.<br /><br />I purchased this \"Holgawood\" camera for $39.99 hoping that the extra $10 bucks (from base price) included 'all' newer upgrades along with the optional color choices.  I am disappointed with the single aperture setting, thus the 4 star rating.  I previously read through all that I could find in terms of customer reviews to these newer Holgas and no one mentions the internal specs to their given model, so I took a chance. :/  I would like to find a Holga 120N that does in fact have the two distinct apertures, a significant improvement IMO.  On-line product descriptions and included manuals have proven worthless!<br /><br />I do love the violet/purple color of my plastic camera, however, and the randomness in final photo results I find both fascinating and charming.  I removed the frame insert to increase vignetting as I prefer the 6x6 format.  The scarcity of 120 film processing with regard to the limited 12 exposures each roll yields gives pause to really consider what you are photographing.  Quite a contrast from today's DSLR camera with instant playback and continuous shutter release on a 32GB memory card.","I really enjoyed taking photos with this camera.I needed this camera for my intro to imaging.<br />It took good photos, easy to load film.","I ordered this camera to play around with and too use in school. i got it and i was so happy it arrived i opened it and it was in perfect condition and after developing my first role of film i noticed there were no light leaks. the pictures cam out so sharp i love this camera so much <3","If you approach this camera with the right attitude, you won't be disappointed.  Its fun going back to a simple, non-digital camera and not knowing how each shot will turn out, if at all.  I took this camera to Coachella (oh the irony) and it ended up producing a bunch of great shots.  If you're willing to lay down the bucks to get the film processed.  I brought it to my local camera shop and got a little gauged.  I can see myself using it for special occasions.","i own every version of the Holga 120 (120N, 120FN, 120CFN, 120GCFN, as well as a 120S and a WOCA 120GF), but the Holga 120N is still the best.  this is the classic Holga experience, and a great intro camera for those new to medium format toy cameras.<br /><br />the hot shoe makes adding a flash very easy.  i prefer the 120N with a detachable color gel Holga Flash over the 120CFN.<br /><br />this Holga comes with the 6x6 mask, which will prevent most light leaks.  if you want light leaks, remove the mask, but note that the interior edges of the camera might scratch the film.  you can tape over the edges to prevent this.<br /><br />you really can't go wrong with this camera.","Like I said I love this camera! It works perfectly like a Holga should and looks freaking awesome while doing so. Seriously, why would someone buy a plain black Holga when they can have a GOLD one?<br />It's also awesome that it has a hot shoe for a flash because if you plan on taking any pictures inside you will either need 12 lamps or to get a flash.","Absolutely everyone should have a Holga! They are fun cameras, and give a completely different perspective on shooting. There are no comparisons to Point and Shoot cameras, nor to DSLRs. These are made from lightweight plastic, also referred to as toy cameras, but they take extremely unique shots, and no shot is ever alike. In fact, each roll is very different, depending on how (or if) you tape the camera up (it takes seconds, but you can use duct tape to keep more light out to change/improve picture quality/effects). I spray painted the interior of mine matte black as well (after taping up the glass) to help reduce light, and I am glad I did this. This seemed to help. Film is easy to find online, but depending on your location developing the film could be an issue (not impossible, but still an issue). Both color and black and while turn out lovely and unique.<br /><br />This camera will change the way you see photography, no matter if you are a novice or an expert (I fall somewhere in between). Also, this purple Holga is from a limited edition line, and the color is gorgeous, even better than it looks in picture. I found purple duct tape, which is slightly darker purple to put on the back of the Holga, and it looks really awesome! I am so glad I got this camera! The only thing I have noticed is that the plastic over the Holga sticker has lost some of its sticky and is beginning to peel, but I do drag it around a lot - but really no big deal. This camera is FUN fun FUN!","This plastic camera is a lot of fun to play with. One great thing is that it's very light. way less than a pound. Best of all, it's expendable. I've been wanting to shoot medium format film while rock climbing but  I will NOT take my hasselblad on a multi-pitch route. If this toylike camera gets busted, I'm only out $30.","Definitely a camera for experimental fun, but be prepared because it's not cheap! I recommend practice with regular film first, and then head towards instant film once you've gotten the knack of the camera. You'll get a lot of various shots depending on exposure times and lighting.<br /><br />Really light weight because it's plastic, but a little bulky. Still great fun!","It's a Holga, it's plastic, there are light leaks. What more is there to say? If you're new to the world of Holga's, it's important to note that these photos are supposed to have light leaks, vignetting and the like. Make sure you buy some electrical tape to seal of crazy leakage when you take your Holga out, find websites that will guide you through various Holga mods and go to town. I specifically bought this one because it doesn't have a flash. When I need a flash, I found some old one lying around my house and it works just fine. My only complaint is that after about three months of use the styrofoam pads on the inside came loose and tried to wind into my film, which happened when I was traveling, but with a Holga you can mod or fix anything and it's all about the adventure of plastic fantastic!","If you like to experiment with photography, this is the camera for you!!!  Don't expect razor sharp photos from this baby - it's all about the art.  Different types of film can yield drastically different results.  It's fun to load up some film and snap away.  Go for it!!!!","This little plastic camera is a must for any film photographer. I have two of them. It's lightweight, small, and can take great pictures. I've used this for everything from landscapes, to portraits, to shoots with a professional lighting setup. The \"hot\" shoe on top DOES work so long as you have an external power source for the flash. I love the simplicity of the camera, in that pretty much any \"ailment\" can be fixed with some electrical tape. It's possible to rig the camera up to take 35mm film with some tape and pieces of sponge. This camera has a great ability to make things looks very surreal and/or ethereal. It is also good if you're going for that \"hipster\" style of photo. If you get a tripod and some 100 speed film it can create absolutely beautiful prints.<br /><br />With a little bit of practice it's easy to guess the focus (which is labeled with either one person, three people, a group of people, or mountains) and get as crisp of shots as you can really hope for with a plastic lens. The plastic adds a soft look, but it's still in focus and the softness can really add to the image. The vignetting is controllable in that if you take out the little frame in the camera, you get more light leaks and vignetting. With some electrical tape the vignetting can be decreased. The viewfinder is totally useless, and I highly recommend you just toss the lens cover since it's very easy to forget it's there and wind up with a blank roll. This camera is set up to be used with a tripod and flash if you want, and because it takes 120 film, you'll be able to get smoother photos than with 35 mm.<br /><br />The simplicity and lack of features makes it very easy to experiment with pictures. You can overlap frames, double exposures are a snap, and there are only two shutter speeds. N for normal (approx. 1/100th of a second, plenty fast for handheld) or B for bulb (meaning you can hold it open). This camera is great for capturing motion because shooting in bulb is so easy. The plastic lens gives a soft feel to everything so the shake from holding your camera and bumping it around a bit can actually add to the feeling of movement. The camera claims to have two apertures (cloudy and sunny), but it really doesn't. It stays at f/11, or possibly f/8 depending on your camera.<br /><br />In short, this is one of the best film cameras you can find and anybody can get amazing and interesting shots. I highly recommend it. It can be a little frustrating with the lack of control at first, but after several rolls it becomes second nature.","This is the second time I bought a Holga. My first one unfortunately was lost while moving. I chose the one without a flash this time because as opposed to the 120CFN (with the flash), I found that the flash function is not needed. Pictures taken inside will not turn out well with or without flash unless you are looking for this extreme look of indoor depth.<br />Also love the color!","This is a great little plastic camera that is tons of fun to shoot and has taught me much about photography in the process.  Because the only real flexibility with the camera is your film choice and all its other parameters are pretty much fixed, it really forces you to think more about the photo itself and less on the technical specs of the camera resulting in better images.  It's so refreshing to not have to scroll through pages and pages of menus on a little LCD screen to set up a shot.  Despite being labeled as a toy camera and often described as a poorly constructed piece of crap (which is true to a degree), if you can understand the very basics of how a camera functions and apply it in your shots, you can take some unbelievable pictures with this thing.  And because you don't get an unlimited number of shots like digital, you'll end up with far fewer crap shots taking up space on your hard drive.  For less than the price of a spare digital camera battery, you really can't go wrong going Holga.<br /><br />Oh- if you plan on shooting some black and white, consider learning how to develop the film yourself.  It's not that difficult and will save you loads of money in the long run.<br /><br />Update 8-29-11:<br />After having had this camera for well over a year now, it has become my favorite tool for capturing memorable photos.  After slowly learning the intricacies of my camera (they're all slightly different from what I hear), I can reliably take pictures with confidence that they'll turn out more or less as intended.  During my last few vacations, the shots from this beast have consistently been my favorites; I'm convinced that it's due to the fact that this camera forces you to be creative in order to overcome its technical limitations.  Highly recommended.","This is actually my second Holga.  I bought this one so that I can have two different types of film loaded at any given time.  It's just as good as my first one, but like all Holgas it has its own personality different from my first Holga.  They're light enough that I don't feel too weighed down having two on me, and with two I get to have one loaded with 35mm without having to find a darkroom if I want to keep shooting, I just load the second one with the regular 120mm.<br /><br />The different colored bodies are fun too.  I take them to fairs and other events and I get a lot of questions and comments on the camera, if not just a funny look or two hehehe.  I think most of the time people expect water to shoot out of the lens or something.<br /><br />All of this and I get some striking and unique images you could never get from a digital without some serious photoshopping, and at only $40 why not?<br /><br />One word of advice though to first time Holga purchasers.  This camera craves sunlight, so even if you are in a well lit indoor area, use a flash or a tripod on the long exposure B setting, otherwise you will end up with a roll of underexposed duds.","Okay so I have to confess I bought this item because the name of it was 'pretty in pink' and that's one of my favorite 80's movies! I am a photography enthusiast and for my college classes I had to experiment with this little camera, when I first got it I laughed because its pinker then the picture let me say the image on the site dose not do it justice its Pepto-Bismol pink color which I love! I usually shoot pinup style, and portraits of people so the Holga was a new way to make my subjects interesting, there is a medium amount of light leakage around the back if you like the effects that it gives you then I say go for it but if you are like some that dont want any light leakage on your photos i would say get some electrical tape and tape around the back where you load the film. if you are a protectionist and want sharp images this is not the camera for you!!! Its a total manual camera meaning you have to slide the negative with the little knob at the top and you'll want to be careful not to expose the negative twice...I did and where as it wasn't the desired intentions the result was some interesting images. The settings on the camera dont really make much of a difference as well you get the same result every time almost its really a hit or miss kinda camera,it's like a water color painting you have to try and not control the mistakes and go with it! I loved working with the camera and cant wait to play with it some more, and if you dont remember any advice i give you then remember this one thing. on the back there are two numbers on the back if you are shooting in 12 (as in size of the plastic frame that is inside meaning the one that is in there when it comes to you) then the arrow on the little viewer to see what number picture you are taking must always be pointing at 12, same for if you are shooting in 16 the arrow must always be pointing at the number or the pictures will over lap!","I bought this camera to take with me on my trip to Europe. I bought black and white film and also color film to use in it. When I received the camera in the mail, one side of the camera (where you open it to put the film in) was broken. It's the same part of the camera that the strap is attached to, so I couldn't wear it around my neck- otherwise the camera would fall right off. The good thing is that you are supposed to tape the camera's edges so less light leaks through. So once I taped it up, the strap worked fine. It's a $40 camera, so I guess I shouldn't have expected it to be extremely durable. Also, it cost me about $25 to develop each roll of film- not including prints! So taking a lot of pictures got really expensive really fast. Needless to say, I was very satisfied with the pictures and they turned out way better than I thought they would.","I've done a few modifications to my holga already to make it more my style.  It was easy to do and the results are exactly what I was hoping for!  Holga is pretty fab!","There is no need to go on here and talk about Holga cameras, Holga culture, or toy cameras in general as there is plenty available on internet. It shoot 120mm film and it does a beautiful job for what is; an all plastic camera. I also  want to add that The Commando version of this classic camera is a pleasure to own...it attracts a lot of attention and is always a conversation piece and hey, how many out there can say they own a camouflaged camera?","I was getting bored of my DSLR. Then someone told me in passing about this little joke of a camera, The Holga. I started researching this camera, bought one, and started playing. I have never had so much fun with photography in my whole life. I take it EVERYWHERE with me. I hear people say as I walk away, \"did you see that girl's camera?\" \"What? That was a camera?\" No one takes it serious. which means people are more okay with you having fun around them, snapping candids, etc. I love my Holga. She is my new best friend, my new eyes, and she goes everywhere with me! You don't have to be as obsessed as me, but if you're looking to have a little fun with your photography, if you feel locked into this perfect digital world of ours, get the holga and have fun with her. You won't regret it.","Ok, so it's not a dirty adult toy, but one of my favorite toy cameras. I was used to using a Diana camera but this is much easier and feels like it won't fall apart. I recommend it for the person who wants to begin in lomography type cameras.<br />The only thing I don't like about it is it's so expensive to develop the film, but it's totally worth it!","It's such a cute little/big camera, I want to say little but it's actually bigger than I thought it'd be. It's just so much fun taking pics with and I've found getting 120 film developed isn't as expensive as I once thought it'd be, it's actually cheaper to get done than 35mm depending on where you take it. For example WalMart's drop off service box can get ti done fair cheaply, while at the same time 35mm seems to cost quite a bit there. Either way this camera is loads fun and I can't wait for spring and summer to get to use it even more.","I've heard so much about Holgas so I purchased one to see what they are all about. When i received my first prints i was impressed with the quality of the photos. It now sits in my bag next to my 500D & X-700... next item for my holga is a fish eye lens....","Great camera purchased for my Girlfriend for christmas, however the lens cover was broke.  Other then that great camera.","I bought this camera to play around with in addition to my digital camera and am pleased with it thus far. It's a cheap quality camera so it feels like a toy more than a real camera when you are shooting pictures. It does have light leaks that can produce a unique vignetting effect or can completely wash out the photos. Because of this and the uniqueness of the manufacturing, it can come up with some pretty unpredictable results! If you don't like the effect, it's simple to tape up the sides of the camera. It can use 35 mm film if you adjust the insides a bit, but it usually uses a 120 medium format film. Depending on where you live, it might be hard to find a specialty photography shop to develop your film. It doesn't come with a flash, but this can be bought separately. You can't adjust the focus or the shutter speed either. Since you manually turn the film after each exposure, you can do a neat layering effect on each photo. You can also add color filters to try different effects. It's an interesting camera to experiment with. You won't be able to see the picture immediately after taking it, the same as any film camera. There are other medium format cameras that produce more reliable results, but I recommend this camera for beginners. Also, the picture quality can't compare with digital, but for as cheap as it is, it's worth it if you're interested in some fun pictures. I've only developed one roll of film so far and only three pictures turned out, so I'm not sure if it's the photo shop I went to or if I overexposed the film. They turned out pretty cool, though. They had a kind of pinhole camera quality.","This buy was one of the smartest decisions I've made. It's a great camera for stepping outside of the ordinary and expected. Every shot is an experiment in light, focus and personal style. I love my Holga and would greatly suggest one to a curious photographer, amateur or professional.","So much fun.  Highly recommend this product especially for all photographers because these toy cameras are inexpensive and offer so much: blurry pics, light leaks, multiple exposures, oh my!!!","These cameras are very artistic and unpredictable(in a very good way).  I get great results with them.  They are fun and easy to use.  You should deffinatly buy one if you are interested in photography.  They are must have.  And this company is the best.  Overall a great camera for artistic photographers or students wanting to experiment with the camera.","In an era when cameras are getting more and more complicated, when the upgrade cycle means built-in obsolescence for digital cameras within a year or two, when the emphasis is on increasingly incomprehensible \"menus\" of digital options, and mind-numbing hours playing with Photoshop, along comes the antidote in the most unlikely form: a cheap plastic camera that has virtually no controls, no settings, no predictability whatever. Welcome to the world of Holga. These delightful cameras bring the fun back to photography. All the features that one cannot get in even the most expensive cameras such as light leaks, severe vignetting, lack of sharp focus, accidental double exposures, and light weight are here! What other camera company makes flashes designed to severely tint the image in yellow or red glows? And of course, the sensor is film! No need to worry about ultrasonic cleaning of CCDs, CMOS, or any other electronic material. Each shot gets its very own sensor. Not satisfied that the light leaks are intense enough? No problem. Just make a tiny hole somewhere in the body! The images are unique and immediately recognizable as being from a Holga (even if the subject is totally unrecognizable). This is post-modern photography at its finest.","The world of photography has changed so dramatically over the last 6-7 years that its honestly hard to put it into words. For the average person digital photography is a welcome advance in technology. No longer having to buy film, being able to see the end picture immediately, being able to make prints on your home computer, being able to shoot with your cell phone, etc.. There are really a hundred and one reasons why most people love digital photography.<br /><br />There is another side to this coin however as there are those out there that do not like digital or what it has done to the entire field of photography over the last 5-10 years. I am one of those people. I absolutely love photography. Its not only my single favorite hobby, its also how I make my living. Its the entire process that I fell in love with, not just the end result. The loading of the film, the limited number of pictures per roll of film, the printing in a darkroom and most importantly the seemingly limitless creative aspects of film itself. There are so many things that you can do to alter the look of the film or print and I am sorry but running your picture through a filter in photoshop doesn't even begin to compare. The end result may appear similar but the process that got you there couldn't possibly be more different. I love the processes just as much as I do the end result and digital just doesn't even begin to compare.<br /><br />Anyways this is where camera's like the Holga and Diana come in. These are camera's for people who are in love with film and the different looks that film can give you. These are sometimes referred to as toy cameras however that does not take anything away from these cameras or their ability to take pictures. I have been using a Holga for over 10 years and I can tell you first hand that if you take the time to master these cameras, you can take absolutely stunning pictures. You don't need 20 MegaPixels and a Carl Zeiss lens to shoot amazing pictures. In fact you dont even need a lens if your shooting with a pinhole camera.<br /><br />Its nice to see that there are still people out there shooting with these kinds of cameras. There are even some that have given up shooting digital and come back to film. My hats off to those people because film is still where its at with photography. As for myself, I still shoot film 99% of the time and My Holga and Diana go pretty much everywhere I go. At around 40.00, you don't have much to lose in regards to trying them out.<br /><br />5 stars!","I'm never without my DSLR, but several photographer friends had recently been raving about the fun they were having with their Holgas. I had to have one. And I had to have the purple one!<br /><br />I was so anxious to finish my first roll of film with it. Known and loved for their imperfections, I couldn't wait to see what mine would do: blurs, vignetting, light flares? I got some great vignetting with mine!<br /><br />The camera is much lighter in my hands than I expected. It feels like a toy instead of a real camera, and it is! (I'm sure you know their story by now, so I'll spare you the history lesson.)<br /><br />One note: It does love a lot of light, none of the pictures that I took indoors really came out.<br /><br />My two cents: Buy it. Have fun with it!","In an age where digital is only getting sharper, bigger, better, and more expensive it's nice to get a HOLGA and not worry about anything but the picture.  I have a few of these and each one takes pictures differently and that's the beauty of it.  Just get one and see what you come up with. I know you'll be pleasently surprised.","Photog snobs love these, and I understand why.  Just don't trust your memories to it because every shot comes out looking different.","I love this camera, the nostalgia in the photos it produces, the vignetting and most of all, the square format - rebelling against all those digital wide-screen cameras.<br /><br />I still like using my digital camera but the Holga has reignited my passion for photography.<br /><br />And this camera costs less than 30 bucks!  You can't beat that.","The Holga is a medium format camera taking size 120 film. I has a single plastic lens and a plastic body with a shutter that is controlled by a single spring. It sounds like a piece of crap and it is. But you will be astonished that it will make such interesting photos and how creative you can be with it. Forget all you know about the technical side of photography when it come to the Holga. Just shoot and wind and be surprised by the results.","Great images, a fun take back to older times. This is a great camera for the professional photographer that just needs a break from it all. Just compose and shoot. One never knows what will happen.","This camera is great, but dont buy it if you are looking for a fancy camera!  The Holga is the absolute bare basics- its quite literally the simplest camera ever.  You should only buy this if you know and are expecting that...but the Holga is an awesome way to simplify your process and toss away the frills","This is my second Holga 120N. I really love using these cameras as a diversion from the now common world of digital cameras. Sure, I could get a better used medium format camera for about the same price without the problems of light leaks, soft focus, and harsh vignetting, but that is kinda the point, isn't it? It is fun to use and doesn't hurt to lose. Pick one up to maybe create something new out of very old technology.","I've been a Holga user for the past decade, and the 120N is definitely an upgrade (if you could call it that) from the older Holga 120S. Light leaks are part of the Holga's charm, but sometimes you want a nice, clean image. Unlike the previous generations of Holgas, I've never had to wrap the 120N in black tape.<br /><br />One caveat: always check your settings. Many times I've inadvertently slid it over to \"bulb,\" producing a very blurry picture. Unless you're in a very low light situation and you have a tripod handy, don't touch the bulb setting.","This is perhaps one of the funnest lomo cameras to use. I have a couple dislikes, though. (1) The back film door tends to come off due to the loose sliding clasps meant to keep it on. I'm not sure if the film used in these cameras is damaged by light, but I assume it is, and thus this can be a frustrating dilemma. I have taped mine shut and abandoned using the clips. (2) It's quite difficult to find someone to develop the film used in this camera.<br />A fun but moderately annoying camera.","This little gem is an adventure to operate! The only camera in the world where it's flaws are it's greatest attributes. Breakout from the boring rectangullar world of digital photography! this little beauty shows you a whole new world of photography!","This camera produces stunningly artistic photos when used outdoors in adequate light. Indoors it is virtually worthless, unless you use a flash. (It took me a little while to find an old flash that would sync right with this, incidentally; my $300 Nikon flash wouldn't work with it) Anyway this is actually made very well and I think made better than the Lomo LC-A, and I like the pictures from this better than the pictures from the $150-$200 Lomo LC-A.","If you are looking for a cheap, no nonsense medium format camera, this is the one for you. Ya, it still shoots actual film, but thats what its all about. No shutter speeds, no real focus, just aim and cross your fingers. [...]","The camera is exactly what I expected. Everything seems to work right, though I haven't had my first roll developed yet. It's all plastic, seems to be tough...came with a neck strap too. I bought the camera to modify into a pinhole camera, which I haven't done yet.","This is a lovely piece of plastic that allows you to do photography in the worst possible way, and the best possible way at the same time. I got three, one for a friend, one for another friend and one for me. It's true, I haven't gotten a good photo yet, but I haven't tried hard enough.","I guess it's just that -- just what I expected.  I love the Holga, but it's for fun and the unexpected, doesn't serve the same purpose as my Nikon D50. :)","the camera was exactly what they said it would be, in great condition, the item was shipped according to my request and everything went smoothly.","The logical progression from the original Holga 120S is this camera, the Holga 120N. It stays true to the original, but with some minor improvements:  a brass tripod socket, bulb exposure setting, and foam cushion film tensioner. It's got the same plastic lens, which captures the heart and soul of just about any photographic moment...try that with a digital! I suggest that you purchase two...one for color work, and one for black & white film. Also, get the optional 6x6cm frame mask to take advantage of the awesome vignetting.","Great camera for all levels of photographers. Unique style and results. You never know what your individual camera will provide. Overexposure and underexposure quality is expected and wanted with this fun camera. A little hard to find places that will develop film with ISO 120 but worth the prints when you can find a place.<br /><br />A must for all photographers to play with. A wonderful buy and worth the money.<br /><br />**Use caution when buying from Calumet! Banned from e-bay they are not the best of places to buy anything! Poor product quality and overpriced shipping are only two of the major problems. Please use caution.","This affordable toy camera is renowned by artists around the globe, and for good reason too!  Once you take this bad boy out of it's box and load your 120 film, the fun begins. It's small and light enough to bring it almost everywhere. The pictures that come out of this camera are something. Don't bother picking up some electricians tape because unexpected light leaks are always fun. Saturation, colour, and vignetting add to my love of this camera. Save yourself some money and pair this up with the Lomo Colour Flash. You can use it with your other cameras for extra fun! Double exposures are no problem, just click away without advancing the film.","It comes with a plastic lense, it takes 120 film, there's no flash, no light metering, no focusing. If you're not familiar with 120 film (not every pharmacy develops 120 film), then you should do a little research before you buy this camera ([...]). Most folks buy this as secondary camera, or just as a fun camera. The picture quality is different from camera to camera, and is not par with digitals. It does take unique shots, it is a cheaply priced camera, it feels cheap in your hands. I give it five stars, because for the price it captures my surroundings in a way that no digital can replicate."]},{"name":"LYTRO ILLUM 40 Megaray Light Field Camera","amazon_reviews":["First things first - if you're jumping on this as a cheap DSLR replacement, you're not going to be happy.<br /><br />If you're up for a new camera to play with and do lots of macro photography, shoot things with a lot of depth, and like experimenting with post-processing, then you'll love this camera.<br /><br />For me, it's a great camera that feels wonderful in the hand and encourages me to look at composition very differently.

Shoot first focus later...","I've been using this camera for about 9 months now after having purchased it from Woot (which Amazon owns). It's now cheaper than the price I paid, and I highly recommend it. It is assuredly *not* a primary camera, mainly because it doesn't have the resolution you'd want in a primary, but it is absolutely an excellent secondary/specialty camera.<br /><br />The camera build is exceptional for several hundred dollars. It has decent heft and good fit and feel. The display is large and easily readable, and there are a number of options available on it and, manually, on the camera itself. It's not quite on par with a high-end DSLR, but it's pretty well equipped in what it can do, certainly to the extent that you're going to want to explore it for a while before lugging it along on a trip - it'll do far more than it initially seems it can, but you need to know how to use the depth of field, etc. Most of what you know from other DSLRs will carry over, but not everything.<br /><br />Software is decent on the Mac and, from what I can tell, better on Windows (because the version there is a bit newer). Software support no longer exists, but what's there works fine. Yes, you won't have updates, but, then again, the camera is less than 1/5 it's original price, so there's that. I was able to do all I needed to do on my Mac.<br /><br />So... what's it good for? First, macros. You can actually touch the lens (if you're crazy enough to do so) to the object and still get an in-focus image. Insane. There is no \"too close\" for this thing. Yes, you'll want to adjust depth-of-field using the manual lens adjustment, but this gets crazy-good macro shots for the price of a decent macro lens.<br /><br />Second, depth-of-field shots. If something's close, and something else is far, and you either want to be able to show both, or nicely blur one or the other, this is your camera. You take the shot and decide in post where to focus and how much depth-of-field to allow.<br /><br />Third, following up on the last point, it's fun for creating animated shots, not only because you can animate the change of the field depth, but also because the large lens plus light-field capture means there's a slight 3-D to the image - you can play a bit with \"where\" the camera is located, and you can create a short movie (a few seconds) showing some movement. For example, start with a close-up shot of your cat, then move over a bit and focus back on the dog in the background.<br /><br />Fourth, you can host images for others to move around and play with - I'll post a link to one in the comments section. This hosting is free and easily done via the desktop or iOS smartphone app (no Android love, unfortunately).<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />This is no longer being made, so support will be limited. Software updates aren't going to happen. The lens is not removable. The camera is a bit large and a bit heavy. Resolution is around 4MP in rendered images, which is fairly low. You need to process images before uploading them to anything other than Lytro's site.<br /><br />But... it's under $300!! Seriously, buy this for the times you need its abilities. You have probably spent more on lenses you don't use. Spend a day learning its capabilities, and I'm certain you'll find a use for it.","There is no question that this camera is not for everyone.  But I have used and still have all the icon cameras going back to the '50s. I currently use an EOS full frame sensor with L lenses for most of my photos. But, for me, this is the bomb!  I'm over the pixel and resolution contest. This camera makes you think of perspective and how the human eye works. The simplest shots are interesting. I find you are drawn into the photo. Now I can't wait to go to the places I want to bring back live!","I haven't had the Illum very long but early impressions are quite positive. Before I go on there are some things to be aware of if you are considering purchasing the Lytro Illum (as in \"Illumination\"). #1 is that Lytro is getting out of consumer products so this camera is a dead end  as is the desktop software. That is why it is so cheap as of late 2016. The current stock is being sold off by various sellers and once gone that's it, no more enhancements or future versions (unless Lytro has a change of heart which seems unlikely). #2 If you do buy one get at least one extra battery with it because they are rapidly selling out. Other sellers such as B&H currently have them. #3 purchase this camera if you love photography, appreciate innovation and are willing to spend time on the learning curve. It's the furthest thing from a point and shoot camera and your good shots have to be thoughtful, well planned and it all works best if you watch the training videos and purchase the Kindle book (see below).<br /><br />FIRST IMPRESSIONS<br />The unboxing was a wonderful experience. The packaging exceeds anything Apple has done and the packaging created an extremely positive impression for me before I even saw the camera. It spoke care and quality to me. Some reviewers have complained about poor quality of the camera but my experience was exactly opposite. It is extremely well made and finished.<br /><br />The camera is impressive looking but large by many standards. On first picking it up it felt great in my hands, and yes, a bit heavy but not an arm buster by any means. The physical controls are minimalist with most of the controls being available from the touch screen. The battery took about 4 hours to initially charge in the standalone charger which is what the documentation said it would.<br /><br />I usually like to jump right in but I had read enough to know to take my time and get educated. Turning the camera on displays a screen chock full of icons and histograms. But the main histogram is focusing scale that was quite mysterious to me. But now, with some practice and patience it’s becoming understandable and very usable.<br /><br />After I verified the camera would turn on  I set it aside to do my homework.<br /><br />LEARNING<br />There are two learning resources that I found extremely helpful. One is the Kindle book entitled “Using Lytro Illum: A Guide to Creating Great Living Pictures”. The other is Lytro’s training videos. For some the videos may be sufficient. I needed to read the book and then I found the videos most helpful.  You can find the videos by doing a Google search for “lytro illum training videos”.<br /><br />USING<br />I’m still getting used too it and don’t yet have any photos I’d be proud to show anyone. But I’m coming along. As others have said these are not super high resolution photos by todays traditional camera standard. The Illum “Living Pictures” are really meant to be viewed on a screen vs. 2D printing. In addition, resolution is affected by various focus settings which can be optimized for the primary screen size you intend to view on (the book explains that well).<br /><br />I expect that as I become more familiar with the camera the less will be the time for me to “think about everything” just to take one shot. But on the plus side, just as with my conventional photography, I find that being thoughtful ultimately makes me a better photographer. That’s why I mostly use manual focus and manual settings on my conventional camera (a Sony A7ii).<br /><br />THE FUTURE<br />As I said at the outset, there is no future for this camera and the software that goes with it including the desktop and IOS applications. So if you by this you should understand what you're doing and accept that for any of a variety of reasons it will become obsolete and perhaps eventually unusable. I knew that when I bought it but was willing accept that future especially since the current prices are so reasonable, and I love photography and exploring all that it has to offer. It's because of the dead end that I gave it 4 stars, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I suppose Apple or some other genius manufacturer will eventually figure out how to provide equivalent capability in a phone but I didn’t want to wait.","WORKED GREAT BUT COULD NOT FIND PLATFORM TO MANIPULATE PHOTOS SO I COULD PRINT. I'LL WAIT FOR NEXT GEN","I got it for just over $300 and honestly I think that is probably still too much money for the camera given the limitations of it.  Do not expect to get photos you can print from it, the photos are not going to make print much beyond 4 X 6 size prints without showing the limitations of the camera.  It is probably making photos on par with an old point and shoot camera from 10 years ago.  Yes it is kind of neat to be able to shoot and change the focus after the fact, but you can't just aim and shoot and get decent results.  You still have to focus the camera because it will have a limited range of distances from which it will be able to give you sharp results after the photo is taken.  Also note the low light capabilities of the camera are very bad.  If you are thinking of this camera you have probably already been to the Lytro web page and looked at their gallery of photos.  Yes they have a few in low light that look pretty good... I have no idea how they managed that because my experience with low light has been absolutely horrible.<br /><br />I think I played with the camera a couple of weeks and it now sits on a shelf catching dust.  A nice idea but really not up to snuff.  It might be worth $100 just to play around with but $300 is too much for it.... also the battery life isn't that great.... oh and it gives you absolutely huge files I think the one's I've been getting are about 50 meg files... but that doesn't really mean you get 50 meg quality it is just the odd file format of the camera that takes a whole lot of data for what is probalby a 1.5 meg quality picture.","i buy many lytro .all of them have chinese .but  this one do not have the  option .please let me know  how to get  the chinese operating interface.","I found this camera a lot of fun. Is it perfect for professional work? No!<br /><br />I use for jewelry photography and have generally good results. Being able to edit focus and depth of field during editing is a great tool for me. I can use different settings for a more artistic, eye catching shot that highlights a certain detail or aspect of the piece or set it for crystal clear focus on the entire piece. This saves me a lot of time. However, I am using these pictures for websites or, at the most, small prints.<br /><br />I found the latest software update to be a lot more stable and fast than the previous versions, which has taken a lot of pain out of the process (no more software crashes during importing or processing). It has some good basic editing tools and can export various formats for other editors.<br /><br />The downside - what most annoys me is the exporting process can add a lot of noise to white surfaces (hello, statement silver cuff). This has rendered some pictures completely unusable to me. It is also both heavy and front heavy.","Great camera. Exceeds all expectations!","A number of reviewers have written about this camera's shortcomings; low (4 MP) equivalent resolution, quirky desktop software, and the limited use case for this camera. All of these are, in fact, issues. At its original price of $1,600, I couldn't justify buying it. But at $329, it seemed worth trying and I'm glad I bought it. I have only had it a few days and am still figuring out the best way to use its multi-focus technology, but I am very impressed with the underlying technology. If for no other reason, taking pictures with it and experimenting with different focus points (after the fact) is a great way to learn about depth of field and focusing my regular camera (Nikon D810). Are the photos as good as what the D810 produces, not at all. But I have, nonetheless, made some pretty good photos with it. Also, it is also very good at shots of detailed objects that I might otherwise need a macro lens for. Will I ever rely on it for shots I must have? No. But as a second camera in the bag, it's a great alternative and a lot of fun to play with.","its nee professional not  for beginner","looks sharp.","good product.","I bought it as a gift for my sister and she loves it","As expected","Really do what they said","Amazing stuff, my hubby liked it a lot. Recently, used it for the first time during my trip to Tibet and the pictures taken (or processed using Lytro Desktop afterwards) are terrific. Very much suit for somebody has no photography background at all.","Perfectly next gen!","Good camera for what it proposes to do.<br />I wish it were easier to work blur , but a lot depends on distances between objects and other factors that are not very clear , sometimes the effect does not happen , even though all right.<br />Forget using ISO above 200, a waste.<br />Not to print photos in larger sizes , it is for use in digital media.","Mostly a gimmick, the actual pixel count isn't very good.  It's fun to play with the depth of focus and even wiggle things a little, but the utility of producing still photos isn't great for my purposes (especially since the software didn't seem very intuitive although I admit I didn't play with it long since the system requirements precluded using it on my regular machine).  If you're making motion pictures, it might be somewhat useful...<br />It's a bit disappointing, since it's a cool idea.","I bought my first Lytro camera three years ago after seeing a classmate using one at a reunion.  I loved it, and endured the updates and trials the company had with getting a first Gen camera to work with the updates from Mac!  Despite the 'glitches', the first generation camera was a delight to work with so when I say this one at such an unbelievable price, I grabbed it!  I downloaded all the training videos and owners manual, and devoured them BEFORE I started taking pictures ... once I was familiar with the ILLUM and its controls, then -and ONLY then-- did I begin shooting.  I wanted perfect pictures from the start, but did not get them [my fault]. Once I tried a few more shots, experimented with the settings and taking several pictures of the same thing, THEN I became more adept at the depth- and Light-field phenomena.<br />I have been taking photo's since my first 620-film camera in the mid 60's, various fixed lens and slr's [film] through the 80's , and have been shooting digital since my first point-n-shoot in the early 90's.  THIS camera is totally different than anything I've experienced, and I'd strongly suggest learning about the peculiarities of depth of field, f-stops, etc., before investing in this.  But once you've learned -- get one!!  You won't regret it!","Great deal for 350.00 clearance price,  but you would be in tears if you paid 1600.00 list price. The camera is heavier than a DLSR and cumbersome to use in real life settings. With a stationary subject grouping, and on a tripod, it can give a very interesting result,  The IQ is good enough for an 8x 10 print if you dont; crop the subject. Its value as a camera is to force you to think differently about subject placement and depth of field. I though it was a good photography technique to learn.  The lens is a very fast constant apeture f 2 lens that is a nice feature.","Love this camera. But I warn you it is NOT a replacement for a DSLR it is a specialty camera that is designed for a particular concept.","Interesting and fantastically advanced toy but not really practical. It is heavy and the photos print poorly. Then again, printing the photos is not the point. Using the lytro software to play with the photos is great. I subtract one star because it is huge and heavy... A valid complaint but not a deal breaker.","What a spectacularly built and conceived product. awesome idea and faultlessly implemented. Shame is, the lack of adoption in the broader market but I love this thing and take it everywhere. I quite like the exclusivity of the product and it's user base although this is not ideal for the manufacture who needs more sales to justify the investments in new products and product updates. It has it's flaws like: Poor low light performance, memory hungry and chews up your hard drive when transferring and the transfer itself and image processing is low and frustrating. But like child birth (so my wife tells me) once the image is born and ready to been seen by the world you forget about all the pain bringing it to life.","I really wanted to like this camera. My main issue with it is that it's as large as my dslr and can not replace my dslr. It's just to large to justify adding to my kit.","If you haven't already researched this piece of tech, I urge you to do so. This isn't a typical camera. The pictures it takes are formatted and require some skill and software to make into your regular jpg format. I really love this device and look forward to the successor of this current gen light ray camera.","This camera is great for what it is designed for and it has amazing looks to it, but I could never recommend it to a beginner looking for a step up from a point and shoot. There are just too many quirks and limitations to do so. Why:<br />- Maximum printing size of 5x7 (sure you can make a larger on, but not a good one according to the manual) as file sizes are limited to this when exporting. This is of no consequence really if you are only concerned about digital images, but some people might want a print larger than 5x7. This is something that is important and not made clear in any manner by anybody else.<br />- No HD video<br />-Must be familiar with gamut warnings and histograms to really utilize the camera<br /><br />I would give this product 4 starts if some of the specs were better - honestly if it could generate an 8x10 printable image, that would do it. I own one and as a photographer, I will be able to use it for many of my digital projects. It has a lot of unique features and the price drop makes it hard to resist buying.","It is great","Picture quality is decent for ISO ~200, above 400 is even worse than iphone camera. Lens got good macro and overall industrial design is really good.<br /><br />One thing that really annoying, I don't see ND8 filter is anywhere necessary.<br /><br />Bottom lines is, for price with 370 bucks, it's a camera worthy to go for. It gives you decent picture at high light and stunning refocusing ability. (To be honest, previous price is ridiculous: 1200 bucks)","The sky is the limit with this one, it's just a little difficult getting the handle on all it can do at this point.","I bought this camera after my old cyber shot broke. I opted to upgrade the MP but really do enjoy the brand. As other reviews stated, the zoom crops the photo, if you want something with real zoom, don't buy a point and shoot. If you want a lightweight camera that takes great photos, this would be your best purchase. It's very affordable and performs wonderfully. I photograph my sewn work, you can see the individual fibers in the fabric at the highest resolution, the weaving of the fabric! Very happy. The flash is pretty bright so be careful when using this for product photography as you might want to turn your flash off or flood out the colors","To take my decision about this camera, I've read several reviews. Finnaly I can say that it is gorgeous. Many thanks!","Takes a little getting used to.  But takes pictures that have wonderful color saturation.  And the ability to change the depth of field after the picture has been taken allows for curing a multitude of ills.","I'm a novice at taking photo's.  I was looking for a macro lens and this camera itself was cheaper than some of the lens out there.  What I like about the camera is it's macro capabilities and field of depth photo's.  I'm still learning how to use it but so far I've taken some nice clear pics.","Good","Great camera.","good","Always wanted to try this camera but it was to pricey.  When the price dropped so dramatically, I couldn't resist.  I love what you can do with the photos and I like pushing the envelope regarding composition.  You really need to think how you shoot.  Lytro seems to be heading into another direction with their movie camera.  Hopefully they won't discontinue platform for the illum. Lots of fun though..","Paid $399 for the camera and experiment with it almost every day. It makes me think differently about photography when I use my other gear.","Neat idea, but a one trick pony that doesn't meet quality standards for great still photos;  So, it does one neat thing, but the basics aren't up to par. Not sharp enough, not easy enough, not fast enough. I can't see this being useful day to day. If I take photos for trade shows, or journalism, with this with me, I'd still have to bring an SLR with me. No point.","Heavy","1. A nice tool to explore, if you can afford it, go ahead and buy it but if you want to replace it with a DSLR, I wouldn't recommend that.It will never do that.<br />2. Outdoor performance is average but indoor/low light performance is horrible, you'll need to buy a flash too. My YN 565 EX II Speedlight works fine with it.<br />3. However I paid extra shipping cost to get it on time, even so, there was a day delay in arriving. Almost missed the flight.","light field is interesting but takes practice.  not a replacement but augment your photographic options.","I would of gave 5 stars but it would freeze and crash and take forever to load. It's quite frustrating. I would've gave it 3 stars in fact, but the bult-in wifi feature and good quality picture made me put 4 stars. It's a good camera , but there are some things that need to be fixed","wow, I really love it","I'm not gonna write the pros of this camera. Enough have been said. Here was my experience of this camera which I took out on the 2nd day and shot ~400 photos<br /><br />1) The shutter leg is about 250ms, significantly longer than a normal digital SLR, which is about 100ms. It is easy to miss a good action because of that. It's hard to predict an action 1/4 second before it happens.<br /><br />2)  Due to lacking of the optical viewfinder, in order to take the sequential shots, you have to turn off the instant preview. Even with the instant preview is off, it takes about 500ms for the object to reappear on the LCD screen after the previous shot. This makes the quick follow up sequential shots impractical.<br /><br />3) The post processing of the image is too slow on the camera, about 5 seconds, before you can adjust the focus and exam a photo.<br /><br />4) The Lytro PC software is too buggy. It crashed twice while downloading the phots via USB3 cable. It took 3 attempts and over 20 minutes to download ~400 photos about 10GB, which should be well under 1 minute based on the USB3 bandwidth. In the end the photos that I downloaded were just a bunch of corrupted images that could not be processed. I had to download one photo a time.<br /><br />5) The refocused JPEG image generated from the Lytro software was only 50KB, which is very low resolution. Maybe I was doing something wrong.<br /><br />This camera is still worthwhile for shooting still images, i.e. portrait or landscape. The price is getting attractive. You could easily spend over $1000 on an f2 SLR zoom lens. Until the above issues are resolved, this camera will remain as an interesting toy, not ready for the serious photography .","This is definitely not a point-and-shoot, let's run out in the crowd and take a bunch of selfies camera. This is a highly sophisticated, well constructed camera, for the experienced amateur or up and coming professional.<br /><br />Between the camera and the software that is supplied by Lytro, you can do almost anything. All controls are conveniently at hand and the display screen is large enough that composing the picture is easy. The big difference between this and many other cameras is that it takes a bit of studying to get the full benefits of the instrument.<br /><br />There's been some complaints that the file sizes are large but considering that you can change the focus and the depth of field after the picture is taken that is completely understandable. If you think you don't need this type of sophistication then by all means go back to your cell phone.<br /><br />The desktop software really reinforces the flexibility of the camera. It also takes a bit of practice to make full use of its potential. The learning curve is a little steep so just have patience. It's well worth a little diligence and study.","The seller is so reliable and always reply my emails very quick, also the product is amazing, I like it a lot. The price is fair also.","Great camera for outside shooting.  Got it at $399(without 25Tax)Really a good deal:)","Great product, thank you","Bought it as a deal at $400, and I was very satisfied with the purchase. It was an extremely interesting product. Solely based on the look, I think it was already worth the money. The presentation of the base, accessories, material qualities, and design was amazing. I have never used a camera with such premium design at this price range.<br /><br />For utilities, If you are creative, want to tell a story using your pictures, and like to show your friends some interactive pictures they had never seen before, this light field camera is the way to go. There is really nothing like this. The sensor was not as good as a dslr, so if you want to take still pictures, it won't perform better than a high end camera. But the interactive picture is something really interesting.<br /><br />So if you already have a decent camera, you can consider this one as an exploration of a totally different type of photography.","I'm just getting used to my Lytro Illum and it looks like an interesting camera, however, there are two negatives which make it an \"okay\" camera - lack of low light performance and lack of image stabilization.  The packaging of the camera is slick and classy and the camera feels good in the hands.<br /><br />The idea of a light-field camera is interesting, especially the capability to change the depth of field on the fly ... but you do need a powerful desktop computer for backend processing with a manageable time lag.  Additionally, get a hi-speed SD card (95 Mbps throughput cards are available on Amazon).<br /><br />All in all, it's an interesting concept but I think the product needs to mature a little.  Either that, or it is also possible that I need to learn a little more about this type of photography because its a slightly new way of taking pictures.  Also, for Android users, there's no app for this camera - another indication that the Lytro still needs some time to mature as a product.  I wouldn't pay $500-$600 for this product for sure.","It's a good camera but it's awkward design makes it hard to handle.","I love it","MUCH better quality than the original Lytro camera and relatively easy to use! I only knock a star off due to some issues I'm having with the camera not being recognized when I plug it in to my PC/Lytro Desktop software.","Great camera only problems i had were with the software","Several issues in current model. Firstly, it is a great camera for what is advertised. It does a great job at what it is aupposed to be doing. That said the equipment still needs a lot of work 1. It does not work in low light situations and I am not talking about dark. Just restaurant light is too little ! 2 The pixel density of images is just ok. considering 4K is becoming a standard fast. This is a little behind. Next the inability to take more than 3 FPS is a big issue. We should be able to shoot video through such an equipment.<br />The screen on the back gets a little hazy at times. Dunno how else to put it. Some sections of the screen will not show the image but black scrollimg bars. This happens in an enclosed region. There is no good case for the camera. Finally, the field depth is not well displayed. There should be an ability to have finer control over the depth region. I am still exploring this feature. But there might be a need for more than +-10 stops on field of depth.<br />Other than that I'm still excited to use the camera. I did try to get my hands on raw data dor the image but it is apparently neither simple not as facilitated by Lytro support just yet.","Never really knew this type of photohraphy existed but after playing with the the camera briefly the things that you can do are incredible.<br /><br />That being said why no 5/5 simply because of two issues, first no manual of any kind and second the power button is a press button and should be a slide button to you do not accidently turn on the camera when in the bag (which does not come with the camera)","PROS:<br />-Capable of amazing effects<br />-Much higher resolution than first Lytro<br />-Offers good control<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Slow software processing<br />-Very expensive<br />-Resulting images remain low-res<br /><br />Unless you have an extremely fast computer, you’ll need to be rich in patience as well as cash to get on with editing its images. You can even get a full-frame camera for less than the cost of the Illum like this one: http://amzn.to/1OyMRFy","i was really looking forward to advancements in this technology. the whole idea of capturing light rays, in unfocused form, instead of focused light points was intriguing. it's kind of what every amateur photographer wanting to be a professional is looking for, not worrying about how to compose a scene or worrying about which subject to focus; just decide what looks great in post, on your computer. this Lytro camera had so much potential, just decide later what to focus on. the previous box version of the camera was really just a gimmick, but this camera had real potential. Lytro was moving forward with a full frame sensor and was actually attracting professionals. the problem with the current technology, in this camera, was that it never fully focused the image, it just approximately focused it, so you could never use it for high-grade professional photographs. there was a lot of promise with the technology and it could have been used for consumer grade point & cameras and for mobile phones (that app would have been hugely popular), but sadly, it is no more. Lytro announced today that low interest in this type of camera has caused them to restructure their company. they have abandoned this camera and even the light ray/focus anywhere technology and have entered the realm of virtual reality. i assume that means as a competitor to Occults Rift. it's too bad really, i was hoping this concept would have advanced along with advancements in technology. i guess there's just no cheat learning artistic compositional skills and taking good photographs; learning photography over the years, like all of us have learned it. the evolution of cameras have made it much easier for photographers and have shortened the learning curve dramatically, but this hack just didn't pan out.","We bought this generation of the Lytro cameras as we were very happy with the original. Lytro Illum has many more features and is easy to use. The shots are amazing and overall camera has outstanding technology. The only downside that we saw was that the desktop software was very slow. This made post-shot editing a bit tedious, but it is definitely worth the wait!","I bought it as I am interested in the future of the photography. I liked the photos. The process of taking a picture takes time (but it's just a matter of practice), to upload photo on computer takes even more time and than you can't share photos with everyone on standard websites. You have to upload it to lytro website or as a movie to other websites. There is a lot of things that they will have to work on, but I believe they have a great potential.","Fabulous camera!!!","My photographic training began years ago, using a hand held light meter and a 4x5 film camera on a 20 pound tripod. Exposures were made based on the expected gamma outcome in the negative, the contrast of the scene and the development manipulation that would be needed to make a straight print on # 2 print paper in the darkroom.<br /><br />The film was processed knowing the shooting conditions that had existed during the exposures and the ability to manipulate the processing to get the desired result with both black and white and color processes. I was exited about having control and being able to get the results that I wanted.<br /><br />Things have changed - now everything seems to be digital.<br /><br />I discovered the Lytro Illum camera and it's support team. In September I received the camera that I pre-ordered. With the ability to refocus and change the depth of field after the capturing of an image, the 3D capability and the broad range of macro capability - I am excited again.<br /><br />I'm adjusting my way of taking pictures to using the active histogram and \"lytro mode\" for setting up the image recording and just using the actual screen image to frame what I want to be included in the scene.<br /><br />My expectation is that the Lytro team will continue to enhance the desktop application. Thus, enabling me to produce the interesting results that I get now and enticing me to continue exploring the range of capabilities that I can develop. The Illum challenges my imagination in new ways of producing meaningful photographic images.<br /><br />The addition of a polarizing filter and a viewfinder attachment have increased my enjoyment of the newly introduced Lytro Illum.","This little toy is cool, it bring us a new way to shot, you dont need to focus first, the focus could be adjusted after even 3 month. But I have to say, it is new design, it is not as good as DSLR, but i believes that it may change the way we make photo in the future","First off....  if you are looking for an easy to use camera with great low light performance I highly recommend the Iphone 6 plus and it will always be in your pocket ready to go.  If you are a creative photographer on the cutting edge of technology the Illum offers new vistas and creative possibilities for your camera bag.<br /><br />For my video review of the camera all you have to do is to search Ken's Iceland With the Lytro Illum.  You will see the full envelope of photography available with the new technology.<br /><br />Pros are many:<br /><br />1. There are new and creative ways to present the iconic photographs of yesterday.<br />2. The desktop editor produces movement in video slideshows of the images.  I have enlarged these onto a 135 inch screen in high resolution with incredible results.  Since most of my pictures are now shown with digital imaging the movement and POP! that the system provides creates an interactive aspect between the viewer and the image.<br />3. For the photographer looking for a new Niche to offer to business consider the possibility of an imbedded video file on a website presenting a merchants products.  (look at my bakery photos)<br />4. For the action photographer consider the camera from close behind the quarterback looking down field. I did some really fun shots of the annual Thanksgiving family football game.<br />5. For slide show presentations consider the ability to edit the movement in a MPG to synchronize with music or narration.  (look at my lytro shot taken with time lapse in the Reykjavik pub.<br />6. For the macro photographer look at the images taken with the subject in near contact with the lens. (look at the Dandelion picture)<br />7. For the Nature photographer consider the flower in a bed of foliage and the ability to refocus any part of the image after the fact.<br />8.  Lytro Corporation is incredibly service oriented.  I have not had any issue that they did not take seriously and respond to.<br />9.  You shoot at a constant F2 and can process from F1 to F16 choosing any focal point as a sharp focus in the image range.  REALLY???<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. It costs as much as I have paid for each one of my better lenses. (Quite a value if you ask me)<br />2. I agree it does need a decent computer to process the images. The file sizes are large but luckily storage is now inexpensive.<br />3. You need to be creative.  To make the images really pop you need to consider close foreground, middle and background.  If you are just looking for a  snapshot use the Iphone.<br />4. You will find yourself carrying two cameras.  The Cotton Camera System works well. (I covet the lighter Sony A7S now)<br />5. The learning curve using zoom and focus coupled with attention to the cameras shutter speed and ISO is steep.  Once you have a month of exposures behind you and if you take the time to watch the Lytro tutorials you can produce moving images with every shot.  It took me years to learn SLR photography.  You can do this in a month?<br />6. As you begin to take more time to set up your capture you will look back to your past SLR photography with a more critical eye. At least I do.<br />7. The software has some problems.  Look at the clipping of foreground objects and occasional artifacts with the macros seen on my videos.  The cool thing is that the raw images can be reprocessed with new software versions as the technology improves. The camera does lock up from time to time.  I pull the battery and reboot. It comes back up quickly and I move on.<br />8.  You will find yourself picking out LYTRO shots.  You will stop more to think about your photography.  You will need an understanding partner on trips to allow more time for photographs.  You will need knee pads to kneel more for creative shots.  You will find yourself upside down holding the camera just above water to photograph the passage of water through rocks on a stream then be amazed when you look at the image and see that everything is in focus including the algae on the rocks and the trees 200 feet away.  You call attention to yourself with this crazy new looking camera and what you are doing with it. You find yourself selling Lytros on a nature walk.  You buy final cut pro X to create new cool ways to show your images.<br />9. It is hard to see the viewfinder in high ambient light.  It helps to tilt the viewfinder but many times one has to focus with the histogram and just shoot to capture the image.  This could be fixed with a creative adaption of some of the DSLR viewfinders.  I am waiting!  With creative use I have yet to miss a shot.<br />10. In very cold temperatures (Iceland) the shutter button would stick.  They know about this and hopefully have already produced a fix on new builds.<br /><br />  This is a new way to create impressive pictures that can move the audience.  Nearly anything worthwhile that I have undertaken has had a much steeper learning curve than this. (and I am old)  If you want to get up and running quickly I strongly suggest a one day shoot with an active lytro photographer.  As soon as you learn the computer assist and focus histogram you will be creating great images.  All my photography has improved after I bought the Illum.  Life is good!","I was vaguely familiar with the technology behind this camera and was interested to see if it was actually more flexible than my standard 35 mm cameras.  I have only been using it a few days but have been amazed at how easy it is to use.  I viewed several of the training videos on the Lytro Web site and found them very helpful.  This is not a camera for casual use because it is too heavy and requires a little time to get the best shot. But if you want the best shot and one that you can alter later, this is the one for you.","While I am just a hobbyist photographer I decided to purchase the Illum after having the 1st generation Lytro camera. I found the first generation to be a novelty that I seldom used, I was pleasantly surprised when I began to use the Illum. It is a great piece of technology. The photos come out amazing once you conquer the learning curve which only take a little bit of patience. The power really comes once you get a bit deeper into it. Things like \"depth map\" editing take this to a whole new level. There is so much more I could write with the things I have done with the camera but they are merely word. The simple reality is that you really should just see for yourself. If you like to think outside the box, not afraid of new things, and are can rethink the concept of \"taking a picture\" . This is certainly for you.","Photography has been a hobby of mine for over 30 years. I consider myself an above average amateur.  I am not a professional. I think the best pictures are the ones that I look back and say \"Wow, how did I get that\".  What I love the most about digital photography is it really pushes creativity. When the first generation Lytro came out  it took me a few months of reading reviews and web surfing, then I bought it.  It is a great introduction to \"light field\" photography and is best for posting on the web. I had fun with it as a third camera and it was easy to carry in a water bottle pocket of my backpack.  When the Illum came out I already had an understanding of light field photography and enjoyed it but felt limited by the first generation camera. I immediately preordered the Illum. When it arrived I was blown away. Like others have said it looks sophisticated and is easy to handle (I notice when I take pictures people stare at the camera), but the ability to change an entire scene by focusing on different points in this high quality camera is amazing. It shoots at a constant f/2.0 and in the software you can adjust from a f/1.0 to f/16. Being creative by focusing on a near object with a different scene in the back can tell a great story. I was at a wedding earlier this month and took a shot of the wedding flowers with the back drop of the couple at the altar or the wedding invitation close and the couple at the cake cutting. Then in the software I would create a mp4 that would vary the focus from the invitation to the couple then bring the whole picture in focus. Amazing. My nephew and his wife loved the photos. Really does unleash creativity and brings a lot of fun into planning your shots.<br /><br />Little more specifics:<br /><br />Pros: Great feel in hands, Camera looks good, rear screen can extend out so when take shot close to ground such a small flowers you don't have to lay on the ground. Lens is high quality and it comes with a ND8 filter(72mm) to help in bright light. I found best to shoot in manual and control the shutter speed and ISO to get the optimal shot. Lytro button is significant help, it allows you to optimize the zoom and focus for best picture and separation between near and far objects while maintaining picture quality.  You can bracket. The hot shoe will work to trigger a flash, but shoot in manual, camera does not compensate for flash.  While not weather proofed, I have taken it to wet areas (waterfalls) and worked fine. Not sure I'm brave enough to try underwater photography with it. Software is easy to navigate, rate, tag, and flag.  It functions similar to Aperture. Animation function gives you control of how you want the mp4 to look. USB3 to upload. Export in jpeg, tiff, or Lytro raw format. The company is very approachable and has numerous resources for learning how to use the camera. Check out their gallery - some great photos there.<br /><br />Cons: You spend time composing a shot, can't just point and shoot (well you can, but that's not why I got the camera). It is computer intensive and it requires a fast SD card to work best. There is a learning curve, but it is not that steep and the more you use it the more you learn. Higher ISO shots can be grainy, try to keep ISO low.  In the software Flagged picture are not well identified (just need to change color from white to yellow).<br /><br />I gave it 5-stars because it really does change the way you think about composing your shots. I was lucky enough to be one of those chosen for the Lytro Iceland trip and the experience has changed the way I take pictures. The camera has you thinking more about composition.  The Illum is not a replacement for my dSLR, but everywhere I travel I bring a dSLR and my Lytro Illum. The first generation is on a shelf with my wife's Elan and my old 5D.","I consider myself an earlier adopter and when the first Lytro camera came out I pre-ordered one immediately.  It definitely had its limitations but it was fun and not terribly expensive.  I could also see the promise in the technology.  So, when the Illum was announced I was right back with a front of the line pre-order.  This despite the hefty increase in price and knowing it would not replace my everyday cameras (both DSLR and mirrorless).  I ordered the Illum with the expectation that the technology would have advanced significantly from the first generation model and that there would be much more in the way of post-processing possibilities through both the Lytro Desktop software and third party software like Photoshop and Lightroom.  One thing that did cause me to hesitate a bit was the fact that the camera only offers a rear LCD for composing and viewing photos.  I prefer an eye-level viewfinder and I know from my experience with mirrorless cameras that an electronic viewfinder (EVF) is a great addition either as standard equipment or as an add-on via the hotshoe connection.  However, my disappointment that the Illum did not offer this feature did not keep me from ordering the camera.<br /><br />I have now had the camera for several months and while it isn't my \"go to\" camera I have gotten some interesting shots and the field of \"computational photography\" seems to be on the verge of some big advancements that I want to be a part of.  As other reviewers have noted, the low light capabilities of the camera are limited and the files sizes are bordering on too big requiring a late model computer with a fast processor. Otherwise you will be waiting a long time for the images to process.  You also need a large hard drive in order to store the files.<br /><br />This camera has a definite learning curve and in some ways is more difficult to master than the original Lytro.  As always, you really need to think about your composition as many shots that look fine in static 2D don't really benefit from what the Lytro has to offer.  If you have something interesting in both the foreground and the background you can get some really nice effects.  The button layout and touchscreen are both pretty intuitive and pressing the Lytro button can help you get your depth of field composition optimized.  The 2.0 constant aperture is a big plus and in post you can change it to anything from F1.0 to F16.0 which is pretty amazing.  The software also allows you do do animations which can be shared via email, social media, etc.  Overall, the Lytro Desktop software is pretty decent but I was disappointed to learn that doing editing in third party software like Photoshop requires multiple steps and a high degree of skill to master.  You could literally spend hours trying to get a perfectly optimized photo.  Hopefully at some point there will be enough of a user base that third party vendors will come up with a streamlined approach to editing.  Likewise, it will be nice when social media sites like Facebook support Lytro photos natively rather than having to link back to the Lytro servers and software.<br /><br />The ergonomics of the camera are okay but I don't like the strap placement and the camera is a little to bulky for my taste.  Over time I expect Lytro will be successful in miniaturizing their cameras making them more portable and fun to shoot with.  I do think Lytro has an excellent support team and they are quick to roll out software updates and new features.  The company has some heavy hitter venture capital backers that see a lot of promise in the technology and I believe over time it will become more pervasive and mainstream.  I am sure that videographers, for example, would find many amazing applications for the technology although the first users in this field will likely be movie studios with deep pockets or those wanting to use it for industrial applications as a consumer grade Lytro video camera seems many years off.<br /><br />Overall I give the Lytro Illum 4 stars as it is a nice upgrade from the original Lytro and continues to advance both Light Field and computational photography.  The camera and the technology both have quirks and glitches but it is possible to get some amazing images with a little patience and the right conditions.  I would encourage anyone thinking about purchasing the camera to look at some of the examples of what people have been able to achieve by going to the photo galleries at lytro.com.  I also think a very well written and helpful guide is Using LYTRO ILLUM: A Guide to Creating Great Living Pictures [Kindle Edition] by Josh Anon.  It is an inexpensive addition to the manuals and documentation available directly from Lytro.","The Illum is Lytro’s second generation Light Field camera. Their first generation camera was about the size of a stick of butter. It had a tiny one inch LCD touchscreen on one end and the lens on the other. The first generation Lytro camera was fun and proved the concept. But images were low res and ergonomics were not it’s strong point.<br /><br />The new Illum is larger, about the size of an entry level DSLR. Most of the bulk is in the large lens barrel. The lens is a 30 to 250 mm equivalent zoom at a constant f2 aperture. That’s an amazing spec, there aren’t many f2 zooms on the market by any manufacturer for any price.<br /><br />The overall design of the Lytro Illum is impressive. The most striking design element is the pronounced forward slant of the back. The camera has a modern minimalist style.<br /><br />The body of the Illum is Aluminum and Magnesium, it feels dense and well put together. The focus and zoom rings on the lens are grippy rubber. The focus and zoom are fly by wire, not mechanical. Their action can be reversed in the settings.<br /><br />There is no viewfinder. The large four inch touchscreen swings out from the body to the vertical and up to the horizontal. The screen is bright, but can be hard to see in bright daylight.<br /><br />The lens barrel is big and fat. There’s a comfortable grip on the right side of the body.<br /><br />Unlike the first generation camera, the Illum has a removable battery. Battery life seems pretty good, I haven’t pushed it hard though. The battery is unique to Lytro and spares go for $59.<br /><br />The Lytro Illum is not cheap, it retails for $1500. And that’s the rub. The Lytro Illum is a specialized camera.<br /><br />The Lytro Illum is not a DSLR or general purpose digital camera. It’s images are designed to be viewed online–they’re not for printing. Images from the Lytro Illum are limited to only 5 MegaPixels when converted to jpeg.<br /><br />So what does the Lytro Illum do that justifies it’s high price?<br /><br />First you need to understand the concept of the Light Field.<br /><br />Light Field cameras capture more data than a conventional digital camera. Conventional cameras only capture brightness and color information for each pixel. Light Field cameras also capture the direction of the incoming light rays and are able to capture depth information, or how far away each pixel is from the lens. Light field cameras also capture multiple planes of focus. The image can be refocused in software after the image is captured.<br /><br />Lytro Illum images come alive online or in the Lytro Desktop software. When viewing an image online you can select focus points and even give the image a slight 3D wiggle. Images can be converted to movies for an impressive 3 dimensional Ken Burns effect.<br />For best results using the Illum, images need to have a lot of depth. You should have something in the foreground to contrast against the background. Ideally, images should have multiple planes of interest. Landscapes with everything at infinity are not good.<br /><br />The camera can focus as close as the surface of the lens. This means the Lytro Illum excels at macrophotography.<br /><br />When shooting with the Lytro Illum you can call up a Depth Histogram. Using the focus and zoom rings you try to spread the Depth Histogram across the camera’s range of focus. This maximizes the refocus ability and 3 dimensionality.<br /><br />Is the Lytro Illum a one trick pony?<br /><br />I don’t think so.<br /><br />Images from the camera are much better than the first generation. The new software makes it easy to create high quality immersive and captivating images.<br /><br />I think the Lytro Illum is ahead of its time. It points to the future of photography.<br /><br />A future where software trumps hardware.<br /><br />A future where we share images online instead of printing them on paper. (most people do this already)<br /><br />A future where still images come alive with shifting focus and 3 dimensionality.","The Illum gets 5 stars because it makes me excited to take pictures with something other than my iPhone 6, Panasonic Lumix, or Nikon N6000.  I photograph some projects for my day job, but I am not making a living as a professional photographer.  My Lytro profile is here, go check it out to see how I use it. https://pictures.lytro.com/ZNZN<br /><br />I bought the 1st Gen Lytro.  When the Illum came out I was offered a pre-order discount AND a customer loyalty discount, so I paid about $1,000 for the camera.  Shipping was on time as advertised.  Don't buy the 1st generation model, buy an Illum.<br /><br />In my opinion, this camera is for creating web content.  I feel this is incredibly important for contemporary journalists.  Everyone complains that print is dead...  If I were to display these photos in a fine art gallery, I would use ELO touch screens and a Mac Mini.<br /><br />So far the hardware and software have performed as advertised.  Use the fastest SD card you have.  In fact, don't use a slow SD card, you will be disappointed.  I shoot in the XRaw format, pictures are 100MB each.  If you use this camera a lot, you will probably end up buying an extra 20 TB of storage.<br /><br />500px will soon accept the Lytro format.  The Lytro support forums are active.  There is even a very nice manual for your Amazon Kindle.  http://www.amazon.com/Using-LYTRO-ILLUM-Creating-Pictures-ebook/dp/B00NE18N3S<br /><br />The camera is a lot of fun, and is always a great icebreaker wherever I take it.<br /><br />Taking images in low light will take some patience.  The fastest shutter speed is 1/4000 and can capture great moments.  There are some quirks with LYTRO app and online gallery, but I see consistent updates so I'm not going to get into that here.<br /><br />I look forward to becoming an expert with this camera in the next couple of years!","Nice camera, awesome images but as it was told to me by the support team - \"The LYTRO ILLUM is next generation technology that makes your computer as important as the camera in the image capture process, and requires recent GPU hardware to process the data we're collecting. Systems that do not meet minimum system requirements (or are potentially borderline) either won't work at all, or may not provide a good user experience. We're not doing this lightly; capturing and processing 40 million light rays and all the data in the resulting 50MB RAW file is no small task. There's a lot of heavy computation and rendering involved. Customers with laptops computers may want to consider getting a desktop or tower system which have much better bang-for-the-buck propositions.\"<br />So I am returning this camera and sticking with my Canon 50D.","Excellent next gen camera – particularly for a semi-amateur/semi-pro (with emphasis on the semi-amateur) like me.<br /><br />Acts as a replacement for a basic DSLR for most uses, but with the benefit of being able to effectively refocus after the fact. This is my third camera, and I have yet to use my DSLR since this arrived.<br /><br />Ability to shift perspective cool, but not a key use for me.<br /><br />Optical zoom and wide lens offer both zoom and macro lenses all-in-one.<br /><br />Perspective shift and refocus most valuable for shots with subjects at varying distances.  Clearly of most value in daylight.<br /><br />Primary limiting trade-off: If you have no need for post-capture refocusing, perspective shift, etc., and want the highest possible fixed resolution, you can get higher resolution static pics at present from a high end DSLR.<br /><br />Biggest benefit so far: allows me to capture shots of my son’s cross country meets – particularly in the home stretch -- and then send separate photos to the other parents with each of their children in focus despite being at varying distances from my son (and therefore out-of-focus in a static DSLR shot) at the time of capture.<br /><br />Overall Rating:  Excellent new technology.  Above expectations. Cool form factor (which at the same time can also be viewed as a limitation for our existing investments in other lenses).  Fixed resolution trade-offs particularly worth it for uses with multiple subjects.","I purchased the Lytro Illum as a third camera, and so far it plays that role well. My primary camera is a Sony DSC-RX1, my secondary (for video) is the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ1000, and finally the Lytro for those special moments where I want something extra.<br /><br />It's important to remember that the Illum is not a point-and-shoot like the original Lytro. On average, it takes me an average of 1-2 minutes to plan and compose a shot. It doesn't perform well in low-light situations, it's bulky, and the images aren't interesting unless there is depth. You have to compose your images in 3D, making sure that there is both a foreground and background subject; but when you have the right subject matter and the time to compose your shot, the results are amazing.<br /><br />The Lytro Desktop software is essential to make the most of Lytro Illum images, but be warned that it requires a pretty beefy computer to process images. I'm using a 6-core Mac Pro, but even then importing images and exporting animations can take longer than you'd expect. I'm hoping they can improve that soon because I don't believe they have tapped the full potential of what the hardware is capable of doing.<br /><br />To summarize, the Illum is a specialist tool for special moments...not a primary or even secondary camera for day-to-day use. Every shot requires the right subject, lighting, and preparation to capture. When done right, it produces results that cannot be matched by traditional cameras or post-processing.","I pre-ordered the Lytro Illum directly from Lytro and it arrived in mid-August. It arrived later than expected so, without any complaints from me, Lytro sent me a spare battery and a second camera strap.<br />Their support team has been extremely supportive with any questions I have.<br />I own many cameras - digital and film.  I consider myself to be an advanced enthusiast.<br />This camera greatly exceeded my expectations.  I almost cancelled the order because of the high cost.  After nearly three weeks of use, I am very glad I didn't.  It is a wonderful camera that helps me think about photography in new ways.<br />My first shots with the camera were not very good.  But then I watched all of the online training videos offered by Lytro.  Those were VERY helpful.  Since this camera is like no other, this training is important and not very time consuming.<br />I can now use the camera to its full potential.  See the Lytro Gallery that includes results from many users.<br />The technology behind this camera is amazing.  Every shot is taken at f/2 but you can change the image from f/1 to f/16 in post-processing using the Lytro Desktop software.  You can also create a short animation that shows the image at f/2 across the image over time - this gives some fascinating 3D effects.  The perspective changes possible with these images alone make it worth the price of admission.<br />The focal length of the lens at f/2 is the 35mm equivalent of 30-250mm.  Try to find that on any other lens.  This provides enormous flexibility in composing each shot.<br />The battery life is excellent.  The lcd screen is large and easy to read except in very bright sunshine.  But even in bright light, you can still select the focus range for the image.  For more on focus range - see the Lytro training videos.<br />The camera strap is great - much more comfortable than a typical camera strap from other manufacturers.<br />The image quality is fine and greatly exceeds the first generation Lytro cameras.  And no other camera can provide the kind of post-processing available with the Lytro Illum.<br />It is great fun to take photos with this camera.  I am now thinking of taking shots to take advantage of the 3D effects that I would never do with a traditional camera.<br />So if you want to expand your horizons in photography and have great fun doing it, the Lytro Illum is for you.<br />I am very happy that I made this purchase.","I just bought this camera in Germany. Not at Amazon store, they don't have it there. For me it is a camera for \"Special effects\", to learn the new way to take fotos - For normale fotos we have a Canon 5D Mark II with 21 MegaPixel - the Lytro Illum only has 4 Mega Pixel (in jpeg) and not a full CMOS sensor like the Canon. But this I knew before I bought the camera.<br />It is an expansive tool to play with, but it really makes fun!<br />I don't like the way the others rated this camera. It is like to buy a Ferrari and then criticise, that you don't can drive offroad ... You have to check the technical data carefully: Megaray don't mean MegaPixel! So when you convert the foto to jpeg, it isn't good quality - not when you want to make a paper foto more then small size!<br />But the living Pictures are really fun to Play with, and to find out, which way to get the best out of this new technic!<br />One less star than possible because of the bad user manual. The tutorial videos are very good - but all Videos are American speech. Not easy to hear more than three Videos in a row for a old german lady ...","Short Version:<br /><br />This is an amazing device that opens a window into a new way to think about photographs. Due to \"old dog/new tricks\" issues, this window is still pretty hazy for me right now, but I can see wonderful things over on the other side.<br /><br />The equipment is well built, sturdy, has a great lens system, and absolutely works as advertised.<br /><br />The three bad things are:<br /><br />1)  The final, effective, what-you-end-up-with-in-the-end resolution of images in 2D is not anything like what I'm used to. On the other hand, for me to compare resolution from such a young technology like this to images taken with $20k worth of a equipment developed over 20 years that includes a 500 mm lens, instant autofocus, taking 12 frames a second with a 30 megapixel full frame sensor, seems a bit unfair. I'm told by Lytro that the camera has a \"4MB max output resolution\", which is probably about what the old exposed film images of yesteryear had. Since there are some really great images from the pre-digital age, this tells me that the problem is not the camera, but the skill of the photographer.<br /><br />2)  There are several small technical glitches in the camera, software, and website that are a tad annoying but don't affect the actual camera operation. When you think about the number of completely new areas this camera system had to pioneer, the number and level of problems seems small. In a twisted way for me this turns around into a plus because every time I ask a question or point out a problem, a nice young man named Adam at Lytro carefully studies what I say, reproduces the problem, speaks to some geeks in the back room, then comes back to me with the solution/resolution they have worked out and an estimate of when they will be able to implement the change. That is absolutely unprecedented in my experience in purchasing cutting edge photographic equipment over many years.<br /><br />3)  If you purchase this camera you may very well come to understand as I have that what you think you know about photography has been a drop in the bucket as to what can be done. I learned that for the DSLR equipment I am used to, there was an amount of money I could spend to make me a passable photographer. I need to pick up my game significantly in terms of composition and color to be able to use this camera instead of relying on fancy equipment to make my images look good.<br /><br />Full disclosure : This review replaces one I submitted last week that gave the camera 2 stars and whined about the resolution because my hobby is high resolution wildlife photography. I have since come to understand that this camera is not designed to compete in that arena.<br /><br />Since my initial review I have taken some amazing images that would not make any sense with normal 2D equipment. I set up a shower pointing towards the camera, flowing in the bright sunlight with the stream falling just in front of the lens. The images allow you to change the focus back and forth through the stream to see individual drops at different distances from the camera. Taking an image like that using a normal 2D camera would be silly because whatever focus point you chose when you released the shutter would be clear, but everything else would be a blur. If you set the F-Stop for the depth of field to include the entire range of the stream, you would lose the concept of volume.<br /><br />I also took some pictures of our dog swimming at the beach where you can change the F-Stop after the picture is taken change the depth of field to either include or blur out the waves behind him. In the past, I would have to take a picture, change the F-Stop to estimate a depth of field I might like later, then take another picture. The fact that I have never done that tells me that I've been too lazy to take the time to make those kinds of adjustments, then learn from the results later on. What I found with the Illum is that I like several different depth of field solutions for a single image, each for a different reason.<br /><br />I'm changing my rating all the way up to 4 stars because this camera is exactly what it claims to be. I can see that this is a brave new world I'm anxious to learn, and in my mind this camera is the start of a new direction for photography.","I was super thrilled to see this camera and ordered one as soon as I received the promotional email announcing the camera. There are a few interesting things about the camera, but just too many bugs and drawbacks to even recommend this for anyone, except for a small niche.<br /><br />Pros: Camera looks sexy! Ability to refocus and shift perspective are cool. There are both autofocus and manual focus options. Fixed aperture of 2 with the ability to adjust DoF on the computer is fun. Picture quality is decent when shot in optimal light, but low resolution. Great Lens with excellent range and quality and super macro 1:3!<br /><br />Bottons are well placed. Large, bright and very functional touch screen and it articulates for optimal viewing. Menus are intuitive. You could even toggle the zoom and focus rings. You can reprogram almost all buttons to do various actions. USB 3. The software that comes with it allows adjustment of DoF.<br /><br />Cons: Despite the sexy looks, camera felt cheap and flimsy in my hands. The zoom and focus rings wobble on my camera and have gaps between the rings and the lens body. Refocussing ability is NOT infinite and one should NOT expect it to be. Perspective shift is simply a hype.<br /><br />There was so much effort at reinventing the wheel in its body design, that many times they ended up with an irregular oval. For a start, the strap design is annoying. Memory card compartment door is flimsy. Lens hood actually scratches the lens body. And cap doesn't click in easily.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is the picture quality that determines if this is a good camera or not. Low light performance is appalling. When shot with the optimal light, the pictures are decent. Although the ISO goes up to 3200, it is unusable above 800. Say goodbye to indoor photography without a flash! With flash you may get a decent picture after playing a bit with flash direction. If you flash directly there is a risk of overexposing anything close. This camera thrives on having a proportionally large distance between near and far objects (not the actual distance, but the ratio of distance from the camera). That's what makes the perspective shift interesting. As the light falls off in inverse ratio to the square of the distance from flash, if you try taking the \"cool\" pictures with flash directly forward, you will be disappointed. The fixed aperture of f/2 with the lowest ISO of 80 limits your shutter speed in bright light, but I can accept this. Unless you're aiming directly at the sun or a really shiny & bright object, you're fine here.<br /><br />Finally, the file sizes are too big. 50 Mb for RAW and 100 Mb with xRAW. Even with the fastest computer it takes a long time to process these pictures. I could not find a way to export to LR to edit and reimport, yet (that's my ignorance, perhaps). Camera freezes often and requires a hard shutdown with battery removal and restarting. I really hope they will fix this.<br /><br />If you have the extra $1500 to throw away and are curious, go ahead and buy. This cannot be your first or second or a spare camera. Despite my eager waiting for this camera, I did not take it out with me on my first opportunity for a shooting in Chicago. I chose to take my 5D Mark III with two extra lenses, rather than remove one lens and make room for this."]},{"name":"Minolta Maxxum 7 35mm SLR Camera (Body Only)","amazon_reviews":["This is seriously SUCH an amazing camera!

This camera holds its own. The autofocus is fast and accurate. The wireless flash makes it a perfect studio camera as well as making it's ease of use with a camera flip phenomenal.

Minolta was terrible in the marketing department because all I remember was Canon commercials, I never saw a Minolta one = too bad. The Maxxum 7 is a super camera and out-of-this-world with the vertical control grip. It's plastic structure belies it's capabilities and it's what the Maxxum 9 (armored/combat camera) should have been. I'm still learning what this thing can do!

AWESOME!! AWESOME!!!<br />Get some black and white film and have fun...","This is by far the best camera I have ever owned in my life, be it point and shoot, film or digital.  I'm in the Marine Corps and took this camera with me in Iraq and countless other places and it went through some of the most extreme weather imaginable and kept on working.  The camera is not labeled as splash-proof, but it should be -- I accidentally dropped this camera in a puddle of water and pulled it out and it was still working.  I never had it fail on me one time.  The LCD display on the back is huge and amazingly informative.  The backlight on the LCD is very handy as well.  The autofocus is also amazingly fast and accurate.  It's a professional quality camera with beginner level accessibility.","This is an excellent contemporary high-tech camera.  I tend to shoot in aperature controlled mode, and it is very easy to change aperatures, to bracket exposures so you get three to seven shots in rapid fire with slightly different settings, and to see differing depths of field.  Depending on the lens, it can also be relatively easy to modify the auto focus (so, for example, you move the center of the focus in front of or behind your subject to get the right part of the scene in focus), but note that some lenses will clutch and not be able to be hand-manipulated, leading to a need to switch to manual focus with those lenses in some cases.<br />What really sells this camera, though, is the wireless flash.  Do not underestimate how much this can improve your flash pictures.  It is very easy to use -- I literally have shown my 3 year old, who was very curious, how to do, and got some good shots of him in the process.  If you buy this camera, you should buy at least one of the Minolta \"D\" flashes.<br />As you take bracketed shots in continuous focus mode, the camera does a good job of remaining in focus.  For those of us with glasses, there is a diopter adjustment in the viewfinder that adjusts the viewfinder to our own current prescription.  On manual focus, this has a real impact on my photos, where my focus was previously a bit soft much of the time.<br />I end up with a couple of minor complaints -- the selector button that lets you choose which sensor to use in focusing is placed right where my nose can hit it, and I've had to learn to take care not to accidentally change the setting with my nose. Also, I'd like to see the new anti-shake technology that is being incorporated in Minolta's new digital 7 incorporated into the 7.  I suspect it is just time until this happens.<br />All in all, an extraordinary camera.","The best autofocus period. Out performs nikon & canon. Can focus in near darkness. It really performs better than expected. I like the information lcd on the back. I like it better than the F100. Judging from what I have experienced it should be very dependable.","I recently upgraded from Dynax 5 to Dynax 7 (Or what you folks over sea call it - Maxxum:), and I really found all the features I missed in my Dynax 5. It's auto focus is very responsive and fast, metering really performs well in most situations, controls are intuitive and easy to use, big LCD provides a lot of things to tweak with, exposure memory for 7 rolls is really useful too.<br />  I do not use Minolta lenses however, Sigma EX series are the ones to use if you want quality for affordable price.<br />  Ah, and my favourite Sigma lens is the 24-70/2.8 EX DG, it really is awesome, and has 'D' mount for Minolta too :)<br />  Theres only one thing about Maxxum 7 I do not enjoy...the weight...it really should have been heavier!","I bought this camera just recently and I am very happy with it. I was reading up a lot before I made the purchase and came to the conclusion that with the extreme amount of innovation, the Maxxum 7 is a professional level camera worth comparing to any other.<br />The 5th-generation autofocus is extremely intelligent; nine points, with the center sensitive to vertical, horizontal and diagonal subjects. It is the fastest ever to wear the Minolta name.<br />The rear of the camera contains the illuminated LCD panel that is easy to read and tells you everything you need to know about the camera's controls in just a glance. Especially nice is the fact that it records all the settings for up to 7 rolls of film. (So one can go back and see what went wrong.)<br />The \"Navigation Display\" LCD panel with a plethora of information also makes above-head camera shots more manageable.<br />The body is compact, well sealed & rugged. The Controls are optimally located. The two prominent knobs are very handy. One allows you to choose the different modes (A, S, M or full Program), while the other one allows for fast compensation settings.<br />The 9-point autofocus system, with dual-cross center sensor, can be controlled by a dial in the back with ones right thumb. The Maxxum 7 boosts an 8X viewfinder magnification with built-in diopter adjustment and a sensational 92% X 94% coverage. Another great feature is the Distance-integrated flash metering with remote high-speed sync at all shutter speeds & rear-curtain sync 14-segment honeycomb-pattern metering system solves the toughest of lighting conditions with ease. The Eye-start operation initiates autofocus & autoexposure systems with just a glance into the viewfinder. One might never use all the 35 programmable custom function settings, but the Maxxum 7 is so loaded with state of the art technology, that as an amateur one will anyway never ever use all the possibilities this camera offers.","This is seriously SUCH an amazing camera!

I'm in the Marine Corps and took this camera with me in Iraq and countless other places and it went through some of the most extreme weather imaginable and kept on working.  The camera is not labeled as splash-proof, but it should be -- I accidentally dropped this camera in a puddle of water and pulled it out and it was still working.  I never had it fail on me one time.  The LCD display on the back is huge and amazingly informative.  The backlight on the LCD is very handy as well.  The autofocus is also amazingly fast and accurate.  It's a professional quality camera with beginner level accessibility.","This is an excellent contemporary high-tech camera.  I tend to shoot in aperature controlled mode, and it is very easy to change aperatures, to bracket exposures so you get three to seven shots in rapid fire with slightly different settings, and to see differing depths of field.  Depending on the lens, it can also be relatively easy to modify the auto focus (so, for example, you move the center of the focus in front of or behind your subject to get the right part of the scene in focus), but note that some lenses will clutch and not be able to be hand-manipulated, leading to a need to switch to manual focus with those lenses in some cases.<br />What really sells this camera, though, is the wireless flash.  Do not underestimate how much this can improve your flash pictures.  It is very easy to use -- I literally have shown my 3 year old, who was very curious, how to do, and got some good shots of him in the process.  If you buy this camera, you should buy at least one of the Minolta \"D\" flashes.<br />As you take bracketed shots in continuous focus mode, the camera does a good job of remaining in focus.  For those of us with glasses, there is a diopter adjustment in the viewfinder that adjusts the viewfinder to our own current prescription.  On manual focus, this has a real impact on my photos, where my focus was previously a bit soft much of the time.<br />I end up with a couple of minor complaints -- the selector button that lets you choose which sensor to use in focusing is placed right where my nose can hit it, and I've had to learn to take care not to accidentally change the setting with my nose. Also, I'd like to see the new anti-shake technology that is being incorporated in Minolta's new digital 7 incorporated into the 7.  I suspect it is just time until this happens.<br />All in all, an extraordinary camera.","The best autofocus period. Out performs nikon & canon. Can focus in near darkness. It really performs better than expected. I like the information lcd on the back. I like it better than the F100. Judging from what I have experienced it should be very dependable.","I recently upgraded from Dynax 5 to Dynax 7 (Or what you folks over sea call it - Maxxum:), and I really found all the features I missed in my Dynax 5. It's auto focus is very responsive and fast, metering really performs well in most situations, controls are intuitive and easy to use, big LCD provides a lot of things to tweak with, exposure memory for 7 rolls is really useful too.<br />  I do not use Minolta lenses however, Sigma EX series are the ones to use if you want quality for affordable price.<br />  Ah, and my favourite Sigma lens is the 24-70/2.8 EX DG, it really is awesome, and has 'D' mount for Minolta too :)<br />  Theres only one thing about Maxxum 7 I do not enjoy...the weight...it really should have been heavier!","I bought this camera just recently and I am very happy with it. I was reading up a lot before I made the purchase and came to the conclusion that with the extreme amount of innovation, the Maxxum 7 is a professional level camera worth comparing to any other.<br />The 5th-generation autofocus is extremely intelligent; nine points, with the center sensitive to vertical, horizontal and diagonal subjects. It is the fastest ever to wear the Minolta name.<br />The rear of the camera contains the illuminated LCD panel that is easy to read and tells you everything you need to know about the camera's controls in just a glance. Especially nice is the fact that it records all the settings for up to 7 rolls of film. (So one can go back and see what went wrong.)<br />The \"Navigation Display\" LCD panel with a plethora of information also makes above-head camera shots more manageable.<br />The body is compact, well sealed & rugged. The Controls are optimally located. The two prominent knobs are very handy. One allows you to choose the different modes (A, S, M or full Program), while the other one allows for fast compensation settings.<br />The 9-point autofocus system, with dual-cross center sensor, can be controlled by a dial in the back with ones right thumb. The Maxxum 7 boosts an 8X viewfinder magnification with built-in diopter adjustment and a sensational 92% X 94% coverage. Another great feature is the Distance-integrated flash metering with remote high-speed sync at all shutter speeds & rear-curtain sync 14-segment honeycomb-pattern metering system solves the toughest of lighting conditions with ease. The Eye-start operation initiates autofocus & autoexposure systems with just a glance into the viewfinder. One might never use all the 35 programmable custom function settings, but the Maxxum 7 is so loaded with state of the art technology, that as an amateur one will anyway never ever use all the possibilities this camera offers.","I have tried several cameras trying to find a camera that was,<br />easy to use,that had pro features but also not very heavy.This camera has suprised me by meeting these needs and more.The camera is sturdy enough for most people,except for extreme weather(below 0,pouring rain,sahara desert conditions).the maxxum7 makes up for this with alot of useable features that are easy to get to and easy to remember.My results have been great and the exposure meter has been very reliable. The camera<br />is easy to hold and fits great in my hands. I bought the vertical grip and it makes the handling even better.Minolta lens selection is good and most are very sharp.minolta not only makes there own glass but they also build there own lenses.I know this sounds like a minolta ad but I was very taken by this camera and<br />the minolta system fits my needs (they just added there version of ultra-sonic lenses).See for yourself if it is the right choice,but if you ask me I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the camera and the system.","I purchased the Maxxum 7 to replace the Minolta 650, and cannot begin to compare the two. Although I will probably never use all the features, I can't wait to put it through it's full paces.","There's no way you're going to find a better camera in this price range.  This beauty does it all. It has all the bells and whistles of camera's costing twice as much.  The autofocus is super fast and the body is solid yet lightweight.  Easily a match for the Maxxum 9 or Nikon F5.","Amazing, glorious camera that provides much more than even most expensive competitors.<br />The camera has metering preview !!! It shows the matrix with metered values for each segment ! It not just allows DOS preview it meters and shows the distances ! It allows  change middle exposure films! It can synchronize the external flash at any speed up to 1/8000 !!!! It is perfection and professional body, so convenient, smart and cool. I proud to own this Minolta's baby!"]}]
